<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this suit, the plaintiffs are claiming that
                    the first defendant made certain false representations to them, thereby inducing
                    them to enter into franchise agreements with a company that was eventually wound
                    up. The plaintiffs claim that the first defendant is personally liable to them
                    for those representations. The first defendant had also at various times served
                    as the managing director of the second defendant, and for this and other reasons
                    the plaintiffs further claim that the second defendant is also liable for the
                    representations made by the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties and Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first plaintiff, Mentormophosis Pty Ltd
                    (“MPL”) is a company incorporated in Australia. The second
                    plaintiff, DNV Image Pte Ltd (“DNV”) is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. The third plaintiff, PT Patria Nusantara Perkasa (“PT
                    PNP”) is a company incorporated in Indonesia. The fourth plaintiff, Ms
                    Dian Patriani (“Dian”) is PT PNP’s director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant is Mr Raymond Phua
                    (“RP”). RP is the managing director of the second defendant, Da
                    Vinci Holdings Pte Ltd (“DVH”). DVH is the holding company of the
                    Da Vinci Group, a well-known and established business group in Singapore and
                    Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiffs had at various times in 2004 and
                    2005 entered into a number of franchise agreements with Tradewind Group Pte Ltd
                    (“Tradewind”) for the sale of ladies’ footwear. RP was at
                    all material times the sole shareholder and a director of Tradewind. Tradewind
                    was wound up on 1 December 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs pleaded that they had entered
                    into the franchise agreements as a result of representations made by
                        RP:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

                            sets of representations made by the 1st Defendant. The first set of
                            representations was made before the Plaintiffs agreed to enter into the
                            Franchise Agreements (“the Initial Representations”). The
                            second set of representations was made after the Plaintiffs had agreed
                            to enter into the Franchise Agreements and after the 1st Defendant had
                            produced drafts of the Franchise Agreements to the Plaintiffs
                            (“the Further Representations”). The Initial
                            Representations and the Further Representations are jointly referred to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiffs also relied on s 2 of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defence primarily denied or did not admit
                    that the alleged representations (“the Representations”) were
                    made, and further denied any reliance thereon by the plaintiffs. RP and DVH also
                    alleged that RP was designated as the managing director of DVH in or about 2003
                    when preparations were being made for a public listing of DVH and that it was in
                    or around April 2006 that RP was in fact appointed as DVH’s managing
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendants also denied any collateral
                    contract with the plaintiffs and denied that the Representations were made
                    fraudulently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendants also relied on certain similar
                    provisions which were contained in each franchise agreement to exclude liability
                    for any of the Representations that might have been made. For easy reference, I
                    set out below the provisions from the franchise agreement with DNV:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     RP also asserted that DNV had elected not to
                    pursue the present action against him because (1) DNV had pursued an action
                    against Tradewind in DC Suit No 1768/2006T for damages for breach of
                    contract and/or (2) DNV had filed a proof of debt against Tradewind on
                    25 January 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal bases of the plaintiffs’ claims against RP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I first briefly review the legal bases of the
                    plaintiffs’ claims against RP, and RP’s defences
                thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deceit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiffs’ principal cause of
                    action lies in the tort of deceit or fraud. The elements of the tort were
                    restated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee
                        Cheow Lee</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (“<em>Panatron</em>”) at [14], following <em>Bradford Building Society v Borders</em> [1941]
                    2 All ER 205:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct.
                        Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be
                        acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the
                        plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the
                        false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered
                        damage by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge
                        that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence
                        of any genuine belief that it is true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     With regard to the requirement that the
                    plaintiff must have acted upon the false statement, the Court of Appeal held at
                    [23] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The misrepresentations need not be the sole inducement to [the
                        plaintiffs], so long as they had played a real and substantial part and
                        operated in their minds, no matter how strong or how many were the other
                        matters which played their part in inducing them to act ... If inducements
                        in this sense are proved and the other essential elements of the tort are
                        also made out, as is the case here, then liability will follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The rationale for such an approach is well explained by
                    Cranworth LJ in <em>Reynell v Sprye</em> (1852)
                    42 ER 710 at 728–729, 1 De GM &amp; G 660 at
                    708:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is impossible so to analyze the operations of the human mind as to be
                        able to say how far any particular representation may have led to the
                        formation of any particular resolution, or the adoption of any particular
                        line of conduct. No one can do this with certainty, even as to himself,
                        still less as to another. Where certain statements have been made, all in
                        their nature capable, more or less, of leading the party to whom they are
                        addressed, to adopt a particular line of conduct, it is impossible to say of
                        any one such representation so made that, even if it had not been made, the
                        same resolution would have been taken, or the same conduct followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Cranworth LJ was speaking in the context of a fraud perpetrated by one
                    party to the contract on his counterparty, but <em>Panatron</em>, where a managing director of a company was held liable
                    for making fraudulent misrepresentations to others to induce them to invest in
                    the company, makes clear that the position is the same when a party to a
                    contract has entered into that contract as a result of a fraud by a stranger to
                    the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     
          <em>Panatron</em> also
                    makes clear (at [24]) that it does not lie for the fraudster to say that his
                    victim could have discovered the fraud had he been more careful:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All that is required is reliance in the sense that the victims were
                        induced by the representations. Once this is proved, it is no defence that
                        they acted incautiously and failed to take those steps to verify the truth
                        of the representations which a prudent man would have taken: <em>The Directors, etc, of the Central Railway Company of Venezuela
                            v Joseph Kisch</em> (1867) LR 2 HL 99.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Or, as Brennan J pithily put it in <em>Gould v
                        Vaggelas</em> (1985) 157 CLR 215 at 252. “A knave
                    does not escape liability because he is dealing with a
                fool.”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     With regard to the standard of proof required,
                    the Court of Appeal held in <em>Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as
                        Niklex Supply Co v Lek Benedict</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 at
                    [14] that, when fraud is alleged in a civil action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the civil standard of proving on a balance of probabilities must apply
                        because there is no known "third standard" although such cases are usually
                        known as "fraud in a civil case" as if alluding to a third standard of
                        proof. However, because of the severity and potentially serious implications
                        attaching to a fraud, even in a civil trial, judges are not normally
                        satisfied by that little bit more evidence such as to tilt the "balance".
                        They normally require more. That <em>more</em> is
                        commonly described as "a burden that is higher than on a balance of
                        probabilities, but lower than proof beyond reasonable doubt"...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misrepresentation and piercing the corporate veil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiffs also relied on s 2(1) of
                    the Misrepresentation Act, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Damages for misrepresentation</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>2</b>. —(1) Where a person has entered
                        into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another
                        party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the
                        person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect
                        thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall
                        be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made
                        fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and
                        did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented
                        were true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As can be seen, s 2(1) only applies
                    between parties to a contract. RP is not a party to the franchise agreements
                    between the plaintiffs and Tradewind but the plaintiffs argued that the
                    corporate veil of Tradewind should be pierced so as to render RP liable for the
                    Representations even if the Representations were not made fraudulently. It is
                    not necessary for me to deal with this argument because I conclude, as
                    elaborated below, that RP had made some fraudulent misrepresentations to induce
                    the plaintiffs to enter into the franchise agreements and they did rely on the
                    same. It was not argued that RP could avoid personal liability if I were to find
                    that he had acted fraudulently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Entire agreement clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendants had sought to rely on the
                    entire agreement clauses in the franchise agreements between the plaintiffs and
                    Tradewind. The Court of Appeal has observed that “whether or not an
                    entire agreement clause can purport to exclude a claim in misrepresentation
                    remains a matter of some controversy”: <em>Lee Chee Wei v
                        Tan Hor Peow Victor</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 at [28]. For
                    present purposes it is sufficient for me to confine myself to the following two
                    propositions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     First, since neither RP nor DVH is a party to
                    the franchise agreements between the plaintiffs and Tradewind, they cannot rely
                    on the terms of those agreements. Second, and in any event, a person cannot
                    contractually exclude liability for his own fraud: <em>S Pearson
                        &amp; Son Ltd v Dublin Corporation</em> [1907] AC 351 at 353
                        <em>per</em> Lord Loreburn LC, at 356 <em>per</em> the Earl of Halsbury, and at 362 <em>per</em> Lord James of Hereford.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As mentioned, RP also pleaded that DNV had
                    elected to sue Tradewind. This was not addressed in any detail in his closing
                    submissions, and I do not think that there is a doctrine which precludes DNV
                    from suing RP and DVH just because they proceeded against Tradewind first or
                    filed a proof of debt against Tradewind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Given my analysis above, the plaintiffs’
                    claims against RP would stand or fall depending solely on whether deceit is made
                    out. By contrast, a successful claim against RP is a necessary but insufficient
                    element of the plaintiffs’ claim against DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual issues: overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I turn now to the evidence. As the parties led
                    a considerable amount of evidence, it is helpful to set out the ambit of the
                    factual inquiry before going into details.</p>

                    his evidence. After RP completed his evidence, his counsel informed me that
                    Danny Phoa could not be contacted. At the same time, counsel for DVH made a
                    submission of no case to answer, and withdrew Tony and Veron Lim as its
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary points</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I would also make a few preliminary points
                    about the factual issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As regards the first allegation of fraudulent
                    misrepresentation, <em>ie</em>, that RP had made the
                    Representations knowing that Tradewind would not be able to carry out its
                    obligations under the franchise agreements, I would say at the outset that I do
                    not believe that RP was running his shoe business, including the franchise
                    arrangements made through Tradewind, as a sham for the purpose of making off
                    with the plaintiffs’ and other franchisees’ monies. It is clear from
                    the documentary evidence relating to RP’s dealings with his staff and his
                    franchisees that RP was genuinely trying to run his shoe business as a
                    legitimate business. It is also clear that RP had very great – though
                    ultimately unfulfilled – ambitions for his shoe business. The fact that
                    the plaintiffs have grievances with the way things turned out does not detract
                    from these points. Consequently, it will not be necessary for me to deal with
                    the numerous difficulties alleged by the plaintiffs in the running of their
                    franchises, save to provide context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I should also observe that all the pleaded
                    representations are oral and were alleged to have been made between 2003 and
                    2005, <em>ie</em>, more than five years ago. Some were said
                    to be made when no other witnesses were around. That said, the gist of the
                    plaintiffs’ allegations, as evinced by their pleadings, is clear. Their
                    central and consistent claim is that RP at various times and in various ways
                    represented to them that his shoe business was backed by the Da Vinci group to
                    induce them to enter into the franchise agreements with Tradewind, and in
                    reliance on such representations and the undisputed strength of the Da Vinci
                    group they entered into franchise agreements with Tradewind. This central claim,
                    which is essentially the second fraudulent misrepresentation alleged by the
                    plaintiffs (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), is not affected
                    by what I said in the preceding two paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In this regard, it is not in dispute that the
                    Da Vinci group was at no time prepared to support and did not in fact support
                    Tradewind and its business in any substantial way, and that RP knew this at all
                    times. I should say here that Tony did allow RP to use some Da Vinci manpower,
                    warehouse facilities, and office space. However, this was said to be on a
                    personal basis and in any case was very far from the support that the plaintiffs
                    said they were led to expect, in terms of the design, production and quality
                    control of the shoes; the logistical support to the overseas franchisees; the
                    knowledge of the respective markets; and generally the overall running of each
                    franchise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Separately, it is also not in dispute that
                    Dian, Evelyn, Neo, and Wendy represent PT PNP, DNV and MPL respectively. Thus,
                    if Dian is defrauded, so too is PT PNP and so on. I note that DNV and MPL were
                    incorporated very late in the day, <em>ie</em>, close to
                    the time when the relevant contracts were signed. (The incorporation date of PT
                    PNP is not in evidence.) This means that at least some of the representations
                    which RP was said to have made would have been made before DNV and MPL even came
                    into existence. However, it was not disputed that the representations made to
                    the relevant natural persons would operate also on the relevant
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The factual inquiry is therefore confined to
                    whether RP fradulently represented that his shoe business had the backing of the
                    Da Vinci group in order to induce the plaintiffs to enter into the franchise
                    agreements with Tradewind, and whether the plaintiffs relied on such
                    representations in entering into the various franchise agreements with
                    Tradewind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     With regard to assessing the evidence, it
                    should be reiterated that all the representations pleaded by the plaintiffs are
                    said to have been made orally (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>
                    above). The factual inquiry therefore turns to a large degree on the credibility
                    of each side’s witnesses. In this regard, it should be mentioned that the
                    witnesses called include persons, such as Peck Lin, who have no direct interest
                    in the present dispute. Generally speaking, the evidence of these disinterested
                    third parties about RP’s dealings with them will, if accepted, have
                    significant value in corroborating or refuting the evidence of the interested
                    parties. While some of the evidence do not relate directly to dealings between
                    the parties, they are still relevant if by themselves or in connection with
                    other facts they make the versions of events advanced by each side highly
                    probable or improbable: s 11(b), Evidence Act (Cap 97,
                    1997 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It should also be pointed out that a
                    considerable amount of the evidence led related to events happening <em>after</em> the respective contracts with Tradewind had been
                    made. Such evidence, by itself, cannot <em>directly</em>
                    prove whether RP had made the alleged representations and whether the plaintiffs
                    relied on them. However, depending of course on the particular circumstances,
                    such evidence may be <em>indirect</em> proof of what
                    happened before the respective contracts with Tradewind were made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background of RP and his shoe business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I begin with an overview of RP, his
                    relationship with the Da Vinci group, and his shoe business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Generally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As at August 2009, RP was 39 years old and
                    married with two children. He is the son of Tony and Doris Phua. He graduated
                    with a degree in marketing management from Toledo University, Ohio, in 1991.
                    After graduation, he worked for various companies before he joined his
                    father’s business in 1995 and worked for him in Da Vinci Collection Pte
                    Ltd (“Da Vinci Collection”), which carried on business as
                    importers, exporters, distributors and dealers in market furniture, fitting,
                    lightings and furnishing accessories with one retail store in Bukit Timah. When
                    RP joined Da Vinci Collection in 1995, he had no official title and was assigned
                    to perform various duties, including warehousing and sales. RP married in 1996
                    and his wife joined him in Da Vinci Collection and assisted him in his duties.
                    On 1 February 1998, RP and his wife were respectively appointed Marketing
                    Director and Sales Director of Da Vinci Collection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     RP said in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”) and at the beginning of his cross-examination that he and
                    his wife left the Da Vinci group in March 2003 after a dispute with his father,
                    Tony. According to RP, he had been orally appointed the managing director of DVH
                    by that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> RP said that, after
                    March 2003, he did not hold any executive roles in the Da Vinci group until he
                    rejoined the company in April 2006, but qualified that by saying that “if
                    there was any help that [he] thought would be useful for [his father] or -- [he]
                    would still help [his father] out.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He also said that, after leaving the
                    group, he and his wife ceased to draw a salary from the Da Vinci
                        group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     After (allegedly) leaving the Da Vinci group,
                    RP dabbled for a while in the business of importing and exporting furniture,
                    using Tradewind as a vehicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He then met one Brandon Toh
                    (“Brandon”), who was selling shoes under the brand name
                        “MAC”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> RP was taken with Brandon’s concept of
                    using the shoe boxes as part of the store design, instead of putting them in a
                    storeroom. He bought into Brandon’s company, MAC Lifestyle Pte Ltd (which
                    was incorporated on 14 February 2003<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>), and
                    eventually took it over in the middle of 2003 after a dispute with Brandon.
                    Sometime in late 2003 or early 2004, RP received a letter from Wong &amp; Leow,
                    the solicitors of L’Oreal Paris, stating that the use of the
                    “MAC” logo infringed the intellectual property rights of
                    L’Oreal Paris. RP said he was shocked when he received the letter, because
                    Brandon had assured him that the necessary checks were done. It turned out that
                    Brandon had only registered the name with the Registry of Companies. RP said
                    that he then discussed the matter with his father’s business partner in
                    Guangzhou, China, one Raymond Wong (“Raymond”). Raymond suggested
                    that RP use the name “Walking Culture” instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     RP said that he then decided, as a stop-gap
                    measure, to use the name “Da Vinci Walking Culture” for his
                    company and his brand. He said he chose the name as “the safest name at
                    that point in time.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> He said he intended to speak to his
                    father, Tony, later to explain the situation to him and it was only an interim
                    measure until he settled on a new trade name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Consequently, RP changed the
                    name of MAC Lifestyle Pte Ltd to Da Vinci Walking Culture Pte Ltd. He also used
                    the Da Vinci name on his shoes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     According to RP, Tony then discovered that RP
                    had used the Da Vinci name for his shoe business. Tony objected as he did not
                    want the public to confuse RP’s business with the Da Vinci group’s
                    businesses. Consequently, Da Vinci Walking Culture Pte Ltd was renamed Walking
                    Culture International Pte Ltd (“WCIPL”) on 6 August 2004. The
                    shoes were also rebranded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     RP’s shoe business also involved
                    Tradewind. Tradewind was registered on 9 April 2003 as Tradewind Venture
                    Pte Ltd and took its current name, Tradewind Group Pte Ltd, on 15 April
                        2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Tradewind
                    originally owned some of the trade marks relating to RP’s shoe business;
                    these were eventually transferred to WCIPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Tradewind was the entity
                    which entered into the franchise agreements with the plaintiffs, and RP
                    confirmed that WCIPL allowed Tradewind to use its trade marks for
                    Tradewind’s franchising purposes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> WCIPL was the entity which
                    operated the Harbourfront and Bugis outlets which were run by RP himself (as
                    opposed to the franchisees).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> RP disagreed with
                    Mr Tan’s suggestion that Tradewind was set up “as a fall guy,
                    a company that could fail without jeopardising [the] Walking Culture trade
                        marks”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     RP was interested in expanding his business
                    through franchising. To this end, RP engaged FT Consulting to advise him on
                    franchising, and through franchising his shoe business expanded
                rapidly..</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Eventually, however RP’s shoe business
                    failed. Tradewind was wound up on 1 December 2006, less than four years
                    after it was registered. WCIPL closed its outlets at Bugis and Harbourfront, and
                    the company itself was sold to one Steve Chiu, for what RP described as a
                    nominal fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The timing of the sale to Steve Chiu is
                    unclear. In cross-examination, RP was asked why Tradewind failed. He replied,
                    “... I believe I expanded too quickly. I believe it was because I
                    expanded too quickly without stabilising areas that needed to be stabilised
                        first.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> These areas included store management, staff
                    strength, and quality control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RP’s relationship with the Da Vinci group from 2003 to
                2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     This is a convenient point to examine
                    RP’s actual relationship with the group during the lifetime of his shoe
                    business, <em>viz</em> 2003 to 2006. This is a highly
                    relevant fact which would determine whether RP was creating a false or
                    misleading impression in his various acts, such as handing out Da Vinci name
                    cards and signing off as the managing director of DVH. This, in turn, is
                    significant in assessing whether RP had created the false impression that the Da
                    Vinci group and his shoe business were somehow linked. In this regard, I must
                    say that the defendants’ pleadings and RP’s evidence as to his
                    relationship with the Da Vinci group was altogether unsatisfactory, to put it
                    mildly. I propose to refer extensively to the same in the following paragraphs
                    to illustrate how unhelpful they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As mentioned above, RP and DVH alleged in
                    their pleadings that RP was (only) designated as managing director of DVH in
                    2003 when preparations were being made for a public listing of DVH. It was
                    (only) in or around 2006 that RP was in fact appointed as DVH’s managing
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     RP elaborated on this position in his AEIC,
                    which was, significantly, made on behalf of both himself and DVH. In para 1, RP
                    said he was previously working as a manager for DVH’s group of companies.
                    He left their employment on 31 March 2003 and rejoined as their managing
                    director on 1 April 2006. In para 8, he said he was appointed a director to the
                    boards of DVH and its subsidiaries on 1 November 2002, but he did not and
                    was not required to carry out any duty as a director. In paras 22, 24–27
                    and 29, he gave more background. He said he worked for his father in Da Vinci
                    Collection after graduation in 1991. He married in 1996 and his wife joined him
                    in Da Vinci Collection to assist him. On 1 February 1998, he and his wife
                    were appointed as marketing director and sales director respectively of Da Vinci
                    Collection. He and his wife left the company in March after a major argument
                    with his father. In para 113(e), he said that the only time between 2003 and
                    2006 he had identified himself as the managing director of DVH was in an email
                    he sent to Dian on 19 June 2004. He alleged he did so as he was designated as
                    such when DVH was making preparations for a public listing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In his AEIC, RP also exhibited two Form IR8A
                    returns to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The first
                    was filed in 2003 and stated that he ceased his appointment as manager on 31
                    March 2003. The second was filed in 2006 and stated that his appointment as
                    manager director commenced on 1 April 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, in the agreed bundles, there were
                    numerous instances of RP signing off his email and letters with references to
                    the Da Vinci group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In some
                    cases, it was clear that RP was signing off as the managing director of DVH or
                    some company in the Da Vinci group. An example is his email to Dian of
                    19 June 2004 from his email address
                    “rayphua@davinciasia.com”, where he signed off as:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     According to other witnesses, including third
                    parties such as Peck Lin and Tan, there were also various instances when RP
                    linked himself to the Da Vinci group by handing out Da Vinci name cards. RP
                    confirmed giving out Da Vinci name cards to Peck Lin, to Indonesian landlords he
                    met with Dian and to Tan whom he met with Evelyn and Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     At the beginning of his cross-examination, RP
                    said he left the Da Vinci group between March 2003 and April 2006 and did not
                    hold any executive role, subject to the caveat that he helped his father out if
                    he thought such help would be useful.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This was confirmed at
                    one point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     When questioned as to why he signed off as
                    “managing director of Da Vinci Holdings” in an email date 19 June
                    2004 to Dian, RP confirmed that he was in fact the managing director of DVH at
                    that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     There were also some articles at the material
                    time referring to RP as the managing or marketing director of DVH. When I asked
                    him for clarification about an article dated 28 October 2004 in the TODAY
                    newspaper, which said that RP was the managing director of DVH, RP
                        equivocated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

                    that, in 2004, he was appointed the managing director for Da Vinci Jewellery. He
                    said that, between 2003 and 2006, he was not told by his father that he was no
                    longer the managing director for DVH and Da Vinci collection. He said that,
                    between 2004 and 2006, he was not told by his father that he was no longer the
                    managing director of Da Vinci Jewellery. He said that, to the best of his
                    knowledge, his father did not tell anyone that he was removed as managing
                    director of these companies during this period. He said that he did nothing
                    important for the Da Vinci group between 2003 to 2006; he only performed some
                    errands. He said that he basically stopped going for work but retained his
                    appointments. He said, of the impressions he gave about his relationship with
                    the Da Vinci group, “I did not run away from the business. I took time to
                    concentrate on my new business and it was not because I wanted to not be
                    associated with it. It’s definitely not the case. Like I said, I’ve
                    been with Da Vinci since I was 25 years old.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> In response to my
                    request for clarification just before I released him, he said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I stopped working. I did not perform my usual roles that I would have
                        performed whilst I was in the company. Your Honour, that we –
                        it’s a Chinese style of business. It – I’m appointed in a
                        very ad hoc manner. I was – I was – I mean, a lot of these
                        appointments are appointed, you know – not in a group of people, as my
                        dad was just saying, you know, “make you the MD”, We
                        don’t have a huge board meeting like I think most companies may
                        have.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a bit different from how I run my own business or how I would run my
                        own business, but this is how my dad had run his own business. I’m a
                        second generation from a patriarch and I just cannot explain how he sees it.
                        But I know that when I did not go in, the position has always been there for
                        me, nothing was removed from my office. I was free to go in and out as I had
                        pleased. I was pleased. He still asked me to do things for him. Initially,
                        not a lot, but subsequently more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I never questioned him, so am I still in the company? No I mean it
                        was something that was – that I left was not necessary to ask him. I
                        mean my dad would not – would never – how you say –
                        terminate me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Effectively, RP had taken three positions as
                    regards his relationship with the Da Vinci group between 2003 to 2006. First, he
                    said he was only the marketing director of Da Vinci Collection up to March 2003.
                    He was not the managing director of DVH but only the managing director
                    designate. He had told the plaintiffs that he had left the Da Vinci group in
                    2003. Second, RP said he considered himself a managing director of DVH at the
                    material time. There were also the references to this position in newspaper
                    articles, and references to the Da Vinci group in his email and correspondence
                    signatures. Finally, RP took a position in between, <em>ie</em>, that he retained his appointments but only did minimal
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     RP should have been well aware of his position
                    in the Da Vinci group. Certainly, his vacillating evidence, on a material point
                    on which he should well be able to respond simply and directly, seriously dented
                    his credibility as a witness. It is noteworthy that counsel for RP did not refer
                    to RP’s evidence on this point in any detail in submission, and instead
                    preferred to focus on attacking the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In fact, it seems that there is no benign way
                    to view RP’s evidence. If he really continued to hold executive roles in
                    the Da Vinci group between 2003 and 2006, then his allegations that he had
                    informed various persons that he had left the group would be entirely
                    incongruous. If he had made a clean break, then his various acts linking himself
                    to the group would create a false impression. If he continued to hold
                    appointments but only (as he put it) ran some errands, other problems arise. It
                    would still be incongruous for him to say that he left the group, especially
                    given his own evidence in re-examination that he did not see it that way (see
                        <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above). His various acts linking
                    himself to the Da Vinci group would still be misleading, since they would convey
                    the impression that he was still with the group but not the fact that he was far
                    from being involved in any significant way. In this regard, it is unbelievable
                    that RP ever conveyed to anyone his (allegedly) nuanced position in the group,
                    which he was able to articulate only after six days of cross-examination. At the
                    very least, RP’s evidence strongly suggests that he was not as scrupulous
                    in distancing himself and his shoe business from the Da Vinci group as he
                    claimed to be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Further, the way RP sought to justify his
                    various acts which suggested an ongoing relationship between him and Da Vinci
                    from 2003 to 2006 is highly significant. As said, these acts included the
                    handing out of Da Vinci name cards and email signatures as the managing director
                    of DVH. If, hypothetically, RP had admitted that those acts were honest or
                    careless mistakes (either by him or third parties, <em>eg</em>, reporters), the significance of those acts might well have
                    been arguable (though even then the sheer number of incidents would require
                    quite some explanation). The fact that RP chose to justify those acts by an
                    explanation which he could not defend consistently, <em>ie</em>, that he was in fact the managing director of DVH –
                    strongly suggests that he knew that there was something wrong with those acts if
                    indeed he was not the managing director of DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     With that, I turn now to view RP’s
                    dealings with various persons in this suit, as seen from their
                    perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">RP’s dealings with Wong Peck Lin and FT Consulting (May 2004 to
                September 2005)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Peck Lin graduated with a Bachelor of Laws
                    (Honours) from the National University of Singapore in 1994 and is an advocate
                    and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore. She was employed by FT
                    Consulting, RP’s franchising consultant, between 1999 and 2008, first as a
                    junior consultant and eventually became a director. As mentioned, she was
                    subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In her statement, Peck Lin said that she and a
                    colleague, John Ong, first met RP on or about 25 May 2004 in the Da Vinci
                    building at 3 Tai Seng Drive. This was more than a year after RP said he left
                    the group in March 2003 (according to his AEIC). Peck Lin said that she and John
                    Ong knew of DVH as being a retailer of luxury furniture, and were given to
                    understand that Da Vinci wanted to engage consultants to advise on franchising.
                    At that meeting, RP talked about his background and experience at Da Vinci, the
                    Da Vinci businesses and its expansion plans, and about the Walking Culture
                    concept and business. Peck Lin and John Ong, for their part, gave a presentation
                    on FT Consulting’s franchise development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     For his part, RP said that he had told FT
                    Consulting about his past experience with the Da Vinci group and that he had
                    left the group. However, in cross-examination, he vacillated several times as to
                    whether he had said the latter at the first meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>
                    His version was also not put to Peck Lin. I should also point out that any
                    allegation by RP that he had left the group would be at odds with his final
                    position that he retained his appointments (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above). In any event, RP accepted that he had handed FT
                    Consulting a name card with the Da Vinci name on it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Peck Lin said that after the meeting, Raymond
                    gave her and John Ong a tour of the Da Vinci building. During the tour, Peck Lin
                    and John Ong saw a roomful of designers. RP said that Da Vinci’s in-house
                    designers would be designing new shoe designs for Walking Culture. This left a
                    distinct impression on Peck Lin’s mind, as she remembered thinking
                    “how versatile these designers are, that they can design jewellery,
                    watches and even shoes! All of which are quite different
                        products”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Counsel for RP suggested to Peck Lin that RP
                    did not take her on a tour of the Da Vinci building, and that Da Vinci’s
                    designers were all for furniture and were in any case based in
                        Indonesia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Peck Lin disagreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Peck Lin said that, based on the information
                    gathered at the 25 May 2004 meeting, she and John Ong prepared a franchise
                    consultancy proposal, which was forwarded to RP with a cover letter dated
                    26 May 2004. The cover letter was addressed to “Mr Raymond
                    Phua, Da Vinci Holdings Pte Ltd” and began with the
                        statement:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks for inviting us over to your office yesterday and for explaining at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Peck Lin did not produce for the trial the
                    proposal said to have been sent on 26 May 2004. However, a version dated
                    1 June 2004 was produced. This was sent as an enclosure to

                    government grant funding for the franchise project. The 1 June 2004
                    proposal was entitled “Walking Culture (by Da Vinci)”. Its
                    preamble read in full as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    
              <b>Preamble</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Da Vinci Holdings is synonymous with the retail of high-end European
                        classical furniture. Since 1994, when the first stores were opened in
                        Singapore and Indonesia, the company has done extremely well in marketing
                        its luxurious brand-name furniture. Today, Da Vinci boasts of 19 (as of
                        1st September 2002) mega stores, spread in Singapore, Malaysia,
                        Indonesia, Brunei and China, with an estimated retail space of more than
                        360,000 square feet and 600 staff strength. Most of these premises are fully
                        owned by the company as real estate. The company is particularly strong in
                        China with 7 mega stores in prime cities – Shanghai, Beijing,
                        Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Da Vinci is known as the top home concept retailer
                        in China.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Over the years, the company has built up formidable strengths and
                        capabilities in these areas:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                
              <b>Design</b> – The company has 50 designers in its in
                            house team who are constantly creating new products for the
                            stores;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                
              <b>Branding</b> – The company is a master at branding its
                            stores and products to differentiate itself from its competitors. This
                            in turn yields the company much higher profit margins than the industry
                            norm;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                
              <b>Retail
                                Network</b> – The company has a far reaching retail and
                            distribution network already in place in the various countries: prime
                            store space, landlords, manufacturers, warehouses, logistics network,
                            etc.;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                
              <b>Asset
                                Base</b> – The company has a very strong asset base of
                            buildings and warehouses in various countries which it can leverage on
                            for other retail businesses;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
              •
                
              <b>Retail
                                goodwill</b> – The Da Vinci name is regarded by many in
                            the industry as a retail success story.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With the above, the company has therefore recently diversified into the
                        shoe retail business with a pilot store known as <b>“Walking Culture”</b> in Bugis Village. In its 9
                        months of operations, the store has experienced good sales and healthy
                        profits. The shoes are value-for-money, with an upper-middle-class image an
                        designs but with very affordable price tags, which surprise and delight
                        customers. It is oneof the unique selling propositions for the store.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Going forward, the company has aggressive plans to open more stores in
                        Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and therafter further afield in
                        Dubai, Canada, USA, South Africa and France. To date, the company has
                        already received 3 franchise inquires for 3 different territories.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The company sees franchising as a key strategy in its expansion plan and
                        to this end, intends to engage a consultant to assist in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I pause here to observe that a plain reading of the preamble gives the
                    impression that DVH itself was branching out into the shoe retail business. At
                    the end of the proposal, RP declared that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the facts stated in this application and the accompanying information are
                        true and correct to the best of my knowledge and that I have not
                        withheld/distorted any material facts. I understand that if I obtain the
                        grant by false or misleading statements, I may be prosecuted under the Penal
                        Code...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Spring Singapore approved the Spring Singapore application on
                    17 June 2004 and funded 50% of the project cost. The claim for the grant
                    was successfully made around September 2004 with no amendments to the proposal
                    which was submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     According to RP, he did realise that the
                    preamble to the proposal was incorrect in that DVH was not connected with his
                    shoe business. He told Peck Lin about the mistake but she said that that was the
                    way to pitch the proposal to obtain the grant. He went along with her advice.
                    Peck Lin however denied that he had told her about the alleged mistake. To
                    support his allegation that he was not trying to connect Walking Culture with
                    the Da Vinci group, RP said that he had given an interview for a Spring
                    Singapore magazine called Productivity Digest. The issue of 20 November
                        2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>
                    carried an article on the interview and made no suggestion that Walking Culture
                    was connected with the Da Vinci group. There was also an article in the April
                    2005 edition of a publication called Men’s Folio.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> This article
                    mentioned that Walking Culture was a completely separate business entity from
                    the Da Vinci group but also referred to his position as managing director of
                    DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Peck Lin also exhibited email in May 2004
                    between RP and Chambi, a potential franchisee in South Africa. The email showed
                    that Chambi thought that he was dealing with the Da Vinci group. For his part,
                    RP said that in May 2004, his franchise concept was not fully formed yet and
                    Chambi might have gotten the impression of a connection with the Da Vinci group
                    because he saw the Bugis outlet with the name Da Vinci Walking Culture at the
                    time, <em>ie</em>, around May 2004. He said that he
                    did tell Chambi that he had left the Da Vinci group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Peck Lin also said that, sometime in September
                    2004, she helped RP to prepare a Walking Culture PowerPoint presentation for the
                    Global Franchise Exhibition (“GFE”) held in Singapore. The
                    presentation she prepared focused only on Walking Culture. However, sometime
                    later after the exhibition (she did not know when), RP added more slides to and
                    generally amended the franchise marketing presentation. After RP’s
                    amendments, the presentation began with a slide entitled “The
                    Group”, followed by some slides entitled “The Companies”
                    and showing pictures of Da Vinci branches worldwide. The first of these slides
                    carried the following description:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Da Vinci Group holds its position as one of Asia’s top group of
                        companies. Its core business is in the retail business of furniture. Since
                        2003, it has expanded to other lifestyle retail businesses of table-top
                        arts, timepieces and jewellery. It also has a property arm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The slides relating to Walking Culture followed the slides relating to
                    the Da Vinci group. All the slides, including those referring to the Da Vinci
                    group, bore the Walking Culture logo, name, and a motto “it’s all
                    about u” at the bottom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     According to RP, his addition to Peck
                    Lin’s slides was to show his past experience with the Da Vinci group.
                    Also, he would orally tell his audience that Walking Culture was separate from
                    the Da Vinci group before he used the slides. If the slides were to be used by
                    others, he would first tell them that the reference to the Da Vinci group
                    therein was only to explain his past experience with the group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> He denied
                    associating Walking Culture with the Da Vinci group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Peck Lin also testified that, in the course of
                    her dealings with RP on various occasions, she heard him say to potential
                    franchisees that Walking Culture could use or leverage on Da Vinci’s
                    design capabilities, business network and infrastructure (logistics, delivery,
                    warehousing, quality control, price tagging, packing, all of which were very
                    labour-intensive). The fact that Walking Culture had access to this big business
                    network/infrastructure was a key selling point of the Walking Culture franchise.
                    This, coupled with the fact that RP himself was the son of Tony Phua, gave the
                    impression that there was a close connection between Walking Culture and Da
                    Vinci. RP also frequently mentioned his personal vast experience in retail and
                    marketing during his years working in Da Vinci. Peck Lin also gave some evidence
                    about RP’s dealings with Neo and Evelyn, which I will refer to in further
                    detail later on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Peck Lin said in her statement that she felt
                    at one point that RP was growing Walking Culture too fast by signing too many
                    franchisees at one time. She referred to an email from herself to RP dated
                    11 October 2004, in response to a request by RP to follow up on one Louis
                    Chambi, a potential franchisee from South Africa. In that email, Peck Lin
                        wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Raymond,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Much as it is in FT’s interest to collect more franchise fees from
                        more franchisees as soon as possible, I must in good conscience advise
                        taking this in a more paced manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For now, I would say the priority for you is to help the Sing franchisees
                        get up and running smoothly (5 stores is no mean feat in the next few
                        months) and also to solve the Jakarta case. I am concerned that your
                        back-end cannot keep up with the franchises you are selling. The most
                        important paramount thing is to make sure that the franchisees already sold
                        get off to a good start.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I don’t want you to get indigestion from swallowing up too many
                        franchises at once. The best is to have “batch development”,
                        where you acquire a group of franchisees, consolidate and settle them and
                        then move on to acquire the next group of franchisees. Unless you have a
                        huge back-up team who can take over the franchisees and do all the necessary
                        once you recruit them – then that’s different. But you
                        don’t have that now, and I feel you should pace it out a bit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I know how passionate and focussed you are on growing the franchise, but
                        at the same time it should be balanced with the long-term health of the
                        brand, which can only be achieved through adequate investment in supporting
                        and ensuring that existing franchisees are given all the help they can
                        possibly need.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">OK, this is rambly but I think you know what my advice is. That being the
                        case, I think we should send friendly emails to Louis to encourage him to
                        continue his ground research and to re-assure him that we are interested
                        (and keep in touch through the next few months), but his timing of early
                        next year is actually quite nicely timed to come in when the Sing
                        franchisees are more settled. I wouldn’t change the standing offer at
                        this point of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Peck Lin</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To this, RP simply replied, on 13 October 2004:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Peck Lin,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please send an email to Mr Chambi to keep his interest going.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Peck Lin was not cross-examined on such email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I pause here to evaluate Peck Lin’s
                    evidence against RP’s. Judging from RP’s curt reply to Peck
                    Lin’s counsel of caution in her email of 11 October 2004, RP was not
                    a person who would let Peck Lin dictate or even influence his commercial
                    strategy, even after knowing Peck Lin for some five months at that point. This
                    seems corroborated by RP’s reflection during re-examination that, on
                    hindsight, he expanded too fast (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>
                    above). I therefore find it unbelievable that RP would have permitted Peck Lin
                    to link DVH and Walking Culture so closely in the Spring Singapore application,
                    which was made early on in their relationship, if he firmly did not want to
                    create such a false impression. At the very least, RP must have acquiesced in
                    creating such a false impression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I would go further and say that I disbelieve
                    RP’s explanation that Peck Lin advised him to create such a false
                    impression. On 1 June 2004, the date of the draft proposal quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> above, Peck Lin had known RP for
                    barely a week. Without any concrete evidence, I find it incredulous that Peck
                    Lin would be advising RP to give what was clearly a false impression in a formal
                    application to a government department so soon after meeting him. It bears
                    mention here that the false impression given in the Spring Singapore application
                    could not, by any stretch, be attributed to careless language or suchlike. It
                    seems, therefore, that RP must have told Peck Lin that Walking Culture was
                    closely linked to DVH, and in fact DVH was venturing into the shoe business
                    through Walking Culture. Peck Lin, in turn, quite naturally seized upon this as
                    a selling point in preparing the application to Spring Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I should also observe here that RP’s
                    dealings with Peck Lin leading up to the Spring Singapore application occurred
                    about the same time when Dian signed the franchise agreement on behalf of PT
                    PNP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As for Peck Lin’s PowerPoint slides
                    which were supplemented by RP, I do not accept RP’s evidence that the
                    amendments were made to highlight RP’s experience with the Da Vinci group.
                    The slides referring to the Da Vinci group said nothing about RP. Further, there
                    seems to be no innocent explanation why RP would choose to insert references to
                    the Da Vinci group in a presentation about Walking Culture, if indeed they were
                    unconnected. It is true that the timing of RP’s amendment of Peck
                    Lin’s slides is not clear and it cannot therefore be said to be used on
                    and relied upon by specific persons on specific occasions. Nevertheless,
                    RP’s additions to the presentation, whenever it took place, supported the
                    plaintiffs contention that he was using the Da Vinci group to sell Walking
                    Culture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Seen in light of the above analysis, some
                    weight must also be given to Peck Lin’s evidence that RP had represented
                    to potential franchisees that Walking Culture could leverage on Da Vinci’s
                    capabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RP’s dealings with Dian Patriani and PT PNP (mid-2003
                onwards)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Dian is a director and owner of PT PNP, a
                    cottage-type industry that produces handbags by hand from her house in
                    Jogjakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Dian first met RP in the middle of 2003, when
                    RP visited Dian’s factory. According to Dian, RP introduced himself as the
                    managing director of Da Vinci<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> and handed her two Da Vinci name
                    cards. RP told her that he was the eldest son of the owner of Da Vinci, and that
                    Da Vinci had a new shoe business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> He told her that Da Vinci had
                    outlets all over the world and was very big in Indonesia, and that eight out of
                    ten people in Indonesia would know of Da Vinci. She said he showed her a
                    presentation on his laptop; the presentation was on Da Vinci and showed pictures
                    of bags and shoes. She saw the Da Vinci logo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> She said RP said that he was looking for
                    someone to produce shoes for Da Vinci Walking Culture. She told him she did not
                    make bags or shoes resembling those she had been shown but he encouraged her to
                    learn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     RP said that when he first met Dian at
                    Jogjakarta, it was to buy handbags from her. He said he would not have
                    introduced himself as being from the Da Vinci group as he was hoping to get a
                    discount from her; to say he was from a big group would have jeopardised his
                    chance of getting a lower price from her. He said he gave Dian a Tradewind name
                    card. He did not hand Dian any name card with the Da Vinci name or logo thereon.
                    Although he had left the Da Vinci group, he had retained some of its name cards
                    to hand only to landlords to whom he was introduced if he thought his father
                    might be interested in a property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> He said that he did not
                    bring a laptop to Jogjakarta when he first met Dian.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I should note here that RP’s explanation
                    that he would not have raised the Da Vinci name because he wanted a discount
                    does not cohere very well with some of his later evidence. I shall refer to this
                    at the appropriate point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Visit to Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     A few months after RP visited her factory,
                    Dian came to Singapore. She took the opportunity to contact RP. According to
                    Dian, RP drove her past the Da Vinci showroom in Tanglin. She said he brought
                    her to his outlet at Bugis which was a Da Vinci Walking Culture outlet. He gave
                    her a Da Vinci Jewellery name card which described him as managing director. He
                    told her that Da Vinci was a large successful retail company in Indonesia. She
                    said he broached the subject again of her supplying him with shoes and offered
                    to introduce her to suppliers of materials in China. He said that he had
                    factories in various countries and one in China. He also brought her past the Da
                    Vinci building at No 3, Tai Seng Drive when she was in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     RP said that when Dian first paid a visit to
                    his retail outlet at Bugis, that shop had a MAC signage and not Da Vinci Walking
                    Culture. He denied bringing her pass the Da Vinci showroom at Tanglin or the Da
                    Vinci Building at Tai Seng Drive. He said that it was only in her subsequent
                    visits that his Bugis shop would have the Da Vinci Walking Culture signage; by
                    then, she would not have thought that his shoe business was linked to the Da
                    Vinci group as he had already told her through various conversations about his
                    quarrel with his father and his background and his having left the Da Vinci
                    group to start his own shoe business. However, while he frequently alluded to
                    such conversations, he did not actually go into detail on them. RP further said
                    that Dian knew that he started off with the MAC brand and why he changed it to
                    Da Vinci Walking culture and then to Walking Culture. He said he told her after
                    her first visit to the Bugis outlet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Visit to China</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In 2004, Dian went to China with RP. He took
                    her to a Da Vinci building in Guangzhou. She was introduced to one Amy whose
                    name card had the Da Vinci name and logo. She also obtained name cards of
                    Chinese suppliers. RP also made a presentation to her about Da Vinci and gave
                    her a brochure on jewellery which was yet to be launched. After the visit, Dian
                    informed RP that it would be too expensive for her to obtain materials from
                    China. RP then suggested that she could be his local partner of shoes in
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On the way back from China to Singapore, Dian
                    said that she asked RP why he was not opening a Da Vinci Walking Culture store
                    in Indonesia himself. She said that RP replied that the shoes should not be
                    marketed together with other Da Vinci products. She said that he represented the
                    importance of linking the Da Vinci brand name with the business he wanted her to
                    do. She said she told him that she had not lived in Jakarta before and had no
                    experience in retail business but he said that there was no need for such
                    experience and he knew the Indonesian market well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     RP said that he brought Dian to China to see
                    how products were made and the quality as he was considering the possibility of
                    a franchise or whether she could make the products for his Da Vinci Walking
                    Culture brand. He said that they met at the Da Vinci Building in Guangzhou as
                    that building was near the hotel where she stayed and they had to pick Amy up.
                    He agreed that she was introduced to Amy but said Amy was only helping to
                    co-ordinate his trips and some purchase requirements. He disputed that he gave
                    Dian a Da Vinci Jewellery brochure. He could not recall giving her a Da Vinci
                    Jewellery name card.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Dian said that, after the trip to China, RP
                    contacted her and said that he wanted to have a franchise venture with her. The
                    next time when Dian was in Singapore, RP passed her a franchise analysis and
                    introduced her to one June Lim, a property agent from DTZ. June could help Dian
                    find a good location in Jakarta for a proposed shoe outlet. She said that, when
                    she expressed her lack of retail experience again, RP told her not to worry and
                    reminded her of Da Vinci’s presence in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Letter of Intent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Dian said that, after she returned to
                    Indonesia, RP called her to say that there were many interested parties in the
                    Indonesian franchise. She said that he encouraged her to take up the franchise
                    and said that as she was his friend, he would keep the franchise for
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     RP then sent a letter of intent to Dian around
                    29 May 2004. After she received it, she placed a deposit of $5,000 with him
                    on 1 June 2004 to proceed with the franchise arrangement. She noticed the
                    name of “Tradewind” in the letter of intent and asked RP about it
                    as she had only heard of Walking Culture and Da Vinci up till then. RP told her
                    not to worry and said that Tradewind was just a company for the
                    franchise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jakarta visit; signing of franchise agreement; visiting
                landlords</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Around 10 June 2004, RP came to Jakarta.
                    Dian paid a second deposit of $10,000 for the franchise on 11 June 2004. RP
                    took her on a tour of the Da Vinci building in Jakarta. RP also spoke to his
                    property agent in DTZ Indonesia, one Vivi Ganto and asked Ganto to help look for
                    a suitable location for the retail outlet. Whenever RP and Dian met landlords,
                    RP would introduce himself as the managing director of DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Dian was scheduled to meet with a landlord of
                    a mall called Pondak Indah Mall 2 (“PIM2”) on 13 June 2004.
                    The day before, she met RP and Peck Lin at a hotel (at night around 11pm). RP
                    told her that she was to sign a franchise agreement. She said she was surprised
                    as she was not told she was to sign it that night although she received a draft
                    thereof a few days earlier. She said she was tired. She asked RP why the
                    franchise agreement was with Tradewind. RP told her that she was really dealing
                    with him and Da Vinci. There was nothing to worry about as Da Vinci was a big
                    company. She said that RP said that if she did not sign the franchise agreement,
                    he could not take her to PIM2. He needed to be sure that she was serious about
                    the intended arrangement. She then signed the agreement which named PT PNP as
                    the area franchisee. She paid RP a further $29,100. She said she also asked why
                    the brand was changed from Da Vinci Walking Culture to Walking Culture. He said
                    that it was to target a younger crowd and also because the Da Vinci name might
                    give the impression that the shoes were costly<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. He also told her not to worry as
                    people would know that Walking Culture was under Da Vinci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     On 13 June 2004, RP and Dian went to PIM2
                    which was still under construction. Dian said RP told her that PIM2 was going to
                    be a high class mall and that without the backing of Da Vinci, he would have
                    been unsuccessful in procuring a shop unit there. She said that at the meeting
                    with a representative of the landlord of PIM2, RP gave a name card which had the
                    name Da Vinci. The meeting dealt with matters concerning Da Vinci Walking
                    Culture and Da Vinci Jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The PIM2 mall would only be opened in mid
                    2005. Pursuant to the franchise agreement, the first retail outlet was to be
                    opened by November 2004. Dian said she suggested that this deadline be pushed
                    back but RP did not agree. RP suggested that she open another shop. She said she
                    was reluctant to open two shops but RP assured her of Da Vinci’s success
                    in Indonesia and that the PIM2 outlet would be subsidised by the first outlet.
                    She agreed. With DTZ’s help, they found a unit at Artha Garding Mall
                    (“AGM”), a middle class mall. She entered into a rental agreement
                    with AGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     RP said that, when meeting the representative
                    of the PIM2 landlord, he gave a Da Vinci business card to the representative. It
                    was for Da Vinci Jewellery. There was already an agreement for a Da Vinci
                    Jewellery store at PIM2. He said he had not yet met the representative he met
                    with Dian and that was why he handed his name card to him. In his mind, he was
                    still helping his father out and he saw nothing wrong with handing over a Da
                    Vinci card. It stated his position as managing director of Da Vinci Jewellery.
                    He denied he had made a presentation for Da Vinci Jewellery as the landlords of
                    PIM1 and PIM2 already knew about Da Vinci Jewellery. He agreed that the opening
                    of PIM2 would be too late for the franchise business. Eventually, a housing
                    agent from DTZ recommended a unit at AGM. RP said that he had preferred another
                    location at a more popular mall, <em>ie</em>, Taman Anggrek
                    but Dian could not be found when that unit was available. As for the AGM unit,
                    he said he had reservations about it but he had no choice but to approve it as
                    Dian was already renovating the unit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     RP said that Dian agreed to be a franchisee of
                    the shoe business not because of the Da Vinci name but because he had a nice
                    concept which used the shoe boxes as part of the store design.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Operation of the outlets; signing of master franchise
                agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Dian and three of her staff went to Singapore
                    for a training session held at the Bugis outlet. She said they would however
                    meet first at an office or warehouse at the Da Vinci building at Tai Seng. She
                    said that, at the training session, RP would again speak about the success of Da
                    Vinci. Dian also paid $100,000 for the purchase of shoe stock. RP said he did
                    not start the training session by meeting them at Da Vinci
                building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    After some initial reluctance on the part of
                    RP, Dian was allowed to inspect shoes stored at Da Vinci warehouse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The outlet at AGM was opened on
                    23 November 2004. Dian said that she encountered problems right from the
                    first shipment of shoes. Some of the problems were as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">some shoes were not in Walking Culture
                            boxes;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">some sandals had a different brand name called
                            “Shijiexing”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">some shoes were of poor quality. The material was
                            peeling, the lace and heels of some were loose, decorations on some had
                            dropped and others had glue over them and some were dirty and scratched;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">some shoes did not match.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">PT PNP was also supposed to use a Point of Sale (“POS”)
                    system but it encountered problems with the system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    RP accepted that in the first shipment of
                    goods to PT PNP, there were shoes containing the label Da Vinci Walking Culture
                    and Walking Culture. He remembered Dian asked him about the change. He said that
                    she already knew about the reason from earlier conversations. He told her it
                    would look better. Walking Culture was the brand to be used for the franchise.
                    He had explained the change from MAC to Da Vinci Walking Culture and then to
                    Walking Culture. He did not confine his response to saying he wanted to target a
                    younger crowd. She knew he was no longer with the Da Vinci group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Dian said RP assured her that the next batch
                    of shoes would be of better quality. He told her that the Singapore outlets were
                    doing well and a Melbourne outlet had also opened. He encouraged her to get a
                    master franchise for Indonesia. She said he told her that, with the master
                    franchise, she would engage sub-franchisees and earn sub-franchise fees. RP also
                    made a PowerPoint presentation. The presentation included references to the Da
                    Vinci group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The name of Da Vinci could be found
                    together with the name and logo of Walking Culture on some slides. The
                    presentation was initially made by RP to Dian on his laptop before a fair in
                    Surabaya. Then on 25 March 2005, at that fair, the presentation was flashed
                    onto a big screen from time to time by Dian and/or her staff for public
                    consumption. After the Surabaya fair, the presentation was repeated in Singapore
                    by RP at his retail outlet at Harbourfront.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I pause here to refer to the presentation.
                    The presentation was substantially similar to the one RP amended from Peck
                    Lin’s original (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above). It
                    began with a slide entitled “The Group”. The second slide
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1">The third slide stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Our Presence in Asia</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Da Vinci Group holds its position as one of Asia’s top group of
                        companies. Its core business is in the retail business of furniture. Since
                        2003, it has expanded to other lifestyle retail businesses of table-top
                        arts, timepieces and jewelry [<em>sic</em>] and
                        fashion. It also has a property arm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The third through sixth slides showed pictures of Da Vinci branches in
                    Singapore, Indonesia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. Thereafter,
                    the slides focussed on Walking Culture. All the slides were marked at the bottom
                    right with Walking Culture’s logo, name and motto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The commercial terms of the master franchise
                    agreement were negotiated by one Budi Untung, a lawyer and notary public, on
                    Dian’s behalf. Eventually she signed the same with Tradewind on or about
                    25 March 2005 but this was backdated to 12 June 2004 (the same date as
                    the franchise agreement with PT PNP).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In the meantime, PT PNP entered into a
                    rental agreement for the PIM2 outlet in June or July 2004. Thereafter, another
                    rental agreement was entered into for an outlet in Jogjakarta and a factory
                    outlet in Solo, Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Unfortunately, Dian and PT PNP continued to
                    encounter difficulties with the shoes supplied and the POS system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Because of these problems, Dian wanted to
                    close one of the shops in Jakarta. Subsequently, she learned that Steve Chui had
                    taken over WCIPL. However, he could not help much. Dian eventually decided to
                    close both outlets in Jakarta and had a clearance sale of shoes at the
                    Jogjakarta outlet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Dian said she found out about RP’s
                    fraud in September 2008, three months after this action was
                commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Correspondence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Dian referred to an email from RP using his
                    Da Vinci email address dated 19 June 2004 to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> In this email, he had signed off as managing
                    director of DVH. Below that were the names of other Da Vinci companies and
                    Walking Culture. Thereafter, there was other subsequent email from RP sometimes
                    using his email address at Walking Culture. He would sign off as managing
                    director or chairman and chief executive officer of WCIPL. However, below that,
                    the name of DVH was also set out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> Formal correspondence
                    would be sent to RP at WCIPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    RP accepted that in his email of
                    19 June 2004, he had signed off as the managing director of DVH. He said
                    this was before the Walking Culture business was completely set up. That was the
                    way he used to sign off in the past. He added the name Walking Culture to a row
                    of companies with the Da Vinci name only to show the companies that he was
                    associated with<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> and not to suggest that Walking Culture was
                    part of the Da Vinci group. Email on issues indicated that it came from him as
                    Chairman and CEO of WCIPL although DVH’s name was also stated
                        therein.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> RP said that was his template but Dian
                    would know the background he had explained to her. He said that just because the
                    names of two companies appeared at the end of the same email did not mean that
                    they were related.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    He also said that by putting the names of
                    three companies (Tradewind Group Pte Ltd, Tradewind Lifestyle Pte Ltd, WCIPL) on
                    a letterhead, it did not necessarily mean they were part of the same
                        group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> He admitted that he told Dian he was the
                    managing director of DVH in one of their conversations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RP’s dealings with Evelyn and Neo of DNV (September 2004
                onwards)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    DNV is a company incorporated in Singapore
                    to operate the Walking Culture franchise for two outlets in Singapore. Its
                    directors and shareholders are Neo and Chung Sze Yiing (“Shavon”)
                    but Neo’s wife, Evelyn was also actively involved in the business. Shavon
                    is Evelyn’s niece.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Evelyn was the principal witness for DNV.
                    Evelyn said that she was a financial services consultant and/or life insurance
                    agent for the past 11 years (by the time of the trial) and in sales for the last
                    20 years or so. She had been taught law subjects like contract and tort as part
                    of her training.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> A search on Evelyn showed that she had also
                    been holding the position of managing director or director or manager in various
                    companies and was a shareholder in various companies. This was contrary to her
                    earlier evidence (on 16 September 2009) that she was not a director or
                    shareholder of any company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Neo has his own businesses (through various
                    companies) in electronics for over 20 years (by the time of the
                trial).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">GFE</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Evelyn said that on or about
                    17 September 2004, she visited the GFE at Suntec Convention Centre with
                    Shavon. They came across the Walking Culture booth and obtained a publicity
                    folder which contained among other things a brochure about Walking Culture
                    franchising opportunities. The brochure itself did not make any reference to the
                    Da Vinci group. (It did, however, refer to the Walking Culture website, the 2007
                    version of which made extensive references to the Da Vinci group: see <a href="#p1_187">[187]</a> below.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">30 September 2004 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Evelyn was interested to find out more and
                    eventually a meeting was arranged for 30 September 2004. On that day, Neo
                    and Evelyn went to the office of FT Consulting at The Globe, 100 Cecil Street,
                    #12-01. Peck Lin, her colleague Su-Anne and RP were there. According to Evelyn,
                    RP handed her his name card which stated that he was the managing director of
                    Walking Culture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Evelyn said RP made a presentation which
                    lasted over two hours. RP said a number of things during the presentation. He
                    said he was the managing director of DVH and spoke of his past experience there.
                    He spoke about the global success of the Da Vinci group. He said Walking Culture
                    was part of Da Vinci’s shoe business. He said he operated the Walking
                    Culture business out of his office and warehouse at the Da Vinci building at Tai
                    Seng. He said Walking Culture was distributed in Milan, Madrid, Paris, London,
                    New York, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jarkarta, Melbourne, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
                    China, the United States, Canada, <em>etc</em>. He said Da
                    Vinci had a lot of designers from all over the world to design shoes for Walking
                    Culture. The shoes would be manufactured in Walking Culture factories in China.
                    He said he was assisted by a dedicated team and many staff. His years of retail
                    experience with Da Vinci would help him bring Walking Culture to a very high
                    level in the fastest time possible. He said he had plans to list Walking Culture
                    in three years’ time. He preferred franchisees like Evelyn and Neo who had
                    no retail experience. He would take care of all warehousing, logistics and price
                    tagging of the stock as Da Vinci had all the logistical support; the franchisees
                    need only be concerned with in-store operations. He said that, based on his
                    experience and the support he had from Da Vinci, he could train everybody who
                    would take the franchise, even someone with zero experience. He agreed with
                    Evelyn and Neo it would be better to open two outlets rather than one. At the
                    end of the presentation, Evelyn and Neo decided to go ahead with the franchise
                    and RP told them Peck Lin would prepare the franchise agreements and call them
                    for another meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Evelyn had made notes of the
                    30 September 2004 meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> The notes did not contain the
                    information which Evelyn claimed RP had given about Da Vinci except for a
                    reference to Da Vinci having won three awards. She said that this was because
                    her notes were focussed on going forward as a franchisee after they had
                    established that Da Vinci was running the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    According to Peck Lin’s statement, RP
                    said at the meeting, which was attended by Evelyn and other potential
                    franchisees, that all the warehousing, logistics and price tagging of the stock
                    would be done by the franchisor at the Da Vinci building/warehouse. She heard
                    him tell them that he could buy back slow-moving or dead stock at a certain
                    price. She also heard him tell them that Tradewind as the franchisor would be
                    managing some of the biggest headaches in the shoe retail business for them as
                    part of the franchise deal, leaving them free to concentrate on in-store selling
                    and customer service. However, in cross-examination, Peck Lin could not recall
                    whether RP had specifically said Tradewind was the franchisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    RP’s version was rather different. He
                    denied that he told Evelyn and Neo on 30 September 2004 that Da Vinci had
                    designers all over the world nor did he say it had factories in China. He denied
                    saying that as persons without retail experience they were perfect. He denied
                    saying he would assist on the entire set up and operations and would guide them
                    through the whole operation. He denied saying Da Vinci would provide logistical
                    support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    RP said that he made a presentation to
                    persons interested in the franchise at the office of FT Consultancy after the
                    GFE. This presentation was attended by about ten interested parties (including,
                    perhaps, Evelyn and Neo). This was before he met them separately on or about
                    30 September 2004. He talked about Da Vinci, his background and his retail
                    experience. He did not in any way, suggest that the Walking Culture business was
                    associated with the Da Vinci group. He did not say that Walking Culture was
                    distributed all over the world nor did he say that it was distributed in Milan,
                    Madrid, Paris, London and New York although he accepted that these cities were
                    stated on the reverse of his Walking Culture name card. He accepted that Walking
                    Culture shoes were not sold in these cities. However, he said that these cities
                    were named not to give a false impression but as a form of
                        marketing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> He said in cross-examination that a
                    PowerPoint presentation was made to the interested franchisees<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> but it was not
                    clear which version was shown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Neo, in his AEIC, simply confirmed
                    Evelyn’s version of the 30 September 2004 meeting. However, in
                    cross-examination, he conceded that RP did not expressly say that the shoe
                    business was a Da Vinci business, and explained that that was the inference he
                    drew from the fact that RP was the managing director of Da Vinci, and also

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    After the 30 September 2004 meeting,
                    Evelyn and RP had several telephone discussions on the outlets’ location.
                    Eventually, RP, Evelyn, Neo and Shavon viewed an outlet at #01-57 at
                    People’s Park on 8 October 2004. The landlord was Tan Kok Thye Pte
                    Ltd, whose managing director was Tan. Tan was present at the meeting, as was a
                    property agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Evelyn said RP liked the location and
                    suggested that she and Neo put in an offer as soon as possible. In
                    cross-examination, Evelyn added she was excited by the crowd at People’s
                    Park and went to walk around;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> she did not therefore
                    participate in the negotiations but believed they were done by RP.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Evelyn also said
                    that the rent was negotiated to $7,000 a month, down from the $8,000 a month
                    quoted by Tan when she first met him two days ago, on 6 October
                        2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> Neo and
                    her then placed a deposit. Evelyn also said that she told Tan that Da Vinci was
                    rolling out a franchise and she was doing the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Tan was subpoenaed by DNV to give evidence.
                    He said that Evelyn had told him that they were starting up a shoe franchise
                    with Da Vinci. He said she was interested in renting the unit but had to check
                    with the franchisor if the unit was suitable. He said that, when he met Evelyn,
                    Neo and RP, RP gave him two name cards – one described RP as the marketing
                    director of DVH; another described RP as the managing director of Walking
                    Culture. He said that the property agent introduced RP as being from Da Vinci.
                    He confirmed that Evelyn did not participate in the negotiations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> RP told him that
                    RP was from Da Vinci and that his father was the owner of Da Vinci. RP told him
                    that Da Vinci was branching out to shoes and Walking Culture was the new
                    business. He said RP claimed the strong support of his father. He said RP told
                    him about the Da Vinci Walking Culture store at Bugis, that it was doing very
                    well and that it was able to afford the high rent there. He said he felt that RP
                    was trying to impress him by telling him about Da Vinci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> RP wanted to
                    have the next Da Vinci Walking Culture outlet at the People’s Park unit.
                    RP negotiated for a lower rent for the franchisee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Tan was keen to have Da
                    Vinci franchisees as his tenants and agreed to reduce the rent for his unit. He
                    said franchisees related to big companies tended to honour their
                        agreements,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> and he was willing to lower his price to
                    receive prompt payment. He rejected a suggestion to him that it was against
                    common sense for RP to speak about the high rent he could afford to pay when
                    negotiating. He explained that RP was trying to impress him that the business
                    was viable provided the rental was right.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> He said that he signed a
                    letter of intent with Evelyn and Neo after the negotiations and received a
                    cheque on the spot.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    RP’s version of events was rather
                    different. He agreed that he gave two name cards to Tan, but clarified that he
                    was actually the managing director and not the marketing director of
                        DVH.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> He accepted
                    that he told Tan that he was from Da Vinci and his father was the owner of Da
                    Vinci. He said that this was in the context of Da Vinci possibly being
                    interested in retail outlets as well.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> He denied telling Tan that
                    Da Vinci was branching out to shoes or that Walking Culture was the new business
                    or that he had the strong support of his father. He denied telling Tan about the
                    Da Vinci Walking Culture store at Bugis because the name had already been
                    changed to Walking Culture by then. He denied saying that he was interested in
                    having the next Da Vinci Walking Culture outlet at People’s Park. He
                    denied negotiating the rent with Tan or telling him that he could pay high rent
                    at Bugis. He said that it did not make sense to claim this if he was trying to
                    reduce the rent. He said he would not negotiate rent for franchisees. He said
                    that he thought that the unit’s area (400 sq ft) was too small and the
                    rent was too high. He said he told Evelyn and Neo about his reservations but
                    Evelyn told him that they had already signed up with the landlord.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    I cannot see any reason why Tan would lie.
                    Further, while Tan was recollecting events occurring more than five years ago,
                    it seems to me that as a landlord he should be quite clear in his mind why he
                    gave a reduction in the rent he wanted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Millenia Walk outlet</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Soon after, on 10 October 2004, Evelyn
                    received an email from a property agent Richard Quek who had been recommended by
                    RP. That email forwarded an email dated 8 October 2004 from Soo Weiping, a
                    senior leasing executive with Pontiac Marina Private Limited
                    (“PMPL”), the landlord of Millenia Walk. Soo Weiping said that she
                    understood from one Samantha, a director of PMPL, that ‘Da Vinci is keen
                    to re-explore the possibility of having their “Walking Culture”
                    concept in Millenia Walk’.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    On 11 October 2004, Evelyn went with RP
                    and Richard Quek to view a unit at Millenia Walk. They ended up looking at a
                    larger unit there. RP helped to negotiate a lower rent for the unit. Evelyn said
                    that had it not been for RP’s representations about Walking
                    Culture’s association with Da Vinci, they would not have been able to rent
                    the unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    With regard to Weiping Soo’s email of
                    8 October 2004, RP said that he clarified this misunderstanding later. RP
                    said that at a meeting with the property agent, Richard Quek, Samantha, Soo
                    Weiping, Evelyn and Neo, he said that Walking Culture was not the business of Da
                    Vinci as he did not want Da Vinci to be liable for the business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> RP said that
                    Samantha had initially wrongly connected Da Vinci with Walking Culture because
                    RP had previously dealt with her regarding a location for a Da Vinci furniture
                    store, and she therefore connected RP with Da Vinci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    RP did not call Richard Quek, Soo Weiping or
                    Samantha to be his witness. He said that Richard Quek did not want to get
                    involved and he could not contact Soo Weiping who had left PMPL. He spoke to
                    Samantha, who vaguely remembered his version, but did not want to get involved
                    in litigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> The alleged clarification by RP to Richard
                    Quek, Samantha and Soo Weiping, in the presence of Evelyn and Neo, was also not
                    raised with either Evelyn or Neo while they were being
                cross-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In the circumstances, it is difficult to
                    escape the conclusion that RP must have said or done something to give Samantha
                    the impression that Walking Culture was a Da Vinci business, and that he did
                    not, contrary to his allegation, clarify this wrong impression later
                on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Franchise Agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    On 13 October 2004, Neo and Shavon
                    incorporated DNV with a paid up capital of $200,000. On 19 October 2004,
                    Evelyn, Neo and Shavon met RP and Peck Lin at Peck Lin’s office to discuss
                    the franchise agreements. On or about 20 October 2004, DNV executed two
                    franchise agreements with Tradewind, one for the store at PPC and the other for
                    the store at Millenia Walk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    According to Evelyn, during the meeting on
                    19 October 2004, Neo asked RP why the franchise agreements were being
                    signed under Tradewind’s name instead of Walking Culture or Da Vinci. She
                    said RP replied that WCIPL was the company holding the brand and Tradewind was
                    just the vehicle used for the franchise business. She was made to understand
                    that the whole business was owned by Da Vinci. She said she asked RP what
                    assurance or guarantee she and Neo would get from the franchisor, and in reply
                    RP told them that Walking Culture had the full backing of Da Vinci. In
                    cross-examination, she explained that the guarantee question came up because RP
                    had earlier asked for payment by way of a bank draft. She added that RP had
                    laughed and said that Da Vinci was so big and “What’s the
                        worry?”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> She said felt assured by what RP was telling
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    The representations which Evelyn alluded to
                    were not contained in any of her handwritten notes for the 19 October 2004
                    meeting. The notes contained information on operational matters.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> When this was
                    pointed out to her during cross-examination, she said that, “I would deal
                    with Raymond, as in Raymond is Da Vinci itself, because he said that he would
                    assure us that all these things will be delivered and, after all, Da Vinci is so
                    big and Da Vinci is backing the entire business.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Neo also confirmed this aspect of
                    Evelyn’s evidence. In cross-examination he said, of RP: ‘He only
                    told us about this brand, Da Vinci... So on the 19th itself when we suddenly see
                    the word “Tradewind”, we had to ask him to clarify. He told us
                    that Tradewind was only a vehicle for this business. The owner was still Da
                        Vinci.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    During cross-examination, RP said that Neo
                    had asked why the agreement was under Tradewind’s name and not Walking
                    Culture. He said he explained that Walking Culture was the brand and Tradewind
                    was the franchisor that had the right to use the brand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> He denied saying
                    that Tradewind was merely a vehicle and the whole business was owned by Da Vinci
                    or that Walking Culture had the full backing from Da Vinci or any connection
                    with Da Vinci. He did not remember a question being raised about the kind of
                    assurance or guarantee the Singapore franchisee would get.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> He said that if
                    it was a Da Vinci franchise, it would not cost $5,000 only. He also said Da
                    Vinci would not need a franchisee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    There was some question whether Neo knew
                    about Tradewind before 19 October 2004. The agreed bundles contained a copy
                    of a letter of intent, signed by Neo and dated 15 October 2004, to enter
                    into a franchise agreement with Tradewind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> This letter was said
                    to be signed at the official opening of the Harbourfront outlet. Neo said at
                    trial that he was told to sign a blank document at the opening for the benefit
                    of the press and felt angry and cheated when he subsequently saw the letter of
                    intent in the course of the present proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> It also turned out that
                    the copy of the letter was RP’s document and the plaintiffs’
                    solicitors had agreed to put it in the agreed bundle subject to the production
                    of the original.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> The timing of the discovery and inspection was
                    also not made clear to me. Neither was it raised in RP’s evidence in chief
                    that Neo knew about Tradewind before 19 October 2004. RP said that Neo
                    would have signed two (and not one) letters of intent, one for each store. These
                    two letters were mentioned only when he gave oral evidence. Prior to that, only
                    one was referred to. In these circumstances I do not think that either party can
                    make anything much out of the letter of intent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fui</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Fui was subpoenaed to give evidence for DNV.
                    Fui said that he had been working for Da Vinci Collection and then Tradewind.
                    When he worked for Da Vinci Collection, he would wear a light blue Da Vinci
                    T-shirt but thereafter, he wore a black T-shirt with a Walking Culture
                        logo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> He would receive shoes from Malaysia and
                    also did deliveries to DNV in trucks with a Da Vinci Presentation
                        logo.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> He would also collect defective shoes from
                    Evelyn and bring them back to the Da Vinci warehouse in Tai Seng and repair
                    them. Fui said that he would also help out in the sale of shoes at the Bugis
                    outlet. He said that when the shoes were using the Da Vinci Walking Culture
                    label, RP had told him once to say that the business was part of the Da Vinci
                        group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Yet, he also
                    said that when he mentioned the Da Vinci group to customers, what he meant was
                    that the shoes were distributed in many cities, and not that the business was
                    part of the Da Vinci group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> When re-examined, he said
                    Walking Culture was RP’s business, not Da Vinci’s. At the same time,
                    in reply to a question on the relationship between RP and Da Vinci, he said,
                    “I didn’t go and understand all this.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    According to RP, the repairs were done at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I would say that Fui’s evidence is
                    inconclusive. Fui seems to be an employee who was not too concerned or certain
                    about his employer’s affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other incidents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    There were other incidents and events, which
                    I will review briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    RP had training sessions for Neo and Evelyn
                    and another local franchisee on 28 and 29 October 2004, in a meeting room
                    in the Da Vinci building. According to Evelyn, there were many pictures hanging
                    on the walls, and RP informed them that the pictures were of Da Vinci buildings
                    in various countries. She also said that, in the midst of the training, a man
                    with a pony tail walked in with some visitors, and RP explained that that was
                    his father, Tony Phua, who was showing the visitors the pictures hanging on the
                    walls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Evelyn said that the first delivery of shoes
                    for the Millenia Walk outlet contained some shoes with the Da Vinci label with
                    Da Vinci boxes. When she asked RP why some of the shoes were using the Da Vinci
                    label and others the Walking Culture label, he said that Walking Culture was the
                    younger version of Da Vinci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Like Dian, Evelyn also had complaints about
                    the shoes which were supplied to DNV.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In email exchanges, RP would sign off as
                    Chairman and CEO of WCIPL but the name of DVH appeared beneath the name and
                    details of WCIPL. However, Evelyn accepted that formal documents like tax
                    invoices, statements of account, purchase orders and sales orders would be
                    issued by or to Tradewind and there was no mention of any of the Da Vinci
                    companies therein. Letters would be on the letterhead of the Tradewind group or
                    Walking Culture without mention of Da Vinci except for the occasional one where
                    DVH was mentioned after WCIPL at the sign off.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> Also, in
                    Evelyn’s many written complaints to RP, Evelyn did not mention the
                    representations which DNV was relying on in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Evelyn and Neo said they found out about
                    RP’s fraud in September 2008, after this action was
                commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RP’s dealings with Wendy of MPL (October 2004
                onwards)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Wendy is a director of and the witness for
                    MPL. Her highest level of education is secondary four. She is a qualified
                    accountant and is a member of the Association for Chartered and Certified
                    Accountants. She completed some law modules as part of her curriculum including
                    contract and corporate legal structures. She was a director and shareholder of
                    various companies in Singapore before migrating to Australia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Initial meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Wendy first met RP at the opening ceremony
                    of the Walking Culture boutique at Harbourfront on 15 October 2004. She
                    attended the ceremony because she wanted to meet RP. She learned that he was the
                    managing director of DVH and wanted to interest him in a project to develop an
                    automated goods and sevices tax (“GST”) card for overseas visitors
                    who were shopping in Singapore. According to Wendy, RP introduced himself as the
                    managing director of Da Vinci and said that he was the person behind the
                    creation of Da Vinci Jewellery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Wendy returned to the Habourfront outlet
                    because a pair of shoes she bought at the opening did not fit well. The staff
                    could not offer an acceptable solution. Wendy asked to speak to the boss. While
                    the call was being made, Wendy noticed that there was a big signboard listing
                    out cities where Walking Culture had a presence. She noticed that Melbourne,
                    Australia was listed. This caught her attention as her eldest son was studying
                    in Melbourne and her family was considering living in Melbourne too. RP then
                    came on the telephone. When he learned about Wendy’s problem, he told her
                    that she could replace the pair she had bought. She asked him where the
                    Melbourne outlet was and he said that the franchise for that city had not been
                    sealed yet. He was thinking of withdrawing the franchise offer to a potential
                    franchisee and asked her if she was interested in it. She said that she did not
                    have any retail experience. He said that she did not need any and everything
                    would be arranged for the franchisee. Wendy said that she would like to know
                    more and a meeting was arranged for 19 October 2004 at Harry’s The
                    Pub at Harbourfront.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    RP said that at the opening of the
                    Harbourfront outlet when he met Wendy, he did not mention Da Vinci at
                        all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meeting of 19 October 2004</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Wendy met RP again on 19 October 2004,
                    together with her husband, Rodney Soh, and her colleague, Tan Swee Lin, who left
                    after making a presentation on the GST project. RP came alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    According to Wendy, RP said a number of
                    things at the 19 October 2004 meeting. She said he claimed he was part of
                    the Da Vinci success. He said that, just like Da Vinci Jewellery, Walking
                    Culture was his brainchild. This gave Wendy the impression that he was opening
                    another Da Vinci business. He said that Walking Culture had factories in China.
                    She said that RP assured her and Rodney that he would be the person driving
                    Walking Culture and he would personally see through its development. She said
                    that, in response to her question on how he would divide his time between
                    managing Da Vinci and starting a new Da Vinci venture, RP said he had the 100%
                    endorsement from the board of the Da Vinci group. She said that RP told her and
                    Rodney that it was Walking Culture’s plan to list on the New York Stock
                    Exchange within the two years. She said that RP said that Walking Culture was
                    very big and had offices all over the world, that the Da Vinci design team would
                    design the shoes, and that Da Vinci’s administrative and logistical
                    infrastructure would support Walking Culture’s manufacturing needs.
                    Finally, she said that RP told her and Rodney that he preferred to appoint
                    franchisees with absolutely no knowledge of the business, because then he would
                    be able to control the way the business should be run and managed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    According to RP, he talked about his
                    experience with Da Vinci. He denied saying that Da Vinci was branching out into
                    the shoe business just as it did with Da Vinci Jewellery. He denied saying that
                    Da Vinci Jewellery was his brainchild.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> He denied saying that Walking
                    Culture had factories in China. He denied saying that he had 100 per cent
                    endorsement of the Da Vinci board of directors to start Walking Culture. He
                    denied saying that he planned a listing on the New York Stock Exchange or that
                    Walking Culture was very big. He did not say the Da Vinci design team would
                    design the shoes. He said Wendy knew he had left Da Vinci and that Walking
                    Culture was a small outfit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span> He said Wendy was interested
                    in the concept of the shop which used the shoe boxes as part of the store
                    design.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Meeting of 30 October 2008; finalisation of terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Wendy and Rodney met RP and Peck Lin on
                    30 October 2008. Peck Lin explained how the franchise system worked. Wendy
                    and Rodney were told that Peck Lin would prepare the franchise agreement and
                    send them a draft of the main commercial terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    After the 30 October 2004 meeting,
                    Wendy went to the Bugis outlet. She noticed that the shoes there were carrying
                    the Da Vinci Walking Culture label whereas the ones she had bought at
                    Harbourfront were just called Walking Culture. She met one Justin whom RP had
                    said was his partner with a 10% stake in the business. Upon her inquiry, Justin
                    explained that the brand was changed from Da Vinci Walking Culture to Walking
                    Culture for two reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">to make the name more sassy as Da Vinci Walking
                            Culture was too long; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">to make it neater.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Wendy said that she asked Justin if it was
                    just a change of name and Justin replied that Da Vinci Walking Culture was
                    started by the Da Vinci group. It was only a change of brand name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Wendy said that she called RP about this who
                    said that Da Vinci Walking Culture was the original brand and Walking Culture
                    was the updated brand. She felt assured by his explanation that Walking Culture
                    continued to be part of Da Vinci.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finalisation of main commercial terms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The main commercial terms were finalised in
                    November. Three drafts of the main commercial terms were forwarded by Peck Lin
                    to Wendy. The first draft was on 1 November 2004, the second on 6 November
                    2004, and the third on 16 November 2004. The first draft contained the
                    following term:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Moratorium Period</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Raymond Phua covenants to remain the majority owner and managing
                        director of <em>Tradewind Group Pte Ltd</em>, the
                        Franchisor entity, for a period of 3 years from the date of the Franchise
                        Agreement for Victoria.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In between the three drafts Wendy expressed some concerns which Peck
                    Lin sought to address. Her email of 11 November 2004 stated that she had
                    consulted a lawyer and a business consultant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> She elaborated in oral evidence that the
                    lawyer was a friend of hers and the business consultant was one Albert Kong, the
                    editor of Asia Franchise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> She also claimed to have
                    done due diligence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    There was also a moratorium clause in the
                    draft which stipulated that RP (not Da Vinci) was to be the majority owner of
                    Tradewind for three years. However, Wendy said that she did not notice this
                    clause until later. Neither did she notice that Tradewind was to be the
                    franchisor. The initial drafts had referred to WCIPL, and not Tradewind, as the
                    other party to the intended franchise.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The November meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    About a week after 16 November 2004,
                    Wendy and Rodney met RP, Peck Lin and an assistant of RP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    According to Wendy, she asked RP about a
                    number of things. She said she asked RP about the production of the shoes. She
                    said RP replied that Walking Culture had already bought over three factories in
                    China, which would give them control over the type and quality of the shoes that
                    were being manufactured. She said she asked to meet RP’s team, and in
                    response RP laughed and said his team was all over the world. She said RP
                    explained that Walking Culture was leveraging on the strength of Da
                    Vinci’s international design team.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Wendy also said that she and Rodney asked RP
                    to included a moratorium in the franchise agreement, noting in this regard that
                    the main commercial terms had already provided for a three-year moratorium
                    period during which time Phua could not leave the Walking Culture business. She
                    annexed an undated draft, clause 5.2 of which provided for the
                        moratorium.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> Clause 5.2 referred to the
                    “Franchisor entity” instead of Tradewind. In cross-examination,
                    Wendy confirmed that the moratorium clause was discussed during this
                        meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Wendy further said that some other
                    commercial terms were discussed and RP also mentioned that Spring Singapore had
                    supported the venture. She said that RP referred to the November 2004 issue
                    of Productivity Digest which described him as a rising star. The relevant
                    article made no reference to Da Vinci. She also said that RP mentioned that
                    WCIPL had registered the trademark “Walking Culture” in Australia.
                    Her husband made a search in Australia after a letter of intent was signed and
                    learned that this information was true.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Wendy said that she felt assured by RP at
                    the end of the meeting, and said that basically RP told her and Rodney that
                    while the infrastructure support at Walking Culture was still being developed,
                    he had Da Vinci behind him to back him up on any financial and operational
                    needs. She said she decided to proceed with taking up the Walking Culture
                    franchise for Melbourne.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    RP denied saying at the meeting on or about
                    23 November 2005 at Intercontinental Hotel that his team was all over the
                    world or that Da Vinci was very big worldwide or that it had many teams of staff
                    to look after fashion trends and needs. He also said he remembered meeting Wendy
                    and Rodney at American Club and saying that he left Da Vinci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span> He could not
                    recall the date of this meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Letter of Intent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    On 25 November 2004, Peck Lin sent
                    Wendy a draft letter of intent. The draft letter was a little over a page long
                    and was expressed to be between Tradewind and Wendy. Wendy said that the fact
                    that Tradewind was the counterparty was not drawn to her attention, and that she
                    was not aware of Tradewind’s existence at that point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    On 9 December 2004, Wendy went to Peck
                    Lin’s office to sign the finalised letter of intent, which incorporated
                    the main commercial terms. RP was also present. Wendy said she was surprised to
                    notice that the finalised letter was written on Tradewind’s letterhead,
                    and that she had not heard of Tradewind before. When asked about Tradewind, she
                    said that RP explained that, as Da Vinci’s core business was in furniture
                    and not fashion, a separate legal identity and entity was needed to establish
                    the franchise model and to take the Walking Culture brand to an international
                    level. She said she was made to understand that Tradewind is a company or entity
                    owned by Da Vinci and set up by Da Vinci as a vehicle for the franchise. She
                    said that she understood the franchise business was still ultimately Da
                    Vinci’s. She then signed the letter of intent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    On 10 December 2004, Rodney and Wendy
                    went to Melbourne to study the shoe industry there. On 23 December 2004,
                    they incorporated MPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I pause here to comment on Wendy’s
                    evidence that she did not know about the existence or involvement of Tradewind
                    until the finalised letter of intent was presented to her on 9 December
                    2004. On her own evidence-in-chief, the moratorium clause, which expressly
                    referred to Tradewind, was present in the first draft of the main commercial
                    terms, which she received on 1 November 2004. It remained unchanged throughout
                    all three drafts of the main commercial terms, which by her own evidence she
                    scrutinised closely. She had also been concerned about Raymond’s
                    involvement since the 19 October 2004 meeting. Further, she expressly
                    referred to the moratorium clause in the November meeting when she asked RP for
                    a similar clause in the actual franchise agreement. In these circumstances, I
                    cannot believe that Wendy did not know about the existence or involvement of
                    Tradewind before 9 November 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finalising the master franchise agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    In January and February 2005, Wendy worked
                    with Peck Lin and RP to finalise the terms of the master franchise agreement.
                    Wendy signed the master franchise agreement on 4 February 2005. There were
                    some amendments and the agreement was eventually dated 18 February
                    2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    In finalising the terms, Wendy was advised
                    by a lawyer, Mr Mansur Husain from Jacob Mansur &amp; Pillai.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> Mr Mansur
                    was not the same lawyer who had advised her on the letter of intent. One of the
                    various comments made by Mr Mansur was in respect of a no
                    representation/reliance clause. Mr Mansur explained to Wendy that this
                    clause was an attempt by Walking Culture to absolve themselves of any liability
                    for promises or advice given.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> Wendy also emailed Peck Lin
                    on 26 January 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> to say that, if the terms of the
                    franchise agreement were unacceptable, she was prepared to walk away and that
                    she exercised independent judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    According to Wendy, she asked RP why the
                    franchise agreement would be signed with Tradewind and not with Da Vinci or
                    Walking Culture. She said that RP and Peck Lin explained to her that Tradewind
                    was a company created to manage the franchise business only; and that they need
                    not be concerned as it did not matter how the companies were set
                up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Clause 20.1.11 of the draft agreement
                    allowed Tradewind to terminate the franchise agreement if any change occurred in
                    the management, ownership or control of DNV. Wendy said she asked RP if MPL had
                    the same right of termination if the management of Walking Culture changed. She
                    said she was told that as long as the system operated normally and successfully,
                    she need not concern herself about who managed the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Clause 20.2.1 of the draft agreement
                    provided a right of Tradewind to terminate the agreement if DNV became
                    insolvent. Wendy said that, when she asked RP what would happen if Walking
                    Culture went bust, RP laughed and said: “Da Vinci Group is so big, do you
                    think we will go bust?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Wendy said that she was comforted by this
                    assurance and the fact that RP had the authority and access to mobilize support,
                    financial or otherwise, from Da Vinci. She said that, every time she raised
                    concerns about the business, RP would assure her that they were buying into a
                    successful model that will reduce start-up risks. She said that RP was in a
                    hurry for them to sign the franchise agreement. In cross-examination, she said
                    that, although she knew the franchise agreement was one-sided, she entered into
                    it because she trusted the name “Da Vinci”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    As things turned out, the moratorium clause
                    in the draft agreement was not included in the final agreement. According to
                    Wendy, RP had wanted a similar moratorium from her, but for ten years instead of
                    three. Eventually, both of them agreed not to have a moratorium clause for
                    either of them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    There was an email from Wendy to Peck Lin
                    dated 25 January 2005. In that email, Wendy had asked what protection they
                    would have if Walking Culture was wound up. Wendy said that this email was
                    probably sent after the oral assurance from RP that Da Vinci would not go
                        bust.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> It was sent because her husband had raised the
                    subject with her. Peck Lin replied that if Tradewind were to go bust, their
                    interest was not to terminate the franchise but to hope that a purchaser of the
                    franchisor’s business would quickly take over and ensure
                        continuity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> Wendy said that she did not respond to Peck
                    Lin’s email to mention RP’s oral assurances because she saw the risk
                    of Tradewind going bust as very low as she believed that Tradewind was part of
                    Walking Culture which was part of the Da Vinci group.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    RP was not challenged with this part of
                    Wendy’s evidence during his cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    I pause here to say that I do not believe
                    that Wendy was assured by the alleged representation by RP that Da Vinci would
                    not go bust. If she had been assured she would not have sent the email dated
                    25 January 2005 to Peck Lin to ask about the protection she and Rodney
                    would have if Walking Culture was wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Searching for an outlet; the Powerpoint presentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    After signing the master franchise
                    agreement, Wendy and Rodney then proceeded to search for suitable locations for
                    an outlet in Melbourne. RP provided them with a Powerpoint presentation which
                    they could use when approaching potential landlords.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span> The
                    presentation was identical to the one said to be made by RP to Dian (see
                        <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    According to Wendy, the presentation was
                    used to impress and win confidence from the target audience which included
                    potential landlords, sub-franchisees, bankers and others. She said that RP used
                    the presentation to introduce Walking Culture to two malls; he did not use the
                    presentation for two other malls because the agents of those malls already knew
                    that he was the managing director of Da Vinci. She said that, during the visits
                    to the malls, RP introduced himself as the managing director of Walking Culture.
                    She said that RP explained that Da Vinci was the holding company of Walking
                    Culture, that Da Vinci was a very successful company with a high net worth and
                    that Walking Culture was one of the businesses it was handling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Eventually, the shopping mall
                    “Collins two3four” offered Wendy and Rodney a space. Wendy said
                    that the mall was owned by a Singapore company through a nominee
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> She said she was informed by an employee of
                    the Mall’s managing agent, Knight Frank, that they were offered a space
                    because the owners of the Mall had relied on Da Vinci’s reputation and
                    financial strength in Singapore. She said that, under Australian practice, the
                    owners of malls would ask for personal guarantees from tenants that did not have
                    a good track record. She said that the owners of the mall did not ask for one
                    because Walking Culture was part of Da Vinci.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    RP disputed that the presentation was to
                    suggest a relationship between the Da Vinci group and Walking Culture. He said
                    “the whole point is to be able to at least let them [<em>ie</em> potential landlords] know who the founder is of this
                    business, and to try and get a better space or negotiate a better rental with
                    the landlord.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> But there was no reference in the presentation
                    to RP himself, and RP did not further explain how potential landlords were able
                    to know about him through the presentation. When asked if the franchisees would
                    be confused by the reference to RP, since by that time they should (according to
                    RP) have known that he had no more dealings with the Da Vinci group. RP replied
                    that Wendy did not make any mention of this issue when he sent her the
                    presentation, and that the references to the Da Vinci group were references to
                    his experiences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> In re-examination, he said that, on
                    hindsight, the presentation should not have been provided to Wendy to present
                    alone to prospective landlords.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    I observe that RP’s evidence here
                    contrasts with his evidence in relation to RP’s first meeting with Dian,
                    where he said he could not have mentioned Da Vinci’s name because he
                    wanted a discount from her. Such conflicting explanations of his commercial
                        <em>modus operandi</em> do not help RP’s
                    credibility at all. I must say that it is more probable than not that RP did
                    draw a link between Da Vinci and Walking Culture to impress the Australian
                    landlords or their agents whom he dealt with in the presence of Wendy and
                    Rodney, and also to impress Wendy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Walking Culture website</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    In oral evidence, Wendy also said that
                    before she signed the franchise agreement, she had gone to the website of
                    Walking Culture, at www.walkingculture.com. She noticed a statement there
                    indicating that “Walking Culture was part subsidiary of one of
                    Asia’s biggest retail group, Da Vinci group”. However, she did not
                    print a copy then and the copy she printed was dated 6 July
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> Also, neither her pleadings on the
                    representations or her AEIC mentioned her reliance on the website. In fact none
                    of the plaintiffs deposed to relying on the website in their evidence-in-chief.
                    It is nevertheless pertinent to refer to the following description on the index
                    page of the website:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Walking Culture is part subsidiary of one of Asia’s biggest retail
                        group – Da Vinci Group which has business interests as property
                        developers, lifestyle home furniture and furnishings, fashion timepieces and
                        jewelry [<em>sic</em>], and designer tabletop arts. As
                        a group, we have been awarded as Top 100 Investor Grade Companies in

                        Seminars department. Further to that, Walking Culture has recently been
                        awarded by European Franchising magazine as 2005’s Top 100 Quality
                        International Franchises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no proof of the precise date of this description. However,
                    some assistance can be derived from the statement “©
                    Copyright 2004 Walking Culture International” at the end of the index
                    page, and from the reference in the quotation above that “Walking Culture
                    has <em>recently</em> been awarded by European Franchising
                    magazine as <em>2005’s</em> Top 100 Quality
                    International Franchises” [emphasis added]. It seems fair to say that the
                    description was made between 2004 and 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    The website was designed by Ad Wright. Ad
                    Wright had been working with Da Vinci since 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> RP acknowledged that, besides
                    the reference to Walking Culture being a part subsidiary of the Da Vinci group,
                    the other information in the part of the website quoted above was
                        accurate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> He further said that the initial version of the
                    website, which was done pursuant to discussions between him and Danny Phoa of Ad
                    Wright, did not have anything like the reference to Da Vinci.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> However, RP
                    was unable to explain how the connection to Da Vinci came to be mentioned in the
                    website without his or Danny Phoa’s knowledge and no one from Ad Wright
                    gave evidence for him. Danny Phoa was supposed to be called but was withdrawn
                    after RP finished his evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    In the circumstances, it is difficult to
                    escape the conclusion that RP must have been the source, either directly or
                    indirectly, for the contents of the website quoted above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent correspondence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Like Dian and Evelyn, Wendy also had
                    complaints about the shoes which were supplied to MPL. RP accepted that in some
                    of his email responses to Wendy’s subsequent complaints about the shoes,
                    he had signed off as managing director of DVH.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> He said that by
                    then, he had returned to Da Vinci and he did tell Wendy of this
                        fact.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Wendy wrote an email to RP on 5 October
                    2005, expressing her frustrations with how the franchise was being run. At the
                    end of the email, Wendy said, “Before I end, Raymond, I would like to
                    reiterate what I said 11 months ago when I took up the franchise – I
                    believe in YOU not your products.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Wendy said she found out about the fraud in
                    June 2006. In her correspondence with RP in or around that period, and in fact
                    generally, nothing was said about RP’s alleged representations and how he
                    breached them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breakdown of relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    I come finally to the allegations which were
                    made in respect of how RP ran the Walking Culture shoe business. It is not
                    necessary for me to go into great detail on these allegations save for the
                    following general points. All the plaintiffs made complaints, some of which were
                    similar. They said that the quality of shoes delivered to them was very poor,
                    and in some cases the shipments were late. They said that RP gave them little
                    assistance in setting up and running up the franchise; in fact, his enthusiasm
                    visibly cooled after the plaintiffs signed their respective contracts with
                    Tradewind. They also said that RP gave each of them the impression that the
                    problems they experienced were unique and the rest of the franchisees were doing
                    well. I have said that the shoe business was not run by RP as a sham, but I
                    would observe that, judging from the tone of the extended correspondence that
                    the franchisees had with RP when the franchisees were still running their
                    outlets, they had legitimate reasons to be aggrieved with RP and the way the
                    business was being run from his end. RP himself admitted in cross-examination
                    that quality control was an issue.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span> It was also not in dispute
                    that Tradewind was in breach of its contracts with the plaintiffs, although the
                    defendants did not accept every breach alleged by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Ultimately, as I have mentioned, the Walking
                    Culture business failed, around four years after it began. WCIPL was, as
                    mentioned, sold to Steve Chiu for a nominal fee at an unknown date. Its Bugis
                    and Harbourfront outlets were closed. The People’s Park outlet was closed
                    on 9 November 2005. The Millenia Walk outlet was closed on 5 February
                    2006. The outlets in PIM2 and AGM, as well as a Jogjarkata outlet which Dian
                    later opened, were closed sometime in late 2006 or early 2007. The Melbourne
                    outlet was closed on 27 March 2007. The fate of the other franchisees not
                    in this action is not in evidence. I observe from the correspondence that the
                    relevant complaints to RP began a considerable period of time of at least a few
                    months before the respective outlets closed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    According to Wendy, she went back to
                    Singapore in May 2006 to look for some of the local franchisees. She managed to
                    contact Evelyn and through her, to contact Dian. They met on 11 May 2006
                    with Peck Lin to exchange notes. Wendy found out that the others were having
                    problems too.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Having reviewed the evidence, I now make my
                    findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    I would make two preliminary points on the
                    evidence, which are applicable to both the plaintiffs and the defendants. First,
                    it can be seen, from my observations in the course of reviewing the evidence,
                    that the versions of events presented by both sides were not entirely congruent
                    with the documentary evidence and the evidence from third parties. This is not
                    unexpected, given that the events concerned had occurred several years ago.
                    Second, a court should be slow to believe self-serving recollections of past
                    events when these recollections are not positively corroborated by
                    contemporaneous or independent sources. Put in another way, the presence of
                    self-interest and the absence of corroboration would generally undermine the
                    weight to be given to a witness’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    The plaintiffs’ case was certainly not
                    free from difficulty. Their recollections of events occurring around five years
                    ago by the time of the trial seem rather too detailed and precise. There was no
                    documentary evidence of the alleged representations. Dian, Evelyn and Wendy
                    could not explain why they did not look for RP at the Da Vinci building in Tai
                    Seng when problems surfaced. I have said that I cannot believe Wendy’s
                    evidence that she knew of Tradewind only when the finalised letter of intent was
                    presented to her, and that she relied on an alleged oral assurance by RP on the
                    financial strength of the Da Vinci group. Wendy also said that she depended on
                    RP (as opposed to Da Vinci); and her evidence generally showed that she
                    exercised her own judgment in entering into the franchise. At the end of the
                    day, all the plaintiffs knew, by the time they signed their respective
                    contracts, that the counterparty was Tradewind, a separate legal entity, and not
                    RP, DVH or any member of the Da Vinci group. Certainly, if the trial had been
                    fought purely as a contest of credibility between the interested witnesses, I
                    would have hesitated to say that the plaintiffs had made out their
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    But this was not the case. There was a
                    considerable amount of contemporaneous and/or independent evidence. There was
                    the Spring Singapore application which referred to DVH and said it was expanding
                    into the shoe business. I have found that RP must be responsible for this. There
                    were the references to the Da Vinci group in the PowerPoint presentation which
                    RP amended from Peck Lin’s original. There was the similar presentation
                    which he showed in Indonesia and gave to Wendy to show in Australia. There was
                    the evidence of Tan the landlord, who said RP was trying to impress him with
                    references to Da Vinci and how it was entering the shoe business. I have said I
                    believed Tan’s evidence. There was Soo Weiping’s email linking Da
                    Vinci to Walking Culture. There was Walking Culture’s website saying that
                    Walking Culture was a part subsidiary of the Da Vinci group. I have found that
                    RP must be responsible in some way for this. There were also RP’s email
                    signatures referring to DVH or to himself as managing director of DVH. There
                    were also RP’s own admissions of acts linking himself to Da Vinci, such as
                    giving out name cards, while doing Walking Culture’s business, such as
                    negotiating with landlords. Not all of this is directly relevant to RP’s
                    dealings with each plaintiff, but taken together they indicate very strongly
                    that RP was indeed linking Walking Culture to Da Vinci in order to advance his
                    shoe business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Against all this, RP’s evidence was
                    singularly unimpressive. He could not even make up his mind on his involvement
                    in Da Vinci during the lifetime of his shoe business. His final version that he
                    retained his managing directorship without performing substantive roles is
                    difficult to square with his other evidence that the plaintiffs were aware, or
                    were told by him, that he had left Da Vinci. Unlike the plaintiffs, his answers
                    kept conflicting with the independent witnesses, <em>ie</em>, Peck Lin and Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    In the circumstances, I find that RP had
                    represented to the plaintiffs before they entered into their respective
                    contracts with Tradewind that the Walking Culture shoe business was linked to
                    and had the backing of the Da Vinci group. Given that there was no dispute that
                    RP knew at all material times that Da Vinci was not linked to and was not
                    backing Walking Culture, these false representations must have been made
                    knowingly. It is not possible to state precisely when and how these
                    representations were made, but I am convinced that they must have been made, and
                    made at some point before the plaintiffs entered into their respective contracts
                    with Tradewind. I would go further and say that, judging from his interactions
                    with third parties such as Peck Lin and Tan, RP must have pitched the
                    representations strongly to induce the plaintiffs to enter into their respective
                    contracts with Tradewind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    The question, then, is whether the
                    plaintiffs had relied on such fraudulent representations in entering into the
                    franchise agreements with Tradewind. Here , it should be recalled that the
                    representations need not be the sole inducement. The plaintiffs’ case is
                    again not without difficulty, but in the final result I conclude that each and
                    every one of them had relied on RP’s fraudulent representations. There was
                    no convincing “moment of revelation” when they found out about
                    RP’s fraud and reacted to it, but given that the plaintiffs’
                    relationship with and confidence in RP had steadily eroded over a number of
                    months, I do not think it very material that they could not convincingly point
                    to a distinct time or incident when they realised that they had been deceived.
                    The plaintiffs also had some general understanding of the concept of the
                    company’s separate legal personality, and in the case of Dian and Wendy
                    had received some legal advice. But I do not think that has any bearing on
                    whether they believed, as a matter of fact, that the Da Vinci group would back
                    up the Walking Culture business. Here I would note that even Peck Lin, a lawyer
                    who worked closely with RP, also came away with the impression that the Da Vinci
                    group was involved with the Walking Culture business. In the final analysis, I
                    think the reliance question can be answered very simply. If RP had, as I found,
                    falsely represented to the plaintiffs that the Da Vinci group, with its
                    undisputed strength, was backing the Walking Culture business, it would be
                    extremely difficult for RP to say that the plaintiffs did not rely on this in
                    any way when entering into the contracts with Tradewind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    I therefore find that all four plaintiffs
                    had entered into their respective franchise agreements with Tradewind in
                    consequence of a fraud by RP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ claim against DVH</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Besides the collateral contract point, the
                    legal basis of the plaintiffs’ claim against DVH is not clearly stated.
                    They amended their statement of claim to remove vicarious liability as a basis
                    of their claim, but at the same time pleaded that DVH was liable because RP made
                    his representations as an employee of DVH. They also pleaded that DVH knowingly
                    permitted RP to make the representations he did, and further that DVH knowingly
                    permitted RP to make use of its name and its logistical resources in running
                    Tradewind. This seems to suggest a case of acquiescence amounting to actual
                    authorisation or ratification by DVH of RP’s acts. However, their closing
                    submissions focussed on ostensible or apparent authority, while on the facts
                    they continued to argue that DVH knew what RP was doing. In the circumstances, I
                    propose to address both actual and apparent authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Before I do so, I would make certain
                    observations about DVH’s stance in these proceedings, which in my view is
                    both curious and unsatisfactory. In para 6 of its Defence (Amendment No 2),
                    DVH had pleaded, not unexpectedly, that it had no knowledge of the
                    representations made by RP and in any event that he was not authorised to make
                    them. It also pleaded that RP was its managing director designate in or about
                    2003, and that he was appointed as managing director in or around April 2006.
                    However, during the trial, DVH associated itself with RP’s evidence, a
                    stance which is not entirely congruent with its pleadings which sought to
                    dissociate DVH from RP. Further, after RP completed his evidence by taking the
                    position that he held the appointment of managing director between 2003 and
                    2006, DVH made a submission of no case to answer. After hearing parties I ruled
                    that this was impermissible, since DVH had already begun its evidence by stating
                    through RP that he was giving evidence on behalf of both defendants. The effect
                    (and in all likelihood the purpose) of DVH’s submission was to withdraw
                    Tony and Veron Lim as witnesses at the last minute. This permits me to draw an
                    adverse inference if necessary: see illustration (g) to s 116 of the
                    Evidence Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Actual authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    I think that the plaintiffs cannot make out
                    a case of actual authority (or ratification). The low level logistical support
                    provided by DVH to the Walking Culture business, such as the use of offices,
                    warehouses and transport, is insufficient by itself to support a finding that
                    DVH knowingly permitted RP to represent that it was fully backing Walking
                    Culture when in fact it was not prepared to do so. The support is probably
                    explicable on the basis of the father-son relationship between Tony and RP.
                    Further, even taking into account DVH’s withdrawal of its proposed
                    witnesses at the last minute, I am unable to say that DVH knowingly permitted RP
                    to make the representations he did. This would be tantamount to saying that DVH
                    is complicit in RP’s fraud, and I can see no reason why DVH would want to
                    be complicit in such a fraud, especially given the relatively small size of the
                    Walking Culture business. In this regard, the position of DVH can be contrasted
                    to that of RP, who by his own admission was driven by to expand the Walking
                    Culture business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apparent authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    I turn to the plaintiffs’ case of
                    apparent authority. As a preliminary point, DVH argued that, in establishing
                    apparent authority, the plaintiffs cannot rely on any representation of
                    authority coming from RP himself. As a general proposition, this is correct
                    – to establish apparent authority, the appearance or representation of
                    authority must come from the alleged principal and not the alleged agent. The
                    plaintiffs cannot say that RP is apparently authorised by DVH on the basis of
                    RP’s words alone if there is nothing emanating from DVH to back this up.
                    However, it is equally clear that a principal can make a representation of
                    authority by its act of putting the agent in a relevant position of authority,
                    in which case the agent will be taken to have the authority usual to that
                    position. On the facts, I find that, by associating itself with RP’s
                    evidence and then refusing to call its witnesses after RP completed his
                    evidence, DVH must be taken to have affirmed RP’s final position in
                    re-examination that he held the appointment of managing director of DVH at all
                    material times. In any event, based on the evidence referred to above (at
                    [47-57]), I would also have found that RP was in fact the managing director of
                    DVH. Consequently, RP would have the apparent authority usual to a managing
                    director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    The question then becomes: is it within the
                    usual authority of a managing director to represent, as RP did, that his company
                    was backing a new business? If so, was it reasonable for the plaintiffs to rely
                    on such representations? With regard to the second question, it should be
                    emphasised that the requirement of reasonable reliance is necessary to establish
                    apparent authority but not fraud, and consequently it is possible for the
                    plaintiffs to succeed in fraud against RP but fail in apparent authority against
                    DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    With regard to the first question, I think
                    the answer is “yes”. As a general proposition, the apparent
                    authority of the managing director, as the highest ranking executive officer in
                    a company, must be very wide. It would include the authority to do all things
                    necessary or reasonably incidental to the management of the company’s
                    business: see, <em>eg</em>, Tan Cheng Han SC, <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em>, 3rd Ed (Singapore: Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 2009) at para 3.14. On the facts, DVH points out that
                    RP’s representations related to a new business, <em>viz</em> the Walking Culture business, and therefore could not be
                    said to be part of his apparent authority as a managing director. This argument
                    is not without force, but on the facts I would reject it. The Da Vinci group is
                    a conglomerate which has at various times expanded into different businesses as
                    diverse as furniture, jewellery and kitchenware. Against this backdrop, which
                    was known to all the relevant parties, I think DVH’s managing director,
                        <em>ie</em>, RP must be taken to have the apparent
                    authority to represent that DVH was backing a new business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    The second question is more difficult but
                    ultimately I think the answer must also be “yes”. On the facts, I
                    think the plaintiffs were not acting unreasonably in failing to confirm
                    RP’s representations with Tony or the board of DVH. RP was a sufficiently
                    high ranking officer for them to take him at his word, especially since he was
                    the son of the chairman, Tony, in a family-centred business. Separately, I do
                    not think that, on the facts, the plaintiffs were acting unreasonably in relying
                    on a mere representation from RP, as opposed to some legally binding promise
                    from DVH, in deciding to contract with Tradewind. Put in another way, I do not
                    think it is commercially realistic for a court to take the general position that
                    parties can only rely on what is actually contracted for. On the facts, the
                    venture was admittedly a significant one for the plaintiffs and that militates
                    against the reasonableness of their reliance on a mere representation. Against
                    that, however, there is the fact that representations came from RP, the son of
                    the patriarch in a family business who was himself holding a key position in the
                    business. This is fortified by the apparently free access that RP had to the Da
                    Vinci premises when he met Wendy, Dian, Evelyn and Neo. In the circumstances, I
                    think the plaintiffs quite reasonably treated RP’s personal involvement as
                    the best guarantee of Da Vinci’s involvement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    I therefore find that RP had the apparent
                    authority to represent to the plaintiffs that DVH was backing the Walking
                    Culture business, and that it was reasonable in all the circumstances for the
                    plaintiffs to rely on his apparent authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Collateral contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    The collateral contract argument can be
                    disposed of quite shortly. The evidence is clear that the plaintiffs knew that
                    they were dealing with Tradewind, and in fact Dian, Evelyn and Wendy had asked
                    RP why this was so. In the end it was clear to them that it was Tradewind they
                    were contracting with. It would be inconsistent with these facts to imply a
                    collateral contract between each of the plaintiffs and DVH.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    For all these reasons, I grant judgment in
                    favour of the plaintiffs against both RP and DVH, with damages to be assessed by
                    the Registrar, who will also decide on interest. The costs of the assessment are
                    also to be determined by the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    RP and DVH are jointly and severally liable
                    for all the plaintiffs’ costs in this action up to the date of my
                    judgment, to be agreed or taxed.</p>
