<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Facts</p></i>
<font face="CG Times (W1)" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">        G Ravichander returned to

his flat at Block 55 Lorong 5 Toa Payoh late in the evening of 1 April 2001. According to

his girlfriend, one Mahaletchimy d/o Pitchay Jaganathan, who lived with him, she refused

to open the door to let him into his own home as she felt afraid that he would pick a

fight with her. Evidently irritated at this, Ravichander began to scold her and shout at

her.</p>
<p align="justify">2        Ravichander broke the

window in an attempt to gain entry into his own house. He placed the broken glass shards

on the parapet of the fifth storey corridor. These pieces of glass fell five storeys onto

a car parked below, damaging its windscreen.</p>
<p align="justify">3        Police officers summoned to

the scene by Mahaletchimy arrived at approximately 11:35 p.m. that night. At first only

one officer attended to the dispute, but as he assessed the subject to be aggressive, he

called for back-up. They found Ravichander in the corridor outside his flat scolding and

shouting at Mahaletchimy. Ravichander’s left hand was bleeding, apparently sustained

whilst breaking the window. According to SSgt Loh Mun Chun, Mahaletchimy was inside the

unit crying. She appeared to be frightened. SSgt Loh and SSgt Mohd Hirwan also testified

that they had seen Ravichander pointing at Mahaletchimy and shouting "I will murder

you" in a loud and aggressive manner. He also said that even if he were to be

arrested and convicted, he would still murder Mahaletchimy after his release from prison.

When Ravichander ordered his girlfriend to strip so that she would not take any of his

things from his flat, she started to lift up her blouse but were stopped by the police

officers.</p>
<p align="justify">4        The three police officers

could not persuade Mahaletchimy to open the grill gate to let them in until they had taken

Ravichander away into custody.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The Charges</p></i>
<p align="justify">5        Two charges were levelled

against Ravichander. The first, DAC No. 54152/2001, read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, G Ravichander, male/35 years, NRIC No. S1761784B are charged that

  you, on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of April 2001, at or about 11.32 p.m., at the corridor

  outside unit #05-158, Blk 55 Lor 5 Toa Payoh, Singapore, did commit Criminal Intimidation

  by threatening one Mahaletchimy d/o Pitchay Jaganathan with death, by stating the words

  "I will murder you", intending thereby to cause alarm to the said Mahaletchimy

  d/o Pitchay Jaganathan and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section

  506 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">6        The second charge, MAC No.

11143/2001, read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, G Ravichander, male/35 years, NRIC No. S1761784B are charged that

  you on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of April 2001, at or about 11.32 p.m., at the 5<sup>th</sup>

  floor corridor of Blk 55 Lor 5 Toa Payoh, Singapore, did cause an act so rashly as to

  endanger human life and the personal safety of others when you placed broken glass

  fragments onto the parapet of the said corridor, causing them to fall to the ground

  thereby causing damage to a motorcar bearing registration number SCG 9408B and you have

  thereby committed an offence punishable under section 336 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7        Ravichander pleaded guilty

to MAC 11143/2001, but claimed trial to DAC No. 54152/2001 in the District Court. He was

found guilty of the second charge and was sentenced in respect of both offences to a term

of seven years’ corrective training. For MAC 11143/2001, he was also ordered to pay

$687.20 as compensation, in default of which he would have to serve three days’

imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">8        Before this Court,

Ravichander appealed against the conviction under the s 506 charge of aggravated criminal

intimidation, as well as against the sentence of corrective training. I dismissed both

appeals but in view of the specific circumstances of this case I decided to enhance the

term of corrective training to the maximum of 14 years. I now give my reasons for my

decision.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Appeal against Conviction</p></i>
<p align="justify">9        The main plank of the

appeal against conviction rested on Mahaletchimy’s denial, made in court, that

Ravichander had ever threatened to kill her, as well as Ravichander’s own testimony

that he had never said those words that constituted the charge against him. In effect, the

submission was that no threat had been uttered and therefore the offence of criminal

intimidation as defined in s 503 of the Penal Code could not be made out. Counsel argued

that the district judge was wrong in disregarding the totality of the evidence proffered

by the couple that totally exonerated Ravichander of the alleged offence. He also

submitted that the judge had placed too much weight on the testimonies of the police

officers even though they were directly contradicted by the victim and the accused. </p>
<p align="justify">10        I had no difficulty

whatsoever in dismissing that line of argument. In my opinion, the district judge was

correct in according little weight to both Ravichander’s as well as

Mahaletchimy’s evidence. On the other hand, </p></font>the police officers who testified

for the prosecution had absolutely no reason to lie under oath. There was also nothing

that could impugn the consistency in the evidence that they presented in Court and no

suggestion at all of any collusion between them. In fact, SSgt Loh, SSgt Mohd Hirwan as

well as Cpl Hirman were called to the scene as a result of a call by Mahaletchimy to the

police. Their testimonies was therefore worthy of the weight ascribed to them by the

district judge.<font face="CG Times (W1)" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">11        Ravichander had said in

court that he did not threaten the victim. He had accidentally cracked the glass window

while trying to open it to speak to Mahaletchimy who was hiding inside the flat. He had

spoken to the police officers but they had "hammered" him. Unfortunately,

Ravichander had failed to raise even this simple defence in his cautioned statements to

the police when faced with the two charges against him. Instead he chose to say nothing.

Furthermore, Ravichander could not shed any light as to why the police officers at the

scene that night would want to fabricate evidence against him.</p>
<p align="justify">12        As for Mahaletchimy, the

district judge had rightly noted that her sister was Ravichander’s bailor.

Mahaletchimy had spoken to Ravichander prior to the trial, and being his girlfriend and an

interested witness, her evidence was to be treated with caution. In my view, just because

a victim turns hostile on the stand and proffers evidence in favour of the accused person

cannot of itself prove the accused person’s innocence of the charge facing him. In

any case it is not unusual for victims or other prosecution witnesses to turn hostile in

court. They may do so for any of a number of reasons. For example, they may fear the

repercussions, real or imagined, of testifying against the accused, or they may have

changed their minds about pursuing justice through the criminal courts. Another

possibility could of course be that the accused is really innocent. The bottom line is

that the victim’s testimony is but a part of the totality of evidence that the trial

court must weigh in order to decide if the prosecution has proven its case beyond

reasonable doubt. </p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        Defence counsel’s

next point was to the effect that even if the threatening words "I will murder

you" were indeed uttered by Ravichander, the victim could not have apprehended those

words as a threat. According to Counsel, Mahaletchimy could only speak Tamil while the

offending phrase was said in English. Ravichander was also drunk at the time and anything

he might have said was said in the heat of a domestic spat that was aggravated by the

interference of the police officers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        I could not accept such an

argument. Apart from that bare assertion, made only at the appellate stage, there was no

evidence whatsoever that suggested that Mahaletchimy could not understand what Ravichander

was saying to her. The angry words were directed straight at her and I found it hard to

believe that Ravichander would have chosen to speak in a language that she could not

understand. The fact that the three police officers, namely SSgt Loh, SSgt Hirwan and Cpl

Hirman, could communicate with Mahaletchimy did seem to suggest that her linguistic skills

were not as limited as was suggested by Counsel. In any event, it was clear from

Ravichander’s aggressive behaviour that he had intended to alarm his victim. The

shouting, the vulgarities, and the attempt to break the window, coupled with the threat to

murder the victim, made audaciously in front of three law enforcers, shook the victim. In

fact, Mahaletchimy was so afraid that she even called the police to intervene.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        In the result, I dismissed

the appeal against conviction.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Appeal against Sentence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        Having failed to convince

this Court that the conviction under the s 506 charge was not sound, Counsel next embarked

on an attempt to persuade me that the term of seven years’ corrective training was,

in his words, a "crushing sentence". Whilst Ravichander may have a track record

of numerous previous convictions, he was not a recalcitrant as this was only his first

conviction for aggravated criminal intimidation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        I disagreed. In fact, I

felt that a seven year sentence of corrective training would be inadequate for a character

like Ravichander.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        The principal aim of

corrective training is, as the name suggests, to reform the prisoner who is sentenced to

undergo that regime. Under s 12(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Court must be

"satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of

crime that the offender should receive training of a corrective character for a

substantial period of time". In <i>Kua Hoon Chua v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9252&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 SLR 386</a> at 389, I

said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">... the principal aim of corrective training is to turn an offender

  away from the easy allure of crime by putting him through a regime of discipline and by

  providing him with certain work skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        In <i>PP v Wong Wing Hung</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49471&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 329</a> at 333, I also made the following remark:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… corrective training is only appropriate and suitable where the

    offender shows that he is capable of reform and can be corrected, so to speak, and

    prevented from committing further crime.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        That reform is the

motivation behind corrective training is underscored by rules 3 to 5 of the Criminal

Procedure (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Rules, which I lay out in full:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font face="CG Times (W1)"><p align="justify">Training in Changi Prison.</p>

</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        Ravichander is no stranger

to the criminal justice system. In April 1984, he was convicted of theft and jailed for a

month as he could not pay the $500 fine. In December that very same year, he was again

charged and convicted of theft, and fined $2000. In 1987, he was fined $1000 for mischief.

A year later, he served an eight-week default jail sentence for possession of drugs. On 12

Septermber 1989, Ravichander was tried and convicted for rioting with a deadly weapon and

sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. His victim died. This only got worse when he

was released as he was charged for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced

to seven-years’ imprisonment. His criminal record was peppered with a whole string of

drug consumption offences in 1993, 1995 and 1997 for which he received sentences ranging

from two months’ imprisonment plus fine, to 3 years’ imprisonment. In 1998,

Ravichander was convicted of disorderly behaviour and fined $500. He was also charged for

using indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words and behaviour against a public

servant and fined $1000. In September 1998 and June 2001, he was convicted of disorderly

behaviour and fined $1500 and sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment respectively.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        With such an illustrious

criminal career behind him, one might be forgiven if one had mistaken Ravichander as a

potential candidate for preventive detention. However, the district judge, having called

for a report from the Prison’s Department, formed the view that he was suitable for

corrective training instead. I saw no reason to disturb this finding. The question I asked

myself was whether the seven-year term was one that was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        It must be reiterated that

the sentencing frameworks for corrective training and normal imprisonment are different.

This is because the aims of each type of punishment as well as the actual conditions under

which they are carried out are not the same. As such, the factors to be considered in

determining the length of corrective training differ from those relevant for determining

sentences of imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        When determining what a

suitable sentence is for imprisonment, the Court is guided, amongst other things, by the

gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the prisoner, and any mitigating or aggravating

circumstances that may exist. Policy considerations may also play a role.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25        On the other hand, when

determining what a suitable term is for corrective training, the Court should keep in mind

that this form of punishment, though in substance very similar to imprisonment: see <i>R v

Mccarthy </i>[1955] 2 All ER 927, should not be treated as a lesser form of preventive

detention. Those undergoing corrective training must first be capable of reform, while

those sent in for preventive detention are hardened criminals. Sending hardened criminals

through the corrective training regime would not only dilute the programme’s aims but

also endanger the reformative path of more promising prisoners.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26        More importantly, when

sentencing a person to corrective training, normal sentencing principles such as the

gravity of the offence, tariffs, mitigating and aggravating factors, while still relevant,

do not take centre-stage. Rather, the critical factor to be considered is the amount of

time that the Court feels is required to enable real reform to be attempted. Lord Goddard

CJ’s comments in the case of <i>R v Barrett</i> [1949] 2 All ER 689 are instructive:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Since a person of 21 years or over who is in need of training …

  can no longer be sent to Borstal, it is a good thing, no doubt, to send him for corrective

  training. If his record shows that his tendency is to lead a criminal life, it is as well

  to make the sentence of corrective training of substantial length and to bear in mind that

  the usual remission will be granted if the prisoner behaves himself. In such cases, it is

  of little use giving a sentence of a length which will not enable real reform to be

  attempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27        Provided that the prisoner

is capable of reform, a longer period of corrective training might be imposed if his

antecedents reveal a more disturbing downward trend. On the other hand, if a prisoner only

has a few previous infractions which are not very serious, and which do not reveal a

dangerous frequency of recurrence, then a shorter period may be imposed since it might be

thought that this would suffice to reform him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28        In light of the

aforementioned considerations, and given the nature of Ravichander’s antecedents, I

was of the firm opinion that the seven-year term of corrective training was manifestly

inadequate to enable real reform to be attempted. As such, I substituted for it the

maximum term of 14 years corrective training.</p>
