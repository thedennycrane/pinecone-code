<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal, which arises from a lamentable
                    series of events, raises a number of novel and difficult issues, and underscores
                    the need (highlighted by Chan Sek Keong CJ at para 21 of His
                    Honour’s speech at the Opening of the Legal Year 2010) for greater clarity
                    with regard to the law of contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Decree Nisi and the order of court granting the Respondent sole
                custody of the sale of the matrimonial flat</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 11 June 2002, a Decree Nisi dissolving
                    the marriage of Mr Tan Boon Aik (“the Respondent”) and
                    Mdm Tan Beow Hiong (“the Appellant”) was granted by
                    District Judge (“DJ”) Emily Wilfred. The Decree Nisi
                    contained a consent order that the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]hall within 12 months from the date of the Decree Nisi Absolute sell
                        the matrimonial flat at Blk 712, Pasir Ris St 72, #10-47, Singapore 510712,
                        in the open market. Subject to refunding the parties’ CPF accounts for
                        monies used towards the purchase of the said flat together with the accrued
                        interest, payment of the outstanding mortgage over the said flat and payment
                        of all necessary costs and expenses in connection with the sale, the net
                        sale proceeds shall be divided equally between the [Respondent] and the
                        [Appellant]…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Decree Nisi was made absolute on
                    18 September 2002, and by the terms of the consent order, the matrimonial
                    flat ought to have been sold by 18 September 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       However, this was not done. The Respondent in
                    his affidavit dated 28 June 2006 alleged that this was due to inaction
                    and/or obstruction by the Appellant. Consequently, the Respondent applied for,
                    and on 20 July 2006 was granted, an Order of Court (the
                    “20 July Order of Court”) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The [Respondent] to have sole conduct of the sale
                            of the matrimonial flat at Blk 712 Paris Ris Street 72 #10-47, Singapore
                            510712.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The Registrar of the Subordinate Courts be
                            authorised to execute, sign, seal and deliver the Option to Purchase,
                            Transfer, or any deeds, instruments, and documents as required by the
                            Housing and Development Board on behalf of the [Appellant] as joint
                            tenant in connection with the sale of the said matrimonial
                        flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The order of court dated 5 March 2009 ordering the Appellant to
                move out of the matrimonial flat within 5 months</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Despite the 20 July Order of Court granting
                    the Respondent sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial flat and empowering
                    the Registrar to execute the necessary documents on the Appellant’s
                    behalf, the matrimonial flat remained unsold and occupied by the Appellant. The
                    Respondent therefore applied on 23 September 2008 (in SUM No 650368 of
                    2008) for an order that the Appellant be compelled to move out of the
                    matrimonial flat within eight weeks thereof. In his affidavit of even date in
                    support of his application, the Respondent alleged that this was again due to
                    the Appellant’s irrational refusal to cooperate with his conveyancing
                    solicitors and/or property agents. In her affidavit dated 11 December 2008,
                    the Appellant did not satisfactorily explain her continued failure to comply
                    with the Decree Nisi and/or the 20 July Order of Court. In the
                    circumstances, it was unsurprising that, on hearing the Respondent’s
                    application, DJ Low Wee Ping made an order on 5 March 2009 (the
                    “5 March Order of Court”) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Appellant] move out of the matrimonial flat at Blk 712 Pasir Ris
                        Street 72 #10-47, Singapore 510712, within 5 months from the date of
                        this Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant was therefore obliged to move out
                    of the matrimonial flat by 5 August 2009. It should be noted that in
                    para 27 of her affidavit dated 11 December 2008, the Appellant had
                    requested for a period of “six months” in which to vacate the
                    matrimonial flat, and that the deadline of 5 August 2009 was therefore
                    either generous (since the Appellant was herself only asking for a deadline of
                    six months from the date of her affidavit, <em>ie</em>
                    11 May 2009) or reasonable (since the Appellant was given five months to
                    move out of the matrimonial flat when she had requested for six
                months).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events from 5 March 2009 to 4 January 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Despite the lapse of the deadline of
                    5 August 2009, the Appellant remained in occupation of the matrimonial
                    flat. On 16 August 2009, however, and notwithstanding that sole custody of
                    the sale of the matrimonial flat had been granted to the Respondent, the
                    Appellant (represented by one Ms Winnie Tan (aka Mah Hwee Khoon))
                    negotiated for the sale of the matrimonial flat to a pair of buyers represented
                    by one Mr Fabian Leong (“Mr Leong”) (Ms Winnie Tan
                    and Mr Leong are collectively referred to as “the agents”).
                    Mr Leong, in his affidavit dated 6 January 2010, alleged that the
                    Appellant had verbally assured him that she would be willing to move out of the
                    matrimonial flat 30 days prior to completion of the sale, which, according
                    to Mr Leong’s affidavit, was originally estimated to be sometime in
                    mid-December 2009. According to paras 9 and 13 of Mr Leong’s
                    affidavit, the Appellant had repeatedly assured him that she would move out of
                    the matrimonial flat by 31 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It seems that the Respondent did not object to
                    the Appellant having conduct of the sale, notwithstanding the 20 July Order
                    of Court granting him sole custody, as well as the 5 March Order of Court
                    requiring the Appellant to move out by 5 August 2009, because it appeared
                    to him that the Appellant was finally cooperating, and so as to avoid further
                    acrimony between the parties which might otherwise have jeopardised the sale
                    process. The Respondent’s conduct in this respect cannot be criticised
                    though it was possible that the Appellant may have been led to believe, through
                    the Respondent’s repeated indulgences that deadlines for compliance with
                    court orders would not be strictly enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Inexplicably, however, in October 2009, the
                    Appellant refused to execute the option to purchase, but instead demanded that
                    the Respondent’s solicitors apply to court to have the Registrar execute
                    all conveyancing documents on her behalf in accordance with the 20 July
                    Order of Court. Although this was done in November 2009, the Appellant informed
                    Mr Leong (on 11 December 2009) that she would only move out of the
                    matrimonial flat after completion of the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This was unacceptable to both the Respondent
                    and the buyers, but efforts to persuade the Appellant to leave the matrimonial
                    flat by Ms Winnie Tan proved futile. On 30 December 2009, the
                    Respondent’s solicitors wrote to the Appellant informing her that they
                    would be taking possession of the matrimonial flat on 4 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 4 January 2010, the Respondent’s
                    solicitors, together with Mr Leong, attempted to take possession of the
                    matrimonial flat, but were met with strident resistance from the Appellant, who
                    allegedly said that she would not leave unless an order of committal had been
                    issued against her (para 25 of the affidavit of Eu Hai Meng dated
                    6 January 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The order for committal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Perhaps understandably, on 6 January
                    2010, the Respondent made an <em>ex parte</em>
                    application (SUM No 650001 of 2010) for leave to apply for an order of
                    committal of the Appellant for contempt of the 5 March Order of Court.
                    Leave having been granted the same day by the Deputy Registrar, the
                    necessary documents were served on the Appellant on 7 January 2010, and
                    after two rounds of pre-trial conferences, the application for the committal
                    order was eventually heard by DJ Sowaran Singh on 1 March
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the hearing, the Appellant gave evidence
                    that she did not move out within the five months as directed by the 5 March
                    Order of Court because she understood that since the completion for the sale of
                    the matrimonial flat was only to take place on 1April 2010, she need not move
                    out prior to that date. She further added that based on the completion date of
                    1 April 2010, she had secured a rental flat commencing on 1 April 2010
                    and that she would move out by then. Under cross-examination, Respondent’s
                    counsel informed her that the buyers were not agreeable to give her more time
                    beyond 8 or 9 March 2010 (<em>ie</em> a week from the
                    hearing). As legal completion was scheduled to take place on 1 April 2010,
                    it was not entirely clear to me on what basis could the buyers have required the
                    sellers, including the Appellant, to provide vacant possession any time prior to
                    1 April 2010. It later emerged from her cross-examination that, although
                    the buyers were originally not prepared to let the Appellant move out later than
                    8 or 9 March 2010, the Appellant was eventually able to persuade them to
                    allow her to move out by noon on 14 March 2010. It should be noted that
                    this date was, therefore, not imposed on the Appellant by DJ Sowaran Singh;
                    rather, it was a date which was mutually agreed, as the transcript
                    revealed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    The buyer has told us that he is not prepared to
                            give you more than a week to move out. Can you move out in a
                            week’s time?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    
              <em>Can I request for two
                                weeks?</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    The buyer cannot do so because he is staying with
                            his in-laws. So can you move out by 8 or 9 March
                        2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    
              <em>I am more confident in finding a
                                place in two weeks by 14 March 2010</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">P/C:  The buyer is agreeable provided she moves out by
                            noon on 14 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Will you move out by noon on 14 March
                            2010?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    
              <em>Yes. Thank
                            you</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     At the conclusion of the hearing,
                    DJ Sowaran Singh held that the Appellant was guilty of contempt for
                    disobeying the 5 March Order of Court by failing to move out of the
                    matrimonial flat within five months of the date of the court order, and
                    committed her to 30 days imprisonment for her contempt (“the Committal
                    Order”). However, DJ Sowaran Singh ordered that her sentence was not
                    to be executed if the Appellant moved out of the matrimonial flat by noon on
                    14 March 2010. Service of the Committal Order was dispensed with since the
                    Appellant was present and had full notice of the contents of the order, and the
                    Appellant was ordered to pay the Respondent’s costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     During the further hearing before me on
                    26 July 2010, I sought clarification from the parties as regards this
                    apparent “right” of the buyers to vacant possession prior to the
                    completion date of 1 April 2010. The Appellant informed me that when she
                    entered into the agreement to sell the matrimonial flat to the buyers on or
                    about 16 August 2009, she had also agreed out of goodwill, at the request
                    of the buyers, to hand over the matrimonial flat 30 days prior to the completion
                    date. However, on or about 11 December 2009, the Appellant withdrew the
                    goodwill offer because the buyers did not release the balance option fee of
                    $1,500 to her within the stipulated date. The Appellant informed the buyers
                    through the agents of this withdrawal and that vacant possession would instead
                    be handed over on the completion date. The buyers did not respond to the
                    Appellant’s withdrawal. Although the balance option fee was eventually
                    released to the Appellant, there was no subsequent agreement by the Appellant to
                    restore her goodwill offer for early possession. Counsel for the Respondent did
                    not dispute the Appellant’s explanation and in fact accepted that the
                    buyers had no contractual right <em>vis-a-vis</em> the
                    Appellant to vacant possession prior to 1 April 2010. This is a finding of
                    some significance because if DJ Sowaran Singh had been informed that the
                    buyers had no such right to early possession, he might have been minded to
                    accede to the Appellant’s request to vacate closer to the completion
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to the Appellant’s affidavit
                    dated 14 June 2010, she undertook several steps to appeal against the
                    Committal Order from 3 March 2010 onwards, and an appeal was eventually
                    filed by her on 12 March 2010, essentially seeking that DJ Sowaran
                    Singh’s Committal Order be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Unfortunately, the Appellant was apparently
                    under the mistaken impression that an appeal operated automatically as a stay of
                    execution, and therefore did not move out of the matrimonial flat by
                    14 March 2010 (although in her affidavit of 14 June 2010 she alleged
                    that she was making efforts to move out expeditiously).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Consequently, on 15 March 2010, the
                    Appellant was committed to prison for 30 days. Although the Appellant has served
                    her term of imprisonment (commuted to 18 days from 15 March to 3 April
                    2010) for her contempt, she nonetheless pressed ahead with her appeal, a course
                    of action which has raised a number of interesting issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     During the hearing before me on 26 May
                    2010, I informed the parties that given the important issues which this appeal
                    has raised and the fact that the Appellant was not represented by counsel, I
                    decided, in the interest of the fair administration of justice, to appoint an
                        <em>amicus curiae</em> to assist the court.
                    Ms Kristy Tan (“Ms Tan”) was thereafter appointed as
                        <em>amicus curiae</em> by letter dated 7 June 2010
                    and was invited to address the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     In contempt proceedings, whether the
                        Court has the power to quash an order for committal and its sentence when
                        the contemnor has already served the sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the Court has such powers in (a), what
                        factors would affect the Court’s decision in the exercise of its power
                        to quash the order for committal and sentence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     On the facts of the present appeal,
                        assuming that the Appellant genuinely believed that the filing of the appeal
                        operated as a stay of the Committal Order, whether that would be a
                        sufficient ground to quash the Committal Order and sentence, and whether,
                        given the quasi-criminal nature of committal proceedings, ignorance of the
                        law would displace the <em>mens rea</em> element
                        required for contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a corollary to issue
                    (b) above, it is relevant to consider whether, on the facts of the present
                    appeal, any of the factors identified in (b) are present to justify quashing the
                    conviction and sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In essence, I was asking Ms Tan to
                    elucidate the court’s power to quash an order for committal and/or the
                    resulting warrant for committal. After carefully considering the above issues, I
                    have decided to quash the warrant for committal issued pursuant to the Committal
                    Order as well as set aside the 30-day sentence that had been activated by the
                    warrant for committal. For the avoidance of doubt, in this judgment, I use the
                    terms “quash” or “set aside” to mean annul and void
                        <em>ab initio</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is appropriate, however, to preface the
                    reasons for my decision, and the examination of the above issues, with some
                    preliminary observations on the law in respect of contempt of court in
                    general.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary Observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     According to Hale LJ in <em>Griffin v Griffin</em> [2000] 2 FLR 44 (at 48) (see also
                    para 21 of Chan CJ’s speech at the Opening of the Legal Year
                    2010):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The power to commit to prison for contempt of court is a common-law power
                        which has never been fully regulated by statute or even by rules of
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, although the jurisdiction of the courts in Singapore to
                    punish for contempt of court is statutorily embodied (see s 8 of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCA”)
                    and s 7 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev
                    Ed) (“SCJA”)) and regulated (see O 45 and O 52 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”)), the solutions to most of the novel issues in this appeal are to
                    be found in the common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is, at common law, a distinction
                    conventionally drawn between criminal and civil contempt of court: see
                    Sir David Eady and Professor A T H Smith, <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith on Contempt</em> (London: Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2005) (“<em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith</em>”), Chapter 3, as
                    well as Nigel Lowe and Brenda Sufrin, <em>Borrie &amp; Lowe: The
                        Law of Contempt</em> (London: Butterworths,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 1996) (“<em>The Law of Contempt</em>”), at pp 655–664. Although
                    the distinction is sometimes criticised (<em>Arlidge, Eady &amp;
                        Smith</em> at paras 3-47 – 3-54 and <em>The
                        Law of Contempt</em>, <em>supra</em>), it is
                    fairly clear that breach of a coercive (<em>ie</em>
                    prohibitory or mandatory) court order or judgment is a civil contempt (see the
                    speech of Lord Oliver in <em>Attorney General v Times
                        Newspapers Ltd</em> [1992] 1 AC 191 at 217), and does not amount
                    to a criminal offence. As Lord Atkinson noted in <em>Scott v
                        Scott</em> [1913] AC 417 (at 456):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... if a person be expressly enjoined by injunction, a most solemn and
                        authoritative form of order, from doing a particular thing, and he
                        deliberately, in breach of that injunction, does that thing, he is not
                        guilty of any crime whatever, but only of a civil contempt of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Notwithstanding this, however, perhaps because
                    of the penal sanctions which may follow a finding of contempt, civil contempt
                    has occasionally been described as a “common law misdemeanour”:
                    see <em>eg</em> per Lawton LJ in <em>Linnett v Coles</em> [1987] 1 QB 555 at 561 and
                    Cumming-Bruce LJ in <em>Lee v Walker</em> [1985]
                    1 QB 1191 at 1201. However, this usage has been criticised (see <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith</em> at paras 3-82 –
                    3-84), and the better view is that, as <em>The Law of
                        Contempt</em> states at p 662:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[C]riminal contempt is, for all its peculiarities, a crime, whereas a
                        civil contempt despite its criminal characteristics is not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Nonetheless, it is still correct to observe
                    that civil contempt has criminal overtones, not least because a contemnor is
                    liable to be imprisoned, and it is therefore often said that civil contempt
                    “partakes of a criminal nature” (per Lord Denning MR in
                        <em>Comet Products UK Ltd v Hawkex Plastics Ltd</em>
                    [1971] 2 QB 67 (“<em>Comet
                    Products</em>”) at 73 (see also <em>Re Bramblevale Ltd</em> [1969] 3 WLR 699 at 704)) or is
                    “quasi-criminal” (per Cross LJ in <em>Comet
                        Products</em> at 77 and Oliver LJ in <em>Lamb v
                        Lamb</em> [1984] FLR 278 at 281). As a result, a number of
                    safeguards must be observed before a litigant is visited with the drastic and
                    punitive consequences attendant on a finding of contempt (see generally
                        <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp; Smith</em> at paras 12-15
                    – 12-65):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     Committal proceedings are a measure
                        of last resort (<em>P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore
                            Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 582 at [5]), especially in
                        family and matrimonial matters (<em>Danchevsky v
                            Danchevsky</em> [1975] Fam 17 at 22 (“<em>Danchevsky</em>”) (per Lord Denning MR) and
                            <em>Ansah v Ansah</em> [1977] Fam 138 at 144
                        (per Ormrod LJ)) (see further <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>
                        to <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> below);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     Contempt must be proved on the
                        criminal standard, <em>ie</em> beyond a reasonable
                        doubt: <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC
                            and others</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Pertamina Energy</em>”) at [31] to
                    [35];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The alleged
                        contemnor must be given the right to be properly heard, which normally
                        entails a strict adherence to the procedural rules, <em>eg</em> the prescriptions as to the form of an order for
                        committal set out in O 52, rr 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court (see
                        generally Chapter 15 of <em>Arlidge, Eady &amp;
                            Smith</em>), although the approach of the English courts in this
                        respect has changed somewhat (see <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>
                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With these preliminary matters settled, I will
                    now deal with the issues pertinent to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Court has the Power to Quash an Order for Committal and
                its Sentence when the Contemnor has Already Served the Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     One of the Appellant’s reasons for
                    appealing against the Committal Order is that the imprisonment term, if not
                    expunged, would leave her with a criminal record and affect her future
                    employability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Given that civil contempt is not a crime, it
                    follows that the Appellant is not a criminal, and she therefore cannot be
                    entered on the Register of Criminals under the Registration of Criminals Act
                    (Cap 268, 1985 Rev Ed) (“ROCA”). Section 4 of the
                    ROCA mandates that the Registrar of Criminals shall keep a register of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, persons convicted of any crime in
                    Singapore, and s 2 of the ROCA states that a “crime” is
                    “any offence included for the time being in the First or Second
                    Schedule”. In neither Schedule, however, is there a reference to s 8
                    of the SCA or s 7 of the SCJA, or to contempt more generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It would seem, therefore, that even if the
                    Appellant’s appeal is successful, there is no criminal record to expunge.
                    In the circumstances, it might appropriately be asked whether the court has the
                    power to hear and adjudicate an appeal which appears to be moot, <em>ie</em> where the sentence has already been served or
                    judgment already executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In principle, an order for committal is an
                    order of court, and is in that respect similar to any other judgment or order of
                    court. An order for committal can therefore be stayed, appealed, varied or set
                    aside like any other order of court (except those which legislation has decreed
                    to be non-appealable), and there is no principle on which it can be said that an
                    appellate court either lacks jurisdiction, or should decline the jurisdiction it
                    otherwise has, to hear and adjudicate an appeal from a judgment or order which
                    has already been executed. It is true that, when an appellant applies to stay
                    execution of a judgment pending the hearing of an appeal, the court hearing the
                    application will often ask itself whether, if a stay is not granted, the appeal
                    would be rendered nugatory: <em>Lee Sian Hee (trading as Lee Sian
                        Hee Pork Trader) v Oh Kheng Soon (trading as Ban Hon Trading
                        Enterprise)</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 869 at [5]. This does not mean,
                    however, that if a stay is not granted, with the consequence that the lower
                    court’s judgment is executed and an appeal is therefore nugatory, an
                    appellate court will refuse to hear the appellant or refuse to overturn the
                    lower court’s judgment (if there are grounds on which to do so). The
                    question of the effectiveness of an appeal is an inquiry relevant to determine
                    whether a stay should be granted pending appeal, and not whether the appeal
                    should be allowed to proceed. A disappointed litigant is entitled to have an
                    appellate court hear his appeal, and to have his rights vindicated on appeal,
                    even if it may only result in a “paper” judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     If this is the case in ordinary civil
                    proceedings, there is no real basis for adopting a different approach in
                    contempt proceedings, where, due to the fact that a person’s liberty and
                    reputation are at stake, it should be even more imperative that an appellate
                    court hear, and rule on, an appeal, even if the alleged contemnor has already
                    served the sentence imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I am fortified in my conclusion by the fact
                    that this was also the view arrived at by Ms Tan. Although her research did
                    not reveal any local decision on point, she helpfully referred me to various
                    provisions of the SCJA as well as a number of English authorities to support her
                    view that the court does have the jurisdiction to quash an order for committal
                    and a sentence thereunder notwithstanding service of the sentence by the
                    contemnor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     First, Ms Tan relied on ss 20, 22
                    and 37 of the SCJA which read, <em>inter alia</em>, as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">From these provisions, it is clear that the High Court, when hearing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Next, Ms Tan referred to several English
                    cases which throw some light on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Lamb v Lamb</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), the respondent wife was
                    granted, <em>inter alia</em>, an order ousting the
                    appellant husband from the matrimonial home and restraining him from removing or
                    destroying its contents. The husband removed some items from the matrimonial
                    home and damaged others before he left. The wife applied for an order for
                    committal for breach of the order, and the court hearing the application decided
                    to dispense with notice to the husband and dealt with the matter <em>ex parte</em>, ordering the husband to be committed to prison
                    for 14 days (“the first order”). The husband appealed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, against the first order, and by
                    the time of the hearing of the appeal, the 14 days had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Oliver LJ commented (at 280–281)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the first order, [counsel for the husband] takes three points.
                        I should say straightaway that, as regards the first order, these points are
                        to a large extent academic because, in fact, the [husband] remains to this
                        day in prison and the period of 14 days has in fact expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nonetheless, the English Court of Appeal went on to hear, consider and
                    adjudicate upon the appeal (albeit the husband’s appeal against the first
                    order was dismissed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Islamic Investment
                        Company of the Gulf (Bahamas) Ltd v Symphony Gems NV &amp; others</em>
                    [2008] EWCA Civ 389 (“<em>Symphony
                    Gems</em>”), the English Court of Appeal was dealing with a
                    suspended order for committal for 28 days made by Bean J on 31 January 2008
                    against a judgment debtor (“Mr Mehta”) who had failed to
                    attend an examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) ordered on
                    16 January 2007 and scheduled for 31 January 2008. Bean J’s
                    order was suspended on condition that Mr Mehta attend a re-scheduled hearing for
                    the EJD on 11 March 2008, in which case the suspended committal order would
                    be automatically discharged. Although it was not disputed that Mr Mehta had
                    been in contempt of court for failing to attend the 31 January 2008 EJD,
                    Mr Mehta appealed to set aside the suspended committal order, on the basis
                    that, the evidence before the court could not have been satisfied beyond a
                    reasonable doubt that Mr Mehta had been in such contumacious contempt as to
                    justify an order for committal, suspended or otherwise. As it turned out,
                    Mr Mehta did attend the EJD on 11 March 2008, and the suspended
                    committal order would therefore have been discharged, rendering
                    Mr Mehta’s appeal somewhat unnecessary. Nonetheless, after noting
                    that Mr Mehta had complied with the suspended order for committal by being
                    present for the rescheduled EJD on 11 March 2008, Rix LJ commented at
                    [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So, automatically, under the terms of the order, the suspended order for
                        committal falls to be discharged, and that is common ground – so much
                        so that, on behalf of the respondents, Mr Anthony Trace QC submits
                        that this appeal (Mr Mehta’s appeal from the order of
                        Bean J) is entirely academic and unnecessary. He nevertheless was
                        inclined, at the beginning of this hearing, to accept the suggestion from my
                        Lord, Tuckey LJ, that it was not as academic as all that, because
                            <em>if, as Mr Mehta submits, the (albeit suspended)
                            order for committal should never have been made in the first place then
                            Mr Mehta is entitled to have this court say that</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     By analogy, on the facts of the present
                    appeal, if, as submitted by the Appellant, the order for committal should never
                    have been made in the first place then the Appellant is entitled to have this
                    court say that, notwithstanding that she has already served the sentence
                    imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Indeed, the English Court of Appeal went on to
                    hold that the evidence before Bean J did not establish, to the criminal
                    standard of proof, that Mr Mehta’s conduct had been so contumacious
                    as to justify an order for committal, and Rix LJ concluded (at
                    [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In these circumstances it seems to me that it is not simply a matter of
                        Bean J’s order being discharged – that, as I say, is common
                        ground – but I think it follows that, [for] the reasons which I have
                        stated in this judgment, … this appeal should be allowed, so that the
                        order should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Another example is to be found in <em>Linnett v Coles</em> (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above), where the defendant had on numerous occasions
                    failed to obey orders made by the High Court to produce certain documents. For
                    his contempt, the defendant was committed to prison “until further
                    order”. After serving eight days in prison, the defendant was released on
                    bail, and thereafter complied with the order to produce the documents, and
                    apologised to the court. At the same time, he lodged an appeal contending that
                    the committal order was unlawful, as it purported to imprison him for an
                    indefinite period, contrary to the maximum two-year period set by s 14(1)
                    of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 (c 49) (UK).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    committal order was indeed unlawful, and concluded that s 13(3) of the
                    Administration of Justice Act 1960 (c 65) (UK) (“the AJA
                    1960”), on its proper construction, gave the English Court of Appeal
                    jurisdiction to remedy an irregularity in the making or form of a committal
                    order which had been executed (such as by substituting a new sentence), if
                    justice so required. More will be said on this aspect of the case later (see
                        <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> to <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> below), but for present purposes the important point was
                    that the English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the
                    defendant’s sentence (without substituting another sentence).
                    Lawton LJ held (at 562):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anyone accused of contempt of court is on trial for that misdemeanour and
                        is entitled to a fair trial. <em>If he does not get a fair
                            trial because of the way the judge has behaved or because of material
                            irregularities in the proceedings themselves, then there has been a
                            mistrial, which is no trial at all. In such cases</em>, in my
                        judgment, <em>an unlawful sentence cannot stand and must be
                            quashed</em>. It will depend on the facts of each case whether
                        justice requires a new one to be substituted. If there has been no
                        unfairness or no material irregularity in the proceedings and nothing more
                        than an irregularity in drawing up the committal order has occurred, I can
                        see no reason why the irregularity should not be put right and the sentence
                        varied, if necessary, so as to make it a just one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     
          <em>Linnett v Coles</em>
                    does not provide a complete parallel to the present appeal, as the defendant had
                    only partially served his (indefinite) sentence, whereas here the Appellant has
                    fully served her sentence. Nonetheless, there is no indication (especially not
                    in the speech of Lawton LJ quoted above) that the English Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Linnett v Coles</em> would have felt itself
                    constrained in quashing an unlawful sentence, simply because that sentence had
                    been fully served. Ms Tan highlighted to my attention that the statutory
                    provision (<em>viz</em> s 13 of the AJA 1960) which
                    was relied on in <em>Linnett v Coles</em> is in very
                    similar terms to s 37(5) of the SCJA (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In light of the provisions of the SCJA and the
                    English cases referred to above, I am satisfied that I have the power to hear
                    and adjudicate the Appellant’s appeal, and, if necessary, quash the
                    Committal Order and the Appellant’s sentence, notwithstanding that she has
                    already served it. Counsel for the Respondent fairly submitted, after
                    considering Ms Tan’s submissions, that the High Court is indeed
                    vested with such a power.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What Factors Would Affect the Court’s Decision to Quash the
                Committal Order and Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Contempt has to be proven beyond a reasonable
                    doubt on established legal principles, and once contempt is proved, the court
                    has a discretion as to sentence – whether an order for committal should be
                    made (instead of a fine or a reprimand), and if so, how long the committal
                    period should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The grounds for appellate intervention where
                    the lower court has erred in applying legal rules to the facts before it
                        (<em>ie</em> where it has no discretion, such as making
                    a finding of contempt) are well-known: an appellate court will intervene where
                    the lower court has misdirected itself as to the law, or where the lower court
                    has made findings of fact which are plainly wrong or against the weight of the
                    evidence (see generally Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice 2009</em> (Singapore: LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>”), at
                    paras 57/1/12–57/1/14). Where a lower court has made a decision in
                    the exercise of judicial discretion, <em>eg</em> the
                    sentence to be imposed in respect of a proven contempt, an appellate court will
                    not intervene unless (<em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> at para 57/1/15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is clearly wrong, as when the judge was mistaken in law or
                        disregarded or misapplied a significant principle or failed to appreciate
                        the true facts or took into account irrelevant considerations or exceeded
                        the discretion vested in him or failed to exercise any discretion at
                        all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     These traditional grounds for appellate
                    intervention have also been applied to reverse findings of contempt (see
                        <em>Re Bramblevale Ltd</em> (<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), where a finding of contempt was overturned because
                    contempt could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt), as well as to set aside
                    or vary committal orders (see <em>Banton v Banton</em>
                    [1990] 2 FLR 465, where a committal order was set aside as the lower court
                    had not appreciated that it had a discretion as to sentence).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether a Genuine Belief that the Filing of an Appeal Operated as a
                Stay of Execution Would be a Sufficient Ground to Quash the Committal Order and
                Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is well-settled that the <em>mens rea</em> necessary to establish a finding of civil contempt is
                    set at a low threshold: the contemnor need only intend to do acts which put him
                    in breach of a coercive court order; it need not be shown that he had the
                    specific intention of disobeying the court order. The contemnor’s motive
                    in doing the acts which breached the court order is irrelevant to the question
                    of liability, and is only relevant to the question of mitigation. This was
                    confirmed beyond doubt by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Pertamina Energy</em> (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>
                    above) at [51] to [62], where it endorsed the voluminous case law supporting
                    such an approach, and commented (at [51]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party
                        alleged to be in breach of the court order was intentional and that it knew
                        of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order (including,
                        of course, knowledge of the existence of the order and of all of its
                        material terms (see the English High Court decision of Re L (A Ward) [1988]
                        1 FLR 255 at 259)). However, <em>it is unnecessary to
                            prove that that party appreciated that it was breaching the
                            order</em>. As Sachs LJ put it in the English Court of Appeal
                        decision of Knight v Clifton <em>[1971] Ch 700 at 721,
                            “[t]he</em> prohibition is absolute and is not to be
                        related to intent unless otherwise stated on the face of the
                        order.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On the facts of this appeal, therefore, it is
                    irrelevant that the Appellant did not appreciate that an appeal did not operate
                    as a stay of execution of the Committal Order: her conduct in intentionally
                    remaining in the matrimonial flat after 14 March 2010 was, to paraphrase
                    the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <em>Pertamina
                        Energy</em> quoted above, in breach of the Committal Order, and she
                    knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach (including knowledge of
                    the existence of the Committal Order and of all of its material terms). In this
                    respect, it was common ground between Ms Tan and the Respondent’s
                    counsel that the Appellant’s belief that the appeal operated as a stay of
                    the Committal Order was irrelevant to the issue of <em>mens
                        rea</em> and in any event cannot displace the <em>mens
                        rea</em> element required for contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, I agree with Ms Tan that the
                    Appellant’s belief that the appeal operated as a stay of the Committal
                    Order could be relevant to the question of mitigation for the purpose of
                    determining the appropriate sentence/punishment. In my view, it is equally
                    relevant to the exercise of discretion to grant additional time for compliance
                    with a court order (a point addressed in further detail at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> below). At its highest, however, the
                    Appellant’s mistaken belief could only justify varying or quashing the
                        <em>sentence</em> of 30 days’ imprisonment, and
                    not the Committal Order itself. Setting aside the <em>Committal
                        Order</em> (which would also mean setting aside the sentence) would
                    require something more, <em>ie</em> an inquiry as to
                    whether there were any other factors which would justify an appellate
                    court’s intervention, which may be sub-divided into a number of
                    questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether DJ Sowaran Singh had
                        correctly found that the Appellant’s civil contempt had been proved
                        beyond a reasonable doubt;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether, having so found, DJ Sowaran Singh was
                        correct in granting the Committal Order (suspended or otherwise);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the
                        (suspended) Committal Order ought to be quashed for any other
                        reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Any Other Factors Justify Quashing the Committal Order and
                Sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether contempt had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There can be no doubt that the Appellant was
                    clearly in contempt of the 5 March Order of Court , which was, as
                    DJ Sowaran Singh observed at [11] of his Grounds of Decision
                    (“GD”), clear and unambiguous in requiring the Appellant to move
                    out of the matrimonial flat by 5 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Appellant had ample time to move out, but,
                    for reasons best known to her, considered that the 5 March Order of Court
                    was simply a means by which she could embarrass the Respondent. In her own words
                    (at para 17 of her affidavit dated 26 January 2010):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I did not mean to defy the Court Order of 5 March 2009 that I move
                        out within five months. It is just that <em>I wanted to prove
                            the [Respondent] wrong by marketing and selling the flat just eleven
                            days later (16 August 2009) and at a reasonable
                        price</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, the deadline of 5 August 2009
                    was not something which the Appellant could, at her option, disregard. A breach
                    of the 5 March Order of Court had plainly been committed when the Appellant
                    chose, quite freely and deliberately, not to vacate the matrimonial flat by
                    5 August 2009. There is no such thing as “one free breach” of
                    an order of court (see <em>Jordan v Jordan</em> [1993]
                    1 FLR 169 at 172 (per Lord Donaldson MR)), and given that the
                    Appellant’s motive in failing to obey the order to move out was irrelevant
                    to the question of her liability in contempt, DJ Sowaran Singh was amply
                    justified in finding the Appellant’s contempt was proved beyond a
                    reasonable doubt. This was also the view arrived at by Ms Tan which,
                    unsurprisingly, was accepted by the Respondent’s counsel. However,
                    Ms Tan rightly pointed out that different considerations need to be
                    examined (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> below) in determining
                    whether the Appellant was in breach of the Committal Order for her failure to
                    vacate the matrimonial flat by noon on 14 March 2010.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rules of Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Order 45 r 5(1) of the Rules of
                    Court prescribes:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is clear that in the present case, the
                    Appellant was “required by a judgment or order to do an act within a time
                    specified in the judgment or order”, <em>viz</em> to
                    move out of the matrimonial flat by 5 August 2009, and that she had
                    “refuse[d] or neglect[ed] to do it within that
                time”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Committal is not the natural consequence of a finding of
                contempt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Nonetheless, as <em>Arlidge,
                        Eady &amp; Smith</em> points out at para 12-30:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even where a contempt is proved, it should never be assumed that committal
                        is the natural consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In <em>Smith v Smith</em>
                    [1988] 1 FLR 179, the plaintiff obtained a non-molestation order against
                    the defendant when their relationship ended. Subsequently, the plaintiff applied
                    to commit the defendant for breach of the order, alleging that the defendant had
                    come to her residence, drunkenly looked through the window and waved some papers
                    at her. At the hearing of the application, the defendant admitted being in
                    breach of the order but explained that he was only delivering a letter addressed
                    to the plaintiff. The recorder hearing the application considered the
                    defendant’s reason a “transparent excuse”, and ruled that
                    “the normal punishment will be committal”, before committing the
                    defendant to prison for 28 days. On appeal, Sir John Donaldson MR said (at
                    181):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is quite clear to my mind that if somebody is accused of a contempt of
                        court by breach of an order that must be proved. That was proved in this
                        case. However, the recorder was in error, if this is what he meant, when he
                        seemed to assume that a breach of an order or of an undertaking
                        automatically or normally leads to imprisonment. It is quite correct that
                        the orders of the court must and will be maintained. But there is nothing
                        automatic about committal to prison. It depends upon all the
                        circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same case, Balcombe LJ said (at 182):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The recorder said that it must be clearly understood that the normal
                        punishment for a contempt of court will be committal. The court’s
                        powers to deal with breaches of orders or undertakings given to the court
                        are much wider than that. In the lowest degree it can merely adjourn the
                        application for committal to see what happens. It can make a suspended
                        committal order. It can, in appropriate cases, impose a financial penalty.
                        Further, of course, the length of the sentence, if it is considered
                        appropriate to commit the contemnor to prison, must, as Sir John Donaldson
                        MR says, vary according to the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Committal as the last resort in family proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It has also been said (per Ormrod LJ in
                        <em>Ansah v Ansah</em> (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) at 144) that “[c]ommittal orders are remedies
                    of last resort; in family cases they should be the very last resort”. In
                        <em>Danchevsky</em> (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), resort to committal proceedings was deprecated by
                    the English Court of Appeal on facts which were similar to this case: a county
                    court made an order for the sale of a house (the former matrimonial home of the
                    parties) in which the husband had continued to live after the dissolution of the
                    marriage. The wife had left the house, but the husband would neither leave the
                    house nor let it be sold. On 15 May 1974, the county court ordered the
                    husband to give up possession of the house to the wife or her solicitors by noon
                    on 12 June 1974 and to cooperate in its sale, but the husband disobeyed the
                    order. On the wife’s application to commit the husband to prison, he
                    refused to give an undertaking to the court to vacate the house within three
                    days, on the grounds that the house could be divided into two separate
                    households (which would give greater security for the couple’s two
                    adolescent children), and on 21 June 1974 the county court ordered the
                    husband committed to prison for three months for contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On appeal, Lord Denning MR commented (at
                    21–22) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The object was to see that the order of the court was obeyed – that
                        the house was sold for the benefit of both parties. To achieve this, it was
                        not necessary to send the man to prison. Whenever there is a reasonable
                        alternative available instead of committal to prison, that alternative must
                        be taken. In this case there was a reasonable alternative available. It was
                        this: to enforce the order for possession by a warrant for possession, to
                        sell the house, and to make the conveyance of the property by means of an
                        instrument to be signed and executed by a third person on the direction of
                        the court…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the wife] submitted that the committal for three months was
                        done to punish the husband – to punish him for his disobedience in the
                        past in not giving up possession. I do not think this was an appropriate
                        case for punishment, certainly not for imprisonment. The husband was
                        obstinate and misguided. But he was sincere. The right way of dealing with
                        the matter was to take steps to enforce the order of the court, but not to
                        imprison him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Buckley LJ added (at 22) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is quite clear, I think, from what we have read in the
                        judge’s judgment, that Mr Danchevsky was in fact in contempt
                        – and one might say in gross contempt – of the order of the
                        court, for he made it manifest that he had no intention of carrying out that
                        order if he could possibly avoid doing so. But the fact remains that the
                        objective could have been obtained by other relief which would not have
                        involved committing Mr Danchevsky to prison for contempt of court. As
                        Lord Denning MR has said, it was open to Mrs Danchevsky to apply
                        for a writ of possession and to execute that writ and thereby recover
                        possession of the house from her former husband, and to carry out that sale
                        with the assistance, if necessary, of an order of the court directing some
                        third party to execute the conveyance in Mr Danchevsky’s
                        place…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Concurring, Scarman LJ remarked (at 24) that committal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… was a singularly blunt and ineffectual weapon for securing the
                        wife’s rights – that is to say, the right to a sale of this
                        house and the division of the proceeds between herself and the defendant.
                        There are, as Lord Denning MR and Buckley LJ have pointed out,
                        other more efficient, more direct ways of achieving the sale of a house than
                        flinging the husband into jail for three months.</p>

          <em>Danchevsky v
                        Danchevsky</em> was cited with approval by Choo Han Teck J in
                        <em>P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte Ltd</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) at [5].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In this case Ms Tan submitted that as an
                    order for possession (and a consequent writ of possession) had not been applied
                    for, a reasonable alternative had not been explored, and therefore it may not
                    have been appropriate for DJ Sowaran Singh to have issued the Committal Order:
                        <em>P J Holdings Inc v Ariel Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> at [6]. However, unlike <em>Danchevsky</em>, a number of features in the present appeal are
                    apparent:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     Other alternatives were in fact
                        attempted, <em>viz</em> the 20 July Order of Court
                        giving the Respondent sole custody of the sale of the matrimonial flat and
                        empowering the Registrar to execute the necessary conveyancing documents in
                        the Appellant’s place (which was the very alternative contemplated in
                            <em>Danchevsky</em> itself), as well as the
                        5 March Order of Court requiring the Appellant to vacate the
                        matrimonial flat by 5 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant displayed none of the <em>bona fides</em> and sincerity of the defendant in
                            <em>Danchevsky</em> (a factor which clearly
                        influenced Lord Denning MR). She failed to comply with the 5 March
                        Order of Court not because she was concerned about the welfare of adolescent
                        children, but because she wanted to prove the Respondent
                    wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     An order for
                        possession and writ of possession may well have been futile given the
                        Appellant’s refusal to vacate the matrimonial flat on 4 January
                        2010 unless an order for her committal was obtained. Ms Tan sought to
                        persuade me that a writ of possession would have been equally effective to
                        make the Appellant move out by 14 March 2010. Ms Tan submitted
                        that enforcement of a writ of possession, as with enforcement of an order
                        for committal, would be by the court’s bailiff. On 15 March 2010,
                        when the bailiff enforced the Committal Order, the Appellant did indeed
                        vacate the matrimonial flat. Accordingly, Ms Tan reasoned that the
                        Appellant would likewise have vacated the matrimonial flat if the bailiff
                        had been enforcing a writ of possession instead of the Committal Order.
                        However, the difficulty with Ms Tan’s submission is that the
                        court would, in effect, be examining the appropriateness of the Committal
                        Order with the benefit of hindsight, a course which Ms Tan submitted I
                        should not adopt in determining the correct order(s) to
                    make.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     Further, in
                            <em>Danchevsky</em>, at the time the order for
                        committal was made, the sale of the matrimonial home had not been concluded.
                        It was perhaps appropriate to first enforce the order for possession by a
                        writ of possession as a precursor to the sale. Viewed in that context, it
                        was understandable for the English Court of Appeal to have found that the
                        county court had failed to consider a reasonable available alternative.
                        However, in the present appeal, the parties had already concluded a binding
                        agreement to sell the matrimonial flat. I agree with the Respondent’s
                        counsel that it was reasonable for the Respondent to expect that the
                        Appellant would not have abided by an order for possession even if that
                        alternative had been explored. After all, it was not disputed that the
                        Appellant did inform the Respondent’s solicitors on 4 January
                        2010 that she would only vacate the matrimonial flat if an order for her
                        committal was obtained, though during the hearing before me on 26 July
                        2010, she explained that she did not fully understand the legal implications
                        arising from such an order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     In any event, I consider that a reasonable alternative
                        was in reality explored by way of the suspended nature of the Committal
                        Order. Inasmuch as a writ of possession would have provided the Appellant
                        with a final chance to comply with the 5 March Order of Court to vacate
                        the matrimonial flat prior to the issuance of an order for committal, the
                        same effect was achieved through the suspended nature of the Committal
                        Order. In truth, DJ Sowaran Singh granted her a further 14 days to
                        comply with the 5 March Order of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_f"></a>(f)     Any further delay in vacating the matrimonial
                        flat might have jeopardised the sale and could possibly have exposed the
                        Respondent as joint tenant with the Appellant to liability to the buyers, a
                        consideration which did not arise in <em>Danchevsky</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In addition, there must be limits to a
                    court’s patience when faced with a recalcitrant and obstructive litigant
                    who is in continuous breach of a mandatory court order. In <em>Kavanagh v Kavanagh</em> ([1978] CA Transcript 166, unreported, but
                    cited by <em>The Law of Contempt</em>, at p 584–585,
                    and N V Lowe, “Evicting the Recalcitrant Spouse”, (1979)
                    43 Conv 337 at 341), Ormrod LJ commented that the wife’s
                    attempts to obtain possession by seeking an order for possession by a writ of
                    possession followed by a writ of restitution and finally by an order for
                    committal was ill-advised, being a highly complex and old-fashioned property
                    approach. Instead, Ormrod LJ recommended a different procedure (which was
                    endorsed by Lord Denning MR) in cases where an ex-wife is attempting to
                    sell the matrimonial home which her former husband refuses to give up possession
                    of, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_a"></a>(a)     Obtain a personal order together
                        with the proper penal message against the husband that he vacate the
                        premises by a particular date and that he be restrained from returning
                        thereafter. However, at this stage no move should be made to commit the
                        husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_b"></a>(b)     Arrange for the contract of sale of the house to be made with vacant
                        possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_c"></a>(c)     When the sale is imminent (<em>ie</em> when the
                        contract is about to be signed), if the husband is still in breach of the
                        order, apply to the court to enforce the personal order. Ormrod LJ
                        envisaged that in such cases the court would make an indefinite committal
                        order pending the sale or until the spouse gives an undertaking not to
                        interfere with the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_61-p2_d"></a>(d)     As soon as the husband is in prison, sign the contract
                        and let the purchaser into possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indefinite
                    committal orders cannot be made by the Subordinate Courts on account of
                    s 8(2) of the SCA (in England, indefinite committal orders can no longer be
                    made as a result of s 14 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981), but the point
                    is that, on the facts of the present appeal, steps (a) and (b) were observed,
                    and the Appellant was still in breach of the 5 March Order of Court despite
                    the imminence of the completion of the sale of the matrimonial
                flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Further, the sentiments expressed in <em>Danchevsky</em> and <em>Ansah v
                        Ansah</em> do not mean that a court should hesitate to deploy
                    committal orders if the court’s authority is continually defied and
                    thwarted. In <em>Jones v Jones</em> [1993] 2 FLR 377,
                    Russell LJ, in response to counsel’s reliance on Ormrod LJ’s
                    dictum in <em>Ansah v Ansah</em> that “[c]ommittal
                    orders are remedies of last resort; in family cases they should be the very last
                    resort” (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), pointedly
                    commented (at 381):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For my part I see little, if any, general principle emerging from the
                        observations of Ormrod LJ. Time and again in this court it has been
                        said that in matrimonial disputes the order that has to be made upon a
                        breach of an undertaking, or a breach of an injunction, must vary and be
                        dependent upon the individual circumstances of the individual case and I
                        certainly am not prepared to hold that Ormrod LJ was contending that in
                        all cases, irrespective of circumstance, an immediate custodial sanction
                        should not be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my judgment, the more appropriate test is
                    that suggested by Butler-Sloss LJ in <em>Re M (Minors)
                        (Access: Contempt: Committal)</em> [1991] 1 FLR 355, which is
                    summarised in the headnote thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Committal orders in family cases were remedies of very last resort and
                        should only be considered where there was a continuing course of conduct and
                        where all other efforts to resolve the situation had been unsuccessful. The
                        court would take that measure where it was clear that a person was
                        deliberately and persistently refusing to obey a court order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On the facts of the present appeal, there
                    clearly was a continuing course of conduct by the Appellant, who was
                    deliberately and persistently refusing to obey the 5 March Order of Court,
                    in circumstances where all other efforts to resolve the situation had been
                    unsuccessful. As such, an order for committal was indeed appropriate, and
                    DJ Sowaran Singh was correct to have suspended the Committal Order on the
                    terms that he did (which he was of course entitled to do under O 52
                    r 6 of the Rules of Court), as it gave the Appellant a final opportunity to
                    comply with the court’s directions, and underscored the dangerous path the
                    Appellant was treading by unilaterally deciding when and how she would
                    eventually vacate the matrimonial property. A suspended order for committal was,
                    in the circumstances, the most ideal solution, for it tempered justice with
                    mercy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The significance of suspending the Committal Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Thus far, the approach of DJ Sowaran
                    Singh had much to commend it, and the Committal Order <em>per
                        se</em> was unassailable. The problem, however, lies in the fact that
                    the Committal Order had been suspended, and the events that transpired after the
                    Appellant’s non-compliance with the Committal Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The court’s discretion in dealing with breaches of a suspended
                order for committal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In her submissions, Ms Tan raised the critical
                    point that where a suspended order for committal has been made, and the
                    contemnor breaches the terms and conditions on which the order was suspended,
                    the court is not obliged to impose the suspended sentence, but has a discretion
                    to do what is just in the circumstances: <em>re W (B) (An
                        Infant)</em> [1969] 2 WLR 99 at 103–104; <em>Banton v Banton</em> (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>
                    above) at 466–467; <em>Villiers v Villiers</em>
                    [1994] 1 WLR 493 at 498; <em>Griffin v Griffin</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) at 49 and <em>Phillips and others v Symes (No 3)</em> [2005]
                    1 WLR 2986 at [51]. The discretion is unfettered – the court may
                    impose the suspended sentence in whole or in part, or substitute a fine, or
                    indeed impose no penalty at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This was first decided in <em>re W (B) (An Infant)</em>, where the contemnor had given an
                    undertaking to the court that he would not associate or communicate with an
                    underaged girl who had been made a ward of the court. The contemnor broke that
                    undertaking, and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for contempt of
                    court, but the sentence was suspended provided he complied with injunctions
                    restraining him from associating or communicating with the girl during her
                    minority. The contemnor breached the injunction, and Megarry J held that he
                    had no discretion but to activate the suspended sentence. The English Court of
                    Appeal unanimously allowed the contemnor’s appeal, with Lord Denning
                    MR stating (at 103) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are all of the opinion that Megarry J. had a discretion in the
                        matter. The sentence of six months did not come into operation at once and
                        automatically upon a breach being proved. The court has a discretion
                        analogous to a suspended sentence in the criminal courts. Imprisonment is
                        not the inevitable consequence of a breach. The court has a discretion to do
                        what is just in all the circumstances. It can reduce the length of the
                        sentence or can impose a fine instead. It may indeed not punish at all. It
                        all depends on how serious is the beach, how long has the man behaved
                        himself, and so forth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It will be seen that Lord Denning MR
                    founded the court’s discretion in such cases by drawing an analogy to the
                    treatment of suspended sentences in the English criminal courts. Our courts,
                    however, have no power to suspend criminal sentences: <em>Aw Hoon
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 886. Nonetheless, as a
                    matter of principle, it is clearly justifiable that a court has a broad
                    discretion in sentencing a contemnor who has breached the terms of a suspended
                    order for committal. When an order for committal is suspended on certain terms
                    and conditions, a breach of those terms and conditions by the contemnor is, in
                    principle, disobedience of an order of court, and therefore a further contempt.
                    Since the court has a complete discretion in sentencing contemnors (see
                        <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above), it must obviously have the
                    same discretion in sentencing repeat contemnors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Procedure to be adopted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In order for this discretion to be properly
                    exercised, the court must be properly appraised of the relevant facts and
                    circumstances surrounding the breach of the suspended order for committal. For
                    this to be possible there must be a <em>renewed</em>
                    application to lift the suspension and activate the sentence, which calls upon
                    the contemnor to show cause as to why the suspended sentence ought not to be
                    imposed. There must be another hearing <em>inter
                        partes</em>, at which the court can then decide, after considering all
                    the relevant facts, what the consequence of the breach should be. If this is not
                    done, and the court is merely told <em>ex parte</em> that
                    the contemnor has breached the terms of the suspended order for committal, and a
                    warrant for committal issued forthwith, not only would the contemnor be deprived
                    of the opportunity to be adequately heard (which would be, to all intents and
                    purposes, a breach of natural justice), the court would also be fettering its
                    discretion unjustifiably.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It is not entirely clear if the English rules
                    on civil procedure prior to 1999 provided for this. For instance, Nigel Fricker
                    and David Bean, <em>Enforcement of Injunctions and
                        Undertakings</em> (Jordans, 1991) at para 31.2 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is submitted that when there has been a breach of the terms of
                        suspension of an order of committal, an application for the lifting of the
                        suspension and implementation of the committal should be made by way of an
                        adapted notice of application to commit. On principle, the contemnor ought
                        to be given precise details of his alleged further contempt. The judgment in
                            <em>Lakin v Lakin</em> [1984] CAT No 488 lends
                        support to this proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The tone of this quotation suggests that no such procedure was in
                    place, and unfortunately <em>Lakin v Lakin</em> is not a
                    reported judgment. Although p 4 of the transcript in <em>Lakin v Lakin</em> does indicate that “a further application
                    to commit” the respondent for breach of a suspended order for committal
                    was made, it is not clear whether the application was made <em>inter partes</em>. In <em>Nicholls v
                        Nicholls</em> [1997] 1 WLR 314, the appellant husband had given,
                    in March 1995, a non-molestation undertaking and an undertaking not to dispose
                    of specified items from the matrimonial home. In September 1995, he was
                    committed to two months’ imprisonment, suspended for one year on condition
                    he did not harass the respondent wife. This was not complied with, and in March
                    1996, the wife (at 317)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>made an application for… the suspended committal
                            order… to be activated</em> on the grounds that the husband
                        had harassed the wife on five different occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the headnote that the wife’s application was
                    served on the husband, and that he was present at the subsequent hearing at
                    which the suspended order for committal was activated. Most notably, in
                        <em>Griffin v Griffin</em> (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), the issue on appeal was whether an
                    order for committal for contempt of court, suspended for as long as the
                    contemnor complied with another order of infinite duration, was valid. In ruling
                    that it was, Hale LJ stated (at 50) that any injustice such an order gave
                    rise to could be cured, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… these orders [<em>ie</em> suspended orders
                        for committal] are not activated automatically <em>but only
                            upon application to the court</em>. The court hearing such an

<p class="Judg-1">Although Hale LJ did not say so explicitly, it seems clear from
                    the context that she had in mind an <em>inter partes</em>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It would appear, therefore, that at least by
                    1999, the practice in England regarding suspended orders for committal was that
                    they could only be activated after an <em>inter partes</em>
                    application to the court seeking such a course of action, and, naturally, only
                    after the consequent hearing had been conducted, whereupon the court would
                    decide, if the breach had been proved, how to exercise its discretion in
                    sentencing.</p>

                    above) at [15]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… what the rule contemplates is that there may be a committal

                        the words of the rule, be discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is of course true that Part 71 of the
                    CPR deals with examinations of judgment debtors and not committal for contempt
                    of court generally, and that our rules of civil procedure are not based on the
                    CPR. However, in my view, there is no reason why the sort of procedure
                    envisioned by r 71.8(4)(b) of the CPR should not also apply in Singapore
                    when a suspended order for committal is made and then not complied with. Given
                    the draconian nature of an order for committal, it is imperative that the
                    contemnor be afforded the chance to be heard and to make representations as to
                    the appropriate penalty to be imposed, if any, for breach of the terms of a
                    suspended order for committal. The correct procedure to be adopted, therefore,
                    where it is sought to activate a suspended order for committal, is for a fresh
                    application to be made, by way of an amended application for an order for
                    committal (under O 52 r 3 of the Rules of Court), and an <em>inter partes</em> hearing to be convened on an urgent basis,
                    whereupon the court will be in possession of all the relevant information and
                    can therefore properly exercise its discretion as to the correct consequence of
                    the breach of the terms of the suspended order for committal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It should be added that once an application
                    has been made to activate the suspended order, and an <em>inter
                        partes</em> hearing convened, if a <em>prima
                        facie</em> breach of the suspended order has been proven beyond a
                    reasonable doubt by the applicant (and therefore a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of contempt made out), then, as with an ordinary
                    hearing of an application for an order for committal, the contemnor bears the
                    burden of convincing the court of his defence: s 105 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”); <em>Lewis v Pontypridd, Caerphilly, and Newport Railway
                        Company</em> (1895) 11 TLR 203. Given the relatively low
                    threshold of <em>mens rea</em> for civil contempt (see
                        <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above), however, it is more likely
                    that any exculpatory facts will only go to mitigation, which the contemnor also
                    has the burden of proving: s 108 of the Evidence Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Procedure not followed in this case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     On the facts of this appeal, however, this
                    procedure was not adopted. What appears to have happened is that, on
                    15 March 2010, faced with the Appellant’s continuing refusal to move
                    out of the matrimonial flat, the Respondent’s solicitors had simply
                    applied <em>ex parte</em> to the Subordinate Courts for the
                    execution of the committal order via the expedited issuance and enforcement of a
                    warrant for committal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It also appears that the warrant for committal
                    was summarily issued by the Subordinate Courts, without any further hearing
                    having been conducted. In such circumstances, the court had erred in
                    unnecessarily depriving the Appellant the chance to be heard, denying itself the
                    opportunity of being acquainted with all the relevant evidence, and fettering
                    its undoubted discretion by, in effect, automatically activating the suspended
                    30-day sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I should add that if, in this case, an
                        <em>inter partes</em> application had been made, and at
                    the hearing the Appellant had simply failed to appear, the court <em>might</em> have been entitled, in exceptional circumstances,
                    to issue an order for her committal in her absence: see <em>Lamb
                        v Lamb</em> (<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above) and
                        <em>Wright v Jess</em> [1987] 1 WLR 1076. It is
                    not, however, necessary to consider this matter in detail as it does not arise
                    for decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Remedy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The conclusion reached thus far is that, while
                    DJ Sowaran Singh was fully justified in imposing the suspended Committal
                    Order, it was not correct for the Committal Order to be executed in the manner
                    that it was, <em>ie</em> on an <em>ex
                        parte</em> basis without any apparent exercise of judicial discretion.
                    In other words, while the Committal Order was not flawed, the warrant for
                    committal was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In England, there has been a substantial body
                    of case law dealing with the question of what an appellate court ought to do
                    when confronted with procedural errors in the form or the making of an order for
                    committal. Whereas it was previously held (see <em>Gordon v
                        Gordon</em> (1946) 62 TLR 217 at 218) that, since the liberty of
                    an individual is at stake, strict adherence to all procedural rules was required
                    and any departure from them, no matter how technical and minor, would result in
                    a committal being set aside regardless of the injustice of such a course of
                    action, the present approach is authoritatively stated in <em>Nicholls v Nicholls</em> (see <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> above). Lord Woolf MR, after a comprehensive review of
                    the authorities, laid down the following guidance (at 327) for future
                    cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    As committal orders involve the liberty of the
                            subject it is particularly important that the relevant rules are duly
                            complied with. It remains the responsibility of the judge when signing
                            the committal order to ensure that it is properly drawn and that it
                            adequately particularises the breaches which have been proved and for
                            which the sentence has been imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    As long as the contemnor had a fair trial and the
                            order has been made on valid grounds the existence of a defect either in
                            the application to commit or in the committal order served will not
                            result in the order being set aside except in so far as the interests of
                            justice require this to be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Interests of justice will not require an order to
                            be set aside where there is no prejudice caused as a result of errors in
                            the application to commit or in the order to commit. When necessary the
                            order can be amended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    When considering whether to set aside the order,
                            the court should have regard to the interests of any other party and the
                            need to uphold the reputation of the justice system.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    If there has been a procedural irregularity or
                            some other defect in the conduct of the proceedings which has occasioned
                            injustice, the court will consider exercising its power to order a new
                            trial unless there are circumstances which indicate that it would not be
                            just to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Lord Woolf MR indicated (at
                    325–326) that the discretion given to an appellate court in England to
                    rectify procedural defects both prior and subsequent to the making of an order
                    for committal had two statutory sources: s 13(3) of the AJA 1960 (see
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above) and Ord 59,
                    r 10(3) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776) (UK)
                    (“RSC”) (now r 52.10 of the CPR). The discretion conferred by
                    both statutory provisions is equally broad (see <em>Smith v Smith
                        (Contempt: Committal)</em> [1992] 2 FLR 40 at 43).
                    Section 13(3) of the AJA 1960 is broadly similar to s 37(5) of the
                    SCJA (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above), and Ord 59
                    r 10(3) of the RSC was in substantially the same terms as O 55
                    r 6(5) of the Rules of Court, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court may give any judgment or decision or make any order which ought
                        to have been given or made by the Court, tribunal or person and make such
                        further or other order as the case may require or may remit the matter with
                        the opinion of the Court for rehearing and determination by it or
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As such, the guidance provided by
                    Lord Woolf MR in <em>Nicholls v Nicholls</em> is, in
                    my judgment, applicable in Singapore. Order 55 r 6(5) of the Rules of
                    Court gives the High Court the power to rectify procedural defects both in the
                    procedure leading up to the making of an order for committal and/or after the
                    order has been made. As Lord Woolf MR held earlier in the same judgment (at
                    326):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like any other discretion, the discretion provided by [O 55,
                        r 6(5)], must be exercised in a way which in all the circumstances best
                        reflects the requirements of justice. In determining this the court must not
                        only take into account the interests of the contemnor but also the interests
                        of the other parties and the interests of upholding the reputation of civil
                        justice in general.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that although <em>Nicholls v
                        Nicholls</em> was concerned with when defective <em>orders for committal</em> can be set aside or amended, the guidance
                    provided by Lord Woolf MR is also applicable to situations where, as in the
                    present case, a <em>warrant for committal</em> (issued
                    pursuant to an order for committal) is defective, and may have to be set aside
                    or amended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Applying the guidelines in <em>Nicholls v Nicholls</em>, the question remains of whether,
                    notwithstanding the fact that the suspended Committal Order was sound, the
                    interests of justice require the defective warrant for committal to be quashed,
                    or whether the procedural irregularities (see <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> and <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above) can now
                    be remedied by way of amendment or retrial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     This requires consideration of whether such
                    irregularities have caused prejudice to the Appellant (or to other parties), and
                    whether there was a reasonable chance that the court would have acted
                    differently if the proper procedure (see <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> and <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above) had
                    been followed. This is entirely in line with my ruling that the decision to be
                    made following the <em>inter partes</em> hearing must
                    ultimately be an exercise of judicial discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In my judgment, the interests of justice
                    clearly require the warrant for committal (as well as the sentence it activated)
                    to be quashed, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     During the hearing on 26 May 2010, I
                    directed the Appellant to file an affidavit to explain her conduct from
                    1 March 2010 (the date of the suspended Committal Order) to 14 March
                    2010 (the date when the Appellant was required to vacate the matrimonial flat).
                    In her affidavit, the Appellant detailed the steps she took after the Committal
                    Order was made by DJ Sowaran Singh:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     From 3 March to 11 March,
                        she took preparatory steps to file her appeal against the Committal Order.
                        She visited the Subordinate Court Registry on a number of occasions to seek
                        assistance to prepare her appeal papers and to obtain the Notes of Evidence
                        which were eventually collected on 10 March 2010. Finally on
                        12 March 2010, she filed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the meantime, she was taking steps to rent a
                        room so that she could move out and hand over the property to the buyers
                        “as soon as possible”. In a text message dated 14 March
                        2010, she told the buyers that they might be able to move in by the
                        following week, <em>ie</em> the week commencing
                        22 March 2010, as she was going to sign a tenancy agreement by
                        “Monday/Tuesday”, <em>ie</em> 15 or
                        16 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     In addition, the Appellant believed that since her appeal had been
                        filed, the Committal Order was stayed and she would not be required to move
                        out by 14 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I have no doubt that had an <em>inter partes</em> hearing been convened, the Appellant would have
                    informed the court of the developments subsequent to the Committal Order. In my
                    view, if that had been done, there was at least a reasonable chance that the
                    court would not have issued the warrant for committal for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant in fact took steps to
                        find alternative accommodation. In other words, she intended and was
                        attempting to comply with the Committal Order. In this regard, the Appellant
                        may be criticised for leaving it very late in the day to do so. However, it
                        cannot be overlooked that she spent a great deal of time preparing her
                        appeal (without assistance from counsel), a course which she was entitled to
                        pursue as of right.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     While her belief, however genuine, that her appeal operated as a stay
                        of the Committal Order does not prevent her from being in contempt of court,
                        it nonetheless reveals that she did not adopt a course of action to
                        intentionally or deliberately flout the Committal Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was common ground between the
                        parties (and accepted by DJ Sowaran Singh at [10] of his GD) that legal
                        completion for the sale of the matrimonial flat was on 1 April 2010. It
                        follows that the buyers were only legally entitled to vacant possession on
                        1 April 2010 a fact that was not disputed by the Respondent. Given that
                        the Appellant was taking active steps to move out by the week commencing
                        22 March 2010 (which would still be within time for legal completion to
                        take place), the court hearing the matter on an <em>inter
                            partes</em> basis would very likely have granted the Appellant
                        additional time to move out and would not have issued the warrant for
                        committal immediately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     As regards the issue of prejudice to the
                    Appellant, that is a given. It is a matter of considerable regret that the
                    Appellant has had to serve what might have been (had the correct procedure been
                    followed) an unnecessary sentence of imprisonment, and it is unfortunate that,
                    unlike in normal criminal cases, the quashing of her sentence will make no
                    discernible difference as there is no criminal record to be erased, and no legal
                    pronouncement will allow her to reclaim those 18 “lost” days.
                    Nonetheless, quashing her sentence will ensure that there will be no <em>administrative</em> record that she has ever been in prison,
                    which might otherwise blemish her employment profile or possibly inconvenience
                    her visits to other countries (in the case of countries which require the
                    visitor to declare any imprisonment sentence), and will in any event vindicate
                    her reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Given all the circumstances of this case,
                    therefore, the interests of justice require that the warrant for committal (as
                    well as the sentence it activated) be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Sentence was in any case Manifestly Excessive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Although DJ Sowaran Singh was amply
                    justified in imposing the suspended Committal Order, the 30-day term of
                    imprisonment was manifestly excessive in view of the Appellant’s
                    circumstances. She was merely seeking to maximise her use of the matrimonial
                    flat prior to legal completion on 1 April 2010. The Committal Order was
                    partly intended to ensure the Appellant’s compliance to give up vacant
                    possession of the matrimonial flat to enable the sale to be completed. That
                    could have been achieved with a brief custodial sentence, which would also have
                    registered the serious consequences arising from her contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In her notice of appeal, the Appellant also
                    appealed against DJ Sowaran Singh’s order that she pay the
                    Respondent’s costs fixed at $2,000 to be deducted from her share of the
                    sale proceeds. In addition to considering whether to interfere with the order as
                    to costs below, I have to consider the issue of the costs of this
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In my view, there is no reason to disturb
                    DJ Sowaran Singh’s order as to costs: the suspended Committal Order
                    was justified (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above), and the
                    Appellant was, after all, in clear contempt of court by disobeying the
                    5 March Order of Court. Costs, therefore, correctly followed the
                    event.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs of the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The question of the costs of the appeal,
                    however, is somewhat more difficult. In <em>Phillips v Symes
                        (No 3)</em> (see <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above),
                    the contemnor had successfully appealed a sentence of two years’
                    imprisonment (the Court of Appeal substituted a term of one year, and the order
                    for committal was modified in other respects in the contemnor’s favour).
                    Pill LJ said (at [4] of the costs judgment ([2005] EWCA Civ 663)) that
                    there was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… little material as to whether the approach to costs on a
                        successful appeal by the contemnor in contempt proceedings should be the
                        same as that in any civil appeal or whether a different approach should
                        apply on the ground that the decision as to sentence will often, as in this
                        case, and as in the case of an appeal against sentence in a criminal case,
                        primarily be an issue between the contemnor and the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Pill LJ considered (at [7]) that, while
                    there was no difference in principle between proceedings for civil contempt and
                    other <em>inter partes</em> proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… factors may be present in contempt proceedings which are not
                        normally present in civil proceedings. Amongst them, in a case such as the
                        present, is the fact that the contemnor by his admitted contempts of court
                        has brought the entire proceedings upon himself and is in a weaker position
                        to claim costs as between the parties than most litigants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In my opinion, Pill LJ’s remarks
                    apply here. The Appellant, by her initial contempt of court, has brought the
                    entire proceedings upon herself, and it would be unfair to penalise the
                    Respondent in costs for an error in procedure which was not of his doing. In the
                    circumstances, it is fair that each party should bear their own costs for this
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The law of contempt represents the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction to safeguard the administration of justice
                    and uphold the rule of law by punishing those who defy its authority: <em>Summit Holdings Ltd and another v Business Software
                        Alliance</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 592 at [25]. At the same time, the
                    contempt jurisdiction is open to charges of arbitrariness precisely because it
                    is a creature of the common law which, when invoked, has potentially devastating
                    consequences for the contemnor. To strike an adequate balance between these
                    competing tensions, it is imperative that the proper safeguards are in place to
                    ensure that contemnors are not unnecessarily, and irreparably, punished for
                    their transgressions. Regrettably, this appeal has revealed that the procedure
                    for the activation of suspended orders for committal has not been adequately
                    regulated, and it is hoped that this ruling in setting aside the warrant for
                    committal and the consequent sentence will remedy this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     On that note, I would like to record my deep
                    appreciation to counsel for their concise and succinct submissions on this
                    important but obscure area of the law. I especially thank Ms Tan for
                    agreeing, in spite of her heavy commitments, to assist in this appeal as amicus
                    curiae. <em>Her submissions were well-researched, clear and
                        commendably fair</em>.</p>
