It was quite telling that <span class="font-italic">both</span> Mogan and Suresh had saved the first and second numbers with names that indicated that they were alternate contact numbers for the same person.

I was unable to accept his evidence. The accused first mentioned that he had lost that mobile phone only in his final long statement recorded on 23 May 2014. If it were true that he had lost that mobile phone, and was no longer using the second number at all, one would have expected him to mention that fact in the 24 April 2014 statement. Instead, the accused’s unqualified position at that time was that “the number 90356293 is used to give to my urine test officer and for my shop”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In fact, his allegation in his final long statement on 23 May 2014 that he had lost the mobile phone only came in response to a <span class="font-italic">subsequent </span>question that Insp Ng asked him about the second number 90356293. Her first question had been: “If you don’t know Mogan before you entered Changi Prison Complex this year, how come he has your number 90356293?” To this, he simply said “I don’t know how come he has <span class="font-italic">my</span> number” [emphasis added], again, without any qualification as to his ownership of and use of that number. In a <span class="font-italic">subsequent </span>question, Insp Ng asked him about the message sent by Suresh “Car stan by ready” to the second number on 6 September 2013. It was only then that the accused sought to explain that he had lost the mobile phone bearing the number 90356293, and that someone else might have used the number afterward. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 When confronted with his omission to state that he had lost that mobile phone on 7 August 2013 in his 24 April 2014 statement, the accused alleged that he had informed Insp Ng about that fact after the conclusion of the recording of the statement. This was a spurious and baseless allegation which was first brought up during cross-examination of the accused. No mention of Insp Ng’s failure to record what he had stated was made in the accused’s examination-in-chief. Further, the accused did not explain the loss of the mobile phone in any of the subsequent statements that the accused gave (which the Defence adduced at the trial), and only raised this in response to a subsequent question asked by Insp Ng in the final long statement. On her part, Insp Ng maintained that the accused had said no such thing to her, and gave clear evidence that she would have amended the statement to add the accused’s further comments had he made them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The accused also alleged that his repeated requests for the assistance of an interpreter during the recording of his 24 April 2014 statement had been denied. As a result, he did not fully understand Insp Ng’s questions, nor the recorded statement when it was read back to him. Again, this was a bare allegation raised for the first time during his cross-examination, which I found rather disingenuous given the accused’s admission that he had made no such request for any of the other statements subsequently recorded from him.

</div> In contrast, the description of “India” given to Mogan did not fit the accused at all. Also, the call records showed that Suresh had dialled Mogan’s number on two occasions; once on 5 September 2013 and once again on 6 September 2013, less than three hours before his arrest.

</div> This showed that Suresh was associated with Mogan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Having considered Suresh’s and the accused’s evidence at the trial, as well as the call records, I rejected the Defence’s argument that it was <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span> who had been the person coordinating the transaction. First, the Defence’s position that Suresh was “Appu bro” was never put or suggested to Suresh in cross-examination. In my view, this was an allegation of such grave importance that it should have been raised to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, the objective evidence (in the form of call records) showed that Suresh could not have been the user of the first number. On 6 and 7 September 2013, Mogan communicated with “India” exclusively over the phone using the first number to coordinate the intended drug delivery. The user of the first number could not have been Suresh, since Suresh’s mobile phones were seized upon his arrest at the McDonald’s, and subsequent verification showed that Suresh’s phone number was 93792632. After Suresh’s arrest, SI Tay directed Mogan to call “India” to ascertain whether the police had arrested the right person. However, the call was received by another person, meaning that “India” and Suresh could not have been the same person:

</div> served as further confirmation that Suresh could not be “India”. This was further bolstered by the call records preceding Suresh’s arrest, which disclosed a total of three calls made between Mogan and the first number, followed quickly by calls between the first number and Suresh’s mobile phone. There was no reason in fact or logic to believe that Suresh would have made multiple calls to himself after each call with Mogan. Suresh and the user of the first number were different persons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I come to the Defence’s point that Suresh had dialled Mogan’s number twice in the days leading up to his arrest on 7 September 2013. In this regard, Suresh vehemently denied that he had dialled Mogan’s number in the face of irrefutable objective evidence to the contrary. While this might have cast some doubt on whether Suresh knew of or about Mogan prior to his arrest, the important point remained that Suresh did not speak to Mogan during these two calls. It was undisputed that while the call records showed that Mogan’s number had been dialled, the calls never went through; Suresh did not speak to Mogan. Therefore, for the transaction, there was no objective evidence of any arrangement made by Suresh with Mogan. As I stated above, apart from this aspect as to whether Suresh knew of or about Mogan, I found Suresh’s evidence to be reliable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In sharp contrast, I found the accused not to be a credible witness. As detailed in [55]–[58] above, he attempted to distance himself from the second number by claiming that he had lost his mobile phone. In doing so, he made unwarranted allegations against Insp Ng in relation to the recording of the 24 April 2014 statement. In addition, there were these two clearly unsatisfactory aspects of his evidence: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the accused claimed that when he reconnected with Suresh in July 2013, he only gave the second number to Suresh. If his version that he lost his mobile phone on 7 August 2013 were to be believed, Suresh would not have been able to contact the accused thereafter. Yet, there were occasions in August 2013 when they met up for drinks. Even then, the accused did not inform Suresh that he had lost his mobile phone, or inform Suresh of his other number being 81787447. Indeed, according to the accused, they met on 5 September 2013, and arranged to go for the urine test at around 8pm to 9pm on 6 September 2013. They also met on 6 September 2013. Still, the accused did not furnish Suresh with a contact number. His evidence defied logic. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, in line with the contents of his statements, the accused stated in his oral testimony that he reported for his urine test on 6 September 2013. As he left the police station, he noticed Suresh and Shashi at a car parked along the road. He then added that Suresh informed him that Suresh had obtained a medical certificate. Suresh then walked to the guard post to submit the medical certificate to a police officer there. Suresh denied meeting the accused at Clementi Police Station. Indeed, having obtained a medical certificate to avoid taking the urine test, there was no reason for Suresh to submit it on the same day, risking detection and arrest by the police. In this regard, the unchallenged evidence of Nurazhar bin Sadikin, the accused’s supervision officer, was that supervisees need to submit their medical certificates personally to the supervision officers. Furthermore, Suresh’s medical certificate was seized upon his arrest at the McDonald’s. Clearly, the accused had not been truthful about his interactions with Suresh that night. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Viewed in totality, the accused’s evidence was unbelievable.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Conclusion </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Based on all of the foregoing, I found that it was the accused who was using the first number on 6 and 7 September 2013 to communicate with both Mogan and Suresh. On the accused’s own admission, he was the user of the second number, which in turn linked him to the first number, given Mogan and Suresh’s clear evidence that both the first and second numbers were used by the same person. This evidence was corroborated by direct evidence from Suresh that the person he had been in communication with on 6 and 7 September 2013 was none other than the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For completeness, I should add that another piece of evidence from Mogan reinforced this finding. Mogan stated that initially, he had called the first number, and “India” had told him that he could secure a job for Mogan at a mini-mart in Tuas. The accused, of course, operated a mini-mart in Tuas and by his own evidence had the power to engage help as he saw fit.

</div> This strengthened the case that “India” was in fact the accused.

Further, based on the evidence of Mogan, Suresh and SI Tay, the accused’s plan for the delivery of cannabis had evolved over the course of 6 and 7 September 2013. Initially, the plan was for Mogan to pass the cannabis to “India” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the accused) at the toilet at McDonald’s. Subsequently, the accused informed Mogan that he would be asking his “fat Indian” friend to collect the cannabis. The accused coordinated the delivery by Mogan on the one hand, and the receipt by Suresh on the other. He did so by checking that Mogan was still at the toilet of the McDonald’s, before asking Suresh to check if there was anyone in the toilet at the said McDonald’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It was also clear that the accused knew that the delivery was of a consignment of cannabis. SI Tay testified that he had heard “India” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the accused) specifically mention the word “<span class="font-italic">ya lei</span>”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Now, I note that there is reference to these words “<span class="font-italic">ya lei</span>” at the third line.

This was a term which the accused himself had used during the phone conversation when referring to the thing which his friend was to collect from Mogan at the toilet at the McDonald’s. In my view, given the context of the discussion, “<span class="font-italic">ya lei</span>” could mean nothing other than the cannabis, and the accused would have known this, being a user of cannabis himself. I did not accept the accused’s bare denial that he did not know that “<span class="font-italic">ya lei</span>” meant cannabis.

The accused had engaged in a conspiracy with Mogan for Mogan to deliver the 1017.9g of cannabis to himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To round off, I should deal with the Defence’s argument that the Prosecution ought to have called Shashi as a witness, since he was in the car with Suresh at the material time and would have been privy to the conversations (at least from Suresh’s end) between Suresh and “Appu bro”.

</div> While Shashi’s evidence would have been relevant in that it would have either corroborated or contradicted Suresh’s evidence, I accepted that the Prosecution had taken reasonable steps to locate Shashi, including calling him on his mobile phone and sending him letters at his registered address. The mere fact that the Prosecution had not made attempts to call on him <span class="font-italic">in person</span> at his registered address did not undermine the Prosecution’s case. Moreover, I should stress that in finding that the accused was the user of the first number, I had relied not just on Suresh’s evidence, but also on Mogan’s evidence and the accused’s own admission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Act pursuant to conspiracy </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Next, it was undisputed that Mogan had brought into Singapore 1017.9g of cannabis, and was on the way to deliver the cannabis to “India” (which, as I have found, referred to the accused) when he was arrested. This constituted an act committed in pursuance of the aforementioned conspiracy, and satisfied the second element of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intention to traffic </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Finally, the Prosecution must prove the additional <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> element of an intention to traffic, since the intended recipient of the drugs was the accused himself. Where the quantity of the drug possessed is many times what a typical addict would be able to consume on a daily basis, the likelihood is that the offender has the drug in his possession not for personal consumption, but for the purpose of trafficking (<span class="font-italic">Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 710 at [29]). Here, a large quantity of cannabis was involved, being more than twice the amount which would attract the death penalty. It was not argued that the cannabis was intended for the accused’s own consumption, nor was any evidence led by the Defence in that respect. Therefore, I found that given the large quantity of cannabis involved, the accused had intended to traffic in the said cannabis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 By the foregoing, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I found him guilty and convicted him of the charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 As I had earlier mentioned, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death, although the alternative sentencing regime in s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA provides the court a discretion to impose a mandatory term of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane where (i) the offender satisfies the court that his acts fall within s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, and (ii) the Public Prosecutor certifies that the offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Here, the accused was meant to take delivery of the cannabis, and, as I have found above, this was meant for the purpose of trafficking, and not for his own consumption. Given the nature of his defence, the accused did not give any evidence that he was merely to <span class="font-italic">deliver</span> the cannabis. I therefore found that he has not proved on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier. Also, the Public Prosecutor has not issued a certificate of substantive assistance. Therefore, the alternative sentencing regime was not available. Accordingly, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death on the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anandan s/o Bala and Kee Yongwen Kenneth (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Public Prosecutor;<br/>Ram Goswami (Ram Goswami) and Cheng Kim Kuan (KK Cheng &amp; Co) for the accused. </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
