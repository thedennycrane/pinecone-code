The money came from Mr Poh’s account with the defendant bank (“UOB”). He instructed UOB to transfer the money to PixelTrade (UK) Ltd (which also had a UOB bank account then): a sum of US$200,000 in October 2017, and a further sum of US$300,000 in December 2017.

Indeed, Mr Poh made no attempt to prove that the 2nd, 3rd and 6th Representations were false.

According to Mr Poh, UOB owed a duty of care to him “to act with reasonable care, or ordinary care and skill, in handling remittance monies and to protect such monies from pure economic loss. This duty arose when [Mr Poh] remitted monies to the PixelTrade Account, and [UOB] processed and handled such remittances”.

It contained, amongst other things, the following statement: “There will be a hard stop placed by the trading agent/software on the account to avoid draw-down of more than ____% of client’s equity”.

Moreover, if Mr Poh truly believed that all his investments made through UOB (or with funds from a UOB bank account) were guaranteed by UOB, he would not have made such a comment.

In particular, if Mr Wong had represented that Mr Poh’s investment in PixelTrade was guaranteed by UOB, Mr Poh would have mentioned that, but he did not. He did not demand that UOB honour such a guarantee. Instead, Mr Poh’s position was that he had thought his investment in PixelTrade was UOB-approved because he was dealing with a UOB relationship manager. That is not the same as his pleaded case that Mr Wong had fraudulently made the Representations to him.

In his AEIC, Mr Poh says that at that meeting, he asked if UOB was going to accept liability for his loss of US$500,000. The UOB representatives deny that he had asked such a question. It is curious that Mr Poh would ask if UOB was going to accept liability for his <span class="font-italic">loss</span>, if Mr Wong had represented to him that his investment was guaranteed by UOB. Had Mr Wong made that representation, one would expect Mr Poh to simply demand that UOB honour that guarantee, rather than to talk in terms of liability for loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The fact of the matter is that Mr Poh always knew that there was no such guarantee from UOB. This explains why Mr Poh did not bring a contractual claim against UOB based on such a guarantee; instead, he brought a claim against UOB on the basis of vicarious liability for Mr Wong’s fraud. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The UOB representatives say that, at the meeting, Mr Poh had admitted or acknowledged that he was aware that his investment in PixelTrade was not a product of UOB nor approved by UOB.

I do not agree that the UOB representatives’ evidence should be faulted on this account: they were at the same meeting, and moreover, they had a discussion among themselves after Mr Poh left. The UOB representatives also elaborated on the meeting in their oral testimony. According to Mr Beh, not once did Mr Poh say at the meeting that he thought the PixelTrade investment was a UOB product. If Mr Poh had said that, then there would have been something for Mr Beh to follow up on. But from what was said at the meeting, Mr Beh’s impression was that the case was closed, as he felt that UOB was totally not responsible. The fact that Mr Poh had met with PixelTrade’s representatives instead of going straight to UOB indicated that he was well aware that his PixelTrade investment did not form part of his investment portfolio with UOB.

UOB noted that the two fund transfers had been processed in Mr Poh’s presence, with the branch operations officer having sighted his transactional vouchers before processing the transfers; moreover, the signature on the fund transfer forms matched the bank’s record of his specimen signature.

The other four Representations in the statement of claim were still conspicuously missing. In particular, the 4th Representation that UOB was guaranteeing investments in PixelTrade was not in the letter of demand. If, as Mr Poh claims, he had mentioned all seven Representations at the meeting with the UOB officers on 15 April 2019, why were only three of the seven Representations mentioned in the letter of demand sent approximately two months later?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On 24 June 2019, UOB denied liability through its lawyers. Specifically, UOB’s lawyers said that it was within Mr Poh’s personal knowledge at all material times that his investment in PixelTrade was neither a product of UOB nor approved by UOB; further, at the meeting on 15 April 2019, Mr Poh had admitted or acknowledged that he had been aware of the same, at the time he instructed the transfers to PixelTrade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Mr Poh then instructed new lawyers who replied UOB on 26 July 2019 to say that Mr Poh found UOB’s position regrettable, that he denied all allegations made against him by UOB, and that he would be suing UOB.

</div> Indeed, Mr Poh went on to purchase ten more bonds from UOB, after he had been informed that his PixelTrade investment was not a UOB-approved investment product. Those ten bonds, like the first four he invested in, were neither risk-free nor guaranteed by UOB, but that did not deter him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Vicarious liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Even if Mr Wong had defrauded Mr Poh (which I find is not the case), it does not necessarily follow that UOB would be vicariously liable. As Belinda Ang Saw Ean J said in <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Han Ling and another v American International Assurance Co Ltd and others</span> [2018] 5 SLR 549 at [160]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ultimately, vicarious liability should only be imposed where it is fair, just and reasonable to do so, having regards to the aims of effective victim compensation, deterrence of future harm, and in the light of the concept of enterprise risk. These aims should also be balanced against the competing public policy consideration militating against holding a person liable for another person’s torts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Given that Mr Poh’s claims are thoroughly contradicted by the documents which he received from UOB, and which he signed and returned to UOB, it would not be fair, just and reasonable to hold UOB vicariously liable. By those documents, UOB represented to Mr Poh that it did not guarantee any investments other than structured deposits (which the PixelTrade investment was not), and that investments carried risks (at least the risk of default by the issuer). By signing and returning the documents, Mr Poh represented to UOB that he understood all of that. Further, the complete lack of any UOB documentation on Mr Poh’s investment with PixelTrade, in contrast to the UOB documentation on the bonds that he had invested in through UOB, was a further sign to him that he was not investing in a UOB-approved PixelTrade investment product.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Negligence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Mr Poh’s negligence claim is not made out. His remittances to PixelTrade were done in accordance with his instructions to UOB. UOB did not owe him any duty to ensure that he did not lose money by investing in PixelTrade. Customers transfer money out of their bank accounts for all sorts of reasons: to make a gift, to pay a debt, to purchase goods, for investment, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. A bank must take care in carrying out a customer’s remittance instructions; but it owes no duty to ensure that the customer does not suffer loss as a result of his decision to remit the money. To take a simple example, if a customer remits money to buy gold, a bank is under no duty to check whether that is a good purchase or investment, let alone to reimburse the customer for any losses if the price of gold falls.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 None of the UOB representatives was cross-examined about Mr Poh’s negligence claim. The furthest Mr Poh’s counsel went was to ask Mr Wong whether <span class="font-italic">he</span> had been negligent in talking to Mr Poh about PixelTrade, when it was not a UOB-approved investment.

This was not pleaded, it was not put to Mr Wong, and Mr Poh led no evidence that the MAS approves investment products, let alone investments in foreign entities like PixelTrade (UK) Ltd. Further, Mr Poh had acknowledged in his letter of demand that it was only on 8 January 2018 (after Mr Poh’s two transfers to PixelTrade) that the MAS had issued an investor alert placing PixelTrade Technologies Pte Ltd and Pixel Group Holdings Pte Ltd on the MAS’s Investor Alert List.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For the above reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim with costs.
