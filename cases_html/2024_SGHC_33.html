</div> The case of <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Limited</span> involved a contract for the payment of Shares in a Share Purchase agreement. The case of <span class="font-italic">T2 Networks</span> concerned a settlement agreement that rode on a commercial contract. These are commercial contracts, which is not the nature of the agreement entered into in our present case. In the context of commercial contracts, the timing and scheduling of the payments are vital to ensure certainty of repayment where the failure to do so could affect parties' obligations to other parties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the form of back-to-back contracts), which would undermine commercial efficacy or create absurd results inconsistent with mercantile or commercial practice. However, the Oral Agreement, in our case, was not founded on a purely commercial premise. It was always intended to be more in the form of a friendly loan, a point that is bolstered by the fact that the Plaintiff claims zero interest on his purported loans. The timing or the schedule of payment was, therefore, not contemplated by the parties to be a material term of the Oral Agreement such that any uncertainty or incompleteness of these terms would render the entire agreement invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 While the Plaintiff relies on my earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Siemens Industry Software Pte Ltd v Lion Global Offshore Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 251 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens Industry</span>”) at [34] in support of its case that agreements entered outside the commercial context in a more friendly context cannot be expected to be drafted with the utmost precision, <span class="font-italic">Siemens Industry</span> does not strictly support the Plaintiff’s proposition as the case does not even concern an agreement entered in a friendly context. Instead, it concerned the issue of whether a licensed software designation agreement entered between two companies was void for uncertainty. The issue arose in a commercial context. There, I had made the following observation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34     Clearly, it is not always the case that the non-inclusion of the mode or time for payment of a sale renders a contract unenforceable for uncertainty. In <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 03.148, the learned authors rightly noted that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the courts do not expect commercial documents to be drafted with the outmost precision and certainty.

</div> the application of <span class="font-italic">the contra proferentem</span> rule is complicated by the absence of specific evidence regarding the exact words spoken during the meeting at the Ang Mo Kio coffeeshop, where the parties conversed in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien. The Plaintiff’s own evidence indicates that the Oral Agreement resulted from a dialogue between the Plaintiff and the Second Defendant, rather than a situation where the Second Defendant had unilaterally dictated the terms. Notably, the Plaintiff even affirmed that he himself had “specifically informed the Second Defendant again that [the Plaintiff] would have to be paid back whatever loans [the Plaintiff] extend[ed] to the First Defendant”.

In other words, a general consensus had, in fact, been reached among the parties regarding the Second Defendant’s proposal of setting up the First Defendant and the Plaintiff’s willingness to lend the First Defendant moneys for its startup, the events and the related costs.

</div> stated that the topic of the loans was discussed and that the Second Defendant had expressly informed the Plaintiff that the latter would be repaid whatever amounts he had lent to the First Defendant from the donations made to the First Defendant as long as the First Defendant has the moneys. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Based on the testimony of the participants of the meeting alone, it is certainly difficult to determine one way or another, whether the topic of loans to the First Defendant had been discussed. However, as in the usual course of determining whether a fact exists, regard must be had to all the circumstances of the case. In this context, documentary evidence often serves as a probative reference point to guide the court’s assessment of such points of fact. In my view, the documentary evidence that has been placed before me supports the Plaintiff’s case that there was, in fact, a general consensus reached between the parties at the Ang Mo Kio coffee shop meeting for the Plaintiff to provide loans to the First Defendant to assist in the setting up of the latter and to fund its activities. As I will consider in greater detail below at [66]–[93], such documentary evidence include: (a) the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details; (b) the First Defendant’s Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017; (c) emails from Second Defendant to First Defendant’s committee members containing the First Defendant’s audited financial statements and the confirmation that those will be the First Defendant’s accounts; and (d) the First Defendant’s audited financial statements for years of assessment 2020 and 2021. It suffices for me state at this juncture that the documentary evidence shows at the very least that the Plaintiff had, in fact, extended significant sums of moneys to the First Defendant as loans. In my view, this is best explained by the fact that the parties had at least discussed and reached a general consensus at the Ang Mo Kio coffee shop meeting regarding the willingness of the Plaintiff to loan the necessary funds for the establishment of the First Defendant and for its operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Furthermore, I consider it material that the Loan Acknowledgment contains an acknowledgment that the Plaintiff had loaned the substantial sum of $1,011,295.95. This is aligned with the parties having reached a general consensus for the Plaintiff to loan the First Defendants the necessary funds cover the expenses of the latter’s starting up, its activities and other related costs. The Loan Acknowledgment states that “[t]his amount shall be repaid with future collection”. While this is not exactly stated in the same precise terms as the General Understanding as pleaded by the Plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the “First Defendant would return the Plaintiff’s loans from the donations the First Defendant receives and as long as the First Defendant has monies”), I accept that the Loan Acknowledgment does at least cohere with the fact that there was a general consensus between the parties present for the Plaintiff to loan the First Defendants the necessary funds to cover the expenses of the latter’s starting up, its activities and other related costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The most important evidence pointing in favour of the transactions as recorded in the Transaction Details as being loans is that the First Defendant had expressly acknowledged, via the Loan Acknowledgment, the existence of loans from the Plaintiff during the AGM on 6 December 2018 and agreed that the moneys shall be repaid to the Plaintiff from its future collections. This is buttressed by the initial plans made at the Ang Mo Kio meeting which constitute the General Understanding that any loans extended by the Plaintiff would be repaid “from the donations the First Defendant receives and as long as the First Defendant has monies”. I am satisfied that the Transaction Details sets out an accurate record of the various transactions where the Plaintiff had extended moneys to the First Defendant and that <span class="font-italic">each and every one</span> of these transactions were <span class="font-italic">separate</span><span class="font-italic"> and distinct</span> loans provided to the First Defendant as and when the Plaintiff was notified of the First Defendant’s need for funds. On its face, the Transaction Details and Loan Acknowledgment provide probative evidence of the loans totalling $1,011,295.95 that the Plaintiff had extended to the First Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I do not consider the fact that the Acknowledgment and Transaction Details had only been signed by the Plaintiff, the Second Defendant, Mr Seet and Mr Wong Yong Hwa (“Mr Wong”) to mean that the documents do not therefore accurately set out the loans which the Plaintiff had dispensed to the First Defendant. The reason these documents had only been signed by the Plaintiff and three other committee members was because the Second Defendant had told the other committee members that those signatures alone would be sufficient. It is not because these other committee members had objected to the First Defendant owing any debts to the Plaintiff. Having reviewed the evidence, I find that the committee members who had been present at the AGM had, in fact, agreed to the loans which were presented by Mr Chen in the Transaction Details. As I will explain below, I reject the First Defendant’s claim that the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details had been signed only to placate the Plaintiff’s wife (see below at [78]). Furthermore, according to Mr Chen, the reason only Mr Seet, Mr Wong, the Second Defendant and the Plaintiff signed the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details was that it was the Second Defendant who had said the Plaintiff and three of the First Defendant’s committee members’ signatures would have sufficed. Mr Gary Chen also testified during the trial that after he explained the Transaction Details and the Plaintiff’s loans contained therein to the parties present, he had specifically asked whether anyone has any objections, and no one raised any objections.

That the witnesses had displayed the <span class="font-italic">same</span> about-face under cross-examination on the critical point of whether the Plaintiff had asked for an acknowledgement to placate his wife and had given his assurance that he would not enforce the acknowledgment leads me to question the veracity of the First Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had requested for the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details to placate his wife.

</div> Therefore, there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> explanation for why Mr Chew had stated in his AEIC that the Plaintiff had requested at the AGM for an acknowledgment that the moneys he donated were to be treated as loans, that this was to placate his wife and that the acknowledgment would not be enforced against the First Defendant. The inference to be drawn then is that this is untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Furthermore, as stated above at [67], Mr Gary Chen had expressly explained the Transaction Details to the persons present at the AGM and he had specifically asked whether anyone has any objections.

</div> In circumstances where the Plaintiff had said nothing during the AGM, where Mr Chen had expressly explained the Transaction Details to the persons present, and where nobody voiced an objection to the transactions, it was more likely than not that the persons present had agreed that the loans as recorded within the Transaction Details and the Loan Acknowledgment were representative of the true state of affairs regarding the loans owed by the First Defendant to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I pause here to add that the fact that the Transaction Details and Loan Acknowledgment depict the loans owed by the First Defendant is also supported by the Second Defendant’s signing of the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017, a document dating to a time before the AGM had occurred on 6 December 2018. This audited financial statement was also submitted to the ROS. Based on the Second Defendant’s evidence during trial, he confirmed that he was not forced to sign the Audited Financial Statements for YA 2017.

</div> This approximately tallies with and is consistent with the Transaction Details which states that the balance of loans owing to the Plaintiff as of 30 June 2017 stood at $607,335.97. The differences in figures may be reasonably explained by the fact that the figure in the Transaction Detail had been rounded up from $607,335.97 to the sum of $607,336 as reflected in the Audited Financial Statements for YA 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The weakness of the First Defendant’s claim that the documents were created merely to placate the Plaintiff’s wife is bolstered by the fact that when I had queried the Second Defendant whether the Plaintiff’s wife had ever gone to the premises of the First Defendant to cause trouble, his was answer was in the negative.

</div> if the Plaintiff’s wife had indeed been unhappy with the Plaintiff’s “donations”, the Plaintiff’s wife would likely have at least raised this issue with the First Defendant. However, as the Second Defendant accepts, not once did the Plaintiff’s wife show up at the premises of the First Defendant. While it may be indeed be <span class="font-italic">possible</span> that the Plaintiff had been upset with the Plaintiff and that this was the reason why the Plaintiff had procured the signing of the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details, this, again, is ultimately the burden of the First Defendant to show. The First Defendant has adduced no objective evidence of the purportedly unhappy state of affairs between the Plaintiff and his wife in support of its case. It was no insignificant matter for the committee members of the First Defendant to sign onto the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details as it would have exposed the First Defendant to a liability to pay a debt of over a million dollars to the Plaintiff. In these circumstances, one would have expected there to have been records of the purported scheme between the Plaintiff and the First Defendant to prepare the false loan acknowledgment and that this was not intended to have any legal effect. Such records could have come in the form of chat messages between the Plaintiff and the Second Defendant or other committee members of the First Defendant. There are simply no such records, as the Second Defendant himself accepted under cross-examination.

</div>
</div> I reject this submission. It is important to be clear that the basis for the Plaintiff’s claim in debt does <span class="font-italic">not</span> arise ipso facto from the Loan Acknowledgment or the Transaction Details. Neither does it stem from the Oral Agreement, a finding which I have reached above at [56], although I accept that the General Understanding was likely to have been reached by the persons present as part of the initial discussions, plans and financial arrangements made (as would be expected) prior to the formation of the First Defendant. Rather, the basis for the Plaintiff’s claim in debt lies in the <span class="font-italic">discrete</span> loans made by the Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">each and every time</span> he had extended moneys as loans to the First Defendant. The Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details are relevant only insofar as they provide <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> on the existence of these loan transactions. The General Understanding is relevant as <span class="font-italic">evidence </span>of the background that led to the later disbursements of the discrete loans by the Plaintiff to the First Defendant. Accordingly, the First Defendant’s objections that the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details had been signed contrary to the First Defendant’s constitution and are therefore invalid, are strictly speaking, besides the point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I also do not find merit in the First Defendant’s argument that the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details are inadmissible hearsay. The documents had been signed by the First Defendant’s committee members comprising Mr Seet, Mr Wong, the Second Defendant and the Plaintiff. As I have found above at [67], all committee members present at the AGM where the documents were signed had agreed that the loans as recorded within the Transaction Details and the Loan Acknowledgment were representative of the actual state of affairs. The fact that the documents were signed by only Mr Seet, Mr Wong, the Second Defendant and the Plaintiff did not mean that the documents were not assented to by the First Defendant.

</div>
</div> To the contrary, the evidence points to them having been conferred with the implied authority to assent to the Loan Acknowledgment by signing it. The Second Defendant had told the other committee members that those signatures alone would be sufficient. The Transaction Details and the Loan Acknowledgment thus amount to admissions by the First Defendant of the quantum of the loans owing to the Plaintiff under s 17(1) of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Next, I disagree with the First Defendant’s fall-back argument that the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details, if admissible, should be excluded for being against the interests of justice under s 32(3) of the EA. The First Defendant has questioned the correctness of some of the calculations in the documents, pointing out in particular that the sum of $1,011,295.95 as stated in the Loan Acknowledgement does not tally with the figures contained in the financial statements dated 30 June 2017 ($607,336) and 30 June 2018 ($740,885). The First Defendant also avers that there may have been a concern that the auditors tasked with the preparation of the Transaction Details may not be as thorough in its audit in view of its relationship with the Plaintiff. Therefore, the First Defendant submits that it would not be in the interests of justice to admit the documents without the opportunity of the auditors being cross-examined on the methodologies used and the basis of their findings, which would undermine the reliability of the documents and their accuracy.

</div> Again, it bears emphasis that Mr Gary Chen had shared with the parties present during the AGM that the amount owing to the Plaintiff was $1,011,295.95. The parties present at the AGM did not raise any queries or objections to the figures that were presented to them. Again, I have found above at [67] that the committee members present were aware of and had in fact agreed to the existence of the Plaintiff’s loans. Whatever inaccuracies there might have been in the figures (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether they tallied with the First Defendant’s financial statements), these could have and should have been raised at the AGM. This was not done. Accordingly, I do not find this to be a proper case to exercise this Court’s discretion to exclude the Loan Acknowledgment and the Transaction Details in the interests of justice under s 32(3) of the EA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Finally, the First Defendant submits that the loan of $150,000 by Mr Lim Swee Chong, a loan of $50,000 recorded under the name of Mr Chen, and a loan of $25,881.64 due to Choon Hin Iron Works Pte Ltd should be excluded from the loans owed by the First Defendant.

</div> This serves as supporting evidence that substantial loans, rather than gifts of up to $607,336 had, at the very least, been given by the Plaintiff to the temple as of 30 June 2017. As explained at [74] above, the fact that this approximately tallies with the Transaction Details, which states that the balance of loans owing to the Plaintiff as of 30 June 2017 stood at $607,335.97, serves as confirmatory evidence of the <span class="font-italic">accuracy</span> of the Transaction Details in recording the Plaintiff’s loans to the First Defendant.

</div> In his attempts to explain away the damning evidence in the form of the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017, the Second Defendant had claimed during the trial initially that at that time:

</div> (a) he did not see the figure of $607,336 contained in the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017; (b) he only flipped through the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017 to confirm the date; (c) he could not recall submitting the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017 to the ROS; and (d) he did not think he had submitted audited financial statements to the ROS. However, as the Plaintiff points out, none of the Second Defendant’s explanations hold water. When the Second Defendant was cross-examined, his evidence conveniently changed on the stand where he not only admitted to submitting the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017 to the ROS, but he had even used the figures contained in the Audited Financial Statement for YA 2017 for purposes of submission to the ROS.

</div> Mr Seet had also testified that he did not raise any objections, did not even speak to the Second Defendant on the email, and left it as it was. Mr Seet had claimed that as he had only intended to be a temporary chairman then, he did not bother to look into so many things. By the time it became known to him that he would be the permanent chairman, Mr Seet maintained that he still did not bother to look when he stated “Yeah, I have missed out after the confirmation”.

</div> I find Mr Seet’s explanation hard to believe. When considered with Mr Seet’s own evidence that even after the First Defendant’s new auditors, JP Auditor, informed him of the Plaintiff’s loans in the audited financial statements, Mr Seet did nothing about these purportedly false loans and simply allowed the Plaintiff’s loans to be carried forward to the audited financial statements for the following year. Since the purportedly false loans were of a very significant amount, I would have expected Mr Seet to do something about them. The more likely inference was that Mr Seet did not object to the Second Defendant’s Email of 25 April 2019 because he was well aware of the Plaintiff’s loans, particularly when Mr Seet was the one of the committee members who had signed on both the Loan Acknowledgment and the Transaction Details during the AGM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Turning then to Mr Hong’s evidence, he had similarly confirmed receiving the Second Defendant’s Email of 25 April 2019 at that time. However, Mr Hong claimed that he merely skimmed through the Second Defendant’s Email and did not even bother clarifying with the Second Defendant. As with Mr Seet, I am satisfied that the more likely reason why Mr Hong did not object to the Second Defendant’s Email of 25 April 2019 was that he was well aware of the Plaintiff’s loans and that the First Defendant had even provided the Plaintiff with the Loan Acknowledgment during the AGM.

If the recording of the Plaintiff’s loan had indeed been a false depiction of the actual state of affairs and that any loans were merely fabricated in an attempt to placate the Plaintiff’s wife (a point I have rejected above at [78]), it is difficult to see why the First Defendant was content to continue with the façade year after year, long after the Plaintiff had ceased his involvement with the First Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I am not convinced by Mr Hong’s attempts at explaining away the First Defendant’s Audited Financial Statements for the years of assessment 2020 and 2021 on the basis that the figures were merely carried forward figures from previous years and hence were not indicative of the Plaintiff’s loans.

</div> When I probed Mr Hong Kok Leong further on who had told him that the Plaintiff’s loans, if wrong, should still be carried forward and whether this was told to him by the accountants, Mr Hong admitted that it was his own thinking and agreed that his failure to rectify the carried forward figures was made in error.

</div> I do not believe that this was the true explanation for why the Plaintiff’s loans had been carried forward in the audited financial statements despite Mr Hong’s misgivings about the existence of these loans. Given the substantial documentary evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s loans in the form of the Loan Acknowledgement, Transaction Details and the financial statement for the YA 2017, the more likely explanation for the carrying forward of the Plaintiff’s loans is that these loans did exist in fact, and this was known to Mr Hong. Contrary to Mr Hong's claims, he did not contest the existence of these loans and had been content for the loans to be left recorded within the Audited Financial Statements for the years of assessment 2020 and 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The fact that the payments were not recorded in donation slips, unlike the usual practice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 As the First Defendant’s bank account was only set up after the First Defendant’s first Kew Ong Yah event, the Plaintiff had on various occasions passed cash to either Mr Wong, Mr Lee or Mr Chen, such that they could make such miscellaneous payments to the various third-party suppliers during the Kew Ong Yah event. I accept that it was more likely than not that the Plaintiff had expressly informed them that unless stated otherwise, his monetary contributions to the First Defendant were to be treated as loans to the First Defendant, with such contributions being unrecorded on any donation slip.

</div> Were it otherwise, they would most likely have issued the Plaintiff a donation slip for every donation he had made. This is all the more likely given the Plaintiff’s evidence that where he had expressly intended to make a donation, he would have informed them accordingly to ensure that this was recorded in a donation slip.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having reviewed the evidence concerning the meetings above, I agree that there would have been nothing unusual in the Second Defendant thanking the Plaintiff for providing financial assistance to the First Defendant. After all, the Plaintiff’s financial assistance was essential to fund the initial set up costs and the subsequent events of the First Defendant. However, I agree with the First Defendant that the evidence does not go so far as to show on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff had been thanked for the <span class="font-italic">specific reason</span> that the Plaintiff had extended loans to the First Defendant. The evidence of the parties present at these meetings is divided. In the absence of documentary proof such as minutes recording of these expressions of thanks and that they were given in response to the Plaintiff’s loans, it is difficult to determine, even on a balance of probabilities, the precise scope of the Second Defendant’s expression of thanks. The expression of thanks could be explained by the Plaintiff’s generous donations just as well as it could be explained by the Plaintiff’s loans to the First Defendant. I would add that it would be unusual for the Plaintiff to be thanked on so many different occasions for his loans and that he would be repaid his loans, particularly in such a public setting. In any event, it is ultimately immaterial whether the Plaintiff had indeed been thanked for his loans at these meetings, as I do not rest my finding that the Plaintiff had indeed made loans aggregating to the sum of $1,011,295.95 on the purported expression of gratitude at these meetings. As explained above at [59], I prefer to rest my finding that the Plaintiff has made out his claim in debt on objective, documentary evidence in the form of the Loan Acknowledgment, Transaction Details and the audited financial statements of the First Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The loans are repayable on demand</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Having found that the Plaintiff has made out his case that he had made loans amounting to $1,011,295.95 to the First Defendant, a question arises as to the repayment terms for such loans. In this regard, I am guided by the statement of law in <span class="font-italic">Ang Boon Tian</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jervois Pte Ltd and another </span>[2022] SGHC 104 at [61], citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Law of Singapore</span> vol 12 (LexisNexis, 2022 Reissue) at para 140.755 that “[u]nless expressly or implied agreed upon otherwise, money lent, whether by way of a loan or overdraft, is repayable on demand.” Thus, even though no specific repayment dates were stipulated for the loans as stated in the Loan Acknowledgment and the Transaction Details, the Plaintiff’s loans are repayable on demand. In any case, it appears that the loans were expressly stipulated to be repayable on demand as can be seen from the First Defendant’s audited financial statements which record the amounts owing to the Plaintiff (then President of the First Defendant) as being “repayable on demand”.

</div> In my view, the Plaintiff has not shown on a balance of probabilities that these sums had been paid to the Second Defendant as loans. Unlike the Plaintiff’s claim for the sum of $1,011,295.95, for which the Loan Acknowledgment and Transaction Details provide objective proof that these were intended to be loans, the same cannot be said for the payments made <span class="font-italic">before </span>the registration of the First Defendant. Had these sums been intended to be loans, the Plaintiff would have logically ensured they were recorded within the Transaction Details. There is little reason why this could not have been done given that the Transaction Details sets out a detailed list of loans made by the Plaintiff to the First Defendant. In these circumstances, I find that the Plaintiff has not made out his claim that the three payments referred to at [101] above were given in the form of loans.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claim in unjust enrichment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Given my finding that the Plaintiff has made out its claim in debt against the First Defendant on the basis that the sum of $1,011,295.95 was loaned to the First Defendant, the issue of unjust enrichment no longer arises.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The remaining claims against the Second Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Finally, I turn to address the Plaintiff’s claims against the Second Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Second Defendant is not personally liable under the Oral Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Continuing from the analysis above that the First Defendant is not liable under the Oral Agreement, I turn to address a related issue raised by the Plaintiff.

</div> My answer to this question is “no” for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 First, as I have stated above, the Plaintiff has made out its claim that the First Defendant is liable to repay the loan of $1,011,295.95. In these circumstances, no question of liability on the part of the Second Defendant arises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Second, even if I am wrong on this and that the Plaintiff has, in fact, failed to make out its case on the loans, I add that I would not have considered the Second Defendant to be personally liable for the purported loans to the First Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 According to the Plaintiff, when asked if an agreement was made “with the temple to be proposed or was it with Mr. Eric Goh?” the Plaintiff replied that “[i]t was Eric Goh, because the temple was yet to be registered at that time.”

</div> However, I am not persuaded that an agreement had been formed with the Second Defendant personally as the Plaintiff has alleged. The fact that the Second Defendant did not receive any portion of the purported loans fortifies my conclusion that the Second Defendant is not personally liable under the Oral Agreement. There is no evidence to suggest that the Second Defendant received any portion of the loan amount as a personal loan from the Plaintiff.

</div> All the funds were either directly deposited into the First Defendant's bank account or used for the First Defendant’s purposes. The Plaintiff’s testimony during cross-examination confirms that he lent money to the First Defendant by paying suppliers directly or depositing funds into the First Defendant’s bank account. Again, there is no evidence that any of the Plaintiff’s loans were handed to the Second Defendant for his personal use. There is also no evidence of any intention on the part of the Plaintiff to lend moneys to the Second Defendant or any intention on the part of the Second Defendant to borrow any moneys from the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I further observe that the Plaintiff and the Second Defendant, including some others at the Ang Mo Kio coffee shop meeting, were all parties interested in setting up the First Defendant. There is no specific reason why the Second Defendant should be the <span class="font-italic">only</span> one identified by the Plaintiff to be made personally liable since these persons at the meeting (including the Second Defendant) were all parties equally interested in setting up the First Defendant. They were promoters of the temple to be set up. I do not believe that the Second Defendant was the one solely interested in setting up the temple for himself, which was to be registered subsequently. The rest including the Plaintiff himself who subsequently became the chairman of the First Defendant was just as interested in setting up the temple. There is no basis therefore for the Plaintiff to pick the Second Defendant as the one who is to be made personally liable should the First Defendant not be set up subsequently for whatever reason. In any event, the First Defendant was subsequently set up, and therefore, the personal liability of the Second Defendant does not appear to arise on the facts.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As the Second Defendant rightly points out, there is no absolute rule of law to the effect that where a person contracts on behalf of a non-existent principal, he is himself automatically liable on the contract.

</div> The Plaintiff relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">Quah Poh Hoe Peter v Probo Pacific Leasing Pte Ltd</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 400 (“<span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span>”) to submit that the Second Defendant remains personally liable under the Oral Agreement even though it was made between the Plaintiff and the then-non-existent First Defendant. According to the Plaintiff, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span> had considered the issue of whether an agent purporting to act for a non-existent principal would be personally bound by the contract and held at [18] that “[s]ince the second defendant in the present case entered into the <span class="font-italic">Elke</span> lease for and on behalf of CMCS which is non-existent, we are of the opinion that he would also be personally bound by the lease under the principle in <span class="font-italic">Kelner v Baxter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[(1866) LRCP 174].” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span> does not assist the Plaintiff. In <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span>, the lease agreement involved a purported company under the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CA”) that was non-existent. The First Defendant was never intended to be a registered company in the present case.

</div> Consequently, the statutory provision relied upon in <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span>, namely s 41 of the CA, is inapplicable, and there is no similar provision under the Societies Act. The Second Defendant, therefore, cannot be treated as being personally bound under the Oral Agreement by operation of statute. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal had imputed personal liability on the purported agent in <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span> by way of an unrebutted presumption after considering that the agent had signed the <span class="font-italic">Elke</span> lease <span class="font-italic">for and on behalf of</span> the non-existent company.

</div> On the facts of that case, the yacht had been physically leased out and the rent of $8,438 was payable monthly in advance for six years commencing 14 May 1983. However, as the Second Defendant notes, <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span> starkly contrasts with the present case. The Second Defendant is not mentioned in the Oral Agreement. The purported loan by the Plaintiff was specifically intended for the setting up of the First Defendant, which is consistent with the borrower being the First Defendant itself rather than an individual such as the Second Defendant. Indeed, the repayment terms specifically pertain to features which make sense only in relation to the First Defendant, such as donations, and that repayment is contingent upon the First Defendant’s financial capacity, rather than being due on demand or on a fixed date.

</div> Hence, while substituting the purported agent for the non-existent company was feasible on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Probo Pacific</span> given that it concerned a straightforward lease agreement, the same cannot be said for the present case. Substituting the Second Defendant for the First Defendant under the Oral Agreement would lead to an unworkable and absurd contract.

The original terms of the Oral Agreement are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whatever amounts I loan to the new temple for its start up, its events and the related cost, this new temple will return my loans from the donations the new temple receives as long as the First Defendant has monies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The revised terms of the Oral Agreement with the First Defendant being substituted for the Second Defendant:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whatever amounts I loan to the Second Defendant for the Second Defendant’s start up, the Second Defendant’s events and the related cost, this Second Defendant will return my loans from the donations the Second Defendant receives as long as the Second Defendant has monies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Applying the substituted terms of the Oral Agreement, as claimed by the Plaintiff, would render the contract unworkable because the Second Defendant does not receive personal donations. It was not even suggested during the cross-examination of the Second Defendant that he regularly receives personal donations, which would have been absurd in any case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I deal then with the Plaintiff’s attempt to correct the alleged terms of the Oral Agreement where in response to my question on the precise framing of the terms of the Oral Agreement, the Plaintiff had stated that the use of the word “donations” in the terms of the Oral Agreement was not entirely accurate, and that the more appropriate term would be “collections”.

</div> No evidence was adduced regarding what “collections” would mean when specifically applied to the Second Defendant. This matter was left unclarified, and the Second Defendant was not cross-examined on this point. The fact that the Plaintiff only provided examples of “collections” that were specific to the First Defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, monetary donations and proceeds from auctions at temple events, strongly suggests that the Oral Agreement was never intended to be enforced against, and is indeed unenforceable against, the Second Defendant personally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Even if, for the sake of argument, the original terms were applied, namely that repayment is to be made from the donations or collections received by the First Defendant, the Second Defendant cannot be personally liable under such terms simply because he has no legal entitlement over the funds received by the First Defendant such that he could even return them to the Plaintiff.

It is a general principle that every person acting as an agent is deemed to represent that they have the necessary authority to act unless the other contracting party is aware of the true nature and extent of the agent’s authority. In other words, if the contracting party is aware of facts that indicate the agent lacks authority, a claim for breach of warranty of authority cannot be upheld.
