        George Wei J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 6 July 2011, a 9-year old boy, the plaintiff
                    in this case (hereinafter, “the Plaintiff”), was knocked down by a
                    vehicle driven by the defendant (hereinafter, “the Defendant”)
                    along Jurong East Avenue 1. He sustained severe, permanent injuries from the
                    accident. He is now a quadriplegic who requires constant care. His life
                    expectancy has been greatly reduced; doctors estimate that he would live only to
                    the age of 38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 13 December 2012, the Plaintiff (via his
                    litigation representative) commenced a suit against the Defendant. By consent,
                    interlocutory judgment was entered against the Defendant on 31 July 2013. It
                    ordered that judgment “be entered in this action in favour of the
                    Plaintiff for 100% against the Defendant with damages and interest and costs to
                    be reserved to the Registrar”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The matter went before the learned assistant
                    registrar (“the AR”) for an assessment of damages. The AR
                    delivered her judgment on 21 November 2014, awarding the Plaintiff a global sum
                    of $1,252,825.86 with interest, and making an award for provisional damages (see
                    [2014] SGHCR 21, hereinafter referred to as “the AR’s
                    Judgment”). Dissatisfied with the AR’s decision, the parties both
                    filed appeals and the matter came before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AR’s order and the parties’ appeals</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">AR’s order</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       For general damages, the AR awarded the
                    Plaintiff the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     pain and suffering assessed at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For interest, the AR ordered that interest is to
                    be applied at half of 5.33% on special damages from the date of service of writ
                    to the date of judgment, and interest at 5.33% on general damages for pain and
                    suffering from the date of service of writ to the date of
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The AR also ordered that the Plaintiff may apply
                    for future damages to be assessed if he requires a permanent tracheostomy as a
                    result of contracting pneumonia within three years of her order
                    (“Provisional Damages Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Costs of the assessment of damages hearing was
                    fixed at $85,000, plus Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) and
                    disbursements to be agreed or taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In Registrar’s Appeal No 377 of 2014,
                    the Plaintiff appeals against part of the AR’s award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In relation to special damages, the Plaintiff
                    appeals against the AR’s award of S$43,882.80 for the mother’s
                    pre-trial loss of earnings and employer’s CPF contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In relation to general damages, the Plaintiff
                    appeals against the following awards:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff’s loss of future
                        earnings assessed at $233,878.14;</p>

                        expenses for daily consumables and essentials assessed at
                    $46,800;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     mother’s loss of future earnings and employer’s CPF

                        application assessed at $2,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Plaintiff also appeals against the
                    AR’s award of interest. However, no submissions were made on this before
                    me. I therefore find no basis to vary the AR’s award of
                interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In Registrar’s Appeal No 383 of 2014,
                    the Defendant appeals against the following awards and orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff’s loss of future
                        earnings assessed at $233,878.14;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     mother’s loss of future earnings and
                        employer’s CPF contributions assessed at $235,248;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Provisional Damages Order;
                        and</p>

                        at $85,000.00 plus GST.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this judgment, I propose to deal with the
                    issues raised on appeal in the following order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     mother’s pre-trial loss of
                        earnings and employer’s CPF contribution at
                    $43,882.80;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     future
                        medical expenses assessed at $317,380.75;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     cost of future nursing care assessed at

                        contributions assessed at $235,248;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     future transport expenses assessed at
                    $23,520;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_f"></a>(f)     future
                        expenses for daily consumables and essentials assessed at
                    $46,800;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_g"></a>(g)     Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings assessed at

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_h"></a>(h)     the

                disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Dealing with the issues in this sequence
                    generally enables me to dispose of the issues which are relatively less complex
                    and more factual in nature, before discussing the heads of appeal that involve
                    more complex questions of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the sake of clarity, I note that there is
                        <em>no appeal</em> on the following awards made by the
                    AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     pre-trial medical expenses agreed at
                        $35,201.12;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     pre-trial transport expenses agreed at $6,500;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     pre-trial domestic help expenses agreed at
                        $11,994.85; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     damages for pain and suffering assessed at $190,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">High Court’s role in a Registrar’s Appeal on assessment
                of damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As a preliminary, it is important to clarify
                    the role of a High Court judge who hears an appeal from an assistant registrar
                    on assessment of damages under O 56 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The authorities establish that the judge in
                    chambers hears the matter not as an appeal in the true sense of the word, but
                    deals with the Registrar’s Appeal on assessment of damages as if the
                    matter came before him for the first time: <em>Chang Ah Lek v Lim
                        Ah Koon</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 551 at [20], affirmed in <em>Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David</em> [2013] 4 SLR 718
                        (“<em>Tan Boon Heng</em>”) at
                    [16].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Indeed, the Court of Appeal helpfully
                    explained in <em>Tan Boon Heng</em> at [16] that in
                    assessing damages, the assistant registrar is “exercising powers and
                    jurisdiction devolved to him from those vested in a High Court judge”.
                    Therefore, “a judge in chambers who hears a Registrar’s Appeal is
                    not exercising an appellate jurisdiction - for that term would only be accurate
                    and applicable where the appealed decision emanates from an inferior court or
                    tribunal - but <em>confirmatory</em> jurisdiction
                    instead”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     There are practical implications to the fact
                    that the judge in chambers exercises a <em>confirmatory</em>, rather than <em>appellate</em>, jurisdiction. For one, the judge is not confined to
                    interfering with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion only if
                    damages were assessed on wrong principles of law or misapprehensions of fact:
                        <em>Tan Boon Heng</em> at [18]. Instead, the judge is
                    entitled to exercise his discretion afresh, while giving due weight to the
                    assistant registrar’s decision: <em>Tan Boon
                        Heng</em> at [21]. Second, the judge also has a wider discretion to
                    admit new evidence and even recall witnesses: <em>Lassiter Ann
                        Masters v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 392 at
                    [10] and [22]. Indeed, both parties helpfully brought the case <em>Swiss Butchery Pte Ltd v Huber Ernst and others and another
                        suit</em> [2013] 4 SLR 381 to this court’s attention, where the
                    High Court did recall witnesses in a Registrar’s Appeal on assessment of
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Whilst the judge can exercise his discretion
                    afresh, unfettered by the assistant registrar’s decision, it must be borne
                    in mind that the assistant registrar still has the advantage of having heard the
                    oral evidence of the witnesses first hand. As the Court of Appeal noted in
                        <em>Tan Boon Heng</em> at [24], a distinction must be
                    drawn between findings of fact based solely on affidavit and documentary
                    evidence, and findings based partly or wholly on oral evidence. The Court of
                    Appeal had made the following observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Where the assistant
                        registrar’s findings of fact are based on oral evidence, the standard
                        of review “should be the same as that applied to a trial
                        judge’s factual findings on appeal to the Court of Appeal - so that
                        these findings may be overturned only if they are plainly wrong or against
                        the weight of the evidence”: <em>Tan Boon
                            Heng</em> at [43].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where the assistant registrar’s findings of fact
                        are based on affidavit and documentary evidence, the judge is in no less
                        advantageous a position, and hence, may make his own findings afresh,
                        unfettered by the assistant registrar’s judgment: <em>Tan Boon Heng</em> at [44].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is with the above principles in mind, that
                    I consider the present appeals before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The AR awarded the Plaintiff damages of
                    $43,882.80 for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings. I briefly set out
                    her reasoning, which can be found at [102]–[103] of the AR’s
                    Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102    Prior to the accident, the mother was working as a
                            receptionist in a law firm … and was drawing a monthly salary of
                            $1,300, excluding employer’s CPF contribution of $208. As a result
                            of the accident, she had to quit her job to take care of the plaintiff
                            full-time. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103    In respect of the mother’s pre-trial loss of
                            earnings, I allowed the claim at $1,508 (including employer’s CPF)
                            per month for a period of 29 months and 3 days, being the time from the
                            date of the accident to the commencement of the assessment hearing on 10
                            December 2013. I arrived at the sum of $43,882.80.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Plaintiff appeals against the multiplier
                    of 29 months and three days used by the AR. He submits that “the
                    multiplier should be assessed from the date of the accident [<em>ie</em>, July 2011] to the end of the assessment hearing in April
                    2014 (being a period of 33 months and 24 days)”. According to the
                    Plaintiff, the AR was wrong to award the Plaintiff damages under this head
                        <em>only</em> up to the date of the commencement of the
                    assessment hearing on 10 December 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At the hearing before me, the Defendant made
                    no objections to the Plaintiff’s appeal and submissions on this
                    front.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I agree with the Plaintiff that he should have
                    been awarded damages for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings up to the
                    end of the assessment hearing in April 2014. The following statement in
                        <em>British Transport Commission v Gourley</em> [1956]
                    AC 185 at 206 is helpful:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two
                        main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage, which has
                        to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses
                        and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally
                        capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general
                        damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes
                        compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries
                        suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability,
                        compensation for loss of earning power in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Special damages are accordingly those which at
                    trial are capable of substantially exact calculation. This particular head is
                    recoverable on the basis that it is part of the Plaintiff’s loss (see
                    discussion at [86] below). If his mother did not stop work, the Plaintiff would
                    have had to engage a full-time nurse. I note in passing that what is important
                    is that there should be no overlap with the claim for loss of future earnings
                    for the mother (which is dealt with later).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Therefore, I award the Plaintiff $50,970.40
                    for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings. I derive the figure in the
                    following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$1,508 x 33 months + $1,508 x 24 days / 30 days =
                                <b>$50,970.40</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appropriate multiplier for future expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before discussing the Plaintiff’s appeal
                    on the damages awarded for the different types of future expenses he would
                    incur, I first deal with the Plaintiff’s appeal on the <em>multiplier</em> that should be applied for future expenses generally.
                    My decision on this would affect the damages awarded for all the heads of claim
                    relating to the Plaintiff’s future expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The AR determined the multiplier for future
                    expenses based on the Plaintiff’s life expectancy at the date of trial.
                    The parties’ medical experts agreed that the Plaintiff had 27 more years
                    to live. The AR’s decision was therefore based on a life expectancy of 27
                    more years. After considering the case authorities, the AR applied a discount
                    and held that a multiplier of <u>12 years</u> was fair
                    and reasonable. It is worth noting that before the AR, the Defendant submitted
                    that a multiplier of 12 years should apply, while the Plaintiff submitted that a
                    multiplier of 18 years should apply (27 years subject to a 33% reduction in view
                    of accelerated payment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Plaintiff appeals against the AR’s
                    decision that a 12-year multiplier should apply for future expenses generally.
                    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that the appropriate multiplier should at least
                    be 16 years. The Plaintiff relies on the Court of Appeal’s <em>dicta</em> in <em>Lai Wai Keong Eugene v Loo
                        Wei Yen</em> [2014] 3 SLR 702 (“<em>Lai Wai
                        Keong Eugene</em>”) at [43] that a 15-year multiplier for an
                    appellant with a lifespan of 30 years “while perhaps on the low side,
                    remains within the range contemplated by the authorities”. On this basis,
                    the Plaintiff argues that if a 15-year multiplier is “on the low
                    side” for a plaintiff with 30 years to live, a 16-year multiplier is more
                    appropriate in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Court of Appeal in <em>Poh
                        Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin</em>
                    [2012] 3 SLR 1003 (“<em>Hafizul</em>”) at
                    [48] and [54] endorsed two possible approaches to determining the appropriate
                    multiplier: the first, is to “fix the multiplier by looking at the
                    multipliers used in comparable cases” (see [48(a)]), and the second, is
                    to “apply a pure arithmetical discount” for accelerated payment,
                    contingencies, inflation, and other vicissitudes of life (see [48(b)]). This was
                    affirmed in <em>Lai Wai Keong Eugene</em> at
                    [19]–[22]. In particular, the Court of Appeal in <em>Lai
                        Wai Keong Eugene</em> clarified that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The second approach is not
                        invariably to be preferred over the first approach (see
                    [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The court
                        may have to apply the first approach exclusively if evidence on interest
                        rates, inflation rates, possible contingencies <em>etc</em>, are lacking (see [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even in the application of the second approach,
                        the figure derived should be “cross-checked with the multipliers used
                        in past cases so as to achieve consistency with cases involving
                        similarly-situated plaintiffs” (see [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It is also worth noting the court’s
                    remarks in <em>Hafizul</em> at [54]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… That said, a blind adherence to the multipliers in previous cases
                        is not desirable. The court should consider in each case whether the
                        previous cases are truly comparable, and should not hesitate to depart from
                        the multipliers used in previous cases if the circumstances call for
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Indeed, it seems to me that in the absence of
                    specific evidence on interest rates, inflation <em>etc</em>, the court has no choice but to rely exclusively on past
                    precedents. Deducing a figure from past cases is undoubtedly not an exact
                    science. There must be no illusion of mathematical precision. There is no rule
                    of law in Singapore stipulating specific rates of discount. The court therefore
                    only has the principles of consistency, proportionality, and its own sense of
                    fairness and justice to guide it in determining the appropriate
                    multiplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the present case, no evidence was provided
                    to the court below, or to me, on the factors a court may consider under the
                    second approach in <em>Hafizul</em>. Neither party
                    attempted to adduce evidence on, for example, the contingencies the Plaintiff
                    was at higher risk of suffering from pre-accident, deposit interest rates, or
                    inflation rates in their submissions on the appropriate multiplier for future
                    expenses. Nothing about the specific facts of the Plaintiff’s case was
                    brought to my attention by either side for especial consideration in determining
                    the appropriate multiplier. I am thus left to broadly decide the appropriate
                    multiplier for future expenses based on case precedents and the general facts
                    before me. I repeat that such an exercise of discretion inevitably involves a
                    broad-brushed exercise of judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In coming to my decision, I took into account
                    the following case precedents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Lai Wai Keong
                            Eugene</em>, the Court of Appeal affirmed a 15-year multiplier for
                        a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 30 years, notwithstanding it noted
                        that this was a bit low (see [43]). The plaintiff was 34 years old at the
                        time of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>Haifizul</em>, the Court of Appeal
                        affirmed an 18-year multiplier for a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 34
                        years. The plaintiff was 29 years old at the time of the accident (see [72]
                        and [76]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
                            <em>TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi</em>
                        and another appeal [2004] 3 SLR(R) 543 (“<em>TV
                            Media</em>”), the court awarded a 17-year multiplier for a
                        plaintiff with a remaining life expectancy of 51 years. The plaintiff was 27
                        years old when her liver failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>Tan Juay Mui (by his next friend
                            Chew Chwee Kim) v Sher Kuan Hock and another (Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd,
                            co-defendant; Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd and another, third
                            parties)</em> [2012] 3 SLR 496 (“<em>Tan
                            Juay Mui</em>”), the court affirmed a 17-year multiplier
                        for a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 32 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     In <em>Ang Leng Hock v
                            Leo Ee Ah</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 361, a 15-year multiplier (reduced
                        from 20) was awarded to a plaintiff with a life expectancy of approximately
                        25 to 30 years. The plaintiff was 41 years old at the time of the
                        accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I observe that courts seem to generally award
                    a multiplier that is roughly half of the plaintiff’s expected life
                    expectancy. In making this observation, I do not intend in any way to lay down a
                    rule. The circumstances of a particular case may justify deviations and indeed,
                    “outliers” such as <em>TV Media</em> do
                    exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Based on the authorities, the AR’s
                    decision on the multiplier of 12-years cannot be said to be wrong as a matter of
                    principle. Nevertheless, I repeat that in the appeals before me, I am entitled
                    to exercise my discretion afresh. Due deference need only be paid to the
                    AR’s judgment where findings of fact based on oral evidence are concerned.
                    The decision on the multiplier certainly was not based on any oral evidence
                    heard by the AR. Bearing in mind the general facts of the present case and the
                    past decisions, the appropriate multiplier in my judgment, is 14
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I thus allow the Plaintiff’s appeal (in
                    part), and find that the appropriate multiplier for the Plaintiff’s future
                    expenses <em>generally</em> should be 14 years, and not 12
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future medical expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The AR awarded the Plaintiff $317,380.75 for
                    future medical expenses. For clarity, I cite the breakdown of the AR’s
                    award for future medical expenses found at [97] of the AR’s
                    Judgment:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Plaintiff is only appealing against the
                    awards highlighted in bold. Obviously, his main complaint is that the quantum
                    awarded by the AR is too low for various reasons. The Plaintiff additionally
                    appeals against the AR’s failure to award any damages for outpatient
                    medication. The Defendant is not appealing against the AR’s award for
                    future medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I shall consider the Plaintiff’s appeal
                    on future medical expenses in the following order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     limb splints;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     treatment for
                    pneumonia;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     physiotherapy sessions; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     outpatient medication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It may have been noted that I did not include
                    in the above outline the appeal relating to the costs for the treatment for
                    URTI, the wheelchair, and medical consultations. This is because the
                    Plaintiff’s appeal in relation to those three aspects of future medical
                    expenses relates <em>only</em> to the appropriate
                    multiplier to be applied. The Plaintiff only objects to the AR’s award on
                    the grounds that she applied a 12-year multiplier, rather than their desired
                    16-year multiplier. Given that I have already decided that the appropriate
                    multiplier for future expenses is 14 years, there is no need for me to further
                    discuss the Plaintiff’s appeal on the costs for treatment for URTI, the
                    wheelchair, and medical consultations. I make the following awards in relation
                    to these three items:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     For treatment for URTI, I award the
                        Plaintiff $205,016 instead of the $175,728 awarded by the AR. I derive the
                        figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>$523 x 4 days x 7 admissions per year x 14 years =
                            $205,016</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     For wheelchair costs, I award the Plaintiff $14,000 instead of the
                        $12,000 awarded by the AR. I derive the figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>$5,000 per wheelchair x (14-year multiplier / 5 years) =
                            $14,000</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     For medical consultations, I award the Plaintiff $3,500 instead of
                        the $3,000 awarded by the AR. The evidence was that the rates of each
                        medical review would cost about $100 to $150 for a private hospital. The AR
                        therefore took the average rate of $125 in her calculations. Further, this
                        rate was to be discounted by 50% to reflect lowered rates in restructured
                        hospitals (see [61] of the AR’s Judgment). Bearing the above numbers
                        in mind, I derive the figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id=""></a>50% x $125 x 4 medical consultations a year x 14 years =
                            $3,500</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I now proceed to deal with the other types of
                    future medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Limb splints</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The AR awarded $2,400 for limb splints on the
                    basis that Dr Keith Goh estimated the cost of each limb splint to be in the
                    range of $100 and $300. She therefore used the sum of $200 as the average cost
                    of each limb splint. Because these rates were the rates at private hospitals, a
                    50% discount was applied. Each limb splint was therefore estimated to be $100
                    (being 50% of $200). The medical evidence was that the Plaintiff would require
                    four limb splints every two years. Thus, using a multiplier of 12 years, the AR
                    calculated the future medical expense on limb splints as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$100 per limb splint x 4 limb splints x (12-year
                            multiplier / 2 years) = $2,400</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On appeal, the Plaintiff objects to the
                    multiplier used, as well as the cost of $100 ascribed to each limb splint. The
                    Plaintiff submits that the multiplier should be 16 years, and the cost of each
                    limb splint should be $150, being half of the maximum cost of
                $300.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I see no basis for departing from the
                    AR’s calculation of the cost of each limb splint. The medical evidence is
                    clear that each limb splint costs an average of $100 to $300 at private
                    hospitals (see [56] of the AR’s Judgment). The Plaintiff does not dispute
                    this in his submissions. Rather, the Plaintiff simply asks that the court uses
                    the “maximum range” of $300 in awarding damages. There is no basis
                    to do so. The Plaintiff has given me no reason to assume that the limb splints
                    he will need will all cost $300 or close to $300.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Therefore, taking into account a modified
                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $2,800 for limb splints. I derive the
                    figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$100 per limb splint x 4 limb splints x (14-year
                            multiplier / 2 years) = $2,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Treatment for pneumonia </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In determining the future medical expenses
                    that should be awarded for the Plaintiff’s pneumonia treatment, the AR
                    allowed for seven incidences of pneumonia across the rest of the
                    Plaintiff’s life. This was reduced from the medical expert estimate of 10
                    incidences across the remaining 27 years of the Plaintiff’s life to take
                    into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. The AR then took into
                    account the medical evidence that each incident of pneumonia would require about
                    seven to 10 days of hospitalisation. She therefore took the average of 8.5 days.
                    She determined that hospitalisation costs $523 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Oddly though, she calculated the award for
                    pneumonia treatment as follows (see [90] of the AR’s Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$530.50 x 8.5 days x 7 incidences =
                        $31,564.75</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I say the calculation is odd, because the AR
                    used $530.50 rather than $523 as the hospitalisation costs per day. The
                    Plaintiff noted this discrepancy in his submissions, but said nothing more about
                    it. The Defendant is not appealing against this calculation. I therefore leave
                    this oddity for a moment to consider the crux of the Plaintiff’s appeal on
                    this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On appeal, the Plaintiff submits the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cost of hospitalisation per day
                        should be $1046 based on Dr David Low’s estimate that each admission
                        for pneumonia would cost about twice as much as URTI (see [90] of the
                        AR’s Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The AR should have allowed for 10 incidences, rather than seven
                        incidences of pneumonia, because 10 times is a “reasonable
                        estimate” over a remaining period of 27 years and is a more
                        “cautionary stand”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In his oral submissions before me, the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel seemed to have conceded his appeal on this point. The
                    Plaintiff’s counsel voluntarily conceded that when Dr David Low said
                    treatment for pneumonia would cost about twice as much as treatment for URTI, he
                    did not know how much treatment for URTI costs. Of course, I have no evidence to
                    this effect. I do not know the basis upon which the Plaintiff’s counsel
                    asserts that Dr Low did not know the cost of URTI treatment in making that
                    statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Nevertheless, I note that in the AR’s
                    Judgment at [90], she stated</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… This estimate was also in line with Dr David Low’s estimate
                        that each admission for pneumonia is usually longer than that of URTI and
                            <em>would cost about twice as much</em>.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It seems to me that a logical way to make
                    sense of Dr David Low’s statement is that treatment for pneumonia costs
                    twice as much <em>because</em> it normally involves a
                    hospitalisation stay of twice the length of that of URTI treatment. The
                    Plaintiff’s initial interpretation that the cost of hospitalisation per
                    day for pneumonia treatment is double that of URTI treatment has no basis in the
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In any case, as I have noted, the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel seems to have conceded his first point on appeal.
                    Therefore, I need not say any more on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the number of incidences of pneumonia that
                    the court should award future medical expenses for, the key question is whether
                    the AR should have discounted the number of incidences indicated by the medical
                    experts to take into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. The
                    Plaintiff made no submissions on the correctness of discounting the number of
                    incidences to take into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. He
                    simply submits that 10 is a “reasonable estimate”, and is more
                    “cautionary”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     No one doubts that 10 incidences of pneumonia
                    is a reasonable estimate. This estimate is based on medical evidence which the
                    AR herself accepted in her judgment. I also do not see how the submission on
                    caution assists me in deciding whether a discount should be applied. Of course,
                    the higher the number, the more “cautionary” the award would
                    naturally be from the Plaintiff’s perspective. But this cannot mean that I
                    award the Plaintiff damages for as high a number of incidences of pneumonia that
                    I reasonably can. This would be unfair to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     On balance, apart from the fact that the AR
                    wrongly used the figure of “$530.50” instead of
                    “$523” as the daily hospitalisation rate, I do not see anything
                    wrong with the AR applying a discount to the number of incidences of pneumonia
                    on account of accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. This seems to be in
                    accordance with well-established principles on discounting damages awarded in
                    view of the fact that a plaintiff often receives an award in one lump sum,
                    upfront. I therefore revise the AR’s award for pneumonia treatment to
                    $31,118.50 ($523 x 8.5 days x 7 incidences = $31,118.50).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Physiotherapy sessions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The evidence shows that the Plaintiff will
                    need physiotherapy on a regular basis for the rest of his life. However, the
                    Plaintiff will also need more intensive physiotherapy after his tenotomy
                    surgeries. The AR allowed for two physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of
                    the Plaintiff’s life. I set out her reasoning on this (at [91]–[92]
                    of the AR’s Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    Both Professor Ong and Dr David Low expressed the
                            view that it was fair to rely on the historical data derived from the
                            plaintiff’s previous rehabilitation sessions as a guide to
                            estimate how frequently the plaintiff should attend physiotherapy.
                            Professor Ong was of the view that a provision of about two
                            physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the plaintiff’s
                            future was fair. <em>Dr David Low testified that during
                                the period of intensification of rehabilitation, the number of
                                sessions could be about two to four times a month, but this would
                                reduce to the historical baseline of about 1.5 sessions a month
                                after the period of intensive
                        rehabilitation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">92    As such, I allowed for an estimation of two
                            physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the plaintiff’s
                            life…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It is clear that the AR took into account the
                    need for more intense physiotherapy in awarding the Plaintiff damages for two
                    physiotherapy sessions a month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On appeal, the Plaintiff submits the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_a"></a>(a)     The AR wrongly failed to make an
                        award for the more intensive physiotherapy sessions needed after the two
                        tenotomy surgeries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_63-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the alternative, if the AR did factor in the need for more
                        intensive physiotherapy in her overall award of two physiotherapy sessions
                        per month, this is insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It is clear that the first submission is
                    wrong. As I stated above, the AR did consider the need for more intensive
                    rehabilitation after the tenotomy procedures in her award. In support of his
                    alternative submission, the Plaintiff highlighted to the court that after each
                    tenotomy surgery, “Professor Ong recommended 3 to 5 times a week and Dr
                    Low recommended 2 to 4 times a month for an intensified period of 3 to 6
                    months”. The Plaintiff took the position that two physiotherapy sessions
                    a month was the appropriate award for “usual rehabilitation”. An
                    additional award must be given above and beyond the two monthly sessions for the
                    “intensified period”. The Plaintiff submitted that in determining
                    this additional award, the court should take the average of the highest medical
                    estimate (<em>ie</em>, five times a week or 20 times a
                    month) and the lowest medical estimate (<em>ie</em>, two
                    times a month), which is 11 times a month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     On the whole, I find many problems with the
                    Plaintiff’s submissions. I uphold the AR’s award of two sessions per
                    month for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff has no basis to submit
                        that two physiotherapy sessions a month is the appropriate award for
                        “usual rehabilitation”. The AR cited medical evidence from Dr
                        David Low that 1.5 sessions per month is the “historical
                        baseline”. The Plaintiff did not dispute this in his
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     The award
                        of two physiotherapy sessions per month for the rest of the
                        Plaintiff’s life is already very generous. This is an additional 162
                        sessions above the usual 1.5 sessions a month (0.5 additional session per
                        month x 12 months x 27 years = 162). This is far more than the
                        Plaintiff’s estimate of the 99 additional physiotherapy sessions
                        needed for post tetonomy recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff has cited no proof that Professor Ong
                        recommends three to five sessions of additional rehabilitation <em>a week</em>. The AR cited Dr Low’s estimate of two
                        to four sessions a month during the intensification period, and Professor
                        Ong’s estimate of two physiotherapy sessions per month for the rest of
                        the Plaintiff’s life. I will not disturb the AR’s finding
                        without more concrete evidence that her award is
                erroneous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Moreover, while this is not necessary to my
                    decision, I point out that if the Plaintiff were correct, the estimates given by
                    Professor Ong and Dr Low seem vastly at odds with each other. The former
                    estimates 12 to 20 sessions a month, while the latter only two to four. If I had
                    to decide this for myself, I would have had to decide which estimate is right.
                    Taking the average of the highest estimate (20) and the lowest estimate (two) as
                    proposed by the Plaintiff does not seem to me to be the correct approach to
                    take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In any case, given the Defendant did not
                    appeal on this, and there is no doubt in my mind that the AR’s award of
                    two physiotherapy sessions per month is fair and reasonable, I shall not disturb
                    the AR’s finding that on the whole, two physiotherapy sessions per month
                    should be awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Plaintiff also makes the point that the
                    multiplier used to calculate the award for physiotherapy sessions should not be
                    12 years. On this, I agree that the AR’s award must be altered in light of
                    my holding that the appropriate multiplier for future expenses generally is 14
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Therefore, taking into account a modified
                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $59,136 for physiotherapy sessions. I
                    derive the figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$176 per session x 2 sessions x 12 months x 14-year
                            multiplier = $59,136</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Outpatient medication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Plaintiff submits that the AR omitted to
                    award damages for outpatient medication, necessary after hospitalisation for
                    URTI and pneumonia. To assist the court in calculating the quantum of outpatient
                    medication, the Plaintiff submits the following facts:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     The cost for outpatient medication
                        is between $10 and $20 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     One week of outpatient medication is necessary after each
                        hospitalisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On that basis, the Plaintiff submits that
                    $7,840 should be awarded for post-URTI medication, and $700 should be awarded
                    for post-pneumonia medication. I reproduce the table the Plaintiff put in his
                    submissions to explain how the figures were calculated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I note that no evidence was offered to the
                    court on any of the above figures. I find this rather unsatisfactory. However,
                    during the hearing before me, the Defendant concedes outpatient medication
                    appears to have been missed out by the AR, and did not object to either the
                    award or the quantum of outpatient medication claimed by the Plaintiff. I
                    therefore assume that the parties agree on the accuracy of the above
                    figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     On my part, in fairness to the Defendant, I
                    would make the following amendments to the figures the Plaintiff proposed based
                    on the facts I have before me:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     On the Plaintiff’s own case,
                        the cost of medication per day ranges from $10 to $20. The average cost of
                        medication per day is therefore $15. While the Plaintiff does not explain
                        why he applies a 50% discount in the table he submits, I assume this is
                        because the figures he submits are based on private rates rather than
                        restructured hospital rates. I would award $7.50 per day for medication
                        rather than $10 on the basis that there is no justification in using the
                        upper limit of the cost of medication.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     As decided previously, taking into account accelerated
                        payment and vicissitudes of life, the number of incidences of pneumonia
                        which the court will award damages for is seven, not 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appropriate multiplier to apply is
                        14, not 16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I therefore award the Plaintiff a total of
                    $5,512.50 for outpatient medication. I shall use the table format used by the
                    Plaintiff to explain how I derived the above figure:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I have reflected the amended sums in bold for
                    clarity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Cost of future nursing care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     There are two aspects to the award for future
                    nursing care. The first concerns a full-time stay home domestic helper. The
                    second concerns a private or auxiliary nurse that would be engaged for one month
                    each year to give the main caregivers (<em>ie</em>, the
                    mother and the domestic helper) some time off. This is to prevent caregiver
                    burnout.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Domestic helper</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The AR took into account the following costs
                    involved in hiring a domestic helper:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     $480 for monthly
                    salary;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     $83.85 for
                        monthly maid levy;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_c"></a>(c)     $80 monthly for food, medical bills and lodging;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_d"></a>(d)     $200 contract renewal fee once every
                        two years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_e"></a>(e)     $300
                        return air ticket once every two years; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_f"></a>(f)     $321 for insurance premiums payable once every
                        two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The AR deemed it appropriate to apply a 50%
                    discount to the total cost of the domestic helper because she spends half her
                    time doing household chores. Using a 12-year multiplier, the AR arrived at a
                    global sum of $48,820.20 as expenses of hiring a domestic helper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Plaintiff appeals against the 50% discount
                    applied as well as the 12-year multiplier. I have already determined that the
                    appropriate multiplier should be 14 years. The only issue left for me to
                    determine is whether the 50% discount was correctly applied. On this, the
                    Plaintiff submits the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     The consensus of the medical experts
                        is that the Plaintiff needs two caregivers and auxiliary help for the rest
                        of his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     The maid was engaged for the predominant purpose of assisting the
                        Plaintiff’s mother take care of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     While it is not denied that the maid
                        helps out with household work, she does so only from time to time. Moreover,
                        the maid’s involvement in the Plaintiff’s care would inevitably
                        increase as the Plaintiff grows in size and weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I agree with the Plaintiff that no discount
                    should be applied to the award for the cost of hiring a domestic helper. It is
                    clear that the need for a domestic helper arose solely because of the accident.
                    It may well be true that the domestic worker helps out with house work. However,
                    it must be borne in mind that the mother is now a full-time care-giver for the
                    Plaintiff and this obviously has an impact on her own ability to perform house
                    work. The need to hire a domestic helper to help out in the areas she does is,
                    in my view, entirely necessitated by the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Moreover, I am fortified in my view by the
                    medical evidence that the Plaintiff needs <em>two
                        caregivers</em>. It thus seems to me entirely fair to award the
                    Plaintiff the <em>full cost</em> of two caregivers
                        (<em>ie</em>, the domestic helper and the mother). As
                    such, I find that a 50% discount should not have been applied to the award for
                    the cost of a domestic helper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Therefore, taking into account a modified
                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $113,913.80 for the cost of a domestic
                    helper. I derive the figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>($480 + $83.85 + $80) x 12 months x 14-year multiplier =
                            $108,166.80</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>($200 + $300 + $321) x 14-year multiplier / 2 years =
                            $5,747</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Total = $108,166.80 + $5,747 = $<b>113,913.80</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Private nurse </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Plaintiff’s appeal on the quantum
                    awarded for the private nurse relates both to the multiplicand and the
                    multiplier. I have already decided that the appropriate multiplier is 14 years
                    not 12 years. Moreover, I see no reason to disturb the AR’s decision to
                    use $160 as the multiplicand. The AR saw it fit to take the average of the
                    lowest end of the defendant’s estimate of the cost of a private nurse
                        (<em>ie</em> $100) and the plaintiff’s estimate
                    of the said cost (<em>ie</em> $220). The Plaintiff has
                    provided no reasons for me to believe that this is erroneous. I therefore only
                    revise the multiplier adopted by the AR, and award the Plaintiff $67,200 for the
                    cost of a private nurse hired for a duration of one full month each year. I
                    derive the figure in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$160 per day x 30 days a month x 14-year multiplier =
                                <b>$67,200</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on cost of future nursing care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In total, the amount awarded for cost of
                    future nursing care is $181,113.80 (being $113,913.80 + $67,200).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mother’s loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The Plaintiff’s mother has since stopped
                    work and become a full-time caregiver to the Plaintiff. While this is
                    undoubtedly a significant drain on her, the AR correctly noted that under this
                    head of damage, we are concerned not with loss to the mother, but loss to
                        <em>the Plaintiff</em>: <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</em>
                    [2012] 2 SLR 85 (“<em>Lee Wei Kong
                    (CA)</em>”) at [53].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It bears repeating that the evidence
                    establishes that the Plaintiff needs two caregivers, and that his mother is one
                    of them. The Defendant thus should rightfully pay the cost of <em>two caregivers</em>. An award for one of the caregivers, <em>ie</em>, the domestic helper, has already been considered
                    above. I now consider the award that should be given as costs of the second
                    caregiver, the Plaintiff’s mother. The difficulty here is that in reality,
                    this care is provided gratuitously to the Plaintiff. As such, the Plaintiff does
                    not actually incur any expense from having to depend on his mother for full-time
                    caregiving. While there is some controversy over whether damages should be
                    awarded to <em>the Plaintiff</em> for the gratuitous care
                    he receives from friends or family (see for example the English position in
                        <em>Hunt v Severs</em> [1994] 2 AC 350
                        (“<em>Hunt v Severs</em>”)), there is
                    sufficient authority for the proposition that a reasonable value of that care
                    should be awarded to the Plaintiff as damages: <em>Donnelly v
                        Joyce</em> [1974] 1 QB 454 (“<em>Donnelly v
                        Joyce</em>”), <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em>
                    at [53]. Moreover, both parties accept this as a correct proposition in
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I note that whilst the House of Lords in
                        <em>Hunt v Severs</em> did overrule <em>Donnelly v Joyce</em>, this was in respect of the holding in the
                    latter case that it was irrelevant to consider the identity of the source from
                    which the need for nursing or care services was met. In <em>Hunt
                        v Severs</em>, the House of Lords held that where the provider of the
                    nursing or care services is the <em>tortfeasor</em>, there
                    was no ground in public policy to require the tortfeasor to pay damages to the
                    Plaintiff in respect of services which he himself has rendered. This was because
                    the House of Lords took the view that the underlying rationale of awarding
                    damages on this front is to enable the voluntary carer to receive proper
                    recompense for the services. That being so, the House of Lords’ conclusion
                    was that a plaintiff who recovers damages under this head should hold them on
                    trust for the voluntary carer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Indeed, I note that regardless of the
                    controversy in England about whether such damages for such services should be
                    held on trust for the caregiver, the position in Singapore is that the plaintiff
                    may directly recover the reasonable value of such gratuitous services rendered
                    as damages. In any case, this issue was never raised by the parties in the
                    appeal and I therefore need not explore it any further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The authorities establish that to compute the
                    reasonable costs of obtaining the care his mother provides, the court will look
                    at the mother’s loss of earnings as the <em>starting
                        point</em>: <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> at [63].
                    In other words, the multiplicand adopted is based on the mother’s monthly
                    income. This is not in dispute on appeal. What is in dispute is the sum which
                    should be imputed as the mother’s monthly income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The AR adopted the multiplicand of $1,508 per
                    month in computing the mother’s loss of future earnings. This was based on
                    the mother’s last drawn salary before the accident. At that time, she was
                    working as a receptionist at a law firm drawing a monthly salary of $1,300 with
                    employer’s CPF contributions of $208 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The gravamen of the Defendant’s
                    complaint is that the AR wrongly used the mother’s last drawn salary as
                    the multiplicand. The Defendant submits that the evidence strongly suggests that
                    the mother would have stopped working. The evidence includes the
                        following<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff’s mother
                        admitted in cross-examination on 10 December 2013 that it was her
                        inclination to stay at home and look after the children even if the accident
                        did not happen. While she did change her testimony when examined on 13
                        December 2013 to say that she intended to work her whole life, the Defendant
                        submits that this is untruthful, self-serving testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff’s mother’s
                        history of employment suggests that she only works during periods when her
                        husband is irresponsible and is not earning a wage to support the family
                        (she has had three husbands so far). Her present husband earns a wage to
                        support the family. This suggests the Plaintiff’s mother is likely to
                        have left her job even if the accident did not take
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     Since 1992,
                        the time she left school to enter the workforce, the Plaintiff’s
                        mother has only worked for approximately eight years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Based on the above evidence, the Defendant
                    submits that the appropriate multiplicand to adopt is that which is adopted for
                    homemakers. According to the Defendant, on the authority of <em>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin Hon</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 407
                        (“<em>Eddie Toon</em>”), this is a figure
                    of about $300. I note that the AR did consider this submission in her judgment,
                    but dismissed it on the ground of other authorities which suggest that the court
                    should not presume the mother would eventually quit work and stay at
                    home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     From the above, two issues arise for my
                    consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     In assessing the cost of care based
                        on loss of future earnings, to what extent should the court speculate
                        whether a caregiver who was working at the time of the accident would
                        continue to work had the accident not taken place?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     To what extent should the cost of a
                        caregiver’s care be assessed based on his or her loss of future
                        earnings? Related to that, how should we compute the cost of a
                        homemaker’s caregiving?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Speculation about a caregiver’s continued employment </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The starting point of this inquiry is the
                    objective of achieving a fair and reasonable assessment of the loss incurred by
                    the Plaintiff in having been reduced to a state where he requires his
                    mother’s full-time care. Naturally, the court needs to be fully apprised
                    of all relevant facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Where the full-time nursing care is provided
                    by a homemaker, it is established that the court should endeavour to award a
                    reasonable and fair value to the Plaintiff as damages. <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em> is relied on by the Defendant for the proposition that the
                    appropriate multiplicand in such a case is the figure generally adopted for
                    homemakers (around $300 per month). On the other hand, where full-time nursing
                    care is provided by an income-earning parent (who had to give up work), the
                    Plaintiff asserts that the assessment is generally based on the income which
                    that parent earned but can no longer earn. This may well be considerably more
                    than the figure that is said to have been generally adopted for
                    homemakers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I pause here to note that many factual
                    permutations can arise. In some cases, it may be that a homemaker parent who now
                    provides the full-time nursing care is a well-qualified professional who
                    intended to return to the work-force in a few years. Nevertheless, at the time
                    of the accident and hearing, that parent had not yet returned to work. In other
                    cases, it may be that the full-time nursing care is provided by a high-income
                    earning parent who has since had to give up his or her job to stay home and look
                    after the severely injured and disabled child. It goes without saying that the
                    income of that parent may be higher than the cost of engaging a full-time
                    professional home nurse. The point made is that it follows that evidence on the
                    following facts <em>are relevant</em> (at the minimum) to
                    determine the cost of a caregiver’s care where such care is gratuitously
                    provided to the Plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was the caregiver gainfully employed
                        prior to the provision of gratuitous care?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     What were the caregiver’s employment
                        prospects, and related to that, whether there was any likelihood that the
                        homemaker turned caregiver would have entered the work-force in the future
                        but for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the caregiver had continued working, how much
                        the care-giver would have earned as salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_d"></a>(d)     The cost of engaging third-party full-time care,
                        whether by means of a domestic helper (where this is appropriate given a
                        plaintiff’s needs), a professional nurse, or institutionalised
                        care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     This list may not be exhaustive – other
                    factors may well be relevant. Whilst it may be said that the above fact finding
                    exercise involves a good deal of “speculation”, it cannot be
                    denied that the court is often compelled by the circumstances of the cases it
                    hears, to make “considered” speculative findings of
                fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Indeed, the AR considered the factual question
                    of whether the Plaintiff’s mother would have continued working if the
                    accident did not take place. From my reading of the AR’s Judgment, the
                    conclusion was that there is insufficient evidence that the mother would have
                    chosen to become a homemaker. In other words, the AR basically made a finding of
                    fact that the mother <em>would have continued working</em>
                    at her pre-accident salary of $1,508 per month (as per the <em>status quo</em> before the accident) if the accident did not take
                    place. It is to this factual finding that I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The AR stated at [107] of her judgment that
                    “it was complete speculation on the part of the defendant to suggest that
                    the mother would have chosen to be a homemaker”. She cited <em>Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend Chua Wee Bee) v Koh Chai
                        Kwang</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1037 (“<em>Teo Ai
                        Ling</em>”) at [74], where Steven Chong JC (as he then was)
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am mindful that the plaintiff is a woman and that she may marry and stop
                        work before the normal retirement age. However, as rightly observed by Chao
                        J in <em>Peh Diana</em> ([42] <em>supra</em>), the court cannot ignore the fact that the government
                        is constantly encouraging women to join the workforce and to contribute
                        positively to the economic growth of the country. Therefore, no reduction to
                        the multiplier should be made on account of the fact that the plaintiff may
                        stop work after marriage. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    
          <em>Teo Ai Ling</em>
                    rightly cautions the courts not to assume that women will stop work <em>simply</em> because of their gender and the homemaker role a
                    woman is traditionally thought to play. This is clearly correct. There is no
                    basis for a court to assume that a caregiver is likely to quit her job just
                    because of her gender. That said, <em>Teo Ai Ling</em> does
                    not go so far as to state that it is never proper to take into account the
                    continued employment prospects of the person who had to leave work to provide
                    full-time care. For example, if there is clear evidence that the caregiver
                    whilst employed at the time when the need for care arose, had already tendered a
                    3-month resignation notice, such evidence should not be ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I therefore turn to the actual evidence
                    before me, and ask whether the Plaintiff’s mother would have stopped
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I outlined the evidence that the Defendant
                    would like me to take into account at [92] of this judgment. In my view, the
                    evidence is insufficient to justify a finding of fact that the Plaintiff’s
                    mother would have become a homemaker for the rest of her life even if the
                    accident had not taken place. I accept that the Plaintiff’s mother has not
                    consistently been in the workforce and that her present husband may be
                    responsibly supporting the family. I also accept that she may personally prefer
                    to be a homemaker if circumstances permit. However, she was holding a full-time
                    job before the accident, and there is nothing to suggest that she would have
                    quit in the near or foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In short, it is not possible to determine on
                    a balance of probabilities that she would have quit her job if the accident had
                    not taken place. Moreover, given that it is the AR who heard the evidence from
                    the mother first hand, I find it appropriate to defer to her judgment that on
                    the evidence, it was “complete speculation” to suggest the
                    Plaintiff’s mother would have quit her job. There is no reason to disturb
                    the AR’s factual finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It might fairly be said that evidence to
                    positively support the fact that the Plaintiff’s mother would have
                    continued working at a monthly salary of $1,508 if the accident did not take
                    place is equally lacking. The Defendant points to the possibility that the
                    Plaintiff’s mother may not have been able to keep such a well-paying job,
                    as well as the fact that she might choose to quit her job (as previously
                    mentioned). I fully accept that these are possibilities. However, it appears
                    that the <em>starting point</em> the courts have adopted in
                    assessing the loss of future income as a result of an accident is the
                    caregiver’s or the victim’s <em>pre-accident
                        income</em>: see for example <em>Donnelly v
                        Joyce</em>, cited in approval in <em>Ang Eng Lee and
                        another v Lim Lye Soon</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 931 at [10] –
                    [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The court rightly tries to avoid speculation
                    as to whether the caregiver or victim in question is likely to find a better
                    job, to be fired, or to eventually quit her job. The starting point is that the
                    pre-accident <em>status quo</em> is presumed to continue
                    unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. It must follow that when a court
                    is asked by the parties to make a finding of fact as to whether a particular
                    victim or caregiver would have, on a balance of probabilities, continued in
                    employment at a particular income, the court may start by assuming that
                        <em>status quo</em> would continue. It is for the other
                    party to then displace this initial presumption with contrary evidence. In the
                    present case, I affirm the AR’s decision that there is insufficient
                    contrary evidence to displace the presumption that the pre-accident <em>status quo</em> would have continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessing the cost of a caregiver’s care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I turn to the question of how the cost of a
                    caregiver’s care should be quantified. Both parties proceeded on the
                    assumption that this should be quantified with reference to the
                    caregiver’s loss of income. This may well be correct in some, if not most,
                    cases. The caregiver’s loss of income is the <em>starting
                        point</em> in assessing the reasonable expense a plaintiff would have
                    had to incur to obtain such care: <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (CA)</em> at [63]. The question, however, is whether there are other
                    factors a court should take into account in determining the reasonable expense a
                    plaintiff would have had to incur to obtain the gratuitous care he has received
                    from his family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    If a successful private banker who draws a
                    monthly salary of $50,000 leaves her employment to provide full-time care to her
                    son who has been severely injured and disabled. Can the court properly award her
                    son damages of $50,000 per month as compensation for her cost of care? This
                    would seem unfair and unreasonable to the tortfeasor. Indeed, this sentiment was
                    expressed by Kan Ting Chiu J in <em>Lee Wei Kong (by his
                        litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong</em> [2010]
                    SGHC 371 (“<em>Lee Wei Kong (HC)</em>”). Kan
                    J (at [29]) held that while claims for a caregiver’s loss of earnings have
                    been allowed, they must be reasonable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… For these losses to be recovered, however, they have to be
                        reasonable. If a mother gives up a $10,000 monthly salary to look after a
                        child instead of employing a maid or a nurse, then the recoverable loss
                        should be based on the cost of employment of a maid or nurse and not the
                        mother’s salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    While <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (HC)</em> has been substantially overturned by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em>, I note that the above
                        <em>dicta</em> was not disapproved of, and remains
                    instructive (see <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> at
                    [63]–[64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Indeed, the above <em>dicta</em> was cited in <em>Tan Teck Boon v Lee Gim
                        Siong and others</em> [2011] SGHC 76 at [25], where the learned
                    assistant registrar adopted Kan J’s approach of awarding the cost of
                    alternatively employing a maid or a nurse where evidence on the victim’s
                    father’s pre-accident income was wholly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    
          <em>Chong Hwa Yin (committee
                        of person an estate of Chong Hwa Wee, mentally disordered) v Estate of Loh
                        Hon Fock, deceased</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 208 (“<em>Chong Hwa Yin</em>”) is also of some guidance. Choo
                    Han Teck J held (at [11]) that a problem with the assistant registrar’s
                    method of assessing the mother’s cost of care in that case was that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the mother’s income as a rubber tapper was accepted as the costs of
                        nursing care. If there was no evidence of what nursing care would cost this
                        item could not be allowed using a rubber tapper’s, or any other,
                        income as the gauge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Choo J seems to suggest by this that one
                    cannot <em>exclusively</em> refer to the caregiver’s
                    loss of income in determining his or her cost of care. Regard must be had to the
                    cost of nursing care generally. It is not clear from his judgment however, how
                    the cost of nursing care would have been taken into account in making the final
                    compensatory award. It is also not clear whether “the mother’s
                    income as a rubber tapper” would still have been relevant if there was
                    evidence of the general cost of nursing care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The final local case I consider on this
                    point is <em>Eddie Toon</em>. In <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em>, the learned assistant registrar had awarded the plaintiff a
                    sum of $480,600 for future nursing care. The award was based on there being two
                    stages of care. The first is when the plaintiff is nursed at home with home
                    nursing care in the day as well as full-time parental care. The second is when
                    the plaintiff’s parents are no longer able to take care of him. The
                    breakdown of the assistant registrar’s award for future nursing care was
                    as follows (see <em>Eddie Toon</em> at
                    [30]–[32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_a"></a>(a)     $405,000 – costs of <em>home nursing care</em> during the first stage using a
                        multiplier of 9 years, and a multiplicand of $125 a day, which is the daily
                        cost of engaging a private nurse.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_b"></a>(b)     $32,400 – the cost of the <em>mother’s services</em> during the first stage in lieu of a
                        private nurse who should be employed for the night shift. A multiplicand of
                        $300 per month was used.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_113-p2_c"></a>(c)     $43,200 – the cost of <em>institutional nursing care</em> during the second stage when the
                        plaintiff’s parents can no longer take care of him. A multiplier of 6
                        years and a multiplicand of $1,500 per month were used (with a 60% deduction
                        for the “domestic element”, being the cost of food and
                        accommodation the Plaintiff would have had to incur even without the
                        accident).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The defendant in that case appealed against
                    the award of $405,000 for home nursing care, arguing that it was not reasonable
                    for the plaintiff to be cared for at home given the significantly greater costs.
                    What is of especial importance is the approach Goh Phai Cheng JC took on
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Goh JC first established that the burden of
                    proving that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to be cared for at home lay on
                    the plaintiff: <em>Eddie Toon</em> at [34]. He then found
                    that engaging a private nurse for the purposes of providing home nursing care
                    during the first stage of care was not a reasonable expense. He reasoned that
                    institutional nursing care was a viable option because the plaintiff’s
                    mother could attend to him daily if she wished: <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em> at [36]. Moreover, if the plaintiff’s mother wished to
                    continue to care for the plaintiff at home, she could engage a maid to assist
                    her. Engaging a private nurse was not necessary because the plaintiff’s
                    mother had been providing excellent nursing care to the plaintiff from the time
                    of the accident till the date of the assessment: <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em> at [37].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Goh JC then calculated the appropriate award
                    for future nursing care assuming the plaintiff was cared for at home with the
                    assistance of a domestic maid, and found this to come up to a global figure of
                    $141,000: <em>Eddie Toon</em> at [40]. He calculated the
                    alternative award assuming the plaintiff received institutional nursing care for
                    the rest of his life (<em>ie</em>, during both the first
                    and the second stages of care). He provided for the travelling expenses the
                    plaintiff’s mother would incur in making daily visits to the nursing home,
                    and found that this would produce an aggregate sum of $162,000: <em>Eddie Toon</em> at [41]–[44]. Having arrived at the two
                    figures, Goh JC, referring to the award of $162,000, held at [44]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Since this award is higher than the award which I have arrived at
                        as the costs of future nursing care on the basis that the plaintiff would be
                        looked after by his parents until such time as they are not able to do so,
                        and for him to be looked after in a private nursing home when his parents
                        are unable to care for him, I am of the view that the plaintiff should be
                        awarded the sum of $162,000 for future nursing care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Based on the reasoning above, Goh JC set
                    aside the assistant registrar’s award of $480,600 and substituted it with
                    an award of $162,000. Two points may be gleaned from Goh JC’s analysis in
                        <em>Eddie Toon</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the court will apply a test
                        of reasonableness in determining the type of nursing care the plaintiff may
                        be compensated for. Hence, where one mode of care (<em>eg</em>, home nursing care) is far costlier than other equivalent
                        modes of care, the court will be reluctant to calculate compensation on that
                        basis. This is in line with Kan J’s <em>dicta</em> in <em>Lee Wei Kong (HC)</em>.
                        Even so, I note in passing that in assessing the home-care option as opposed
                        to institutional care, the court must have regard to any non-monetary
                        advantages of home-care by a private nurse or a parent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the court will not
                        necessarily determine the award for the future cost of nursing care based on
                        the <em>cheapest</em> possible mode of care. It is not
                        clear why, of the two reasonable alternative modes of care, Goh JC decided
                        to base his award on the more costly mode of care (<em>ie</em>, on the assumption of institutional nursing care). That
                        said, the court must consider all the possible reasonable nursing care
                        options the plaintiff has before deciding on the basis upon which it makes
                        its award. Indeed, this seems to have been the point Choo J was making in
                            <em>Chong Hwa Yin</em> at
                [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    One important question that arises, and that
                    both parties to the present appeal made submissions on, is how to value a
                    parent’s gratuitous caregiving. This is important when a court is
                    assessing the range of reasonable options available, and is deciding on the cost
                    to impute on a parent’s full-time care-giving as a possible option of
                    care. <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> suggests quite clearly
                    that the parent’s loss of income is an appropriate measure. However, this
                    leaves open the question how an assessment may be made if the caregiver was
                    previously unemployed and was performing the role as a homemaker. Strictly
                    relying on the loss of income as the measure of a caregiver’s gratuitous
                    caregiving would result in the homemaker’s care having at most a nominal
                    value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The Defendant submits that this is in fact
                    the case, and relies on <em>Eddie Toon</em> as authority
                    for this. The Defendant argues that Goh JC awarded the mother, who was a
                    homemaker, a nominal figure of only $300 per month for her care of the
                    plaintiff. I point out that this is not entirely accurate. The sum of $300 was
                    only awarded for the mother’s services in lieu of a private nurse
                        <em>at night</em>. While it is arguable that the court
                    may have ultimately omitted to make an award for the cost of the mother’s
                    care <em>in the day</em> (given it rejected awarding the
                    plaintiff the cost of a private nurse for the day), the court’s award in
                        <em>Eddie Toon</em> is not in my view conclusive
                    authority that a homemaker’s full-time care should only be awarded a
                    nominal value. Indeed, this point was never raised or discussed on
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I have found the English case law on how to
                    assess the cost of care gratuitously provided by family or friends instructive.
                    English case law on this issue suggests that there are two broad approaches to
                    assessing the cost of care gratuitously provided by family or friends. The first
                    is the “loss of earnings basis”, and the second is the
                    “cost of care basis”: <em>Fairhurst v St Helens and
                        Knowsley Health Authority</em> [1995] PIQR Q1 (“<em>Fairhurst</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Both approaches seek to provide proper
                    recompense for the services provided gratuitously by a family carer. As May LJ
                    held in <em>Evans v Pontypridd Roofing Limited</em> [2002]
                    P.I.Q.R. Q5 (“<em>Evans v Pontypridd</em>”)
                    at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Circumstances vary enormously and what is appropriate and just in
                        one case may not be so in another. If a caring relation has given up
                        remunerative employment to care for the claimant gratuitously, it may well
                        be appropriate to assess the services provided <em>by
                            reference to the carer’s lost earnings</em>. If the carer
                        has not given up gainful employment, the task remains to assess proper
                        recompense for the services provided. As O’Connor LJ said in <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em>, regard may be had to <em>what it would cost to provide the services on the open
                            market</em>. But the services are not in fact being bought in the
                        open market, so that adjustments will need to be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Indeed, the principle that an objective of
                    the assessment is to provide proper recompense to the caregiver comes from
                        <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> [1986] 1 All ER 332
                        (“<em>Housecroft v Burnett</em>”).
                    O’Connor LJ held at 343:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Once it is understood that this is an element in the award to the
                        plaintiff to provide for the reasonable and proper care of the plaintiff and
                        that a capital sum is to be available for that purpose, the court should
                        look at it as a whole and consider whether, on the facts of the case, it is
                        sufficient to enable the plaintiff, among other things, to make reasonable
                        recompense to the relative. So, in cases where the relative has given up
                        gainful employment to look after the plaintiff, I would regard it as natural
                        that the plaintiff would not wish the relative to be the loser and the court
                        would award sufficient to enable the plaintiff to achieve that result. The
                        ceiling would be the commercial rate. In cases like the present I would look
                        at the award of £108,550, remembering that there is in that sum a sum
                        of £39,000 over and above the sum required to provide the expected
                        outgoings, and ask: is this sufficient to provide for the plaintiff's needs,
                        including enabling her to make some monetary acknowledgment of her
                        appreciation of all that her mother does for her? I would also ask: is it
                        sufficient for this plaintiff should her mother fall by the wayside and be
                        unable to give as she gives now? …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    While the objective of providing reasonable
                    recompense to the caregiver is clear and undisputed, it is noted that
                    O’Connor LJ framed this objective within the overall goal of making
                    sufficient provision for the plaintiff’s needs. For this reason, the
                    question was also asked: “is it sufficient for this plaintiff should her
                    mother fall by the wayside and be unable to give as she gives
                    now”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    As mentioned above, English case law
                    suggests two distinct approaches in assessing what is reasonable recompense. I
                    shall call them the “income approach”, and the “cost of
                    care approach”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The founding authority for the income
                    approach is arguably the case of <em>Donnelly v Joyce</em>.
                    In that case, Megaw LJ awarded the plaintiff the cost of his mother’s care
                    based on the income she would have earned if she did not have to stay home to
                    take care of the plaintiff. This was justified as the plaintiff’s loss (at
                    462):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The loss is the plaintiff’s loss. The question from what
                        source the plaintiff’s needs have been met, the question who has paid
                        the money or given the services, the question whether or not the plaintiff
                        is or is not under a legal or moral liability to repay, are, so far as the
                        defendant and his liability are concerned, all irrelevant. <em>The plaintiff’s loss, to take this present case, is not
                            the expenditure of money to buy the special boots or to pay for the
                            nursing attention. His loss is the existence of the need for those
                            special boots or for those nursing services</em>, the value of
                        which for purposes of damages – for the purpose of the ascertainment
                        of the amount of his loss – is the proper and reasonable cost of
                        supplying those needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Earlier at [88], I noted that the House of
                    Lords in <em>Hunt v Severs</em> disagreed with the holding
                    that the source the plaintiff’s needs were met was irrelevant. That said,
                    the loss of income approach was not disagreed with and indeed was also adopted
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Fitzgerald v Ford</em> [1996]
                    PIQR Q72 (“<em>Fitzgerald v Ford</em>”),
                    where the court awarded the plaintiff £62,600 for her
                    brother-in-law’s gratuitous caregiving. Her brother-in-law was her
                    full-time caregiver and the sum of £62,600 represented his loss of
                    earnings. Notably, there was evidence that after making the appropriate
                    discounts, an award based on the cost of professional care (the alternative
                    basis for assessment, as we will see in a while) would have come up to
                    £82,000. However, the court chose to make an award for future care on the
                    basis of the caregiver’s loss of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The second approach adopted by the English
                    courts is the cost of care approach. As suggested in the passage quoted above
                    from <em>Evans v Pontypridd</em>, this method of assessment
                    is based on what it would cost the plaintiff to obtain equivalent caregiving
                    services on the open market. On this approach, the courts generally base their
                    award on the hourly rate of professional nursing care, and multiply it by the
                    number of hours of care required as a result of the accident. A quarter to
                    one-third discount is then applied to the global figure to take into account the
                    fact that the plaintiff is receiving the services gratuitously, and that income
                    tax and National Insurance contributions (a feature unique to the English legal
                    system) are not paid on the provision of the caregiving services: see <em>Evans v Pontypridd</em> at [14] and [36]–[38];
                        <em>Fairhurst</em>; <em>Willbye v
                        Gibbons</em> [2004] PIQR P15.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In deciding that only a 25% rather than a
                    one-third deduction should be made in <em>Fairhurst</em>,
                    the court took into account the fact that the parents in <em>Fairhurst</em> had to acquire special skills to take care of the
                    plaintiff. The parents’ services were thus valued “somewhat closer
                    to the full commercial rate than might otherwise have been appropriate”.
                    This reasoning was affirmed in <em>Evans v Pontypridd</em>
                    at [37], and the court additionally stated that it would also take into account
                    the possibility that “the services of the gratuitous carer may not be
                    available for the entire period upon which the assessment is based” in
                    determining the appropriate discount to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Having laid out the two approaches adopted
                    by English courts in different cases, the important, and perhaps trickier,
                    question is how they interact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    First, O’Connor LJ in <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> held at 343 that while a
                    plaintiff’s caregiver’s loss of income may be the basis for
                    computing the award for past and future care, “[t]he ceiling would be the
                    commercial rate” of the caregiving services provided. By contrast, where
                    the caregiver’s loss of income is less than the discounted commercial rate
                    of obtaining caregiving services, the courts have in some instances decided to
                    award the plaintiff the lower figure: see <em>Fitzgerald v
                        Ford</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Second, based on <em>Evans v
                        Pontypridd</em> at [25], it appears that the English courts have
                    avoided “putting first instance judges into too restrictive a
                    strait-jacket, such as might happen if it was said that the means of assessing a
                    proper recompense for services provided gratuitously by a family carer had to be
                    assessed in a particular way or ways”. The court then went on to describe
                    the income approach and the cost of care approach as two possible methods of
                    assessment (see quoted passage from <em>Evans v
                        Pontypridd</em> at [121] of this judgment). In other words, the
                    English cases suggest that there <em>are</em> and <em>should be</em> no fixed rules governing which approach a
                    court adopts. It all depends on what is appropriate and just on the particular
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Third, the authorities accept that where the
                    caregiver did not in fact give up any gainful employment in entering into
                    full-time care of the plaintiff, the cost of care approach should be used: see
                        <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> at 343 and <em>Fairhurst</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    On this basis, a plaintiff who receives
                    gratuitous care from a caregiver who did not give up gainful employment would
                    necessarily be awarded damages based on the cost of care approach. A plaintiff
                    who receives gratuitous care from a caregiver who did give up gainful employment
                    could, on the basis of <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em>, be
                    awarded damages based on either the income or cost of care approach. A problem,
                    however, with the law as set out by O’Connor LJ in <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> is that the damages awarded on the cost of
                    care approach is necessarily higher than the damages awarded on the income
                    approach. This is because the ceiling for an award on the income approach is the
                    commercial rate of caregiving. Given the cost of care approach is premised on
                    the commercial rate of caregiving, the income approach would, at best, give a
                    plaintiff an award as high as one assessed on a cost of care approach. Indeed,
                    if we consider the facts of <em>Fitzgerald v Ford</em>, the
                    plaintiff would arguably have received a higher award for future care if her
                    brother-in-law (her primary caregiver) were unemployed before. She might have
                    been awarded the discounted cost of commercial care (£82,000) rather than
                    her brother-in-law’s loss of income (£62,600).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The learned author of Harvey McGregor, QC,
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        19<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2014) (“<em>McGregor on Damages</em>”) considered this problem and argues
                    at para 38-231:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if the relative has given up employment which paid him or her
                        less than what the court would award to a relative who had not given up paid
                        employment and was therefore entitled to the cost of commercial care as
                        discounted, the same award should be made to both. This seems only right,
                        though it is contrary to Stuart-Smith L.J.’s approach in <em>Fitzgerald v Ford</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    He further argues in <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para 38-232 that the statement that the
                    “ceiling would be the commercial rate” in <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> was strictly <em>dicta</em> and is not binding. A plaintiff should be allowed to
                    recover the cost of a devoted family carer even if it is more expensive (when
                    assessed based on loss of income) than outside professionals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    A final point I would make is that there are
                    precedents where English courts have awarded a plaintiff damages on the basis of
                    the cost of care approach even if computing damages on the basis of the income
                    approach would have resulted in a smaller award (<em>ie</em>, the opposite of <em>Fitzgerald v
                        Ford</em>). This can be seen in the Court of Appeal decision in
                        <em>Hogg v Doyle</em>, CA, Judgment of 6 March 1991
                    (Unreported), where the plaintiff was awarded damages based on the cost of care
                    approach, which amounted in substance to 1.5 times the plaintiff’s
                    caregiver’s loss of earnings. This was justified on the basis of the
                    extensive care provided by the caregiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The discussion above has perhaps raised more
                    difficulties than answers. Does the cost of care approach have any place in
                    Singapore law? If so, how should the relationship between the income approach
                    and the cost of care approach operate in practice?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The income approach and the cost of care
                    approach are premised on divergent conceptual paradigms. The income approach
                    views the cost of care which the plaintiff receives as that which had to be
                    foregone by the caregiver. By contrast, the cost of care approach views the cost
                    of care the plaintiff receives to be the fair value of the nursing and
                    caregiving services <em>actually provided</em> by the
                    caregiver, regardless of what the caregiver could have otherwise earned. That
                    said, I repeat the observation of O’Connor LJ in <em>Housecroft v Burnett</em> that the question is whether the sum
                    awarded is “sufficient to provide for the plaintiff’s
                    needs”. In that case, the needs include enabling the plaintiff to make
                    some monetary acknowledgment of his or her appreciation of all that her mother
                    (the caregiver) does for her, as well as making sufficient provision for the
                    plaintiff if her mother should “fall by the wayside”. The needs
                    are those of the <em>plaintiff</em>. The loss in question
                    is also the <em>plaintiff’s</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Coming back to the case authorities in
                    Singapore, the Court of Appeal established in <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (CA)</em> that in assessing the value of the gratuitous
                    caregiver’s care, the caregiver’s loss of income should be the
                    starting point. I am bound by this authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Indeed, there is merit in adopting the
                    income approach where the caregiver has given up employment. After all, from a
                    practical point of view, the value of the loss caused by the accident (in terms
                    of nursing or care needs) is indeed the loss of the income which the caregiver
                    would otherwise have earned. This is the plaintiff’s loss, because the
                    accident created the need for him to be cared for by family. The argument made
                    by the learner author of <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at
                    para 38-232 also supports this view: the cost of care a devoted husband provides
                    must be measured in terms of what he had to give up (a well-paying job) and not
                    just in terms of the actual commercial value of the nursing care he provides
                    (which may arguably be unquantifiable in the open market because from his
                    wife’s perspective, he is not substitutable by any other nurse or
                    caregiver).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The question that remains to be answered is
                    whether a similar approach should be applied to homemakers. Should only a
                    nominal value be awarded for the cost of their care on the basis that they did
                    not give up gainful employment? In my view, this must be wrong. Taking guidance
                    from the cost of care approach, the correct approach in such cases is to
                    consider the value of the care a caregiver <em>actually
                        provides</em> to a plaintiff (as derived from commercial rates with a
                    suitable discount applied where appropriate) . Even in the case of caregivers
                    who were earning nothing before (or an income lower than the cost of care), the
                    loss caused to a plaintiff must still be, at the minimum, the value of the care
                    that he requires as a result of the accident. To say that the value of the care
                    provided by a homemaker is merely nominal would not only unfairly devalue the
                    non-financial contributions of homemakers in our society, but would also devalue
                    the significant sacrifice the homemaker has to make as a result of the
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Thus, to summarise my conclusions at this
                    juncture, I find that in assessing the cost of gratuitous care received by a
                    plaintiff, the following approach is to be adopted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_a"></a>(a)     The caregiver’s foregone
                        income is to be the starting point.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_b"></a>(b)     This starting point may be departed from where
                        appropriate if the foregone income is <em>less
                            than</em> the fair value of the nursing and caring services
                        provided to the plaintiff. In such a case, the cost of the gratuitous care
                        received by a plaintiff shall be taken to be the fair value of the nursing
                        and caring services the plaintiff actually requires and
                    receives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    It is appropriate at this point to address a
                    concern raised earlier that it would be unfair to a defendant to require him to
                    compensate a plaintiff for the cost of a family carer if that family carer
                    happens to be earning a large salary. In my view, this concern should come in
                    only at the second stage of the inquiry, after the cost of a gratuitous
                    caregiver’s care has been assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Where it is clear on the facts that the
                    plaintiff has been and will continue to be cared for gratuitously by a family
                    carer, the first stage of the inquiry requires an <em>assessment
                        of the value of the care provided gratuitously</em> by the said
                    caregiver and received by the plaintiff. For this, the principles stated above
                    apply. Should the caregiver’s pre-accident income be $50,000, the value or
                    cost of the care gratuitously provided by that caregiver would ordinarily be
                    assessed at $50,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    This is where the second stage comes in. As
                    seen from <em>Eddie Toon</em> and the <em>dicta</em> in [11] of <em>Lee Wei Kong
                    (HC)</em>, the plaintiff must also show that it is <em>reasonable for him to receive the particular mode of care he seeks
                        compensation for</em>. The reasonableness inquiry will involve a
                    balancing of the plaintiff’s need for the specific mode of care, the
                    equivalence of the other available alternatives, and the costs of the various
                    modes of care. In <em>Eddie Toon</em>, where the court
                    found that institutional nursing care (with the plaintiff’s mother
                    travelling daily to visit him) or the assistance of a domestic maid was
                    sufficient to meet the needs of the plaintiff, hiring a private nurse to stay at
                    his home throughout the day was found to be unreasonable. Similarly, if a family
                    caregiver was earning $50,000 per month (and hence the costs of the family
                    carer’s care would be assessed at $50,000 per month as per the principles
                    laid down above), and the costs of professional nursing care (which may offer
                    the plaintiff superior care from a medical perspective) were substantially less,
                    the court may not find it reasonable that the plaintiff chooses to have his high
                    earning family carer stay at home to take care of him. On that basis, the court
                    may only award damages for future nursing care on the basis of the lower rate of
                    hired help. If the high-wage earning parent still chooses to stay at home and
                    provide the care and forgo the $50,000 salary - that is a choice for the parent
                    to make.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Indeed, I make the observation that the loss
                    of income approach set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lee Wei
                        Kong (CA)</em> at [63] is couched in terms of it being “the
                    starting point”. In appropriate cases, it must follow that adjustments
                    can be made: whether up or down from that starting point depending on the
                    overall facts and circumstances. Whilst it may be questioned whether
                    O’Connor LJ’s ceiling of the “commercial rate” is
                    rightly cast as a mandatory rule, there is no reason why it should not be a
                    factor, as a matter of fairness and reasonableness, which can be taken into
                    account in appropriate cases in assessing the plaintiff’s needs for
                    nursing and home care during his remaining life expectancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In my view, adopting the above approach to
                    determining the award that should be made for the past and future care of the
                    plaintiff (whether such care be provided gratuitously by a family carer, by a
                    domestic maid, by an institutional nursing home, or by a private stay-in nurse)
                    allows the court to fairly balance the interest of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Applying the above to the present case, it
                    is clear that the Plaintiff’s mother will continue caring for him
                    gratuitously. The first stage of the inquiry is therefore triggered – what
                    is the value which should be ascribed to her caregiving? Her loss of income is
                    the starting point. As seen above, I have affirmed the AR’s decision that
                    the Plaintiff’s mother has foregone $1,508 per month in salary. The only
                    question that remains is whether this falls below the fair value of the nursing
                    and caring services the Plaintiff’s mother <em>actually
                        provides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    In the present case, little evidence was
                    provided on that. Based on the parties’ submissions, I do not have enough
                    to determine if the Plaintiff’s mother provides care akin to a private
                    nurse, or whether a second domestic helper could fulfil her role. As such, the
                    sum of $1,508 per month should be taken as the value of the Plaintiff’s
                    mother’s caregiving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    I move on to the second stage of the
                    inquiry. Again, the parties did not make submissions on whether it was
                    reasonable to award $1,508 per month as the Plaintiff’s cost of care given
                    the range of alternatives available. The Defendant’s only submission on
                    appeal is that the Plaintiff’s mother would have likely quit her job. I
                    have already rejected this submission. Based on the material before me,
                    therefore, I find that $1,508 per month is a reasonable sum to award the
                    Plaintiff for the costs of one of his caregivers (<em>ie</em>, his mother).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I therefore substantially uphold the
                    AR’s reasoning on the mother’s loss of future earnings. I only
                    adjust the actual award she made on the basis that a 14-year multiplier rather
                    than a 12-year multiplier should be adopted. I therefore award the Plaintiff
                    $274,456 for the cost of his mother’s future caregiving. I derive this
                    figure as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$1,508 x 13 month (inclusive of a month’s bonus) x
                            14 = <b>$274,456</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future transport expenses </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Future transport expenses relate to the cost
                    of private ambulance trips needed to transport the Plaintiff to the hospital for
                    follow-ups. In awarding the Plaintiff $23,520 for future transport expenses, the
                    AR took into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_a"></a>(a)     Award should only relate to
                        non-emergency cases because the cost of the ambulance is included in the
                        hospitalisation bill in emergency cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff is likely to take an average of
                        28 non-emergency trips to the hospital annually: physiotherapy sessions
                        twice a month (12 x 2 = 24), and medical consultations four times a
                        year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        average cost of private ambulance services is $70 given the invoices for the
                        ambulance fees show that the costs ranged from $50 to
                $90.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The Plaintiff makes two points on
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Plaintiff submits that
                        the AR was wrong to leave out an award for the cost of ambulance services in
                        emergency cases. According to the Plaintiff’s counsel, historical data
                        shows that the cost of private ambulance services for emergency cases is not
                        included in the Plaintiff’s hospitalisation bills.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiff submits that
                        the AR was wrong about the average costs of ambulance services. Apparently,
                        the cost of a one-way transfer is $50 to $90. The average cost of a two-way
                        transfer is $110. Naturally, the Plaintiff submits that he should be awarded
                        the cost of a two-way transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Frequency of trips</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    On the first point, the Plaintiff submits
                    that the appropriate number of two-way ambulance trips he should be compensated
                    for is <u>673</u>. I cite the following table from the
                    Plaintiff’s closing submissions to explain his claim:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The AR has already included the trips for
                    the first and third items in the table (<em>ie</em>,
                    medical consultation and non-intensive rehabilitation and physiotherapy) in her
                    calculations of the total number of trips needed in a year. There is no appeal
                    relating to that decision. On the fourth item, <em>ie</em>,
                    rehabilitation and physiotherapy during the intensified period after the two
                    tenotomy procedures, I have decided above that the AR’s global award for
                    two rehabilitation and physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the
                    Plaintiff’s life is appropriate. I have explained that the award of two
                    physiotherapy sessions a month seems to more than adequately cater for even the
                    intensified period after the tenotomy procedures. It thus follows that the
                    Plaintiff’s claim for transport costs to his post-tenotomy rehabilitation
                    sessions is adequately covered by the third item in the above table and the
                    claim for the fourth item in the table above must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    According to the Plaintiff, the remaining
                    three items claimed in the table above relate to emergency cases. The question
                    therefore is whether the hospitalisation bills for URTI treatment, pneumonia
                    treatment, tenotomy procedures, and botox and baclofen infusion treatment,
                    include the cost of a two-way ambulance transfer. If it does, allowing the
                    Plaintiff to claim for private ambulance costs here would effectively allow
                    double recovery because these costs would have already been taken into account
                    in calculating the appropriate award for the above treatments and procedures.
                    However, if the hospitalisation bill does not cover transport costs, then the
                    Plaintiff should rightfully be entitled to claim the cost of a two-way ambulance
                    transfer each time his injuries necessitate a trip to the
                hospital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Before me, the Defendant’s counsel
                    conceded that the hospitalisation bill for the Plaintiff’s visit to the
                    hospital on 14 July 2012 did not include ambulance costs. He did not seek to
                    challenge the sufficiency of the evidence the Plaintiff adduced, and I hence
                    proceed on the basis that an award should be made for emergency ambulance
                    trips.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Looking at the above table, the appropriate
                    award for item 5 should be seven trips rather than 10 trips (see my conclusion
                    above at [61]–[69]). In relation to item 2, the Plaintiff’s
                    submission of seven trips per year for URTI treatment does not appear to be
                    disputed (see [44] above). The claim for four treatments for tenotomy and botox
                    and baclofen infusion treatments seems reasonable as well given the AR’s
                    conclusion that the Plaintiff would require two tenotomy procedures (see the
                    AR’s Judgment at [64]) and two botox and baclofen infusion treatments (see
                    the AR’s Judgment at [66]) for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Thus, to sum up, the following table
                    represents the number of ambulance trips I am awarding, on the basis of a
                    14-year multiplier:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Average cost of a two-way ambulance transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The next question is simple: what is the
                    average cost of a two-way ambulance transfer? I am satisfied that based on the
                    invoices, the AR mistakenly assumed that $50 to $90 was the cost of a <em>two-way</em> ambulance transfer. At the oral hearing before
                    me on 7 September 2015, the Defendant’s counsel conceded that $100 was a
                    good estimate of the average two-way ambulance costs. He recognised that costs
                    may be higher depending on whether the ambulance trip is taken during or outside
                    office hours. As such, I find that $100 is a good estimate of the average costs
                    of a two-way ambulance transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Thus, I allow in part the Plaintiff’s
                    appeal against the AR’s award of $23,520 for future transport expenses,
                    and award the Plaintiff $50,100 instead. I derive this figure as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>501 trips x $100 = <b>$50,100</b></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I note that this roughly accords with the
                    Defendant’s oral submission that an additional ballpark figure of $20,000
                    should be awarded for emergency transport. The final award appears about $7,000
                    more than what the Defendant submits because of my conclusion that the
                    appropriate multiplier to be applied is 14 rather than 12.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future expenses for daily consumables and essentials </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    At [98]–[99] of the AR’s
                    Judgment, the AR awarded $325 per month for daily consumables and essentials
                    (such as nasogastric tubes, suction tubes, diapers, liquid diet, daily dressings
                    and wipes). It is undisputed that this sum was derived after deducting the
                    subsidies the Plaintiff received from the KK Women’s and Children’s
                    Hospital (“KKH”) Health Endowment Fund and the Medifund Junior
                    Scheme (see [98]–[99] of the AR’s Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that the AR
                    should not have taken into account the subsidies the Plaintiff received. At the
                    court’s request, the Plaintiff tendered a letter dated 29 April 2015 from
                    the Medical Social Work Department of KKH which stated that the Plaintiff will
                    not qualify for financial assistance once he receives the damages awarded for
                    his injuries. As such, the Plaintiff submits that $1,000 per month for daily
                    consumables and essentials is a more appropriate multiplicand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In light of the new evidence,
                    the Defendant has since accepted that the Plaintiff’s figure of $1,000 per
                    month is reasonable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    As such, I allow the Plaintiff’s
                    appeal on this issue, and award the Plaintiff $168,000 for future daily
                    consumables and essentials. I derive this figure as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$1,000 per month x 12 months x 14-year multiplier =
                                <b>$168,000</b></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    As a result of the Defendant’s
                    negligence, the Plaintiff has no hope of ever earning a wage or supporting
                    himself. Moreover, medical experts estimate that the number of years he has left
                    to live has been shortened considerably (he is expected to live only up to an
                    age of 38). It is thus not at all inaccurate to say that the Defendant’s
                    actions have caused the Plaintiff to lose all the working years he would have
                    had as a normal, healthy adult if the accident did not take place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The question before the court, however, is
                    whether compensation should be given for the Plaintiff’s <em>loss of earnings</em> across all the years of life he no
                    longer has, but would have had, if he did not meet with the accident (the
                    multiplier question). Moreover, a second question that arises is how much the
                    Plaintiff would have earned (in terms of a monthly wage) across his years of
                    working life (the multiplicand question). The difficulty in estimating the
                    second is obvious in the present case – this nine year-old boy could very
                    well have become a wealthy businessman or professional, as much as he could have
                    ended up in a low-waged blue collar job. The only thing that is clear is that
                    after the accident, neither of these are possibilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    At the hearing below, the AR adopted a
                    multiplier of nine years in relation to the Plaintiff’s loss of future
                    earnings. She assumed that the Plaintiff would only start work after finishing
                    National Service at 22 years old. Neither party objected to that assumption. She
                    then reasoned that given the Plaintiff is expected to live up to 38 years old,
                    he is likely to have 16 years of working life. She rejected the
                    Plaintiff’s submission that a multiplier of 16 years should be adopted,
                    stating that the multiplier must be discounted for the vicissitudes of life and
                    the accelerated receipt of a lump sum award which can be invested to yield a
                    return (see [33] of the AR’s Judgment). On the basis of <em>Eddie Toon</em>, where the court adopted a nine-year multiplier for a
                    plaintiff who was 7.5 years old at the time of the accident and was likely to
                    have 19 years of working life in view of his reduced life expectancy, the AR
                    adopted a multiplier of nine years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that a
                    multiplier of 20 years (or 16 years in the alternative) should be awarded. The
                    Plaintiff makes this submission on the basis of a new argument that was never
                    raised before the AR. The argument is that the Plaintiff should be awarded loss
                    of future earnings up until the normal retirement age of 62 years old, <em>ie</em> for 40 years of working life, since this is the
                    period he would likely have worked and earned a salary if the accident had not
                    taken place. In other words, the Plaintiff submits that he should also be
                    awarded damages for his loss of future earnings during the years he has lost due
                    to the accident. I shall refer to this as the “lost years
                    claim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    At the first hearing before me, the matter
                    was adjourned and I asked parties to make further written submissions on the
                    differences between a lost years claim by a living plaintiff, a deceased
                    plaintiff’s estate, and a dependency claim. The parties duly tendered the
                    written submissions, and I must express my gratitude for the detailed and
                    well-researched arguments presented. Indeed, having read the submissions, it is
                    apparent that the legislative and historical context in which a lost years claim
                    is made is of some significance. It is to that which I first turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legislative and historical context of a lost years claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Where a plaintiff’s life is truncated
                    because of a defendant’s negligence, the lost years can never be fully
                    made good by a monetary award. Indeed, even in the case of the loss of
                    opportunity to earn a wage and to generate an income in the years that have been
                    taken away, considerable problems have arisen in determining the extent to which
                    such “losses” can be compensated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I pause here to note two different factual
                    scenarios whereby a claim for loss of earnings in respect of the years lost
                    might arise. First, there is the case where the tortfeasor has killed the
                    victim. The second is where the tortfeasor has injured the victim such that his
                    or her normal life expectancy has been reduced. In both cases, difficult
                    questions of law and policy arise where a claim is brought in respect of loss of
                    expectation of life and loss of earnings or earning capacity in respect of the
                    years lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    The problem is perhaps at its most acute in
                    the first scenario. The common law rule was that no action could be brought for
                    loss suffered through the killing of another. This position was eventually
                    changed by Parliament. In Singapore, it is now dealt with by various provisions
                    in the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Civil Law Act”). That
                    said, even in the second scenario, the question as to whether it is proper for
                    the victim to maintain a claim for loss of earnings in respect of the years lost
                    (as opposed to any loss of earnings or earning capacity in the years of life
                    that remain) has caused problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    A number of philosophical questions arise.
                    First, it may be asked, as did Lord Scarman in <em>Pickett
                        (Administratix of the Estate of Ralph Henry Pickett Deceased) v British Rail
                        Engineering Ltd</em> [1978] 3 WLR 955 (“<em>Pickett v British Rail</em>”) at 980H: what does compensation
                    mean when it is assessed in respect of a period after death?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    As Lord Scarman candidly responds (at 981E),
                    there is no completely satisfying answer. While it can be said that a plaintiff
                    who loses the ability to earn a living because of an accident suffers a loss of
                    earnings in the period that he <em>lives
                    incapacitated</em>, it is not as easy to say the same for a plaintiff who
                    has lost the chance at living itself. The loss of earnings during those lost
                    years arguably belongs to his “future self” who will no longer be
                    around to earn and enjoy them because of the accident. That said, Lord
                    Scarman’s comment at 981F also bears repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The logical and philosophical difficulties of compensating a man
                        for a loss arising after his death emerge only if one treats the loss as a
                        non-pecuniary loss – which to some extent it is. <em>But it is also a pecuniary loss</em> – the money would have
                        been his to deal with as he chose, had he lived…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Second, another question is asked: who is or
                    are the parties that have suffered loss and who ought to be compensated? We
                    might assume that the answer is clear and straightforward – it is the
                    plaintiff who has suffered loss. However, as will be seen, the law as it has
                    developed is very much concerned about compensating the loss caused to <em>dependants</em> as well. The line between the two is blurred
                    at times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Third, assuming the loss of earnings during
                    the lost years is properly seen as the plaintiff’s own loss, yet another
                    question arises: how does the law conceptualise what the plaintiff has lost?
                    This is related to the first question. Is the object of the monetary award to
                    compensate the plaintiff for his loss of a chance at enjoying his earnings? But,
                    that is something no monetary award can ever remedy. It is an irremediable fact
                    that the years of potential enjoyment are lost. Further, to earn that income and
                    to enjoy the income, expenses will have to be incurred. Indeed, the
                    “right” to spend money on oneself is a self-evident common way of
                    enjoying the fruits of labour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Perhaps, as suggested by Lord Wilberforce in
                        <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> (at 962A), the loss
                    suffered by the plaintiff is the loss of the financial ability to use such part
                    of the income that he does not need for his dependants, or for other persons or
                    causes which he wishes to support. Or perhaps, as suggested by Lord Scarman in
                    the passage I quoted above, there is no need to further conceptualise the loss.
                    The loss is a straightforward pecuniary loss – money which would have been
                    his, but is no longer his, because of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Compelled by the myriad of different factual
                    circumstances, three distinct types of claims have developed in English and
                    Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    First, a <em>living
                        plaintiff’s claim</em> for loss of income during the lost years.
                    This is the claim in the present case. The plaintiff’s life expectancy and
                    hence his working years are reduced, but the plaintiff is alive at the time of
                    trial. I shall call this a “Living Plaintiff’s
                    Claim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Second, an <em>estate
                        claim</em> for a deceased plaintiff’s loss of income during the
                    lost years. This relates to a situation where the plaintiff has died as a result
                    of the accident at the time of the trial, but the estate
                    “inherits” his claim for lost years and pursues the action for the
                    damages the plaintiff would have been entitled to had he been alive to
                    personally pursue the action. I shall call this an “Estate Claim”.
                    In Singapore, the enabling statutory provision can be found at s 10 of the Civil
                    Law Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Third, a <em>claim by the
                        dependants</em> for the loss they suffered as a result of the
                    deceased’s loss of income during the lost years. This relates to a
                    situation where the plaintiff has died as a result of the accident at the time
                    of the trial, and his or her dependants make a claim for the loss they suffered
                    as a result of the deceased’s loss of earnings due to his death. I shall
                    call this a “Dependant’s Claim”. In Singapore, the enabling
                    statutory provision can be found at s 20 of the Civil Law Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    These claims all arise from the tortfeasor
                    having caused a plaintiff’s death or reduced life expectancy, which
                    results in a loss of earnings during the lost years. A brief review of the
                    historical development of these claims may be helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    In <em>Lassiter Ann Masters
                        (suing as the widow and dependant of Lassiter Henry Adolphus, deceased) v To
                        Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 8
                        (“<em>Lassiter</em>”) at [12]–[29],
                    Woo Bih Li J explained the legislative history behind the development of these
                    claims in great detail. Reference may therefore be made to <em>Lassiter</em> for a more detailed exposition of the historical
                    development of these claims. I mention only the salient points
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Singapore’s law on fatal accidents and
                    claims for loss of income has followed English law quite closely: <em>Lassiter</em> at [12]. English law, as noted above, started
                    out by disallowing all claims when a plaintiff passes on. This was based on the
                    common law principle that a personal action dies with the person. However,
                    because of the injustice that dependants were thought to suffer from losing
                    their sole breadwinner in an accident caused by a defendant’s negligence,
                    the United Kingdom (“UK”) passed the Fatal Accidents Act 1846
                    (UK). This Act enabled prescribed classes of dependants to bring an action for
                    loss of dependency against a tortfeasor who caused the death of their relatives.
                    This legislative provision is presently in force in the UK under s 1 of the
                    English Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (UK). It is also in force in Singapore under s
                    20 of the Civil Law Act. It should be noted that such a claim cannot be brought
                    if the plaintiff had obtained judgment against the defendant for the
                    “wrongful act, neglect or default” before he died.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    There was a second development in English,
                    and subsequently, Singapore law, which culminated in what I referred to above as
                    the Estate Claim. The English Parliament passed the Law Reform (Miscellaneous
                    Provisions) Act 1934 (UK), which provided at s 1 that “on the death of
                    any person after the commencement of this Act all causes of action subsisting
                    against or vested in him shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the
                    benefit of, his estate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    In line with this amendment, Singapore
                    adopted s 8 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) (“the 1970 Civil Law
                    Act”). The English and Singapore provisions were <em>in
                        pari materia</em>. The provisions allowed a deceased plaintiff’s
                    estate to inherit and pursue, <em>inter alia</em>, his lost
                    years claim even after his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In England, the above legislative provisions
                    were applied in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> [1981] 2 WLR 248
                        (“<em>Gammell v Wilson</em>”). In that
                    case, the House of Lords upheld an Estate Claim for two young plaintiffs who
                    died as a result of the defendant’s negligence. Similarly, in Singapore,
                    the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Low Kok Tong v Teo Chan
                        Pan</em> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 643 (“<em>Low
                        Kok Tong</em>”) followed the House of Lords in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em>, and allowed an Estate
                Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    While an Estate Claim was thus recognised by
                    the highest courts of both jurisdictions, I note that both courts came to the
                    decision with significant reluctance and regret. In particular, the courts were
                    concerned with the potential unfairness to a defendant arising from the
                    possibility of double recovery by the estate and by the dependants under statute
                        (<em>ie</em>, the possibility that an Estate Claim and
                    a Dependant’s Claim can both succeed simultaneously, resulting in the
                    defendant having to pay damages twice for the same loss caused).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The English Parliament intervened after
                        <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> by passing the Administration
                    of Justice Act 1982 (UK). The 1982 Act amended the Law Reform (Miscellaneous
                    Provisions) Act 1934 (UK) by adding that an estate <em>does
                        not</em> inherit actions for “damages for loss of income in
                    respect of any period after that person’s death”. This essentially
                    precluded an estate from bringing a lost years claim after the plaintiff’s
                    death. Singapore followed suit in 1987, and the same amendment (<em>in pari materia</em>) can be found at s 10(3)(<em>a</em>)(ii) of the Civil Law Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Notably, from the Singapore Parliamentary
                    Debates, Official Report (4 March 1987) vol 49 at cols 66–69, it can be
                    seen that Parliament was concerned with solving the following problems in
                    passing the 1987 amendment:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_191-p2_a"></a>(a)     the problem of double compensation
                        as described above; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_191-p2_b"></a>(b)     the problem of unjustly enriching distant relatives who
                        are beneficiaries of the estate but are not dependants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    In my view, this legislative history
                    strongly suggests that <em>where a plaintiff has already passed
                        on</em>, Parliament has been primarily concerned with compensating the
                        <em>loss to the dependants</em>. The choice to remove
                    an Estate Claim and retain a Dependant’s Claim demonstrates that. The law
                    is not concerned with compensating a deceased plaintiff’s <em>personal</em> loss of earnings in the lost years (which
                    should ordinarily belong to the estate like any other claim); it is instead
                    concerned with compensating the dependants for their loss of support. It must be
                    borne in mind that the deceased’s dependants are not necessarily the same
                    persons entitled to his estate. The question that remains is whether this policy
                    inclination applies, or ought to apply, in respect of a <em>living plaintiff</em> who has lost years based on medical estimates
                    of reduced life expectancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    It might have been observed that the above
                    discussion of legislative history primarily concerns claims where the plaintiff
                    has <em>already passed on</em>. Little has been said about
                    a Living Plaintiff’s Claim, which is what the present case is concerned
                    with. Nevertheless, the above discussion provides a helpful backdrop for the
                    discussion that is to follow. I therefore now turn to discussing whether a
                    living plaintiff can make a lost years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lost years claim for a living plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Philosophically controversial as it may be,
                    it has become relatively uncontroversial in law that a living plaintiff does
                    have a lost years claim. This general proposition may well be subject to certain
                    exceptions, but it is certainly true as a starting point. Indeed, if this were
                    not the case, the problem in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> as
                    well as <em>Low Kok Tong</em> would never have arisen. The
                    estate would not have <em>inherited</em> a claim for lost
                    years if the deceased plaintiff never had such a claim when he was alive. I
                    shall now consider the local and English authorities which support a Living
                    Plaintiff’s Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Singapore position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    As a preliminary, I note the
                    Defendant’s submission that to the best of his knowledge, there are no
                    local decisions on a Living Plaintiff’s Claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This is not entirely accurate, as will be seen
                    from the discussion that follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In <em>Low Kok
                        Tong</em>, the deceased plaintiff was a 20 year-old national
                    serviceman who died from the injuries he sustained in a traffic accident. The
                    administrators of his estate made a claim for loss of future earnings under s 8
                    of the 1970 Civil Law Act (which was then in force). The Singapore Court of
                    Appeal allowed the Estate Claim (see [13] of the judgment). It cited <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> and <em>Gammell v
                        Wilson</em> as authority for the following propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_a"></a>(a)     A person is entitled to be
                        compensated not only for the immediate reduction in his earnings but also
                        for the loss of the whole period for which he has been deprived of his
                        ability to earn them: <em>Low Kok Tong</em> at
                        [7].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_196-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        deceased’s estate is entitled to bring a claim for lost years under s
                        8 of the 1970 Civil Law Act because the lost years claim vested in the
                        deceased before he died: <em>Low Kok Tong</em> at
                        [9]–[10].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    While this decision has effectively been
                    overturned by the 1987 legislative amendment previously discussed, <em>only</em> the second proposition at [196(b)] above was
                    rejected by Parliament – a deceased’s estate no longer can pursue a
                    lost years claim. Importantly, the legislative amendments have no impact on
                    whether a <em>living plaintiff</em> still has such a claim.
                        <em>Low Kok Tong</em> therefore is still good authority
                    for the proposition at [196(a))] above, that a living plaintiff can make a lost
                    years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    This position has been taken in two
                    subsequent High Court cases as well. The first case is <em>Au
                        Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban and another</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 290
                        (“<em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em>”). That
                    case concerned a plaintiff who sustained injuries in a road accident. He was
                    severely disabled because of the accident and his life expectancy was reduced by
                    10 to 15 years, but he lived to bring a claim for personal injury. The High
                    Court awarded the plaintiff future loss of earnings for the period in which his
                    working life was shortened. The award was made by basing the multiplier for loss
                    of future earnings “on the working life of the plaintiff prior to his
                    injuries”: <em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em> at [59]. A
                    Living Plaintiff Claim was thus allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    The second case is <em>Ramesh
                        s/o Ayakanno (suing by the committee of the person and the estate, Ramiah
                        Naragatha Vally) v Chua Gim Hock</em> [2008] SGHC 33
                        (“<em>Ramesh v Chua</em>”). The High
                    Court (at [36]) affirmed the assistant registrar’s observation that an
                    award for loss of future earnings was to compensate the plaintiff for losses he
                    would not have incurred but for the accident. The plaintiff’s lifespan
                    would not have been reduced if not for the accident. An appropriate multiplier
                    must therefore be assessed with reference to the plaintiff’s <em>natural or pre-accident working life</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    I must point out that a potentially contrary
                    authority exists and was brought to my attention by the parties. That is the
                    case of <em>Eddie Toon</em>. In <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em>, the High Court adopted a multiplier of 9 years for the
                    plaintiff’s loss of future earnings, taking into account the fact that the
                    then seven and a half years old plaintiff’s post-accident working life
                    would be 19 years: see <em>Eddie Toon</em> at
                    [53]–[56]. The plaintiff was only expected to live up to an age of 40
                    after the accident, and he was assumed to start work at 21 years old. The High
                    Court did not make an award for loss of earnings during the plaintiff’s
                    lost years. This question was never discussed. It appears that neither side
                    brought the issue of lost years up, nor did the court consider the matter. I
                    therefore do not think that <em>Eddie Toon</em> stands as
                    an authority <em>against</em> the granting of a lost years
                    claim. The claim was not granted simply because the plaintiff never put it into
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    In conclusion, the Singapore authorities
                    quite unanimously support the existence of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim.
                    Whether there are exceptions to this general position is a matter that shall be
                    subsequently discussed. I now consider the English authorities on the
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">English position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    The most important English decision on a
                    lost years claim is arguably the House of Lords decision in <em>Pickett v British Rail</em>. In that case, the court held that a
                    living plaintiff does have a lost years claim. The plaintiff was 51 years old
                    when he contracted mesothelioma. This was caused by breathing in asbestos dust
                    at work. The plaintiff successfully sued his employer for negligence and claimed
                    damages for personal injuries. At the time of the trial, the plaintiff was
                    expected to have only a year left to live. He had passed on by the time the case
                    reached the House of Lords on appeal. The court found that if not for the
                    asbestos dust that he had breathed in at work, the plaintiff would have been
                    expected to live up to 65 years old. The court therefore held that the plaintiff
                    was entitled to recover damages for loss of earnings during the lost years, but
                    that the damages should be computed after deduction of his probable living
                    expenses (see 963E, 966E, 974H and 981H–982A). I will not discuss the
                    issue of assessing the multiplicand at this juncture. Instead, what is of
                    importance at this stage is the majority’s reasons for allowing a lost
                    years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    The first key plank of the majority’s
                    reasoning is that the loss of earnings during the lost years was a real
                    pecuniary loss to the plaintiff personally. As Lord Edmund-Davies puts it (at
                    973H–974A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… With respect, it appears to me simply not right to say that, when
                        a man’s working life and his natural life are each shortened by the
                        wrongful act of another, he must be regarded as having lost nothing by the
                        deprivation of the prospect of future earnings for some period extending
                        beyond the anticipated date of his premature death. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Lord Scarman (at 981F) describes a plaintiff
                    whose life expectancy was reduced as suffering both a non-pecuniary and a
                    pecuniary loss. The pecuniary loss he refers to is the “money [that]
                    would have been his to deal with as he chose, had he lived”. Lord
                    Wilberforce was similarly of the view that to the plaintiff, “something
                    objective” has been lost (see 961G). He rhetorically states (at
                    961H–962A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Is he not entitled to say, at one moment I am a man with existing
                        capability to earn well for 14 years: the next moment can only earn less
                        well for one year? And why should he be compensated only for the immediate
                        reduction in his earnings and not for the loss of the whole period for which
                        he has been deprived of his ability to earn them? To the argument that "they
                        are of no value because you will not be there to enjoy them" can he not
                        reply, "yes they are: what is of value to me is not only my opportunity to
                        spend them enjoyably, but to use such part of them as I do not need for my
                        dependants, or for other persons or causes which I wish to support. If I
                        cannot do this, I have been deprived of something on which a value - a
                        present value - can be placed"?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    Indeed, Lord Wilberforce continued with the
                    trenchant observation that “[f]uture earnings are of value to him in
                    order that he may satisfy legitimate desires, but these may not correspond with
                    the allocation which the law makes of money recovered by dependants on account
                    of his loss. He may wish to benefit some dependents more than, or to the
                    exclusion of, others … He may not have dependents...” According to
                        <em>Pickett v British Rail</em>, it followed from basic
                    compensatory principles that the plaintiff should be awarded damages for his
                    loss of earnings during the lost years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The second important feature of the
                    majority’s reasoning is their holding that recovery does not depend on
                    whether the plaintiff has dependants. This, in my view, follows from the first
                    point made above. If the law is compensating the plaintiff for a pecuniary loss
                    he <em>personally</em> suffers, the existence of dependants
                    and the extent of loss they suffer must be irrelevant. Lord Edmund-Davies held
                    (at 973H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… For our present consideration relates solely to the <em>personal entitlement</em> of an injured party to recover
                        damages for the "lost years," <em>regardless both of whether
                            he has dependants and of whether or not he would (if he has any) make
                            provision for them</em> out of any compensation awarded to him or
                        his estate…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Lord Wilberforce (at 962D–F) and Lord
                    Scarman (at 980F–H) both took a similar position. While Lord Salmon was
                    concerned about the injustice that the plaintiff’s dependants may suffer
                    from the denial of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim (see 965B), he held (at
                    966D):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Certainly, the law can make no distinction between the plaintiff
                        who looks after dependants and the plaintiff who does not, in assessing the
                        damages recoverable to compensate the plaintiff for the money he would have
                        earned during the "lost years" but for the defendant's negligence.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    As can be seen from the above discussion,
                    the majority in <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> were in
                    agreement that a living plaintiff may successfully make a lost years claim,
                    regardless of whether he or she has dependants. Indeed, even if the plaintiff
                    has dependants, it does not mean that the plaintiff cannot, during his life,
                    spend all his monies and savings elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    The final observation I would make about the
                    reasoning in <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> for now is
                    that while the majority recognised that there were inevitably difficulties in
                    assessing the quantum of damages for a lost years claim, they were of the view
                    that the difficulties were not insuperable. Problems of evidence did not affect
                    the existence of the principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Lord Wilberforce held (at 962H) that a lost
                    years claim does not create “insoluble problems of assessment”
                    (though he did qualify his statement by distinguishing the case of a young
                    child). In the case of a young adolescent, Lord Wilberforce thought that the
                    value of lost earnings whilst real would probably be assessed as small. Lord
                    Salmon stated (at 966E) that “[t]he assessment of these living expenses
                    may, no doubt, sometimes present difficulties, but certainly no difficulties
                    which would be insuperable for the courts to resolve”. Lord Edmund-Davies
                    similarly observed (at 974G) that the lost earnings are not “far too
                    speculative to be capable of assessment by any court of law”. The
                    majority in <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> therefore
                    allowed the plaintiff’s lost years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    
          <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em> was subsequently applied by the House of Lords in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em>. While the House of Lords in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> expressed some reservations about
                    granting an Estate Claim, it nevertheless held that following <em>Pickett v British Rail</em>, the deceased had a lost years claim
                    which survived for the benefit of his estate under s 1 of the Law Reform
                    (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (UK).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Notably, in light of the young ages of the
                    two plaintiffs in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> (15 and 22
                    years old), the House of Lords expressed some concern about the difficulty of
                    assessing damages for their estates’ lost years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Lord Diplock (at 250G) described the task of
                    assessing damages in that case as indulging “in what can be no better
                    than the merest speculation about what might have happened to the deceased
                    during a normal working life-span if he had not been prematurely killed”.
                    Lord Edmund-Davies (at 259E–F) found that “[t]he process of
                    assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain that it can hardly be
                    dignified with the name of calculation; it is little more than
                    speculation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Yet, notwithstanding these concerns, the
                    court ultimately allowed the Estate Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    Indeed, while the Administration of Justice
                    Act 1982 (UK) effectively reversed <em>Gammell v
                        Wilson</em>, it did not disturb the conclusion that a <em>living plaintiff</em> has a claim for lost years: <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para 38-108. It merely prevented
                    a deceased plaintiff’s lost years claim from being vested in his
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    It is clear that in both Singapore and in
                    the UK, a <em>living plaintiff</em> may successfully bring
                    a lost years claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lost years claim for a young, living plaintiff </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Given the weight of English authority, the
                    Defendant accepts that a living plaintiff may have a claim for lost
                        years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, the crux of the
                    Defendant’s objection to the lost years claim <em>in the
                        present case</em> is that a <em>young</em> living
                    plaintiff should not be allowed an award for loss of earnings during his lost
                    years. The argument appears to be either (a) young living plaintiffs are an
                    exception to the rule, or (b) the claim will fail because of the absence of
                    sufficient objective evidence proving what the young plaintiff’s earnings
                    are likely to be, or indeed, what the future expenses of the young plaintiff are
                    likely to be but for the accident and injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    The main authority the Defendant cites is
                    the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Croke v
                        Wiseman</em> [1982] 1 WLR 71 (“<em>Croke v
                        Wiseman</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    In <em>Croke v
                        Wiseman</em>, the infant plaintiff was 21 months old when he was
                    injured by the defendant’s medical negligence. As a result, the
                    plaintiff’s life expectancy was reduced to 40 years. The court unanimously
                    held that the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim failed. However, the
                    majority held (Lord Denning M.R. dissenting) that the infant plaintiff did have
                    a loss of earnings claim for the time period during which he was expected to
                    live (<em>ie</em>, up to the age of 40).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    The Defendant does not dispute that the
                    Plaintiff in the present case does have a loss of earnings claim for the time
                    period during which he is expected to live. However, the Defendant relies on the
                    reasoning in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em> to support its
                    position that a <em>young</em> living plaintiff should not
                    be awarded damages for loss of earnings during his <em>lost
                        years</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Griffiths LJ, whom Shaw LJ substantially
                    agreed with (see 85A), had two main reasons for rejecting the plaintiff’s
                    lost years claim in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em>. The first
                    reason is the difficulty of assessing the sum that should be awarded as damages
                    for loss of earnings during the lost years. Griffiths LJ acknowledged (at 81H)
                    that while it is “a task of the greatest difficulty to assess an
                    appropriate sum to award a young child for future loss of earnings”, the
                    court frequently undertakes such tasks. However, Griffiths LJ was of the view
                    that in a lost years claim, the court faces an <em>even greater
                        difficulty</em> (see 82D):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In attempting to assess the value of a claim for the lost years,
                        the court is faced with a peculiar difficulty. Not only does it have to
                        assess what sum the plaintiff might have been earning, but <em>it also has to make an assessment of the sum that would not
                            have been spent upon the plaintiff's own living expenses and would have,
                            therefore, been available to spend upon his dependants</em>.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    Thus, the difficulty of assessment is, in a
                    sense, doubled. Not only must a court predict what a young plaintiff’s
                        <em>future earnings</em> would be, it must also predict
                    his <em>future expenses</em>. Indeed, the difficulty of
                    assessing damages for a young plaintiff’s lost years claim was also
                    acknowledged by the House of Lords in <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em> and <em>Gammell v
                Wilson</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em>, Lord Wilberforce expressed the view (at 962H) that in the
                    case of a young child, “neither present nor future earnings could enter
                    into the matter” because of the problems of assessment. Lord Salmon
                    stated (at 966A) that in the case of a young child, “lost earnings are so
                    unpredictable and speculative that only a minimal sum could properly be
                    awarded”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    In <em>Gammell v
                        Wilson</em>, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton expressed the strong view (at
                    259D–E) that it would be hard to assess a young plaintiff’s lost
                    years claim because he had “no established earning capacity or settled
                    pattern of life”. He observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is particularly difficult to justify the law in cases such as
                        the present, in each of which the deceased was a <em>young
                            man with no established earning capacity or settled pattern of
                            life</em>. In such cases it is hardly possible to make a
                        reasonable estimate of his probable earnings during the "lost years" and it
                        is, I think, quite impossible to take the further step of making a
                        reasonable estimate of the free balance that would have been available above
                        the cost of maintaining himself throughout the "lost years," and the amount
                        of that free balance is the relevant figure for calculating damages. The
                        process of assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain that
                            <em>it can hardly be dignified with the name of
                            calculation; it is little more than speculation</em>. Yet that is
                        the process which the courts are obliged to carry out at present.
                        …</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    This concern was shared by Lord Diplock (at
                    250G and 253D–E), Lord Russell (at 262A) and Lord Scarman (at
                    265F).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Griffith LJ’s second reason for
                    rejecting the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em> was that the plaintiff does not, can never, and
                    will never have dependants. I find it useful to cite Griffith LJ’s
                    reasoning (at 82E–F) in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the case of a living plaintiff of mature years whose life
                        expectation has been shortened and who has dependants, there are compelling
                        social reasons for awarding a sum of money that he knows will be available
                        for the support of his dependants after his death. It was this consideration
                        that led to the result in <em>Pickett's</em> case.
                        … In the case of a child, however, there are no dependants, and if a
                        child is dead there can never be any dependants and, if the injuries are
                        catastrophic, equally there will never be any dependants. It is that child
                        that will be dependent. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Griffiths LJ thus found that the
                    “compelling social reason” to grant a lost years claim, that is
                    the dependants’ loss of support, was not present in the case of a young
                    child who will never have any dependants. A lost years claim was therefore
                    denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    The Defendant submits that in Singapore,
                        <em>Eddie Toon</em> is good authority for the rejection
                    of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim where the plaintiff is young. However, as
                    explained at [200] above, the High Court in <em>Eddie
                        Toon</em> cannot be taken to have rejected a lost years claim. An
                    award for lost years was not made because the parties never raised it as an
                    issue before the court. Indeed, there seems to be a dearth of local authority on
                    whether a <em>young</em>, living plaintiff’s lost
                    years claim may succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    In considering this novel issue in the
                    Singapore context, I propose to first consider Griffith LJ’s concern
                    regarding the difficulty of assessing damages for a young plaintiff’s lost
                    years claim. In particular, the court must consider whether any assessment of
                    damages is so inherently speculative such as to make the claim too remote to be
                    measurable (as per Lord Scarman in <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em> at 981H). Thereafter, I shall consider the significance of a
                    young plaintiff’s absence of dependants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Difficulty of assessing damages </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    The difficulties of assessing damages for a
                    young plaintiff’s lost years claims can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is often impossible to make a
                        factual finding, on a balance of probabilities, about what the young
                        plaintiff is likely to earn in future given working life is such a distant
                        future. Naturally, the younger he is, the more distant working life is, the
                        more difficult the fact finding exercise becomes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_230-p2_b"></a>(b)     It is also often impossible to make a
                        factual finding, on a balance of probabilities, about the plaintiff’s
                        likely spending patterns and expenses in the future when he no longer
                        depends on his parents for a living.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    Those who oppose awarding a young plaintiff
                    damages for loss of earnings during lost years would argue that any factual
                    finding in relation to the above two matters must inevitably be speculative and
                    arbitrary. They will argue that it therefore cannot be the basis for awarding
                    damages, and liability for a lost years claim must be denied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    I pause to note again that local authorities
                    have not fully explored the issue of the difficulty of assessing damages for a
                        <em>young plaintiff’s</em> lost years claim, as
                    well as its potential implications on <em>liability</em>.
                    The Singapore Court of Appeal did comment in <em>Lee Wei Kong
                        (CA)</em> (at [33]) that in the case of “injured plaintiffs who
                    were young at the time of the accident and had yet to commence work at the time
                    of the trial … the main difficulty with quantifying [loss of future
                    earnings] … is in determining the multiplicand, as many imponderables
                    come into play. Undeniably, in this exercise, the court is being asked to look
                    into the future”. Nevertheless, the court did not have to consider if
                    such assessment difficulties had an impact on <em>liability</em> (specifically, if it negated liability), especially if
                    the plaintiff in question were even younger (the plaintiff in <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> was aged 18 at the time of the
                    accident).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    I return now to the English authorities to
                    discuss one final, but rather important, English Court of Appeal case –
                    <em>Iqbal v Whipps Cross University Hospital NHS Trust</em>
                    [2008] P.I.Q.R. P9 (“<em>Iqbal v
                    Whipps</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    The Court of Appeal in <em>Iqbal v Whipps</em> makes important comments on Griffith LJ’s
                    two concerns in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em>, namely, the
                    difficulty of assessing damages, and the absence of dependants. However, I shall
                    limit my discussion to the first concern at this juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    The plaintiff in <em>Iqbal v
                        Whipps</em> was an infant injured at birth by the defendant’s
                    medical negligence. As a result, he sustained dystonic tetraplegic cerebral
                    palsy and his life expectancy was reduced to 41 years. The Court of Appeal
                    dismissed the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim. While it expressed
                    great dissatisfaction in doing so, it held that it was bound by its previous
                    decision in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em> to deny a young
                    plaintiff’s lost years claim (see [64], [89] and [92]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    On the difficulty of assessing damages, the
                    Court of Appeal’s main point in <em>Iqbal v
                        Whipps</em> seems to be that the task, while difficult, is not
                    insurmountably so. Courts are in fact required to undertake similar tasks in
                    similar contexts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    One such context is most obviously the
                    assessment of a young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings <em>during the time he is expected to live</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    Gage LJ found it “difficult to accept
                    that if it is possible to assess prospective future loss of earnings for the
                    lifetime of a young child, even allowing for the difficulty of assessing the
                    surplus, it is not possible to assess damages for the lost years” (see
                    [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    Rimer LJ held (at [81]–[82]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81 … True it is that the indications given in both <em>Pickett</em> and <em>Gammell</em>
                        were that the assessment exercise in the case of a child as young as the
                        present claimant was likely to be too speculative to justify more than a
                        modest award, if any. But the judge [below] did not feel inhibited by that
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">82 In short, the techniques of assessment had moved on since <em>Pickett</em> and <em>Gammell</em>,
                        and there was no reason to shy away from the assessment of the claim in
                        respect of the lost years merely because of the extreme youth of the
                        claimant. In principle, I would not fault that approach. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    Notably, however, Gage LJ acknowledged at
                    [72] of his judgment that the more advanced techniques of assessment the court
                    referred to, <em>ie</em>, the “Ogden Tables”
                    used in the UK, “cannot offer any help on the element of speculation
                    identified in <em>Pickett</em> and <em>Gammell</em>”, which relates to “the surplus from which
                    the damages for the lost years are derived”. In other words, it seems
                    that the actuarial tables currently available in the UK do not assist the court
                    in determining the appropriate discount to apply to take into account expenses.
                    Moreover, in the present case, I note that I do not have the assistance of any
                    actuarial calculations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    Having considered the submissions and
                    authorities above, I find that the difficulty of assessing damages for the
                    Plaintiff’s lost years claim in this case <em>does
                        not</em> prevent the claim from succeeding. I do not think it is
                    impossible for the court to make a finding on how the Plaintiff’s life
                    would have turned out if the natural and ordinary course of events were allowed
                    to unfold, without the tragic intervention of the present accident. Of course,
                    it is impossible to predict with precision the <em>exact</em> life the Plaintiff would have led, the exact income he
                    would have earned in the future, and the exact living expenses he would have
                    incurred. However, this is not necessary for an assessment of damages claim.
                    Such certainty is never possible in any assessment of damages involving the
                    estimation of loss of earnings. Indeed, it bears repeating that in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em>, damages were awarded to the young
                    living plaintiff (21 months old) for the loss of earnings during the remainder
                    of his life. Factors taken into account included actuarial tables, the national
                    average wage for a young man, and family background.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    The court is entitled to use evidence of
                    general income and expenditure patterns of the average Singaporean to inform its
                    decision on the damages that it should award for the present Plaintiff’s
                    lost years claim. Indeed, the authorities, as well as both parties, acknowledge
                    that this is so with respect to future income <em>during the time
                        the Plaintiff is likely to live</em> (<em>ie</em>, up to the age of 38). If the difficulties of assessment do not
                    preclude an award for loss of future income during the time the Plaintiff is
                    likely to live, there is no reason why such difficulties, which are almost
                    identical in nature, should preclude a claim for loss of income during the lost
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    I acknowledge, as Griffiths LJ points out in
                        <em>Croke v Wiseman</em>, that the court <em>may</em> face an additional difficulty of having to
                    “make an assessment of the sum that would not have been spent upon the
                    plaintiff’s own living expenses” (<em>Croke v
                        Wiseman</em> at 82D) in assessing damages for a lost years claim. In
                    other words, besides assessing the Plaintiff’s future income, the court
                    may also have to assess the Plaintiff’s <em>future
                        expenditure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    However, this first assumes that the English
                    approach of deducting future expenditure (living expenses) from the estimated
                    future earnings during the lost years is an approach that also applies in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    Second, even if this court decides to follow
                    the English approach, I am of the view that the task of assessing a young
                    plaintiff’s <em>future expenditure patterns (living
                        expenses)</em> whilst clearly difficult, is not any more difficult
                    than assessing a young plaintiff’s <em>future
                        income</em>. It is as hard to tell whether a young plaintiff will end
                    up extravagant or thrifty, as it is to tell whether he will end up a high or low
                    income earner. In both cases, I do not deny that the use of national averages
                    can only provide a blunt and broad-brushed approximation. However, if such
                    approximations are sufficiently precise for the assessment of damages for a
                    young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings during his expected lifetime, it
                    must follow that it also is sufficiently precise for the assessment of damages
                    for a young plaintiff’s lost years claim (even if it comprises two
                    components – an estimation of future income <em>and</em> future expenses). I further mention in passing,
                    notwithstanding the House of Lords’ reservations about the speculative
                    nature of the assessment of damages for a young plaintiff’s lost years
                    claim in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em>, it nevertheless
                    affirmed the lower court’s decision to make such an award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    This leads me to my third point. As Gage LJ
                    opined in <em>Iqbal v Whipps</em> (at [79]), concerns about
                    the difficulty of assessment do not go towards showing that “as a matter
                    of principle, a young child will have no claim in respect of lost years”.
                    It merely might negate liability because the loss is too <em>remote</em> (as per Lord Scarman in <em>Pickett v
                        British Rail</em> at 981B).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    There can be no dispute that the accident
                    directly caused the Plaintiff’s reduced life expectancy. Denying a young
                    plaintiff’s lost years claim on the ground of excessive speculation or
                    arbitrariness in assessment would have the <em>practical
                        effect</em> of pegging his loss at <em>zero</em>,
                    even whilst the court acknowledges <em>in principle</em>
                    that the plaintiff has suffered loss that ordinarily ought to be compensated
                    from having his life expectancy so reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    Therefore, for the above reasons, I do not
                    think that the difficulty of assessing damages for the Plaintiff’s lost
                    years claim in this case precludes the claim from succeeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    I now consider whether the fact that the
                    Plaintiff does not have dependants might defeat his lost years
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Absence of dependants </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    While the relevance of dependants has been
                    alluded to above, it is helpful to examine why the presence of dependants
                    mattered to the previous courts that have heard such claims. When a plaintiff
                    has his life expectancy reduced (whether he dies immediately or has fewer years
                    left to live), the dependants whom he supports with his monthly wage clearly
                    suffer a loss. They lose financial support in the years that the plaintiff would
                    have lived but for the accident. The law has been concerned with ensuring that
                    these dependants are taken care off in an award of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    This social concern explains the
                    availability of a dependants’ claim in Singapore under s 20 of the Civil
                    Law Act, and in the UK under s 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (UK). It also
                    explains why the courts have been concerned with ensuring alternative
                    compensation mechanisms for dependants where the abovementioned statutory
                    provisions do not apply. In <em>Pickett v British
                    Rail</em>, the majority was acutely aware of the fact that the dependants
                    would no longer have a statutory action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976
                    because the plaintiff had obtained judgment against the tortfeasor when he was
                    alive. This was arguably one reason why the House of Lords found it just to
                    award damages for loss of earnings during the lost years (see for example
                        <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> at
                    964H–965C).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Traces of this concern for dependants can
                    also be found in Singapore authorities dealing with lost years claims. In
                        <em>Low Kok Tong</em>, the Court of Appeal commented
                    (at [14]) that “[i]t could be questioned with some justification why
                    persons other than the actual dependants of a deceased should be unjustly
                    enriched by an award to the estate for the “lost years””.
                    In the same vein, in <em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em>, the High
                    Court held (at [59]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The basis for awarding damages for the years by which the
                        plaintiff’s life has been reduced when computing future loss of
                        earnings is that the plaintiff must provide for his dependants. The
                        multiplier for loss of future earnings for the plaintiff’s working
                        life is accordingly based, <em>inter alia</em>, on the
                        working life of the plaintiff prior to his injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    One might thus argue that if the basis for
                    awarding a lost years claim is the loss to the dependants, a plaintiff with no
                    dependants should not be awarded any compensation for loss of earnings during
                    the lost years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    In my view, such an argument is wrong. In
                    the present case, I find that the Plaintiff’s absence of dependants or the
                    prospect of dependants does not defeat his claim for loss of income during the
                    lost years. In holding this view, I find myself supported by both legal
                    authorities and principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    As discussed above (see [206]–[208] of
                    this judgment), the majority in <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em> took a clear position on this issue. The House of Lords held
                    that in allowing a lost years claim, the law cannot distinguish between
                    plaintiffs who support dependants, and those who do not: <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> at 966D.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    This interpretation of <em>Pickett v British Rail</em> is supported by Rimer LJ at [78] of
                        <em>Iqbal v Whipps</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was discussion in <em>Pickett</em> as to
                        whether the real losers in respect of a lost years earnings claim were the
                        claimant’s dependents. Whatever the force of that, the four members of
                        the House who were in agreement in allowing a lost years’ earnings
                        claim recognised that it was nevertheless a loss suffered by the claimant
                        himself in respect of which he was entitled to recover in his own right
                        … There is nothing in their speeches to support the view that success
                        on such a claim is conditional on proof that the claimant has, or would
                        have, dependents who could or might benefit from any recovery
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    The comments made by Gage LJ in <em>Iqbal v Whipps</em> (at [35]) are also illuminating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, <em>Gammell</em> makes quite clear,
                        what might be said to be less clear from <em>Pickett</em>, that the age of a victim is not as a matter of
                        principle relevant to the issue of whether or not a claim can be made for
                        the lost years. Further, <em>the lack of dependants cannot be
                            a factor which defeats a claim for damages for loss of earnings in the
                            lost years</em>. When it comes to the assessment of damages for
                        the lost years the issues are evidential and not matters of principle.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    It is clear that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Iqbal v Whipps</em> at [45], [46] and [83]
                    expressed the view that the earlier decision in <em>Croke v
                        Wiseman</em> that the absence of dependants in the case of a young
                    child was fatal to the claim for loss of earnings in the lost years was
                    inconsistent with previous House of Lords authority (<em>Pickett
                        v British Rail</em> and <em>Gammell v
                    Wilson</em>). That said, the Court of Appeal regarded itself bound by the
                    decision in <em>Croke v Wiseman</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    A living plaintiff brings an action in his
                    own capacity. In my view, it must follow that the <em>only</em> loss he can claim for is <em>his
                        own</em>. Indeed, even in the case of claims for future nursing and
                    home-care where these are provided gratuitously by a family member, as
                    emphasised above, the court awards a plaintiff damages, assessed in relation to
                    the caregiver’s loss of future earnings as a <em>loss to
                        the plaintiff himself</em>, and not to his caregiver. Similarly, to
                    succeed, a living plaintiff’s lost years claim must be <em>conceptually</em> founded on a plaintiff’s personal loss,
                    rather than his dependant’s loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    I am therefore of the view that the absence
                    of dependants or the prospect of dependents, does not defeat a young living
                    plaintiff’s lost years claim. While the High Court in <em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em> did suggest (as noted above) that the basis
                    for awarding a lost years claim is the loss to the dependants, the comment was
                    strictly <em>obiter</em> and was intended more to explain
                    the normative reasons for awarding a lost years claim rather than establish a
                    legal test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on lost years and the appropriate multiplier</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    In conclusion, the authorities clearly
                    establish that a living plaintiff has a lost years claim. Moreover, an exception
                    should not be made just because the living plaintiff is young. In my view, the
                    existing authorities and principles support this position. Therefore, I find
                    that the Plaintiff’s claim for loss of earnings during the lost years
                    succeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    In this regard, I affirm the AR’s
                    decision to adopt a multiplier of 9 years for the period in which the Plaintiff
                    is likely to live (16 years of working life). Regarding the lost years, I accept
                    the Plaintiff’s assumption that he would have worked until the age of 62
                    if not for the accident. The number of “lost years” is thus 24. In
                    view of the above, I find that a multiplier of 8 years for the lost years claim
                    is appropriate. A more substantial discount from 24 years takes into account the
                    fact that the more distant in time, the greater the exposure to the vicissitudes
                    of life and the more advantage is gained from accelerated receipt. What remains
                    is the need to determine the appropriate multiplicand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplicand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    The first question that arises is whether
                    the multiplicand adopted for the lost years should be different from that
                    adopted for the period in which the Plaintiff is expected to live.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    In my view, it should be. In awarding
                    damages for a lost years claim, Singapore authorities do support the English
                    approach of deducting a plaintiff’s anticipated expenses from his loss of
                    earnings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_264-p2_a"></a>(a)     In awarding an Estate Claim, the
                        Court of Appeal in <em>Low Kok Tong</em> held (at [7])
                        that with respect to the deceased’s loss of earnings during the lost
                        years, “damages should be computed after deduction of his probable
                        living expenses during that period”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_264-p2_b"></a>(b)     The High Court in <em>Au Yeong
                            Wing Loong</em> similarly deducted the living plaintiff’s
                        estimated living expenses during the lost years in awarding damages for loss
                        of earnings during that period (see [50] and [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    I note that no such deduction of expenses
                    was made in <em>Ramesh v Chua</em>. The High Court seemed
                    to have used the same multiplicand for the period during the time the plaintiff
                    was expected to live, and during the lost years period (see [38]–[39]).
                    Nevertheless, it appears that this issue was never raised to the court. The
                    discussion on the lost years claim was notably brief. Neither <em>Low Kok Tong</em> nor <em>Au Yeong Wing
                        Loong</em> was considered by the High Court in <em>Ramesh v Chua</em>. I therefore find that on balance, the local
                    authorities we have suggest that different multiplicands should be used for the
                    period in which the plaintiff is expected to live, and the lost years period. In
                    the former, the court simply awards the plaintiff his estimated loss of
                    earnings. In the latter, the court awards the plaintiff his estimated loss of
                    earnings after deducing his estimated personal living expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Multiplicand for the period during which the plaintiff is expected to
                live</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    To assess the appropriate multiplicand for
                    the period during which the plaintiff is expected to live, the court is
                    concerned with assessing the fair value of income that the Plaintiff may be
                    treated as being likely to earn should the accident not have happened. In this
                    case, given that the Plaintiff was only 9 years old at the time of the accident,
                    it is very difficult for the court to assess the likely income he would have
                    been earning had the accident not happened. There is neither a track record of
                    past earnings, nor is there any clear indication as to the educational levels
                    the Plaintiff was likely to attain. As mentioned earlier, recourse to national
                    averages is thus inevitable. Both parties accept that following <em>Eddie Toon</em>, the mean commencing salaries of young
                    workers should be used as the basis for calculating the multiplicand (see the
                    AR’s Judgment at [39]–[40]). What they disagree on is which
                    occupational groups ought (or ought not) to be taken into account in the
                    calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    The AR adopted a multiplicand of $1,723.24.
                    She first took the average of the figures set out in the table at [42] of the
                    AR’s Judgment, which contains the median monthly wage of persons across
                    eight occupational groups in the age-group of 25 to 29 years old. The figure
                    derived was $2,059.25. She then applied a discount based on the average annual
                    basic wage change over a 10-year period (see the AR’s Judgment at [48]) to
                    reflect the fact that the court was concerned with the median commencing salary
                    of persons <em>aged 22 years old</em> (rather than 25 to 29
                    years old). She derived the final figure of $1,723.24, which she accordingly
                    adopted as the multiplicand to assess the Plaintiff’s loss of future
                    earnings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant have
                    appealed the AR’s decision on the multiplicand. The Plaintiff’s main
                    submission is that the multiplicand should not have been adjusted downwards from
                    the average of $2,059.25 (for workers in the age-group of 25–29 years old)
                    to reflect the fact that the Plaintiff is assumed to commence work at age 22.
                    This wrongly assumes the Plaintiff’s salary would remain stagnant
                    throughout his working life. The Plaintiff referred the court to the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>Koh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by
                        her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)</em> [2011] 3 SLR 610
                        (“<em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>”) at [58],
                    where the Court of Appeal took into consideration the fact that the plaintiff
                    would have had an average annual salary increment of 7.3% in calculating the
                        multiplicand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff therefore submits that
                    the average wage for workers in the age-group of 25–29 years old should be
                    used as the multiplicand without a discount. I note that the Plaintiff has not
                    taken issue with the <em>method</em> the AR used to
                    discount the average wage for persons in the age-group of 25–29 years old;
                    he only takes issue with the fact that the discount was applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    The Defendant’s main submission on
                    appeal is that the AR should not have taken into account the top two income
                    earning occupational groups, “Managers” (median wage of $3,663)
                    and “Professionals” (median wage of $3,300), in calculating the
                    multiplicand. This is because the Plaintiff was less than likely to attain
                    tertiary education.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Defendant makes the following
                    points in support of that submission:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_a"></a>(a)     The AR wrongly held that the
                        Plaintiff has an equal chance of becoming a professional or a
                            labourer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff’s academic results reveal
                        that he was an inconsistent and average to below average student. The
                        Plaintiff’s results only picked up slightly in the first half of
                        Primary Three despite tuition. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_269-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff’s family background is less than
                        ideal. The Plaintiff’s mother has gone through two failed marriages,
                        and his biological father was irresponsible and left the home. The
                        Plaintiff’s mother and her present husband were both earning only a
                        modest income at the time of the accident. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    I first address the Plaintiff’s
                    submission that the AR should not have based the multiplicand on the average
                    commencing wage of a person aged 22. On the one hand, the Plaintiff is correct
                    that <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em> suggests the court should
                    take into account salary increments over a plaintiff’s working life in
                    determining the multiplicand. However, in <em>Teo Ai Ling
                        (CA)</em>, there is considerable <em>dicta</em>
                    that suggests a different approach might apply for young children who have not
                    started work. In this regard, I refer to the Court of Appeal’s comment at
                    [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We recognise that for this purpose there is a distinct difference between,
                        say, a young child of five years old and a student like the Respondent who
                        has completed her "O" levels and has embarked on tertiary education,
                            <em>ie</em>, a polytechnic course. In the case of a
                        five-year-old child, admittedly it would be difficult to reasonably predict
                        what that child would become. Will he graduate from university and become a
                        doctor, lawyer or engineer? Is medical science able to provide an answer?
                        Fortunately, we are not here concerned with such a child. Here, the
                        Respondent, if not for the accident, would have probably completed the

                        or any other job. All she has now is her "O" level certificate.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    The Court of Appeal did not explain the
                    approach it thinks a court should adopt for a young child. However, there is at
                    some suggestion that a different approach might be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    The approach taken by the High Court in
                        <em>Eddie Toon</em> to the assessment of the
                    multiplicand for a young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings is
                    instructive. The High Court in <em>Eddie Toon</em> held (at
                    [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even if I adopt the learned assistant registrar's basis for the assessment
                        of the loss of future earnings, then in arriving at the multiplicand,
                            <em>I would use the mean commencing salaries of all
                            occupations for young workers and not the average monthly earnings of a
                            Singaporean for all occupations</em>. The average monthly earnings
                        of a Singaporean would have taken into account the salaries of those
                        employees nearing retirement age.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    Indeed, it is clear from [47] of <em>Eddie Toon</em> that this holding was an affirmation of the
                    High Court’s decision in <em>Peh Diana and another v Tan
                        Miang Lee</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 22 (“<em>Peh
                        Diana</em>”). I find it useful to cite the reasoning in [28] of
                        <em>Peh Diana</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Therefore, I find great difficulty in accepting that in the case
                        of a person who has never worked, the national average wage should be used
                        for purposes of working out his loss of future earnings. I understand the
                        English courts have used something like this in calculating the loss of
                        future earnings in respect of fairly young children, <em>eg
                            Croke v Wiseman</em> [1982] 1 WLR 71; [1981] 3 All ER 852 where
                        the child was seven years old at the date of trial. Even so, the wage
                        adopted by the court in <em>Croke</em> was not the
                        national average wage but the national average wage <em>for a
                            young man</em>. That I think is quite different. … The
                        amount to be taken in computing loss of future earnings following <em>Croke</em>, must be that of a young stenographic
                        secretary and not someone who had worked for some years. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    In my view, <em>Peh
                        Diana</em> and <em>Eddie Toon</em> establish the
                    approach that ought to be taken by Singapore courts in assessing the
                    multiplicand for a young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings. <em>Eddie Toon</em> establishes that the “mean commencing
                    salary” of young workers should be adopted; <em>Peh
                        Diana</em> holds that the “national average wage <em>for a young man</em>” should be adopted. It is
                    therefore clear that in the present case, the multiplicand should be calculated
                    based on the average wages of younger workers. The only question is whether the
                    court should insist on using the Plaintiff’s estimated “commencing
                    salary” at the age of 22 (as per <em>Eddie
                    Toon</em>), or whether the average wage of young workers more generally
                    should be used, in which case, the salary range for workers aged 25–29 may
                    arguably be a fairer range to consider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    On balance, I prefer <em>Eddie Toon’s</em> approach of using the <em>commencing salary</em> of young workers. In coming to this decision,
                    I have taken note of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_275-p2_a"></a>(a)     The House of Lords’ caution
                        in <em>Gammell v Wilson</em> (<em>as
                            per</em> Lord Edmund-Davies at 259A) “counselling
                        moderation” where an assessment of damages is inevitably speculative
                        “to reflect the high degree of speculation” that is
                        involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_275-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        arbitrariness of taking the age-group 25–29 (bringing us to an average
                        of 27 years old) as a representative of the average wage of “young
                        persons” just because that is the age group which statisticians have
                        decided to use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    I therefore affirm the AR’s approach
                    of basing the multiplicand on the average commencing wage of a 22-year old
                    (being the year the Plaintiff is assumed to start work) and applying an
                    appropriate discount to the figures in evidence to reflect that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    I now consider the Defendant’s
                    submission that the AR should not have taken into account the top two highest
                    earning occupational groups on the ground that, on a balance of probabilities,
                    the Plaintiff would not have completed tertiary education even without the
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    In this regard, the AR, citing [49] of
                        <em>Eddie Toon</em>, rejected the Defendant’s
                    submissions. The High Court in <em>Eddie Toon</em> at [49]
                    held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The plaintiff's academic abilities based on Primary 1 results is
                        not a reliable guide as to what the plaintiff's achievements at "O" or "A"
                        Levels would have been if he had not met with the accident. <em>It is possible for the plaintiff to obtain a university
                            education or to drop out from school in his teens. That is really a
                            matter for speculation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    The AR therefore reasoned (at [38] of the
                    AR’s Judgment) that little weight should be given to the plaintiff’s
                    primary school results. The court simply cannot make a finding that, on a
                    balance of probabilities, the Plaintiff would not have attended tertiary
                    education: [46] of the AR’s Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    On the other hand, it is relatively clear to
                    me that <em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> (at [31]–[32])
                    does support the proposition that a plaintiff’s family background, along
                    with school results, is at least a relevant factor that a court ought to take
                    into account in assessing the multiplicand. With respect, I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    In my view, the question before me is
                        <em>not</em> whether the Plaintiff’s pre-accident
                    school results or family background are relevant to the determination of the
                    multiplicand. There is no doubt that the authorities suggest they are. In this
                    regard, I accept the Defendant’s submissions that I <em>must</em> take those facts into account. The court is asked to gaze
                    into a crystal ball and, based on <em>all</em> the relevant
                    facts it has before it, predict <em>as accurately as is
                        reasonably possible</em> what the Plaintiff is likely to earn in a
                    counter-factual future. The only question, however, is whether the undoubtedly
                    relevant evidence on the Plaintiff’s results and family background is
                        <em>sufficient</em> in the present case to allow an
                        <em>affirmative factual finding</em> (on a balance of
                    probabilities) that the Plaintiff <em>will not</em>
                    complete tertiary education and end up as a “Manager” or
                    “Professional”. The burden is on the Defendant to show this. If
                    the evidence does not allow an affirmative factual finding either way, the court
                    has no choice but to assume every possibility is equally likely. It would then
                    take the average wage across <em>all occupational
                        groups</em> as the basis for the multiplicand as the AR had done
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    Framed in this light, and having considered
                    the evidence before me, I do not think I have enough evidence to make an
                    affirmative factual finding that the Plaintiff will not complete tertiary
                    education and/or end up as a “Manager” or
                    “Professional”. It is still too early to tell. The Defendant tried
                    to distinguish <em>Eddie Toon</em> on the ground that the
                    plaintiff in <em>Eddie Toon</em> was seven and a half years
                    old, while the Plaintiff in the present case is nine. I am not persuaded that
                    the year and a half makes a difference on the present facts. I am of the view
                    that, <em>at this stage</em>, it is impossible to find that
                    the Plaintiff <em>will not</em> end up completing tertiary
                    education. Perhaps, one might argue that the very uncertainty caused by the
                    Plaintiff’s youth has worked to his advantage. That might be so. However,
                    in cases like the present, where “many imponderables come into
                    play” (<em>Lee Wei Kong (CA)</em> at [33]), the
                    court can only come to the <em>best approximation</em> of
                    what is just. I therefore uphold the AR’s finding on this
                front.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    Given the analysis above, I reject both the
                    Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s appeal against the AR’s
                    decision on the multiplier for loss of future earnings during the period the
                    Plaintiff is expected to live. I affirm the AR’s decision to adopt
                    $1,723.24 as the multiplicand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Multiplicand for the lost years period</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    Given my determination that the multiplicand
                    for the Plaintiff’s loss of earnings should be $1,723.24, the only
                    question here is how much should be deducted for the Plaintiff’s expenses
                    to determine the multiplicand for the lost years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    In <em>Low Kok
                        Tong</em>, the Court of Appeal held (at [13]) that the
                    deceased’s “earning after expenses” was $150. Unfortunately,
                    it is not clear from the report of the case as to how this figure was derived.
                    The Court of Appeal simply noted that the estate had “urged us to apply a
                    multiplier of 16 years with earnings ranging from $170 to $200 per
                    month”. The court also noted that the deceased was earning $122.47 per
                    month during national service, and $150 per month as a shop assistant before
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    In <em>Au Yeong Wing
                        Loong</em>, the court made the deduction for living expenses based on
                    the plaintiff’s “living expense before the accident”: at
                    [69]. In that case, both parties agreed to that approach. It should be noted
                    that the plaintiff in <em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em> was
                    already a working adult with a relatively stable pattern of expenses, making it
                    easier for the court to come to a conclusion as to the plaintiff’s monthly
                    expenses. Nevertheless, I note that the court’s decision on the
                    appropriate deduction for expenses appears to have been ultimately based on a
                    rough estimation driven by submissions rather than specific evidence. As the
                    High Court notes at [68]–[69]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    Counsel were asked to assist the court by
                            indicating the amount that should be deducted for living expenses for
                            the lost years having regard to the fact that no evidence was led. Mr
                            Yap suggested the figure of $500 per day. Ms Ng was of the view that
                            $150 would be proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    This is a case of a man who was living with the
                            family and working for a family concern. His expenses incurred in the
                            course of his travel for business would in all probabilities be met by
                            his employer. The chances are he would have been left with most of the
                            money that he earned. $500 pm works out to roughly $17 per day. Both
                            counsel were agreed that the deduction for living expenses should be on
                            the basis of living expenses before the accident. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There therefore does not seem to have been a detailed factual
                        inquiry into the plaintiff’s pre-accident
                expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    Indeed, as a matter of law, one potential
                    question that arises is how “expenses” ought to be defined, and
                    related to that, what the legal justification for deducting expenses even is.
                    During the “lost years”, a plaintiff certainly would not incur any
                    expenses – on that basis, it may be thought fair that the plaintiff should
                    be awarded a sum based on the income he would have left after deducting the
                    expenses he would have had to incur if he were alive. However, should the
                    deduction be based on the minimum sum necessary to meet a person’s basic
                    needs, or should it take into account a plaintiff’s spending habits (if
                    there is available evidence on that)? In the case of a young plaintiff, where no
                    available evidence exists on spending habits, should national averages on saving
                    and expenditure rates be used instead?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    In <em>Pickett v British
                        Rail</em> at 962A, Lord Wilberforce observed</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… To the argument that “they are of no value because you
                        will not be there to enjoy them” can he not reply, “yes they
                        are: what is of value to me is not only my opportunity to spend them
                        enjoyably, but to use such part of them as I do not need for my dependants,
                        or for other persons or causes which I wish to support
                        …”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I fully agree. Nevertheless, given that the parties did not
                        make detailed submissions on this point, this is not an appropriate case for
                        me to explore the issues any further than I already
                have.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    In the present case, it would have been
                    preferable if there were evidence and submissions on the correct approach the
                    court should take in determining what expenses to deduct, as well as statistics
                    on, for example, the average expenditure of Singaporeans in the relevant age or
                    income group (whether in absolute value, or as a percentage of income). In the
                    absence of such evidence, I must make a decision based on the material and
                    submissions before me. In coming to my decision, I am reminded of the well-known
                    aphorism that it is better to be roughly right than to be precisely wrong. Given
                    my earlier holding, it would be wrong to award the Plaintiff damages for loss of
                    earnings in respect of the lost years <em>without</em>
                    taking into account living expenses. The Plaintiff in his submissions refers to
                    a number of Canadian decisions on assessment of living expenses. These cases are
                    not binding on me and in any case, it is evident that much depended on the
                    evidence, facts and circumstances of each case. The range of deductions in the
                    Canadian cases appeared to have varied from 33% to 70%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    In the present case, I am well aware of the
                    need for caution, especially given the nature of the exercise, which is
                    speculative at best. I note that in Singapore, the minimum saving for a working
                    person derives from the CPF scheme. This provides the court with a base-line
                    figure of approximately 20% (based on present rates) for savings, as well as 17%
                    from employer’s contributions. The wage earner is free to spend or save
                    the rest of the salary as he or she thinks fit. In the decision of <em>Au Yeong Wing Loong</em>, the Court adopted the figure
                    suggested by the Defendant of $500 per month for expenses for a plaintiff based
                    on a salary multiplicand of $3000 per month. It is stressed that no evidence had
                    been led in that case on expenses, and the court had determined that the
                    deduction for expenses should be based on the plaintiff’s established
                    spending habits. Such evidence is unavailable in this case. The precedent is
                    therefore not of much help in this case. In these circumstances, I am of the
                    view that a plaintiff’s CPF savings is a good estimate of the savings he
                    would have had after expenditure. This is approximately 40% of his
                    salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    Thus, in my view, the applicable
                    multiplicand for the loss of income during the lost years is therefore $1,723.24
                    x 40% = $689.30.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the award for the Plaintiff’s loss of future
                earnings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    In summary, I affirm the AR’s award of
                    $233,878.14 for the Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings during the period
                    he is expected to live, and award the Plaintiff $71,687.20 for his loss of
                    future earnings during the lost years. The total award for the Plaintiff’s
                    loss of future earnings is thus $305,565.34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    The award for the lost years is derived as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Provisional Damages Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    The AR ordered that the Plaintiff may apply
                    for future damages to be assessed if within three years of her order, he
                    requires a permanent tracheostomy as a result of contracting pneumonia (see the
                    AR’s Judgment at [89]). The Defendant appeals against this order on the
                    following grounds: first, that the claim for provisional damages was not
                    sufficiently pleaded, and second, that the AR arbitrarily selected the duration
                    of three years without proper medical evidence to support the time frame
                        stipulated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a>295    There is little dispute on the applicable
                    legal principles governing the award of provisional damages. In this regard, I
                    reproduce the legal principles derived from <em>Tan Juay
                        Mui</em> helpfully delineated at [82] of the AR’s
                    Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_295-p2_a"></a>(a)     The risk of development of the
                        contingency must be a clear risk and not one that is fanciful (at [90] of
                            <em>Tan Juay Mui</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_295-p2_b"></a>(b)     The contingency must be objectively
                        identifiable and it must be objectively determinable whether the contingency
                        has occurred. If so, when it does occur, a provisional damages award may be
                        made. In order to prevent future dispute, one must be able to define the
                        precise contingency, upon which further damages should be awarded (at [84]
                        of <em>Tan Juay Mui</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_295-p2_c"></a>(c)     The contingency must be a clear-cut event. If
                        you cannot specify at what point the contingency has occurred, then the
                        contingency cannot be objectively determined as the law requires (at [87] of
                            <em>Tan Juay Mui</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_295-p2_d"></a>(d)     There must be some evidence as to the
                        degree of such risk or when such changes were likely to occur. The evidence
                        must support a finding that there was a reasonable likelihood of the
                        condition occurring within the not too distant future (at [86] of <em>Tan Juay Mui</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_295-p2_e"></a>(e)     A time frame based on medical evidence should be
                        specified for the plaintiff to return to apply for further damages (at [90]
                        of <em>Tan Juay Mui</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    When the parties came before me on 13 April
                    2015, the Defendant confirmed that it does not dispute that requirements (a) to
                    (d) are satisfied. Further, it was common ground that medical evidence was
                    indeed lacking on the appropriate time frame for an award of provisional
                    damages. In the circumstances, I directed that further evidence on the issue of
                    the appropriate time frame for provisional damages should be sought from the
                    Plaintiff’s doctors, Dr Henry Tan (“Dr Tan”) and Dr Annette
                    Ang (“Dr Ang”). I remitted the matter to the AR, who heard
                    evidence from Dr Tan and Dr Ang on 3 July 2015. Parties came back before me on 7
                    September 2015 to make submissions on, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    the appropriate award for provisional damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    I shall first deal with the preliminary
                    objection based on pleadings, and if necessary, deal with the appropriate award
                    of provisional damages in light of the new evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pleadings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_298"></a>298    At para (h) of the “Particulars of
                    General Damages” in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim, the
                    Plaintiff prayed for provisional damages without giving further particulars.
                    This was the only part of the statement of claim that mentioned provisional
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_299"></a>299    The Defendant cites the decision of
                        <em>ACD (by her next friend B) v See Mun Li</em> [2009]
                    SGHC 217 at [23] in support of the proposition that in making a claim for
                    provisional damages, a plaintiff must plead with specificity the exact medical
                    condition which, if it develops in the future, is to form the triggering event
                    to apply for further damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I accept this as a general
                    proposition of law. I also accept the Defendant’s submission based on
                        <em>PT Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA
                        and other appeals</em> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<em>PT
                        Prima</em>”) that the object of pleadings is to, <em>inter alia</em>, require each party to give fair and proper
                    notice to his opponent of the case he has to meet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> On this basis, it is clear that
                        <em>prima facie</em>, the Plaintiff’s pleadings
                    are insufficiently particularised to support the present claim for provisional
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_300"></a>300    However, it is important to note that the
                    failure to plead a particular point does not automatically bar the party who
                    failed to plead the point from raising it at the hearing. As seen from the
                    approach of the Court of Appeal in <em>PT Prima</em> at
                    [51], consideration will also be given to whether the other party has suffered
                    any <em>prejudice</em> from the lack of
                notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_301"></a>301    The Defendant’s counsel appears to
                    accept this, and submitted initially that his client was prejudiced because he
                    was caught by surprise at the hearing before the AR and was not given the
                    opportunity to ask the doctors the necessary questions in relation to the issue
                    of provisional damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> It is abundantly clear now that after the 3 July
                    2015 hearing, when further evidence was heard by the AR, the Defendant had ample
                    opportunity to prepare and ask all the questions it wished to ask Dr Tan and Dr
                    Ang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_302"></a>302    While the Defendant maintains an objection
                    to an award of provisional damages in its submissions dated 7 September 2015 on
                    the basis of the Plaintiff’s failure to plead the issue, he did not
                    explain why he continues to be prejudiced notwithstanding the opportunity he has
                    been given to question the doctors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Thus, I am of the view that the
                    Plaintiff’s pleadings, while disappointingly bare, is not an impediment to
                    its present claim for provisional damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appropriate award of provisional damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_303"></a>303    From the evidence given on 3 July 2015, the
                    consensus of the doctors appears to be that an award of provisional damages
                    should be made. Indeed, apart from the Plaintiff’s deficient pleadings,
                    the Defendant raises no other ground post the 3 July 2015 hearing to dispute
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_304"></a>304    Dr Ang’s evidence is that the
                    Plaintiff should be observed for another ten years until he enters young
                        adulthood.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Dr Tan’s evidence is less clear.
                    He agreed that if the Plaintiff goes on for another three to four years without
                    developing pneumonia severe enough to require a permanent tracheostomy, the risk
                    of him requiring a permanent tracheostomy diminishes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, he also gave evidence that in his view,
                    the risk of requiring a permanent tracheostomy remains constant throughout the
                    estimated 27 years of the Plaintiff’s life, and that he advises monitoring
                    the Plaintiff throughout.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In a bid to be helpful, he suggested that at
                    the minimum, a time frame of 13.5 years, <em>ie</em>, half
                    the Plaintiff’s lifespan, should be set.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_305"></a>305    From my brief summary of the evidence, it is
                    clear that there is little medical consensus on the appropriate time frame.
                    Based on Dr Tan’s evidence that the risk that a permanent tracheostomy
                    would be required diminishes after three to four years, the Defendant submits
                    that three to four years is an appropriate time frame. Based on Dr Ang’s
                    evidence, the Plaintiff submits that eight years is an appropriate time frame
                    because this would take care of the Plaintiff until he reaches 21 years
                    old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_306"></a>306    The task of setting an appropriate time
                    frame for an award of provisional damages is not a matter that permits
                    precision. While the appropriate time frame should be based on medical evidence,
                    it is not uncommon that as in the present case, the doctors themselves disagree
                    or find it difficult to provide a specific time frame. In my view, the
                    court’s task is to decide on a fair time frame as between the parties,
                    taking into account the views of the doctors, as well as the interest of
                    finality (see <em>Teo Ai Ling (CA)</em>) at
                [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_307"></a>307    Having regard to the evidence of Dr Tan and
                    Dr Ang, as well as the interest of finality, I find that a period of five years
                    is an appropriate time frame. While I acknowledge that the Plaintiff may be at
                    risk of requiring a permanent tracheostomy even after the five-year period, I am
                    of the view that five years best strikes a balance between the Plaintiff’s
                    need to have some protection against the eventuality that he will need a
                    permanent tracheostomy and the Defendant’s interest in finally settling
                    the litigation. Thus, I order that the Plaintiff may apply for future damages to
                    be assessed if within five years of the date of my judgment, he requires a
                    permanent tracheostomy as a result of contracting pneumonia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Future cost of Mental Capacity Act application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_308"></a>308    I see no reason to disturb the AR’s
                    award of $2,000. I agree with her assessment that the application is unlikely to
                    be contentious. Moreover, while the Plaintiff’s counsel tried to offer
                    evidence from the bar about the cost of hiring a lawyer and submitting an
                    application (even a non-contentious one), no proper evidence was
                adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_309"></a>309    The Plaintiff’s counsel also submits
                    that the cost of the Mental Capacity Act application will be far higher in 10
                    years (when the Plaintiff turns 21), rendering $2,000 grossly insufficient.
                    However, I note that an assessment of damages takes place in terms of <em>today’s prices</em>. The Plaintiff gets the $2,000
                    today, and can choose to invest it as he will to preserve its value so that it
                    will be sufficient to pay for the application in 10 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_310"></a>310    The AR awarded costs of $85,000 excluding
                    disbursements. The Defendant submits that this is excessive, but offered no
                    other grounds for its submission besides the fact that “[t]he matter went
                    on for five days only”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, I see no
                    reason to disturb the AR’s order of costs for the hearing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_312"></a>312    I further order that the Plaintiff may apply
                    for future damages to be assessed if, within five years of the date of this
                    judgment, he requires a permanent tracheostomy as a result of contracting
                    pneumonia. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defendant’s appeal against the
                    costs ordered by the AR is dismissed. Cost of the present appeal is to be
                    awarded to the Plaintiff to be agreed or taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_313"></a>313    The hearing on damages in this case has
                    taken considerable time. The court is grateful to learned counsel for their
                    submissions, in particular on the issue of the claim for lost years. The court
                    also records its gratitude to the medical experts who have testified and, in
                    particular to Dr Henry Tan and Dr Annette Ang, for the assistance they have
                    provided.</p>
