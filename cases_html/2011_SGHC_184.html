<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In the present application to strike out the
                    Plaintiff’s statement of claim, or part thereof, two separate issues of
                    law were presented for the court’s determination. First, what is the
                    nature and effect of consent orders and did a prior consent order entered into
                    between the parties preclude the Plaintiff’s action in the present suit?
                    Secondly, did the effect of section 51(10) of the Housing and Development Act
                    (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“HDA”) extend so far as to preclude the
                    bringing of a proprietary estoppel claim involving a Housing and Development
                    Board (“HDB”) flat? Although these issues appear novel at first
                    sight, the answers were, in truth, not far to find once the principles already
                    espoused in the relevant areas of law were properly considered. To this task I
                    now turn my attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>The background to the
                        application</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   the factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff and the Defendant are cousins.
                    Their dispute arose following the demise of their common grandmother, Tan Ah Kng
                    (“the Deceased”), and revolved around a flat situated at Block
                    306, Hougang Avenue 5, #02-355 Singapore 530306 (the “Flat”) that
                    she left behind. This was a flat sold by the HDB and which was subject to the
                    provisions of the HDA. While the Defendant did not necessarily agree with
                    everything stated in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim and his subsequent
                    affidavit, it was only necessary, for the purposes of the present application,
                    to consider the Plaintiff’s version of the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A note, before we continue, about the pleadings.
                    I am not given to be particularly particular about particulars. However, it
                    would not be inaccurate to describe the statement of claim filed by the
                    Plaintiff as inadequately bare. In it, he set out the relationship between the
                    main protagonists, the gist of the main facts as well as the breakdown for his
                    claim of S$18,350.50. Unfortunately, much of the relevant, and indeed crucial,
                    facts were not properly pleaded. While brevity in pleadings is a virtue that
                    should be encouraged, the austerity of the Plaintiff’s statement of claim
                    in this case meant that it was impossible to discern what the legal basis for
                    his claim was. Indeed, it almost appeared that the Plaintiff himself was unclear
                    as to his legal claim, merely that he had disparate grievances that required
                    airing. It was not until the Plaintiff filed a subsequent affidavit, for the
                    purposes of this application, that much of his case could be understood. It is
                    mostly on the basis of the subsequent affidavit that most of the following facts
                    are recounted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Insofar as I was able to discern, the Flat was
                    purchased around 1983. At the time of the purchase, the Deceased was the sole
                    owner of the Flat but at some unknown subsequent point in time, one of her
                    daughters, Low Eng Cheng (“the Aunt”), was added as an owner such
                    that the Flat was owed in joint tenancy between the two of them. Be that as it
                    may, it was the Plaintiff and his immediate family who had use of the Flat as
                    their family home for many years. This certainly was the case from the time the
                    Plaintiff was born (in 1984) until 2003. In that latter year, for reasons
                    undisclosed, most of the Plaintiff’s family moved out of the Flat, save
                    for one of the Plaintiff’s brother and the Plaintiff himself. About two
                    years later, in 2005, the Deceased and the Aunt also made the Flat their
                    residence. The year after, the Plaintiff’s brother moved out. This, of
                    course, left the Deceased, the Aunt and the Plaintiff as the remaining occupants
                    of the Flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff averred that almost immediately
                    after his brother had left the Flat, the Plaintiff had to look after both the
                    Deceased and the Aunt as they were in poor physical health. The Aunt was
                    diagnosed with ovarian cancer while the Deceased, towards the end of her life,
                    contracted tuberculosis. The responsibility for caring for the infirm fell to
                    the Plaintiff who, I am told, fulfilled his familial obligations selflessly.
                    Despite the Plaintiff’s efforts, both the Aunt and the Deceased eventually
                    succumbed to their illnesses and passed away in 2007 and 2008, respectively.
                    Both of them died intestate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 April 2009, the Defendant was granted
                    letters of administration in respect of the Deceased’s estate. The only
                    asset which had to be distributed was the Flat (which the Deceased owned wholly
                    following the earlier death of the Aunt). Pursuant to the Intestate Succession
                    Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed), the beneficiaries of the estate were the
                    five surviving children of the Deceased; the Plaintiff was therefore not a
                    beneficiary of the estate. The Defendant then took the view that the Plaintiff
                    was, whilst the Deceased was alive, a free lodger and, now, an illegal occupier
                    of the Flat. Accordingly, in what he regarded was his lawful duty as the
                    administrator of the Deceased’s estate, the Defendant endeavoured to
                    remove the Plaintiff from the Flat. In succession, the Defendant orally informed
                    the Plaintiff to vacate the Flat, called a locksmith to pick the lock of the
                    Flat and instructed solicitors to issue a letter of demand to the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   the legal background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Finally, given the Plaintiff’s lack of
                    response to his entreaties, the Defendant commenced Originating Summons No. 213
                    of 2009 (the “Order 81 Application”). In that application, the
                    Defendant sued, pursuant to Order 81 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), for immediate possession of
                    the Flat as well as costs for the legal proceedings. Thereafter, but prior to
                    the hearing of the Order 81 Application, attempts at an amicable settlement were
                    made, the details of which would turn out to be significant for the present
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The olive branch was first extended by the
                    Defendant even though he was also the one who commenced the Order 81
                    Application. On 13 July 2009, his counsel wrote to the Plaintiff’s
                    counsel in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The [Defendant]
                            offers to settle this OS [the Order 81 Application] as
                        follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">a.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">That the [Plaintiff] does agree to vacate the
                                HDB flat in question within a date no later than 31 July
                                2009;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">b.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">In return, the [Defendant] will not ask for the
                                costs of the OS and the Plaintiff will agree to abandon the claims
                                arising from trespass and unlawful occupation;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">c.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">This agreement to be recorded in a consent
                                order within on or before 24 July 2009.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       To that offer counsel for the Plaintiff
                    responded on 17 July 2009 in a somewhat equivocal fashion:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We write to confirm that our client will accept the
                            offer as set out in your Fax, without prejudice to any claims that he
                            may have against the estate, particularly in respect of any moneys
                            expended and/or ownership.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the following fax, on 21 July 2009,
                    counsel for the Defendant set out the Defendant’s view that the Plaintiff
                    had made a counteroffer:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We refer to your fax dated 17 July 2009
                            accepting our client’s offer to settle this OS. Technically, the
                            fax contains a counter offer in paragraph 2 after the first comma. That
                            portion is not part of any settlement which the [Defendant] agrees to
                            and will have to be left to be resolved under the general law, if
                            applicable.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We enclose the draft Order for your reference. This
                            document will also be served on you by EFS.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We will attend before the District Judge on Friday
                            to record the settlement before extracting the Order. Please let us know
                            if you wish for us to mention on your behalf.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Significantly, the terms of the draft order enclosed with the
                    foregoing fax were similar to those of the consent order eventually entered
                    into: see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, below. The terms, in short,
                    were that the Plaintiff vacates the Flat and the Defendant abandons any claim
                    for trespass and unlawful occupation as well as costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     This chain of correspondence finally concluded
                    with counsel for the Plaintiff writing to the Defendant’s counsel on
                    22 July 2009 in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We refer to your fax of 21 July 2009, received
                            by us at 9.00pm (the “Fax”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We acknowledge the contents of the Fax. Rather than
                            making a counter-offer, we were merely reiterating that the acceptance
                            of your client’s offer was not be deemed an abandonment of any
                            claims that he may have against the Estate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We enclose herewith the amended draft consent
                            order, duly approved by us for your necessary action. As the amendments
                            are extensive, we have redrafted and approved the same. We trust you
                            will have no objections to this.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The draft was essentially amended for organisation and to comply
                    with the standard form for Orders of Court. The substantive terms of the order
                    remained unaltered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Indeed, the form and substance of the amended
                    draft prepared by the Plaintiff’s counsel reflected the actual one
                    eventually entered into before Deputy Registrar Julian Chin on 24 July
                    2009. The learned Deputy Registrar recorded the terms as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the [Defendant] be given immediate possession of
                            the [Flat];</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the [Plaintiff] shall deliver vacant possession
                            of the Flat to the [Defendant] by 31 July 2009;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">provided the [Plaintiff] vacates the Flat by
                            31 July 2009, the estate of Tan Ah Kng (“the Estate”)
                            shall agree to abandon any claims by the Estate against the [Plaintiff]
                            arising from the [Plaintiff’s] occupation of the Flat in respect
                            of trespass and unlawful occupation; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iv.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that there be no order as to
                        costs.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Thereafter, the Flat was duly delivered to the Defendant, sold and the
                    proceeds thereof distributed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently, the Plaintiff commenced the
                    present suit to recover, as I have mentioned, a total of S$18,350.50 or,
                    alternatively, damages to be assessed. According to the statement of claim, the
                    claim was for “the monies expended in taking care of [the Deceased]
                    during her lifetime” and that “[t]he Plaintiff’s claim
                    against the Defendant arose when the Deceased passed away and the Defendant gave
                    notice to the Plaintiff to evict out of the flat…” The claim of
                    S$18,350.50 was obtained by totalling various household expenses, including
                    expenses for power services, telecommunication services, transport and town
                    council charges which the Plaintiff had paid for. Dissatisfied with the action,
                    the Defendant took out the present application to strike out the statement of
                    claim, in whole or in part, pursuant to Order 18, rule 19(1)(a), (b) and (d) of
                    the ROC.</p>

<b>The parties’
                        submissions</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   the Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As alluded to earlier, the affidavit that the
                    Plaintiff filed for the purposes of the present application cleared up much of
                    the factual ambiguity created by the statement of claim. However, the legal
                    basis of the Plaintiff’s claim was still unclear. To further complicate
                    matters, at different points in his affidavit, the Plaintiff made oblique
                    references to licenses, proprietary estoppel and constructive trust without
                    stating explicitly which ground he was seriously pursuing or if he was relying
                    on all of them. Even in the written submissions tendered before me, it was
                    maintained that the “causes of action against the Defendant lie in
                    estoppel and constructive trust.” However, before me, counsel for the
                    Plaintiff confirmed that the Plaintiff’s case was one of proprietary
                    estoppel on the basis of the following facts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Deceased had, on various occasions prior to
                            her demise, promised that the Flat should not be sold, that the
                            Plaintiff could live in the Flat for as long as he wanted and that he
                            could use the Flat as his family home. Such promises were made not just
                            in the presence of the Plaintiff but also in the presence of other
                            family members.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In reliance of those promises, the Plaintiff
                            acted to his detriment. For instance, he took care of the Deceased by
                            paying for the household and medical expenses. He also gave up a
                            relatively rewarding career as a financial planner to work from home as
                            a tutor so as to take better care of the Deceased. Furthermore, the
                            Plaintiff exposed himself to danger by living in close proximity with
                            the Deceased who had tuberculosis and had to undergo the ordeal of
                            medical examinations to ascertain that he, himself, had not contracted
                            the disease.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">As a result, of the foregoing, an equity had
                            been raised. However, the Plaintiff did not seek a trust over any
                            interest in the Flat to satisfy that equity. Instead, the Plaintiff
                            sought to be compensated by damages for the outlay he had already
                            incurred in reliance of the Deceased’s promises. In short, the
                            Plaintiff had paid for various household and medical expenses in
                            reliance of the representation that he would be allowed to stay in the
                            Flat for as long as he desired. The promise not having been kept, he
                            sought to be put back into the same position he would have been in had
                            he not relied on those promises.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   the Defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Counsel for the Defendant essentially
                    presented two arguments, one revolving around the Order 81 Application and the
                    other around the HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     First, counsel for the Defendant argued that
                    the Plaintiff was estopped from raising his claim. This was because the issue as
                    to whether the Plaintiff was entitled to any interest in the Flat was first
                    brought before the courts in the Order 81 Application. In an affidavit to
                    support that application, the Defendant had alleged that the Plaintiff was an
                    illegal occupier of the Flat. The natural import of such an allegation was that
                    the Plaintiff had no claim to or interest in the Flat. If the Plaintiff thought
                    otherwise, he should have challenged the Defendant’s Order 81 Application.
                    Instead, the Plaintiff chose to enter into a consent judgment and give up
                    possession of the Flat. By so doing, the Plaintiff had, in fact, <em>agreed</em> with the Defendant’s allegations as set out
                    in the supporting affidavit and should not now be allowed to re-open the
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The other distinct argument made by the
                    Defendant’s counsel was that the Plaintiff was precluded from bringing his
                    claim by virtue of section 51(10) of the HDA, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest
                        in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever
                        created or arising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was not disputed between the parties that the Plaintiff was
                    ineligible to own the Flat as he, being unmarried and without a family nucleus,
                    did not satisfy the HDB’s Eligibility Rules. However, given how the
                    Plaintiff’s pleadings were initially unclear and how the Plaintiff’s
                    counsel had subsequently clarified that the claim was based on proprietary
                    estoppel and not constructive trust, I asked counsel for the Defendant if he was
                    still pursuing this argument. He answered in the affirmative. His view was that
                    the Plaintiff’s claim, if successful raised, necessarily raised an
                    equitable interest in the Flat. While it may be that the Plaintiff was presently
                    seeking only liquidated damages and not an interest in the Flat, this prayer was
                    in lieu of, and therefore based on, an equitable interest. By his reckoning, all
                    equitable interests in a HDB flat raised in favour of an ineligible person are
                    prohibited. As such, the Plaintiff’s claim was doomed to failure and
                    should be struck out for that reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii)   the Plaintiff’s reply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Plaintiff’s response to the
                    Defendant’s arguments was relatively straightforward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Addressing the Defendant’s argument on
                    issue estoppel, counsel for the Plaintiff pointed out that in the correspondence
                    leading up to the making of the consent judgment, the Plaintiff had emphasised
                    that that he was preserving his rights to any claim he may have against the
                    Defendant, including the present one he was making. In effect, all that he was
                    consenting to in the Order 81 Application was to vacate and give up possession
                    of the Flat. This was reflected by the circumstances in which the consent order
                    was entered into as well as the very terms in the eventual order made: see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, above. The Plaintiff was therefore
                    not estopped from pursuing the present claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Where the issue involving the HDA was
                    concerned, the Plaintiff’s counsel made clear that the Plaintiff’s
                    case, in no way, involved a constructive trust. It was, as stated earlier,
                    grounded in proprietary estoppel. If the claim was successful, no interest in
                    the Flat need arise as the Plaintiff was seeking for equitable compensation.
                    This was different from a claim seeking an equitable proprietary interest in the
                    Flat. The court, it was submitted, may satisfy an equity raised by a claim of
                    proprietary estoppel in a number of ways, including by declaring a trust over
                    the Plaintiff’s interest or by awarding equitable compensation. The latter
                    remedy was independent of the former. As such, the Plaintiff’s claim was
                    not precluded by section 51(10) of the HDA which only prohibited an ineligible
                    person from being entitled to a HDB flat by way of a constructive or resulting
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Defendant’s present application was
                    made pursuant to Order 18, rule 19(1)(a), (b) and (d) of the ROC, reproduced
                    below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that –</p>

                        entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The standard which must be satisfied before
                    pleadings can be struck out was clearly set out in the Court of Appeal case of
                        <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee
                        Chong Jin and oths</em>, [1997] SLR(R) 649, which reads,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases
                            that the power of striking out should be invoked. This was the view
                            taken by Lindley MR in <em>Hubbuck &amp; Sons v
                                Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark</em> [1899] 1 QB 86 at p 91. It
                            should not be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the
                            documents and facts of the case in order to see if the Plaintiff really
                            has a case of action. The practice of the courts has been that, where an
                            application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument,
                            the court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only
                            does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading, but in
                            addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity
                            for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 844, G P Selvam JC
                    explained the court’s reluctance to summarily strike out a claim (at
                        [31]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…This is anchored on the judicial policy to afford a litigant the
                        right to institute a bona fide claim before the courts and to prosecute it
                        in the usual way. <em>Whenever possible the courts will let
                            the Plaintiff proceed with the action unless his case is wholly and
                            clearly unarguable…</em> [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although the Defendant had cited three limbs
                    of Order 18, rule 19(1) as the basis for his application, counsel for the
                    Defendant only seriously pursued the “frivolous and vexatious”
                    limb before me. In respect of those words, Lai Siu Chiu J, delivering
                    judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, stated in <em>Ridhuan
                        bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another</em> [2005]
                    2 SLR(R) 188 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    In <em>Afro-Asia Shipping Co (Pte)
                                Ltd v Haridass Ho &amp; Partners</em> [2003]
                            2 SLR(R) 491 I had defined (at [22]) the words
                            “frivolous or vexatious” under O 18 r 19(1)(b) of the
                            Rules to mean “cases which are obviously unsustainable or wrong,
                            [and where] the words connote purposelessness in relation to the process
                            or a lack of seriousness or truth and a lack of <em>bona
                                fides</em>”. The definition as held by Yong Pung How CJ
                            in <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek Kiau</em> [1990]
                            2 SLR(R) 705 at [15], also included proceedings where a party
                            “is not acting <em>bona fide</em> and merely
                            wishes to annoy or embarrass his opponent, or when it is not calculated
                            to lead to any practical result”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There being no serious suggestion that the Plaintiff was not
                    acting <em>bona fide</em>, I had, therefore, only to
                    ascertain if the Plaintiff’s cause of action was obviously unsustainable
                    or wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In connection thereto, and arising from the
                    submissions made by counsel for the Defendant, two main issues arose for
                    consideration:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the Plaintiff’s claim was precluded
                            by the consent order entered into between the parties in the Order 81
                            Application; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether the Plaintiff’s claim was precluded
                            by section 51(10) of the HDA.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Plaintiff’s claim was precluded by the consent
                judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The key to this issue really laid in
                    understanding the nature of a consent order and the effects thereof. To this
                    end, a short survey of case law is necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on consent orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Siebe Gorman &amp; Co
                        Ltd v Pneupac Ltd</em> [1982] 1 W.L.R. 185
                        (“<em>Siebe Gorman</em>”), a decision of
                    the English Court of Appeal, the Plaintiffs issued a writ against the Defendants
                    in respect of a transaction of goods. After the close of pleadings, the
                    Defendants took out a summons for specific discovery to be provided within 10
                    days of the date of the order sought. The summons also prayed for a peremptory
                    order in default of compliance with the order, even though this was the first
                    summons for discovery. Just prior to attending before the Master for the hearing
                    of the summons, solicitors for both parties had a brief discussion and agreed
                    that, in return for the Plaintiffs consenting to the order sought, the
                    Defendants would allow the Plaintiffs ten days to comply with the order. No
                    mention was made of the peremptory prayer then. However, when the Defendants
                    drew up the order, the peremptory prayer was included. Naturally, the Plaintiffs
                    failed to comply with the order for discovery. After the Defendants took the
                    position that the Plaintiffs’ claim had been struck out, the Plaintiffs
                    applied for an extension of time to comply. This was allowed at first instance
                    but was reversed upon appeal. The Plaintiffs then further appealed to the Court
                    of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The leading judgment was written by Lord
                    Denning M.R. who, in his usual breezy manner, allowed an extension of time for
                    the Plaintiffs to comply with the discovery order. In so doing, he noted that
                    not all consent orders were alike (at 189) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have had a discussion about “consent orders”. It should
                        be clearly understood by the profession that, when an order is expressed to
                        be made “by consent”, it is ambiguous. There are two meanings
                        to the words “by consent.” That was observed by Lord Greene
                        M.R. in Chandless-Chandless v Nicholson [1942] 2 K.B. 321, 324. One meaning
                        is this: the words “by consent” may evidence a real contract
                        between the parties. In such a case the court will only interfere with such
                        an order on the same grounds as it would with any other contract. The other
                        meaning is this: the words “by consent” may mean “the
                        parties hereto not objecting.” In such a case there is no real
                        contract between the parties. The order can be altered or varied by the
                        court in the same circumstances as any other order that is made by the court
                        without the consent of the parties. In every case it is necessary to
                        discover the meaning is used. Does the order evidence a real contract
                        between the parties? Or does it only evidence an order made without
                        objections?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, Lord Denning distinguished between contractual consent orders
                    and ‘no objections’ consent orders. The former is, in essence, a
                    contract entered into in the presence of the court; the latter, as observed by
                    Templeman LJ in <em>Tigner-Roche &amp; Co Ltd v
                        Spiro</em>(1982) 126 SJ 525 (“<em>Tigner-Roche</em>”), is merely a case where “...the
                    Plaintiffs [or the Defendants as the case may be] merely bowed their heads and
                    submitted to such an order”. This distinction has since been followed in
                    many English cases thereafter: see <em>Greater London Council v
                        Rush Tomkins</em> (1984) 128 SJ 722 (full transcript
                    available on Lexis), <em>RG Carter (West Norfolk) Ltd v Ham Gray
                        Associates Ltd</em> (1994) 42 ConLR 68, <em>Boyle v Hagerty</em> (unreported, 29 October 1987, full transcript
                    available on Lexis), <em>Wembley Laboratories Ltd v Joyce Ground

                        Council</em> [2010] 4 All ER 733.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the circumstances of the case, Lord Denning
                    considered the consent order made in the application before him to be a
                    “no objections” consent order (at 190):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I cannot put any such interpretation [an interpretation that the consent
                        order was a contractual consent order] on the order which was drawn up in
                        this case. It often happens in the Bear Garden that one solicitor or legal
                        executive says to the other, “Give me 10 days.” The other
                        agrees. They go in before the master. They say, “We have agreed the
                        order.” The master initials it. It is said to be “by
                        consent.” But there is no real contract. All that happens is that the
                        master makes an order without any objection being made to it. It seems to me
                        that that is what exactly happened here. The solicitors for the Plaintiffs
                        were saying, “We do not object to the order. Give us the extra 10
                        days from the time of inspection, and that is good enough.” It seems
                        to me quite impossible in this case to infer any contract from the fact that
                        the order was drawn up as “by consent.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The first local case that picked up on the
                    distinction drawn by Lord Denning was, I believe, the High Court case of
                        <em>Wiltopps (Asia) Ltd v Drew &amp; Napier and
                        another</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 252 (“<em>Wiltopps</em>”). In that case, after the writ was filed, the
                    Plaintiff failed to comply with a court order to file affidavits of
                    evidence-in-chief. Initially, the Defendants were happy to provide the Plaintiff
                    with more time. Eventually, however, the delay was so exorbitant that the
                    Defendants filed an application praying that unless the exchange of affidavits
                    of evidence-in-chief took place within three days, the Plaintiff’s action
                    would be dismissed with costs without further order. At the hearing of that
                    summons, it was recorded in the Notes of Evidence that the Plaintiff was
                    “prepared to accept an unless order, provided that the summons in
                    chambers is for seven days”. To that effect the court so ordered.
                    Unfortunately, the Plaintiff again failed to comply by the deadline. Pursuant to
                    the unless order, the Defendants extracted an order for the action to be
                    dismissed. The Plaintiff sought to set aside this default
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Lee Seiu Kin JC cited the case of
                        <em>Siebe Gorman</em>, applied the analysis to the case
                    before him and held that the consent order entered into was of the contractual
                    kind. He reasoned (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case the unless order was made pursuant to an application
                        taken out by the Defendants who had prayed for an unless order that gave the
                        Plaintiffs three days to comply. At the hearing of that application, the
                        Plaintiffs’ solicitors offered to consent to the order if they were
                        given seven days, to which the Defendants’ solicitors agreed. It was
                        on this basis that the court made the order. It is clear that there was
                        consideration flowing from the Defendants to the Plaintiffs in that they
                        would otherwise have maintained their application for a three-day deadline,
                        in respect of which there was a possibility that they would obtain it. This
                        was therefore an order giving effect to the contract between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having so decided, Lee JC then went on to examine the effect of a
                    contractual consent order. To this end, he observed (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A judgment or order by consent is binding until it is set
                        aside and fresh proceedings must be commenced if it is sought to set aside a
                        consent order. In <em>Wilding v Sanderson</em> [1897] 2
                        CH 534, Byrne J said, at 543:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A consent judgment or order is meant to be the formal result and
                            expression of an agreement already arrived at between the parties to
                            proceedings embodied in an order of the Court. The fact of its being so
                            expressed puts the parties in a different position from the position of
                            those who have simply entered into an ordinary agreement. It is, of
                            course, enforceable while it stands, and a party affected by it cannot,
                            if he conceives he is entitled to relief from its operation, simply wait
                            until it is sought to be enforced against him, and then raise by way of
                            defence the matters in respect of which he desires to be relieved. He
                            must, when once it has been completed, obey it, unless and until he can
                            get it set aside in proceedings duly constituted for the purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The next significant case is that of <em>Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em>
                    [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>Wellmix</em>”). <em>Wellmix</em> revolved
                    around an alleged consent unless order, this time for the Defendant, rather than
                    the Plaintiff, to serve affidavits of evidence-in-chief failing which the
                    defence would be struck out. This unless order was entered into after counsel
                    for both parties had a discussion outside chambers. After the Defendant failed
                    to comply with the unless order, the Plaintiff attempted to enforce the same;
                    the Defendant denied that the unless order was by consent and appealed against
                    the decision of the assistant registrar who had agreed with the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Against this backdrop, Andrew Phang Boon
                    Leong J set out the methodology to be employed in ascertaining whether
                    there was a contractual consent order (at [14]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>general</em> (albeit crucial) starting-point
                        is this: One has to adopt an <em>objective</em>
                        approach towards ascertaining <em>the parties’
                            intentions</em> at the initial hearing before the assistant
                        registrar and, indeed, before he made the order concerned. In this regard,
                        close attention had to be paid not only to the parties’ own actions
                            <em>in the context of the relevant surrounding
                            circumstances</em> but also to the <em>language and
                            terms of the actual order made by the assistant registrar
                            himself</em>. Looked at in this light, it is clear that the
                        assistant registrar’s own <em>subjective</em>
                        interpretation of the order he had made earlier on, whilst not totally
                        irrelevant, was clearly not decisive by any means. [Emphasis in
                        original.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the circumstances before him, Phang J found that the unless
                    order made between the parties was not a contractual consent order. This was
                    because the discussion between counsel was a short one and there was no prior
                    negotiations nor clear written correspondence. Neither were the words “By
                    consent” used by the assistant registrar in making his order. On that
                    basis, <em>inter alia</em>, Phang J set aside the
                    interlocutory judgment entered in favour of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A brief pause, if I may, to address an issue
                    not strictly relevant to the present proceedings. In <em>Wiltopps</em>, Lee JC also considered the following question:
                    once a contractual consent order has been entered into, can the court subsequent
                    to that interfere with the terms of the agreement? He noted the two differing
                    opinions proffered by the coram in <em>Purcell v F C Trigell
                        Ltd</em> [1971] 1 QB 358 (“<em>Purcell</em>”) on this issue. Specifically, Lord Denning
                    proposed a further distinction between a contractual consent order in an
                    interlocutory matter and a contractual consent order made as a final judgment.
                    As to the former, Lord Denning was of the opinion (at 363) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court has always a control over interlocutory orders. It may, in its
                        discretion, vary or alter them even though made originally by
                        consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where a final judgment is made by consent, however, the court - Lord
                    Denning reckoned - has no discretion to interfere, save pursuant to ordinary
                    contractual principles. However, the majority, including Winn LJ and Buckley LJ,
                    saw no reason to make the same distinction. Regardless of whether the
                    contractual consent order was an interlocutory judgment or a final judgment,
                    they were of the opinion that it can only be set aside on ordinary contractual
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Lee JC did not, in <em>Wiltopps</em>, make a decision as to which view was correct as it was
                    unnecessary for him to do so. However, he made clear that the majority view was
                    the one he preferred, <em>i.e</em>., a contractual consent
                    order can only be set aside on grounds that would justify the setting aside of a
                    contract. Phang J, in <em>Wellmix</em>, did however
                    take a decisive stand on this issue. After carefully examining all the relevant
                    authorities and materials on this issue (including <em>Purcell</em> and <em>Wiltopps</em>),
                    Phang J held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">89    However, I would be prepared to accept that, the
                            objections in the preceding paragraphs notwithstanding, <b>it would still be desirable to allocate to the court a
                                residuary discretion of the type suggested by Lord Denning MR
                                in</b><b><em>Purcell</em></b><b>. In this
                                regard, I also respectfully differ from the view preferred by
                                Lee JC in the</b><b><em>Wiltopps</em></b><b>case</b>, and I do so for the following main
                            reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">90    It must be borne in mind that a consent unless
                            order, whilst technically a contract between the parties, is one that
                            allows one party to wholly deprive the other of its legal rights in the
                            context of litigation. Even though such an order has been agreed upon
                            between the parties, there may, in my view, arise certain circumstances
                            where it would nevertheless be unjust for the party in whose favour the
                            consent order operates to insist on its enforcement in the absence of a
                            high degree of intentionally contumacious or contumelious
                            conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">91    Such a discretion is, in the final analysis, merely
                            an aspect of the court’s power to have ultimate control over its
                            own procedure. This is not at all unreasonable, in my view, and does, on
                            balance, conduce to justice and fairness. The focus is still on
                            procedure, rather than substance. It might be argued that the
                            substantive rights of the Plaintiff would be adversely affected. This is
                            arguably the case but it must never be forgotten that an unless order is
                            part of the procedural armoury and is not based on the substantive
                            merits of the case as such. Thus, an unless order (whether by consent or
                            otherwise) deals, in the final analysis, with the <em>litigation process and, on this score, the courts ought to have the
                                final say</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis in italics in original. Emphasis in bold added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was the other basis on which Phang J arrived at his
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The last local case which has added to our
                    understanding of consent orders is that of <em>Woo Koon Chee v
                        Scandinavian Boiler Service (Asia) Pte Ltd and others</em> [2010] 4
                    SLR 1213 (“<em>Woo Koon Chee</em>”). In that
                    case, it was not disputed that there was a contractual consent order made which
                    was aimed at resolving the substantive conflict between the parties.
                    Unfortunately, the appellant failed to abide by the terms of that contractual
                    consent order. The respondents then took out a summons for specific enforcement.
                    The issue at hand was the appropriate manner in which a contractual consent
                    order should be enforced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Court of Appeal endorsed the following
                    passage found in the <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>
                    (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed, LexisNexis 2009) in holding that the respondents need
                    not start a separate action to enforce the contractual consent order:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        contract…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the advantage of embodying the terms of the settlement in a

<p class="Judg-1">More pertinent to the present application before me, the Court of

                    Appeal had relied on the following passage in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of England</em> vol 37 (Butterworths,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed) at para 391:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[w]here the parties settle or compromise pending proceedings,
                        whether before, at or during the trial, the settlement or compromise
                        constitutes at a new and independent agreement between them made for good
                        consideration. <b>Its effects are (1) to put an end to the
                            proceedings, for they are thereby spent and exhausted; (2) to preclude

                            they have provided for liberty to apply to enforce the agreed terms; and
                            (3) to supersede the original cause of action
                            altogether…</b> An agreement for a compromise may be
                        enforced or set aside on the same grounds and in the same way as any other

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The following is, then, the law relating to
                    consent orders as I understand it:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There are two kinds of consent orders. One is a
                            contractual consent order. This is a real contract between the parties,
                            recorded in the presence of the court. The other is a ‘no
                            objections’ consent order. This is, in essence, a passive consent
                            order in that one party simply does not object to the prayers sought by
                            the other party: see <em>Siebe Gorman,
                                Wiltopps</em> and <em>Wellmix</em>.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">To distinguish between the two, one must adopt an
                            objective approach and look at all relevant circumstances of the case,
                            including the parties’ conduct and the order made: <em>see Wellmix</em>.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In the case of a contractual consent order which
                            aims to settle the substantive dispute, the consent order supersedes the
                            original cause of action altogether. The original proceedings are then
                            spent and exhausted: see <em>Woo Koon Chee</em> and
                                <em>IOB v Motorcycle Industries</em>.
                            Presumably, a contractual consent order dealing with an interlocutory
                            matter supersedes the interlocutory application and the application is
                            then spent and exhausted.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iv.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Where enforcement is concerned, a consent order,
                            whether a contractual or a ‘no objections’ one, may be, but
                            need not be, enforced without a fresh action. It may be enforced like
                            any other court order: see <em>Woo Koon
                            Chee</em>.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">v.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">However, different principles apply to the setting
                            aside or variation of a contractual consent order and a ‘no
                            objections’ consent order. In the former case, the consent order
                            can only be set aside or varied pursuant to ordinary principles applied
                            in the law of contract. In a ‘no objections’ consent order,
                            the principles applicable to the setting aside or variation of an
                            ordinary court order applies: see <em>Siebe
                                Gorman</em> and <em>Wellmix</em>.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">vi.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There is one rider to the principle stated in
                            (v). Insofar as a contractual consent order regarding interlocutory
                            matters is concerned, the court has an overriding discretion to vary or
                            alter the terms of the order: see <em>Wellmix</em>
                            and Lord Denning <em>per Purcell</em>. This is an
                            exception to the general rule that contractual consent orders may be set
                            aside or varied pursuant only to ordinary contract law
                            principles.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In order to address the arguments presented by
                    the Defendant’s counsel, it must first, of course, be ascertained what
                    kind of consent order was agreed to between the parties in the Order 81
                    Application. This was to be done by using an objective approach, taking into
                    account all relevant circumstances of the case. Upon a close examination of the
                    correspondence between the parties leading up to the making of the consent
                    order, there was no doubt in my mind that the consent order arrived at was a
                    consent order of the contractual kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The genesis of the consent order was the olive
                    branch extended by the Defendant on 13 July 2009: see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, above. In this fax, the Defendant agreed not to seek costs
                    for the Order 81 Application and to abandon any claims for trespass if the
                    Plaintiff will vacate the Flat by 31 July 2009. This, obviously, was an offer as
                    understood in contract law to settle the Order 81 Application on the terms set
                    out. However, the nature of the response by the Plaintiff’s counsel on 17
                    July 2009 (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>, above) was not so easy to
                    discern. This was because counsel for the Plaintiff did not accept the olive
                    branch unequivocally but said that “our client will accept the
                    offer…without prejudice to any claims that he may have against the
                    estate, particularly in respect of any moneys expended and/or ownership.”
                    To my mind, this response may be understood in two ways. First, it may be
                    understood as a counteroffer in that the Plaintiff accepted all the terms set
                    out in the Defendant’s initial offer but wished to include a separate term
                    that the Plaintiff was to be allowed to pursue any claims against the estate
                    that he may have. This was indeed the way the Defendant’s counsel
                    understood the response. Secondly, the response may also be understood as a
                    request for clarification. The Plaintiff wanted to ascertain that the terms of
                    the Defendant’s initial offer did not implicitly preclude the Plaintiff
                    from claiming against the estate. If so, the Plaintiff was willing to accept the
                    Defendant’s offer. I myself preferred this second interpretation of the
                    Plaintiff’s response. However, regardless of whichever interpretation was
                    correct, the significant point was that there was no contract formed at this
                    stage as there was no unequivocal acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     What then is to be made of the next fax of 21
                    July 2009 by the Defendant’s counsel (see 10, above)? To reiterate, the
                    Defendant’s counsel wrote, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]echnically, the fax [from the Plaintiff’s counsel] contains a
                        counter offer in paragraph 2 after the first comma. That portion is not part
                        of any settlement which the [Defendant] agrees to and will have to be left
                        to be resolved under the general law, if applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thereafter, a draft order of court was attached which reflected the
                    same terms set out in the Defendant’s initial offer. In my opinion, the
                    Defendant was, again, making the same offer it did before (on 13 July 2009).
                    This time, however, the Defendant made clear that the Plaintiff’s possible
                    claims were <em>not</em> part of the settlement and that
                    any such claim was to be resolved separately, <em>i.e</em>., “under general law”. This was also clear because
                    the Plaintiff’s potential claims were, at this point, a live issue. Since
                    the Defendant did not explicitly state that the Plaintiff was to abandon any
                    claims that he may have in the draft order, it must mean that any such term was
                    not part of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Thereafter, counsel for the Plaintiff
                    redrafted the consent order for form but not substance: see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>, above. At this point, if not before, there
                    was a meeting of minds between the Plaintiff and the Defendant as to the terms
                    of the formal contract to be entered between them. While it had not yet been
                    formally recorded, there was nevertheless <em>consensus ad
                        idem</em> between the parties. The formal recording of the contract
                    finally took place on 24 July 2009 before Deputy Registrar Julian Chin in the
                    form of the consent order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The above, I believe, is the proper way to
                    analyse the correspondence between the parties. The consent order entered into
                    between the parties was therefore a contractual consent order rather than a
                    ‘no objections’ consent order. At all times, counsel for both
                    parties were fully aware of, and in agreement with, the terms of the contract.
                    Equally, they were also aware of a live outstanding issue – that of the
                    Plaintiff’s claims – which was not part of the agreement. Even so,
                    there was sufficient consideration from the Plaintiff, given that he had vacated
                    the Flat, for contract formation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Since the consent order entered into between
                    the parties in the Order 81 Application was, in essence, a contract, the effect
                    of that contract must be determined solely by reference to the terms of the
                    contract. The terms of the contract were encapsulated by the consent order (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, above) and did not include one to
                    the effect that the Plaintiff was to give up his right to take out the present
                    action. I do not agree with the argument that the Plaintiff had, by entering
                    into the consent order, agreed with the Defendant’s allegations (that the
                    Plaintiff was an unlawful occupant of the Flat) as set out in the
                    Defendant’s supporting affidavit for the Order 81 Application. The
                    supporting affidavit did not form part of the contract between the parties. The
                    facts set out therein did not, therefore, bind the Plaintiff. Indeed, in the
                    correspondence leading up to the consent order, the Defendant had expressly
                    agreed that such any issue regarding the Plaintiff’s right to sue the
                    estate was to be “resolved under the general law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Defendant’s counsel also pointed to
                    two cases in support of the Defendant’s present application which I will
                    now address. First, counsel argued that issue estoppel applied on the basis of
                    Sundaresh Menon JC’s decision in <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian
                        Teck and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<em>Goh Nellie</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff, as
                    trustee, sought the right to sell a particular piece of property without the
                    fifth defendant’s permission. Prior to this application, the fifth
                    defendant had applied via Originating Summons No 618 of 2005 (“OS
                    618/2005”) for a determination of her right to stay in a particular piece
                    of property. That application was disposed off by Phang JC, as he was then,
                    who made a substantive order to the effect that the fifth defendant had the
                    right to stay on the property as long as she personally resides there. On that
                    basis, the fifth defendant argued, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    that issue estoppel applied to the plaintiff’s application before Menon
                    JC. On this point, Menon JC wrote (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In the present case, there can be no doubt that the
                            order made in OS 618/2005 was a final determination of the right of
                            Rosaline [the fifth Defendant] to reside at No 61</em>. There was
                        nothing that remained to be decided in relation to this. Counsel for Nellie
                        [the Plaintiff] submitted, however, that OS 618/2005 was a consent order and
                        he contended that consent orders are incapable of forming the basis upon
                        which an issue estoppel could arise. In my judgment, this is misconceived.
                            <em>Leaving aside the question whether OS 618/2005 was a
                            consent order to begin with, this would not prevent it forming the basis
                            of an issue estoppel so long as the order was final</em>: see
                            <em>The Doctrine of Res Judicata</em> at para 38,
                        citing <em>Kinch v Walcott</em> [1929] AC 482.
                        [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the second italicised sentence in this passage seemed to
                    support the Defendant’s position at first glance, a proper understanding
                    of Menon JC’s decision revealed that this was not so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The critical part of the passage was the fact
                    that Menon JC found that there was a “final determination” in OS
                    618/2005: see the first italicised sentence of the preceding passage. There was,
                    in other words, a final and conclusive judgment <em>on the
                        merits</em>. To my mind, the consent order in OS 618/2005 must
                    therefore have been a ‘no objections’ consent order rather than a
                    contractual consent order, although this was not explicitly stated. This was
                    because in a contractual consent order, there would have been no final and
                    conclusive judgment <em>on the merits</em>. As explained
                    earlier, in a contractual consent order, the judge merely records a contract
                    agreed between the parties. The judge does not apply his mind to the case to
                    ascertain, according to law, whether the application or the prayers sought
                    should be granted. In fact, as the Court of Appeal in <em>Woo
                        Koon Chee</em> explained (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    to <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>, above), the contractual consent
                    order supersedes the original cause of action altogether. The original
                    proceedings are then spent and exhausted. This is different from a ‘no
                    objections’ consent order where the judge makes a judicial determination
                    as to the rights between parties, albeit without objections from one party. This
                    view is supported by the fact that Phang JC had came to his final
                    determination in OS 618/2005 “[o]n a true construction of paragraph 2(a)
                    of the Last Will &amp; Testament of Low Gek Huay and in the events that have
                    happened…” This suggests that Phang JC had applied his mind
                    to the merits of the application. Thus, when Menon JC suggested that it did not
                    matter whether the order made in OS 618/2005 was a consent order or not (and
                    that issue estoppel applied anyways), he actually meant that it did not matter
                        <em>whether the order was a ‘no objections’
                        consent order or whether the order was made after full arguments</em>.
                    This was because in either case there would have been a judgment <em>on the merits</em>. However, it would be a very different if
                    the consent order made in OS 618/2005 was a <em>contractual</em> consent order. Had that been the case, it would be
                    very surprising if Menon JC had arrived at the same conclusion he did. For this
                    reason, I was not of the view that the case of <em>Goh
                        Nellie</em> supported the Defendant’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The second case which counsel for the
                    Defendant raised was much simplier to deal with. In <em>Sim Lian
                        (Newton) Pte Ltd v Gan Beng Cheng Raynes and Another</em> [2007] SGHC
                    84, Assistant Registrar Paul Tan had occasion to deal with an application
                    pursuant to Order 81 of the ROC. In that case, AR Tan analysed the nature of an
                    Order 81 application and reasoned that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    [s]everal consequences flow from the summary nature
                            of proceedings under O 81. First, where there is a dispute on the facts
                            or on legal issues, O 81 would not be the appropriate procedure and the
                            applicant should have his claim adjudicated by the usual process,
                            including trial if necessary…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    …in summary proceedings, it is not the
                            function of the court to resolve the case on its merits but only to
                            judge whether there is a dispute that ought to be adjudicated by trial.
                            In this regard, once the applicant has present a <em>prima facie</em> case, it falls on the responding party to
                            “lead trump or risk losing” (see, <em>1061590 Ontario Ltd v Ontario Jockey Club</em> (1995) 21 O.R.
                            (3d) 547 at 36).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of these passages, counsel for the Defendant argued
                    that the Plaintiff should have claimed trial instead of consenting to the order
                    made in the Order 81 Application. Having consented, he could not now reopen the
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     With respect, counsel’s argument was
                    misconceived. The responsibility of the Plaintiff to “lead trump or risk
                    losing” in the Order 81 Application only applied if the Defendant had
                    pursued his case against the Plaintiff. However, as it turned out, the Defendant
                    did not. Rather, the Defendant chose to enter into a contractual consent order
                    with the Plaintiff. At the risk of repetition, this meant that the consent order
                    superseded the Defendant’s cause of action in the Order 81 Application
                    altogether. The Order 81 Application was then spent and exhausted: see <em>Woo Koon Chee</em>. Since the Defendant did not pursue his
                    case, the Plaintiff had no case to respond to. Accordingly, the fact that the
                    Plaintiff did not challenge the Order 81 Application then did not mean that he
                    could not now pursue the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For all of the above reasons, I was of the
                    view that the Plaintiff was not precluded from pursuing the present action by
                    reason of the consent order entered into between the parties in the Order 81
                    Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Plaintiff’s claim is precluded by section 51(10) of
                the HDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I now turn to the second issue. To reiterate,
                    the argument made on behalf of the Defendant was that the Plaintiff was
                    precluded from bringing his claim by virtue of section 51(10) of the HDA. To
                    assess the validity of this argument, it was necessary to understand fully the
                    nature of a proprietary estoppel claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proprietary estoppel and constructive trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     When reading caselaw, it is not often easy to
                    distinguish proprietary estoppel from another equitable action known as
                    constructive trust. This confusion may, to my mind, be the result of at least
                    four factors. First, the term ‘constructive trust’ has been used to
                    mean different things; Indeed, Sir Peter Millet commented that “the use
                    of the language of constructive trust has become such a fertile source of
                    confusion that it would be better if it were abandoned”: see McKendrick,
                        <em>Commercial Aspects of Trusts and Fiduciary
                        Obligations</em>, (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 3. Secondly, the
                    use of the term ‘proprietary estoppel’ is relatively modern although
                    the pith of that cause of action is deeply antiquated, dating from before the
                    nineteenth century. Even when the term ‘proprietary estoppel’ was
                    used in the twentieth century, it was not used consistently. This means that one
                    cannot always be certain that a particular decision was based on proprietary
                    estoppel or some other cause of action. Thirdly, the exact ambit of proprietary
                    estoppel is not particularly settled. On the contrary, the common law, I
                    believe, is still in the midst of feeling out its edges. Fourthly, facts that
                    may suffice to make out a proprietary estoppel are often also sufficient to make
                    out a constructive trust, particularly a common intention constructive trust,
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Be that as it may, it is relatively clear that
                    while there are areas of overlap between a proprietary estoppel claim and
                    constructive trust claim, the two are distinct causes of action. The exact
                    boundaries of these causes of action may be difficult to define but the two
                    causes of action are conceptually different and independent of each other. I
                    shall attempt to explain the difference between the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I begin with constructive trust for the law
                    regarding constructive trust is more settled. The term ‘constructive
                    trust’ may be used to describe a cause of action or an equitable remedy.
                    As a cause of action, English law has, generally only recognised the existence
                    of an ‘institutional’ constructive trust (as opposed to a
                    ‘remedial’ constructive trust). (I note, however, the decision of
                    Judith Prakash J in <em>Koh Cheong Heng v Ho Yee Fong</em>
                    [2011] 3 SLR 125 (“<em>Koh Cheong Heng</em>”)
                    which seemed to accept a very limited form of remedial constructive trust in
                    Singapore.) The primary feature of an institutional constructive trust is that
                    it is brought into being on the occurrence of specified, well-established
                    events, without the need for the intervention of the court. As a cause of
                    action, the term ‘constructive trust’ is simply a way to categorise
                    these disparate specified events under one umbrella. These specified events are
                    disparate because the facts required to make out these events are quite
                    distinct. That said, there is a commonality underlying these events – in
                    each of these events, it would be inequitable – or some would say
                    unconscionable – for the holder of the legal title to assert absolute
                    entitlement to the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Although unconscionability is a vague idea,
                    the conditions under which a constructive trust cause of action may be made out
                    are relatively well circumscribed under English law. Without attempting to be
                    exhaustive, the following are facts that would generally found a constructive
                    trust claim:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i. </div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">fraud;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the retention of property acquired as a result of
                            a crime causing death;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a profit in beach of a fiduciary
                        duty;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iv.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the retention of property by a vendor after the
                            vendor had entered into a specifically enforceable contract to sell the
                            property;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">v.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the changing of a will by the survivor of two
                            persons who had entered into a contract to execute wills in a common
                            form;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">vi.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the acquisition of land expressly subject to the
                            interests of a third party;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">vii.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the assertion of full entitlement to property
                            after a common intention to share property had been formed (also known
                            as a ‘common intention constructive trust’).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">So far, English law has taken the view that a constructive trust claim
                    may not be established outside of these well-defined and accepted
                events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Once these events are established, the court
                        <em>declares</em> the existence of a constructive
                    trust. A constructive is not imposed because the trust exists from the time the
                    relevant events occurred. The court merely recognises that the beneficiary
                    enjoys a pre-existing interest in the property. The corollary to this principle
                    is that the court does not have a discretion as to the appropriate remedy to be
                    rendered. Once the facts are found to have arisen, a constructive trust
                        <em>must</em> be declared. Accordingly, a constructive
                    trust may be capable of gaining priority over other subsequent interests in the
                    property. The court’s function is, therefore, to declare proprietary
                    interests as they are, not to alter them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     A proprietary estoppel claim is a little
                    different. As expressed in Pearce, Stevens &amp; Barr, <em>The
                        Law of Trusts and Equitable Obligations</em>, (Oxford University
                    Press, 2010, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed), (at p 339):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Proprietary estoppel is an entirely different equitable device from either
                        the constructive or resulting trust, because it does not operate by
                        recognizing the existence of a beneficial interest already created by the
                        parties themselves, as it the case with express, resulting, and constructive
                        trusts. Instead, it provides an equitable remedy, even though the remedy may
                        allow a party to acquire an interest in the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The moral force of a proprietary estoppel claim lies in the
                    unconscionability of a ‘frustrated expectation’: see Gray and Gray,
                        <em>Elements of Land Law</em>, (Oxford University
                    Press, 5th edn, 2009) (“Elements of Land Law”) (at [9.2.119]). In
                    essence, the legal owner of a property must have conducted himself (whether by
                    way of encouragement or representation) in such a manner that the claimant
                    believes that he has, or will obtain, some rights in respect of that property.
                    The claimant must thereafter have relied on the legal owner’s behaviour to
                    his detriment. When such a situation arises, it would be unconscionable for the
                    legal owner to then assert his strict legal entitlement to the property and
                    equity will intervene to prevent this. The court, in essence, has to identify
                    circumstances in which a legal owner’s conduct can be said to be
                    unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     If the above sounds similar to a constructive
                    trust – particularly a common intention constructive trust - claim, it is.
                    The moral force of a constructive trust and a proprietary estoppel claim is, I
                    believe, rooted in the same source – unconscionability. What is different
                    is the focus of the judicial enquiry, the degree of unconsionability and the
                    legal consequences resulting thereto. As stated in <em>Elements
                        of Land Law</em> (at [9.2.119]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as any distinction exists between the doctrines of proprietary
                        estoppel and constructive trust, it is sometimes said that the balance of
                        emphasis in the constructive trust falls on the notion of frustrated
                        bargain, whereas the ‘equity’ of estoppel is more obviously
                        founded upon the notion of frustrated expectation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As compared to a constructive trust claim, proprietary estoppel is a
                    far more flexible and versatile doctrine, more suited to dealing with lesser
                    degrees of unconscionability arising from lay persons’ varied and informal
                    arrangements with regards to property. When circumstances giving rise to a
                    proprietary estoppel claim occurs, only an inchoate estoppel equity is raised.
                    Unlike a constructive trust claim, no trust automatically arises as a result of
                    such facts occurring. The claimant is thus entitled to remedial relief in order
                    to satisfy the equity. At this point, the court must then decide what remedy is
                    appropriate in the circumstances to satisfy the expectation raised by the
                    estoppel. In some cases, a trust will be <em>imposed</em>
                    over the property. But this is not the inevitable result. The court may select
                    from the full range of equitable remedies available at law including ordering
                    injunctions or awarding equitable damages. The court is limited only by the
                    principle that it should award the <em>minimum</em> right
                    or interest necessary to do justice between the parties. The court’s
                    primary function is, therefore, not to ascertain proprietary rights as they are
                    but to rectify the unconscionability in a proportionate manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Despite the doctrinal differences highlighted
                    in the preceding paragraphs, it cannot be gainsaid that there is, in practice, a
                    substantial area of overlap between constructive trusts and proprietary
                    estoppel. Often, the same factual matrix may give rise to both a constructive
                    trust and a proprietary estoppel claim. However, that there is an area of
                    overlap does not, in any way, diminish – much less eliminate - their areas
                    of differences and, consequently, the fact that the two causes of action are
                    distinct and separate. Indeed, Lord Walker expressed doubt in <em>Stack v Dowden</em> [2007] 2 AC 432 (at [37]) that the two areas of law “can or
                    should be completely assimilated” and held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[p]roprietary estoppel typically consists of asserting an equitable claim
                        against the conscience of the ‘true’ owner. The claim is a
                        ‘mere equity’. It is to be satisfied by the minimum award
                        necessary to do justice…which may sometimes lead to no more than a
                        monetary award. A ‘common intention’ constructive trust, by
                        contrast, is identifying the true beneficial owner or owners, and the size
                        of their beneficial interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the law to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having so understood the law, the answer to
                    the Defendant’s objections to the Plaintiff’s claim presented
                    itself. In my view, section 51(10) of the HDA did not make the Plaintiff’s
                    claim obviously unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Section 51(10) of the HDA reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall become entitled to any protected property (or any interest
                        in such property) under any resulting trust or constructive trust whensoever
                        created or arising.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision was amended to its current wording in 2010. Prior to
                    that, the equivalent provision, which is section 51(6) of the then-HDA,
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall become entitled to any such flat, house or other building
                        under any resulting trust or constructive trust, whensoever created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The main change was, therefore, the addition of the words “or
                    arising”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Prakash J explained in <em>Koh
                        Cheong Heng</em> that the amendment did not change the effect of the
                    provision but merely reflected that a resulting trust or a constructive may
                    sometimes be more accurately said to have “arisen” rather than
                    “created”. She explained (at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the amended legislation includes the words “or
                        arising” at the end of the relevant provision, in my opinion the
                        addition of the words “or arising” only clarify that a
                        “resulting trust” or a “constructive trust” may
                        be more properly said to arise by operation of law, rather than by the
                        creation of parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, materials pertinent to understanding the previous section
                    51(6) were also relevant apropos the present section 51(10).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     To understand objectives lying behind the
                    older provision, the Ministerial Statement that was read at the second reading
                    of the Bill was instructive. The Minister stated as follows (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (15
                    August 2005) vol 80 at col 1252 (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National
                    Development)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 51 to make it clear that, in addition
                        to prohibiting the voluntary creation of trusts over an HDB flat, the Act
                        also prohibits any person from becoming entitled to a HDB flat under a
                        resulting trust or a constructive trust. <em>This will help
                            to prevent a situation where a person who is ineligible to own an HDB
                            flat may become entitled to own one, for example, by paying the purchase
                            price of the flat on behalf of the owner</em>. [Emphasis
                        added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The intent of section 51(6) of the then-HDA was therefore to prevent
                    ineligible persons from owning HDB flats. This was also the understanding of the
                    High Court in the case of <em>Tan Chui Lian v Neo Liew
                        Eng</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 265. The restriction, in other
                    words, operated within strict boundaries. The conditions were that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the purported beneficiary must be one who is
                            ordinarily ineligible to own a HDB flat;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the beneficiary must be claiming an interest in
                            the HDB flat; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the beneficiary must be entitled to the
                            interest in the flat by way of a resulting or constructive
                        trust.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Since the effect of section 51(6) of the then-HDA was not changed by
                    the subsequent amendment, the present section 51(10) must be understood to
                    operate within the same boundaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the present case, although criterion (i)
                    (as listed in the preceding paragraph) was satisfied, criteria (ii) and (iii)
                    were not. The Plaintiff was making a proprietary estoppel claim on the basis of
                    certain representations made to him by the Deceased. He was not making any of
                    the constructive trust claims enumerated in <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>, above. As a result, no trust need necessarily be declared
                    by virtue of the nature of his claim, if successfully made. All that arose out
                    of the unconscionability of the facts would be a mere estoppel equity, not a
                    trust. To this end, counsel for the Defendant had confused the doctrine of
                    proprietary estoppel for that of constructive trust. Furthermore, the Plaintiff
                    did not seek for the equity to be satisfied by way of a trust. In fact, the
                    Plaintiff was not even seeking an interest in the Flat. Rather, the Plaintiff
                    was merely asking for equitable damages in order to satisfy the equity raised.
                    This prayer was one that was within the court’s equitable discretion to
                    grant. Given the particular way in which the Plaintiff’s case had been
                    framed, it could not be said his claim was necessarily precluded by section
                    51(10) of the HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Allow me to conclude with a personal
                    observation. In my view, the present case is exactly the kind of case that the
                    proprietary estoppel doctrine is uniquely suited to deal with. Indeed, given the
                    recent liberalisation of the common intention constructive trust doctrine (see
                        <em>Oxley v Hiscock</em> [2005] Fam 211 and <em>Stack v Dowden</em>), the time may soon come when proprietary
                    estoppel is used only to do the minimum required to remedy any unacceptable
                    unconscionability rather than allocate proprietary interests. If that happens,
                    one will expect it to be the exception rather than the norm for an estoppel
                    equity to be satisfied by the imposition of a constructive trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I had dealt with the Plaintiff’s case on
                    the basis of the representations made by his counsel that the Plaintiff claim
                    was based only on proprietary estoppel and that the Plaintiff was not seeking a
                    trust to satisfy any equity raised. For all of the above reasons, I came to the
                    conclusion that the Plaintiff’s case was not obviously unsustainable or
                    wrong. I was, therefore, not of the view that the appropriate course of action
                    was to strike out the Plaintiff’s case entirely. However, that the
                    Plaintiff’s statement of claim was inadequately defective remained so.
                    Accordingly, I ordered that the Plaintiff amend his statement of claim to
                    properly reflect his proprietary estoppel claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Both sets of counsel before me agreed that the
                    Defendant should be awarded costs of this application. In the circumstances, I
                    awarded fixed costs of S$5000, excluding disbursements, to be paid by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
