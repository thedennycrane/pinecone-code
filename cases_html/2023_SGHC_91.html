Uneducated and unemployed, she was left a widow at age 25 with four young children. Not only did she raise her children, she also accumulated a number of residential and commercial properties. The property in dispute in this case, a shophouse at 24 Cuff Road, was the first property that she bought after her late husband’s death (the “Property”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Tey bought the Property with the late Mr T Govindasamy (“TG”) as tenants-in-common in equal shares. The main dispute in this case was over whether TG held his half-share in the Property on trust for Tey. The two most important witnesses, TG and Tey, had died – TG died on 10 October 1993 and Tey died on 24 May 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiffs are the legal representatives and co-administrators of TG’s estate, pursuant to a Grant of Letters of Administration issued on 1 June 2021. The 1st plaintiff, Mr Appangam Govindhasamy, is TG’s eldest son. The 2nd plaintiff, Mr Subbaiyan Govindasamy, is TG’s youngest son. The 3rd plaintiff, Mr Selvadurai Manickam, and the 4th plaintiff, Ms Kalaichelvi C w/o Chidambaram M, are the son and daughter respectively of TG’s second son, the late Mr Manickam Govindasamy (“Manickam”), who died in 2011.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiffs sought an order for the sale of the Property and the distribution of the proceeds of sale, and for an account and inquiry of all rental proceeds of the Property received by the defendants since TG’s death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The 1st defendant, Mdm Salaya Kalairani, is Tey’s only daughter and youngest child. She is the main beneficiary under Tey’s will dated 28 February 2002 (the “Will”). She is also the 2nd defendant in her capacity as the legal representative of Tey’s estate pursuant to the Grant of Probate issued on 26 June 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In their counterclaim, the defendants sought a declaration that TG held his half-share on trust for Tey’s estate and an order for TG’s half-share to be transferred to Tey’s estate. Under the Will, the 1st defendant would inherit TG’s half-share in the Property if it were found to be held on trust for Tey’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 2 December 2022, I dismissed the defendants’ counterclaim and ordered the Property to be sold and the net sale proceeds to be distributed equally between TG’s estate and Tey’s estate. I also dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim for an account and inquiry of rental proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 29 December 2022, the plaintiffs and defendants filed cross-appeals against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Tey married the late Mr Salaya s/o Vengdalamandor (“SV”) in 1960. SV was an employee with the Public Works Department (“PWD”) in Singapore. Their inter-racial marriage was frowned upon and both Tey and SV were estranged from their respective families. Tey reconciled with her own family only in the 1980s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 After their marriage, Tey and SV stayed on the lower floor of government-controlled quarters situated off Hindoo Road along present day Jalan Besar. TG was staying on the top floor of the same quarters. TG was then employed as a mason with the PWD and he became good friends with SV and a close friend to SV’s family. SV’s children addressed TG in Tamil as “grandfather”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In the late 1960s, SV was diagnosed with liver disease, and he subsequently fell severely ill and passed away in 1969. As an unemployed young widow with four young children, Tey relied on TG’s advice.

I agreed with the defendants’ submission. This meant proving that TG owned his half-share in the Property absolutely. However, the plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the presumption of indefeasibility of title. The plaintiffs did not have to prove that TG paid for his half-share; they only needed to show that TG was the registered owner of a half-share in the Property: <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14].<span class="font-italic"> </span>The plaintiffs had discharged their legal burden of proof; it could not be disputed that TG was the registered owner of a half-share in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The burden therefore shifted to the defendants to prove the alleged resulting trust or common intention constructive trust. Proof of either would displace the presumption of indefeasibility of title.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Both TG and Tey had died and there was no direct evidence of either trust.

The burden was on the defendants to prove that Tey did pay the full purchase price of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 There was no evidence as to how the Property was paid for, including whether a loan was taken to pay for the Property. The defendants’ case that Tey paid the full purchase price was one of inference based on their allegations that Tey had the ability to pay the full purchase price whilst TG did not have the ability to pay for his half-share of the purchase price. There was no direct evidence of Tey’s ability to pay or TG’s inability to pay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was not enough for the defendants to merely prove that Tey had the ability to pay the full purchase price. Having the ability to pay did not necessarily mean that Tey therefore <span class="font-italic">did</span> pay the full purchase price. To support the inference that Tey did pay the full purchase price, the defendants had to also prove that TG could not have paid for his half-share in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Tey had the ability to pay the full purchase price</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Tey was married in 1960.

</div> As remarkable a woman as Tey was, the circumstances that she was in would have constrained her earning capacity in the 1960s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The defendants also relied on the fact that Tey purchased a half-share of 10 Veerasamy in 1971 and that she purchased 18 Tai Hwan in 1974 (see [13] and [14] above). The defendants argued that this showed that she had financial means. In my view, these facts did not lead to the inference that Tey therefore had the ability to pay the full purchase price of the Property <span class="font-italic">in May 1970</span>. I noted as well that Tey’s half-share of the purchase price of 10 Veerasamy was $11,000 and there was no evidence as to how she paid for it. 18 Tai Hwan was purchased in 1974 for $94,000; again, there was no evidence as to how she paid for it. There was evidence that she mortgaged the Property for a bank loan of $120,000 in 1975 although there was no evidence as to what she used the moneys for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In my judgment, there was insufficient evidence for me to draw the inference that Tey had the means to pay the full purchase price of the Property in May 1970. All that could be inferred from the evidence was that Tey was able to save enough money to pay for at least half of the purchase price of the Property, either with or without taking a loan.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether TG had the ability to pay for his half-share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It was the defendants’ own case that TG came to Singapore in 1950 and the documentary evidence supported this.

</div> There was no evidence of this apart from the 1st defendant’s contention that this was what Tey had told her. In my view, this contention was both unlikely and illogical. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first bank loan taken by Tey was in 1975; the loan was secured by a mortgage over the Property. It was unlikely that in 1970, Tey was already making plans to not only take loans in future but to also use TG as surety. Tey’s husband had just died in 1969 and she had to raise four young children who were aged between five and ten. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) More importantly, the contention that Tey made TG a co-owner of the Property so that he would be an acceptable surety to the bank was illogical. The Property itself was going to be used to secure the loan. It did not make sense that making TG a co-owner of the Property would make him more acceptable as a surety for the loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I found that the 1st defendant was not a credible witness.

</div> The 1993 POA was drafted by Tey’s lawyer. The recital in the 1993 POA stated that TG’s beneficiaries were “desirous in having the Grant of Letters of Administration in order <span class="font-italic">to crystalize the assets and to realise the same</span>” (emphasis added). The stated purpose of the 1993 POA was to authorise Tey to apply for the Letters of Administration for TG’s estate and to “effect any other application … to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or to otherwise deal [with] any property whatsoever of [TG] … especially the property located at and known as No 24A Cuff Road”.

</div> I noted that the 1st defendant did not give any evidence to this effect. In any event, the defendants’ case was contradicted by the 1993 and 1995 POAs, which stated expressly that TG’s beneficiaries wanted the letters of administration to realise the Property. Both POAs were drafted by Tey’s lawyer. It seemed to me that if Tey had informed her lawyer that TG’s half-share was held on trust for her, or that the purpose of the POAs was for Tey to transfer TG’s half-share to herself, her lawyer would have drafted the POAs differently. The language in both POAs was more consistent with the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs’ evidence that Tey told them that she would sell the Property and repatriate half of the proceeds to them.

</div> In my view, this argument did not help the defendants. It did not explain why Tey referred to only her “share” in the Property in the Will. The Will was prepared by a lawyer. If Tey had regarded TG’s half-share as hers, there was no reason why she would not have informed her lawyer. If Tey had informed her lawyer that TG held his half-share on trust for her, there was no reason why the Will would not have dealt with this expressly, especially since there was express reference to 24 Cuff Road. In my judgment, the Will was strong objective evidence that Tey did not regard herself as the owner of TG’s half-share in the Property and thus did not inform her lawyer that TG held his half-share on trust for her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The burden was on the defendants to prove that Tey paid the full purchase price for the Property. The defendants sought to prove this by way of inference based on their allegations that Tey had the means to pay the full purchase price whilst TG did not have the means to pay for his half-share. The defendants did not prove both allegations. Even if it could be said that Tey had the means to pay the full purchase price, this in and of itself did not prove that she did so. The objective evidence showed that she did not pay the full purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The defendants therefore failed to prove that Tey paid the full purchase price. Accordingly, I dismissed the defendants’ claim based on resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether TG held his half-share in the Property on a common intention constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048, the Court of Appeal explained a common intention constructive trust as follows (at [97]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… X acquires a beneficial interest in a property by way of a common intention constructive trust when he relies to his detriment on a common intention that the beneficial interest in the property is to be shared.

</div> However, the fact that TG’s wake was held at 22 Veerasamy merely showed that 22 Veerasamy was TG’s last place of residence at the time of his death. As discussed above, there was a reason why TG was staying at 22 Veerasamy at the time of his death.

PW5 was in Singapore from 1987 to 1990 whilst PW4 came to Singapore in 1993. Even if TG was staying at 22 Veerasamy by then, that did not mean he had abandoned his residence at the Property or that he did not bring PW4 to the Property. There was no reason why he could not have continued to go to the second floor of Property as and when he wanted to. Even if it was more convenient for TG to stay at 22 Veerasamy after his knee surgery, that did not mean that he could not on occasion climb the stairs to go to the second floor of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It was not disputed that TG used 24A Cuff Road as his official registered address. There was no reason for him to have done so if he never stayed there at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my view, the defendants failed to prove that TG did not stay at the Property at any time.

In my view, the fact that TG stood as surety for Tey’s loans was a neutral factor. It did not show that TG therefore held his half-share on trust for Tey.

</div> The 1st defendant explained that she did not do so because she had no cause to doubt the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs and she therefore decided to keep the documentation in abeyance until after her dispute with her brothers had been concluded. I rejected the 1st defendant’s explanations. Her claim that she had no reason to doubt the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs was utterly unbelievable. After all, according to the 1st defendant, TG had said in her presence that he did not trust his sons to “do the right thing after his death”.

He was clearly a relevant witness who could have testified to various matters, including whether TG lived on the second floor of the Property and why he took the position that Tey was only entitled to a half-share in the Property during his (and his brothers’) dispute with the 1st defendant.

In that case, the dispute was over a property that had belonged to the deceased. The plaintiffs were two of the beneficiaries of the estate. The defendants were co-administrators of the estate. The 1st defendant (whose husband was another beneficiary of the estate) and her family had occupied the property without challenge for some 46 years. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the property formed a part of the deceased’s estate and an order that the property be sold, and the proceeds distributed. The issue was whether the property still formed part of the estate. The High Court dismissed the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The defendants submitted that it was readily apparent that <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kow Quee</span> applied to the present case.

The defendants did not quote the Court in context. The Court first referred to certain facts (at [9]) which included the fact that some distributions had taken place, but no steps appeared to have been asserted in respect of the property. The Court then said the following (at [10]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10  In my judgment, the proper inference that is to be drawn from these facts is that the property had been taken into account in a consensual arrangement between all the children of the deceased. The utter lack of any steps having been taken by any of the beneficiaries to assert their claims for such a long period of time renders it highly improbable that these rights had not been settled. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Having inferred that the property had been taken into account in a consensual arrangement between the beneficiaries, the Court then found that the lack of any steps having been taken rendered it highly improbable that the rights over the property had not been settled in that arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The factual matrix in the present case was very different. There was no reason or basis to infer that there was any sort of consensual arrangement between the TG’s estate and Tey (who died in 2015) or Tey’s estate regarding TG’s half-share in the Property. On the contrary, the evidence did not support any such inference. The 1993 and 1995 POAs, the revocation of the 1993 POA in 1996 and the Will showed that there could not have been any such consensual arrangement which might have resolved the question of the beneficial ownership of TG’s half-share. Indeed, there was no objective evidence of any claim of a trust over TG’s half-share that might have led to some sort of a consensual arrangement regarding the same, before 27 July 2021.

If any party failed or refused to sign the necessary documents to effect the sale within 14 days after receipt of the same, the Registrar of the Supreme Court was empowered to sign on behalf of such party.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The above timelines could be extended by the parties’ mutual consent or by the court.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The parties had liberty to apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim for an account and inquiry of rental proceeds received by the defendants after TG’s death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 On 6 June 2022, the plaintiffs made a settlement offer to the defendants. The offer was not an offer to settle (“OTS”) under O 22A of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The plaintiffs’ offer was on terms that (a) the Property be sold and the plaintiffs would receive 50% of the proceeds less $50,000, (b) the costs of valuation would be borne by the parties equally, (c) the plaintiffs would forgo their claim for an account of rentals. The defendants did not respond to the offer. Although this offer was not an OTS, it was nevertheless still a relevant factor on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 On 28 October 2022, the plaintiffs made an offer to settle pursuant to O 22A in similar terms to the previous offer but with a $100,000 haircut instead of $50,000. The defendants did not accept the OTS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Both the 6 June 2022 offer and the 28 October 2022 OTS offered terms that were more advantageous to the defendants than my decision in this case. Accordingly, I ordered the defendants to pay costs on standard basis up to 6 June 2022 and on indemnity basis thereafter. I fixed the total costs at $130,000 plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 For the above reasons, I dismissed the defendants’ counterclaim and ordered the Property to be sold and the net proceeds distributed equally between TG’s estate and Tey’s estate. I gave directions for the conduct of the sale, including an option to the defendants to purchase TG’s half-share in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim for an account of rentals received by the defendants since TG’s death. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As for costs, I ordered the defendants to pay costs to the plaintiffs fixed at $130,000 plus disbursements to be fixed by me if not agreed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joshua Chow Shao Wei and Mohamed Baiross (I.R.B.
