</div> Between 2017 and 2018, the Plaintiffs commenced various proceedings in India (“the Parallel Proceedings”), which I will elaborate on later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiffs’ claim in Suit 709</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 15 July 2019, the Plaintiffs commenced Suit 709 against the Defendants for the torts of conspiracy, fraudulent misrepresentation and misrepresentation under s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“Misrepresentation Act”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conspiracy to injure the plaintiffs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Plaintiffs claimed that the JVA envisaged that each party would share equally in the financing of the joint venture entities. However, the Educomp Group started defaulting on their obligation to make equal contributions and the burden of funding fell increasingly on the Plaintiffs. When P1 approached D1 to rationalise this mismatch, the Plaintiffs alleged that the “Conspiring Parties” – who were initially stated in the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (“SOC”) to be D1, D2 and/or associates of D1 and/or the Educomp Group (or any two or more of them together) – began to conspire and devise a plan through which the Plaintiffs would be misled into believing that Educomp Solutions / the Educomp Group were agreeable to a buy-out of the latter’s stake in the joint venture even though they had no intention to do so. This is so that the Plaintiffs would continue to fund the joint venture exclusively while D1 would continue to retain control of JRRES and Noida College (“the Conspiracy”).

The Minutes of Meeting of the 2014 India Meeting (“2014 Minutes”) support this. The Plaintiffs claimed that “It was only later, in or around late 2014 / early 2015, that the Educomp Group … finally indicated its willingness to consider a fresh proposal that would include such ceding control over JRRES. Parties agreed thereafter to hold physical meetings in Singapore in early March 2015 between representatives from the Educomp Group and [REG] to discuss / negotiate <span class="font-italic">on that basis</span> the terms of the Educomp Group’s exit from the [joint venture]” [emphasis in original].

Under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, the burden lies on the defendant to show that there is some other available forum which is “clearly or distinctly” more appropriate for the trial of the action (in this case, India) than Singapore. If the court concludes at this stage that there is some other available forum which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> is clearly more appropriate it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. For this second stage inquiry, the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of the special circumstances.

Indeed, he has consistently held out his residence as being the AMK Flat, in his OCI Card dated 2017 and even in an ACRA People Profile Search done as recently as September 2019 (long after the Look Out Circular was issued against D1). The fact that a person holds himself out as being ordinarily resident in a place is “highly relevant” for the purposes of determining his ordinary place of residence and should be given weight (<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito and others v Chan Sing En and others </span>[2011] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>”) at [54]). While <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> pertained to the issue of security for costs, the holding there is no less applicable to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Indeed, D1 has not produced any evidence to support his assertion that he is only in Singapore a few days a year, or even that he has not travelled to Singapore in the past 14 months (when he made the attestation in October 2019). He could have easily done so by producing a copy of his passport.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Hence, D1 has not shown that he is ordinarily resident in India or that he is not ordinarily resident in Singapore at the material time or even now. This is even if D1 has business interests in India or is no longer a director of any Singapore company other than Educomp Intelliprop. As noted earlier, D1 had been a director of numerous Singapore companies even until 2015 and 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Further, a person can be ordinarily resident in more than one jurisdiction. The determinative factor is the individual’s “settled purpose”. Once this purpose is established, temporary absence from a place does not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> alter the fact that the individual is still ordinarily resident there: <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [25]–[33]. In this case, the evidence that D1 has adduced, <span class="font-italic">at best</span>, shows that he is ordinarily resident in both India and Singapore, since the evidence – that he is a Singapore permanent resident and holds himself out as residing in the AMK flat in the OCI Card and ACRA People Profile Search – shows that he has a settled purpose to reside in Singapore. Therefore, even if I were wrong that D1 is not ordinarily resident in India, it is clear on the evidence before me that D1 is, on balance, <span class="font-italic">also </span>ordinarily resident in Singapore. Hence, this factor does not assist D1 in proving that Singapore is not the more natural and appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Place of fraudulent misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I turn to deal with the Plaintiffs’ claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. In <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [91] and [93], the Court of Appeal provided guidance on the approach to be adopted in relation to the place of the tort of misrepresentation. Where the misrepresentation was received and acted upon in a single jurisdiction, that place should be the place of the tort, unless that place was fortuitous or if the receipt and reliance occurred in different countries, in which case, the “substance test” would be more applicable. In the “substance test”, one looks at the events constituting the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [90]). In applying the “substance test”, where the representation is “received and acted upon” (particularly where the representation is made to a specific person or class of persons) is the place where the tort is generally committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I find the evidence showed that the Pre-SPA and Pre-BAA Representations, if made, would have been made, received, and relied upon, in Singapore. There was no evidence that the Pre-SPA Representations were made at the 2014 India Meeting – D1 had categorically denied that any such representations were made at all. Even if they had been made there, such representations would have continued to be made after that meeting until the SPA and BAA were executed. The documents showed that many of the terms (including material ones) which eventually found their way into the SPA (and BAA) were not discussed or even finalised at the 2014 India Meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, the documents support the inference that the alleged Pre-SPA and Pre-BAA Representations were made after the 2014 India Meeting to the Plaintiffs’ representatives such as John and Doris who were based in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The 2014 Minutes were bereft of details.

This would support the Plaintiffs’ claim that it was only “in or around late 2014 / early 2015, [when] the Educomp Group … finally indicated its willingness to consider a fresh proposal that would include such ceding control over JRRES” that the Plaintiffs agreed to hold physical meetings in Singapore in March 2015 to negotiate the terms of the Educomp Group’s exit from the joint venture.

I am satisfied that the any Pre-SPA and Pre-BAA Representations would have been made in Singapore and received and relied upon in Singapore by the Plaintiffs’ representatives. Even if some representations might have been made at the 2014 India Meeting, the evidence suggests that representations continued to be made thereafter until the SPA and BAA were executed.

The Defendants knew at all material times that the Plaintiffs’ representatives were based in Singapore and that the representations would be relied upon and received by them in Singapore. The bulk of the negotiations conducted in person was done at the 2015 Singapore Meetings and the final SPA differed from the 2014 and 2015 Term Sheets materially.

The court, in determining the issue of the appropriate forum for the dispute, should look at the relevant pleaded case which the Plaintiffs choose to run. In any event, although the Plaintiffs had initially included other persons as Conspiring Parties, they had all along pursued their claims only against D1 and D2.

</div> As I had earlier found, D1 was also ordinarily resident in and more closely connected to Singapore during the material time of the alleged conspiracies. As such, assuming there was a conspiracy to injure the Plaintiffs, it was more likely to have been hatched in Singapore – this included making the Pre-SPA and Pre-BAA Representations and where the agreement to injure the Plaintiffs might have taken place. The 2015 Singapore Meetings were in Singapore and the SPA and BAA were executed in Singapore. If D1 was ordinarily resident in Singapore (as I had found), his instructions to other persons, in pursuance of the conspiracies, to perform acts which caused damaged to the Plaintiffs would have been likely given by him from Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Next, P1 and P2 are incorporated, and their directors based, in Singapore.

</div> The resolution of these issues will also depend materially on witness testimony. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Witness convenience </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I deal first with the witness convenience factor. The question, at the interlocutory stage, is how the court should approach the issue of which witnesses are to be considered. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> ([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) held at [66]–[67], following <span class="font-italic">Good Earth Agricultural Co Ltd v Novus International Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 711 at [21], that the court hearing an application for a stay should not predetermine the witnesses the parties should call. It would not be appropriate to require a defendant to demonstrate exactly how it would use the testimony of the witnesses it proposes to call, at this interlocutory stage, as it has not yet prepared its defence. Nevertheless, the defendant should at least show that evidence from the foreign witnesses is “at least arguably relevant” to its defence, as it should not be permitted to assert without substantiation that it requires foreign witnesses; otherwise, that would make it easy to manufacture a connecting factor for the purposes of a stay application. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rappo Tania</span> ([35] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [90] appeared to have taken a similar approach. It had disagreed with the view expressed by the court below that there was no need to call some witnesses at the trial or that the evidence of such witnesses was likely to be irrelevant. Such a view was “premature” in the context of a stay application. Likewise, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> adopted the approach in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> ([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) when it found that the appellant had sufficiently demonstrated that the evidence of the witnesses in Singapore was “at least arguably relevant” (see <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> at [74] and [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Ms Lin, citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> ([36] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), submitted that only the material or key witnesses are to be considered. However, <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> must be read in its context. The Court therein placed weight on the fact that the “principal witnesses” were located in Singapore, in the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of any foreign non-party witnesses having been identified for the purposes of determining the appropriate forum in that case (see <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [23]–[29]). Thus, I accept the approach in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> – that the defendant’s identified witnesses whom it claims it intends to call at trial must be shown to be at least arguably relevant to its case. At the end of the day, in most cases, the approaches in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> and <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> may not result in a material difference – a witness who is arguably relevant is also potentially likely to be material (see <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [69], where the Court of Appeal held that witnesses whose evidence is “potentially material and relevant” to the issues should be reckoned). In any event, whichever approach is adopted would make no difference to my analysis of the present case because I find that the parties’ identified witnesses are material and their evidence at least arguably relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Plaintiffs identified the “key” witnesses to be John, Doris, Chew, D1 and D2, who are all based in Singapore.

D1 has not explained why the Foreign Witnesses’ evidence cannot be obtained by video-link. Further, India is not far from Singapore.

</div> Applying the principles (at [78] to [81] above) to the present case, there is no evidence to show that the Foreign Witnesses are unwilling or less willing to testify in Singapore. Consequently, I am unconvinced that the witness compellability factor leans, or tilts the balance, in favour of India as the more natural forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other connecting factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I turn to deal briefly with some of the other connecting factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 First, as for the choice of law for torts, the double actionability rule applies in Singapore <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the tort must be actionable under both the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> and the <span class="font-italic">lex fori </span>(<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [88]). The <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>, based on my earlier analysis of the place of the torts, is Singapore law, and it is clear that the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span> is also Singapore law. The Plaintiffs’ claims of fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy are thus actionable under Singapore law and the <span class="font-italic">lex causae</span> for the torts is Singapore law. In any event, the key issues in dispute are factual rather than legal in nature, and both India and Singapore are common law jurisdictions such that there is usually little difficulty in one forum applying the law of another (<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> ([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [55] and [57]). Therefore, whilst the governing law of the torts is Singapore, this is not a weighty factor, and in any event does not tilt the balance in favour of the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, insofar as the parties’ personal connections are concerned, P1 and P2 are Singapore entities, and P3’s directors are based in Singapore. D2 is a Singapore citizen and, whilst D1 may claim to be residing in India currently, he is nevertheless a Singapore permanent resident. At this stage, I briefly deal with D1’s claim that he is currently in India and unable to travel overseas because of the Tribunal Order and Look Out Circular. As I had earlier found, the Tribunal Order does not prevent D1 from travelling overseas; it merely states that D1 has to inform the Tribunal before he does (see [43] above). As for the Look Out Circular, D1 has not shown evidence of how it applied to him, and whether it is still valid as against him, today (see [44] above). Hence, D1 has not shown that he is currently unable to travel overseas, even assuming he is in India. Thus, this factor does not tilt the balance in the Defendants’ favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Third, even though some of the acts done in pursuant to the alleged conspiracies may have occurred in India, this does not clearly or distinctly point towards India as the more natural or appropriate forum. As I had found earlier, the alleged representations would have been made, received, and relied on, in Singapore, and the alleged conspiracies in substance occurred in Singapore.

Whilst there may be some overlap of issues between the Parallel Proceedings and Suit 709, the causes of action and parties (particularly the defendants) are different. Pertinently, CC 11448/2018 is a criminal complaint. The Parallel Proceedings are also largely in the preliminary stages. There is no evidence as to the precise stages of each of the Parallel Proceedings, and it would seem that they are either at a pre-hearing or pre-trial stage.

</div> I gave little weight to this submission, as it was made by counsel and not attested to by D1, and P1 has not had the opportunity to explain this. Pertinently, it should be noted that CC 11448/2018 was filed against 12 accused persons, most of whom are Indian residents or citizens (putting aside D1), and against Educomp Solutions, which is incorporated in India. Hence, it would be reasonable for P1 to file its criminal complaint in India. Even if D1 was currently residing in India, this did not mean that he was ordinarily resident (or ordinarily resident only) in India or so resident at the time of the torts (see [48] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I find that the overall shape of the litigation does not necessarily point to India as <span class="font-italic">clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum</span> than Singapore. The acts making up the dispute essentially concerned the alleged representations made by the Defendants, and their intent, via the alleged conspiracies, to cause damage to the Plaintiffs. I had found that the representations would have been received and relied upon by the Plaintiffs in Singapore, and the Defendants would have hatched their conspiracy in Singapore. Even if D1 claimed to have been residing in India, the fact remained that D2 was in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, the Defendants bore the burden of showing that there is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. I am not satisfied that they have done so. Given this, there is no need for me to consider the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test.
