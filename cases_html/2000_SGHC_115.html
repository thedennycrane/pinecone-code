<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns=""><b>
<p>Background</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">1. At the conclusion of the trial on 13 February 1998, I found that the

defendants had breached their written agreement whereby they agreed to vote at all directors and

shareholders meetings in accordance with the plaintiffs vote unless the resolution was against

the defendants interest or against the interest of Way Company Pte Ltd (the company).

Consequently, I ordered damages to be assessed by the registrar from the date of the plaintiffs

removal as the chairman of the company to the date of his reinstatement.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The plaintiff was reappointed to the board of directors and made its chairman

on 8 June 1998. Counsel for the plaintiff informed me that the plaintiff was wrongly kept out of the

management of the company for a period of 21  months.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Assessment by the Registrar</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">3. The learned assistant registrar assessed the damages under 3 heads as follows:</p>
<b><u>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Loss of income as chairman and director of the company</p>
</blockquote></u></b>
<p align="justify">For loss of income, he fixed the directors fee for the plaintiff at $10,000

p.m. and multiplied it by 21.5 months. After deducting 20% for income tax, transport expenses and

the plaintiffs mitigation of his loss, he awarded $172,000 for this item.</p>
<b><u>(b) Loss of a chance to sell the factory premises before the property downturn in late 1997.</u></b>
<p align="justify">The loss here was assessed on the basis that had the plaintiff not been removed

as the chairman and director, the company would have sold the factory premises in Singapore (held on

a 30 year lease from 1984 with an option for a further term of 30 years) before the downturn in the

property market sometime in late 1997. The assistant registrar assessed this loss to the plaintiff

at $50,000 to compensate him for his loss of the chance to sell the factory premises at the market

price then prevailing before the property market softened.</p>
<b><u>(c) Loss in the value of the plaintiffs shareholding because he was not allowed to control

and manage the company for 21.5 months</u></b>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff alleged that he had suffered loss because he was prevented from

putting into operation his business plans which would have enabled the company to be more

profitable. The assistant registrar disallowed this head of claim.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The total amount awarded by him was thus $220,000. The plaintiff and

defendants appealed. Both appeals came before me. The defendants counsel argued that the award of

$172,000 for loss of directors fees was excessive. He further contended that the claim for loss

of a chance (a) to improve the operations of the company and (b) to sell the factory should be

disallowed for lack of evidence and for being too speculative and uncertain in nature.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>My Decision</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">5. I varied the assistant registrars order and substantially reduced the

damages payable to $104,000. As the defendants have not appealed, I do not think it is necessary to

explain in detail why I allowed all 3 heads of claim as prayed for by the plaintiff. The central

issue then is the quantum of damages, which I presume is considered too low by the plaintiff who has

since appealed. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><u>
<p align="justify">(A) Loss of income as chairman and director of the company</p>
</u></b>
<p align="justify">6. Plaintiffs counsel submitted that the plaintiff invested some $801,000 to

become the largest shareholder in the company. As the chairman of the board of directors, he would

shoulder the heaviest responsibility. Accordingly, counsel supported the learned assistant registrars

assessment of $10,000 p.m. as the plaintiffs loss of income. By comparison, the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants remuneration was $11,000 p.m. as the managing director at that time.</p>
<p align="justify">7. I do not think that it is right to assess the plaintiffs remuneration as

the chairman and director purely on the basis of the size of his shareholding or his seniority on

the board of directors. Size of shareholding is neither an indication of a persons ability to add

value nor of his actual contribution to the companys management. In my opinion, the fee paid to a

director must generally be commensurate with his overall contribution to the company as a director.

As an example, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant should have his total remuneration assessed on the value

of his work, the time spent and his contribution as a full time managing director with the added

responsibilities of the day to day management of the company.</p>
<p align="justify">8. In principle, a director with a very large shareholding but who hardly makes

any contribution to the company as a director should be paid a correspondingly lower directors

fee than one who makes a substantial contribution as a director, but who may only have a nominal

shareholding in the company. A shareholders proper return is through dividends and capital

appreciation of the shares. The fact that no dividends are declared does not mean that shareholders

do not get any return because undistributed profits do increase the net tangible asset value of the

shares. Using directors fees as the mechanism to distribute returns to shareholders is therefore

improper. It will create distortions in the financial remuneration for directors, particularly where

there are non-shareholding directors. What is more intolerable is the fact that minority

shareholders who are non-directors will also be unfairly treated and short-changed as profits meant

for distribution to all shareholders by way of dividends in accordance with their respective

shareholding will be siphoned out by directors should directors fees be allowed as the principal

means by which to distribute profits to the shareholders, in which case only shareholders who are

directors will benefit to the exclusion of those shareholders who are not directors.</p>
<p align="justify">9. I will thus assess the directors fee that the plaintiff ought to have

earned on the assumption that he would have run the company on a proper footing i.e. he will not

misuse directors fees to reward himself for his large shareholding but that he will declare

dividends when he desires to reward the shareholders. In determining the appropriate quantum, I need

to take account of (a) the amount of time and effort spent by the plaintiff on the company; and more

importantly, (b) the real worth of his contribution to the company as a director. Directors drawing

excessive or inflated fees not commensurate with their contribution will need to have their fees

shaved down in the interest of the company and its body of shareholders. Review of directors fees

will fall within the plaintiffs scope of responsibility once the company is under his control.

But I still have to assume that the plaintiff will act in good faith when assessing the appropriate

amount to pay himself so as to be fair to other directors and the shareholders at the same time. If

these assumptions are not made, assessment of the appropriate amount to fix as his directors fee

will be near impossible as there can be many ways to milk the company and other minority

shareholders, one of which is to confer extravagant benefits (e.g. very high housing and children

educational allowances, unlimited entertainment allowances etc) or pay grossly inflated fees or

salaries to themselves as directors.</p>
<p align="justify">10. I will now examine the plaintiffs role and responsibility as a director

and chairman of the company. His role is envisaged to be more at a strategic, planning and advisory

level, where he sets goals and directions for the company, leaving the implementation and the daily

running of the company to the managing director and other executive directors of the company. He has

admitted that his role is to steer the company and oversee its operations but not to perform

managing directors duties. Although the voting agreement gives the plaintiff full management

control, it is not envisaged by the parties that he would have any direct responsibility for the day

to day management of the company which would still remain under the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants

charge as the managing director. At the trial proper, the plaintiff even said that he would like the

1<sup>st</sup> defendant to continue as the managing director.</p>
<p align="justify">11. Essentially, the plaintiff would not be playing an active role in the

operations of the company. The plaintiff admitted that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant has more

experience in the line of business that the company is in. He did not know the details of the hair

care products manufactured by the company. The plaintiffs own expertise is generally on accounts

and budgeting as he is a practising accountant and a certified auditor.</p>
<p align="justify">12. Unlike the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, the plaintiff would not be working full

time in the company. The plaintiff has his other business commitments. According to the affidavit of

the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, when the plaintiff was a director of the company from 6 June 1996 to

22 August 1996, he only visited the company about twice a week, each time for a period of about one

or two hours. He was thus very much a non-executive director. I must emphasise that in my written

grounds of judgment for the trial, I made no finding that the plaintiff was to be responsible for

the day to day management of the company. I found that he intended to have overall control and

management when he bought into the company and signed the voting agreement with the defendants. But

this did not mean that he was to be saddled with the day to day business of managing the company at

the same time.</p>
<p align="justify">13. I cannot imagine this relatively small company paying two persons to manage

its daily operations. With the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant already doing that for about $11,000 p.m.,

the company can hardly afford to duplicate that function by having the plaintiff do more of the same

thing and be paid say another $11,000 p.m. by the company. Manpower costs will increase drastically.

Furthermore, duplicating administrative and daily management functions is grossly inefficient from

the point of view of workflow. Precious manpower resources will be wasted in the process.</p>
<p align="justify">14. Without the evidence to show that the plaintiff was to take over the entire

management of the daily operations of the company from the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and that the

plaintiff was going to give up his other businesses and work full time in this company, I am not

prepared to assess the plaintiffs contribution even at $10,000 p.m. to be nearly on par with the

1<sup>st</sup> defendant, which was what the learned assistant registrar had done.</p>
<p align="justify">15. In any event, if the plaintiff were to remove the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as

the managing director, reduce the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants $11,000 p.m. remuneration to almost

nil and basically take over all of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants functions so as to pay himself

what the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant was getting previously, then plaintiff would in turn be acting in

breach of the voting agreement. Surely, my assessment cannot be on this basis.</p>
<p align="justify">16. In fact, when the plaintiff first joined the company, he himself recognised

his limited contribution both in time and effort when he agreed to his directors fee of $3,664.12

p.m. plus employers CPF contribution of $734 per month, making a total of some <b><u>$4,400 p.m.</u></b>

This is considerably less than the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants of some $11,000 per month. Plaintiffs

counsel showed me his salary slip for July 1996 which showed a gross amount paid of $3,664.12 for

that month, and he said that reflected the plaintiffs actual monthly remuneration. As defendants

counsel did not dispute it, I took that to be correct despite the plaintiffs declaration in his

own IR8A income tax form which stated his remuneration as $3,664.12 for 2 months from 1 June 1996 to

31 July 1996, thereby suggesting that his directors fees was only $1,800 p.m. The plaintiff also

accepted at the assessment hearing that his transport allowance was $1,000 and his director fees was

$800 p.m., which appear to be at odds again with the salary slip. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant

testified to the same at page 24 of the notes of evidence and at paragraph 11 of his affidavit

affirmed on 17 July 1999. The written submissions of plaintiffs counsel at paragraph 33 also

adopted the figure of $1800 p.m. If indeed the plaintiffs agreed total directors fee per month

previously was actually $1,800 and not $3,664.12, have I then overprovisioned for this head of loss?

I think not. $1,800 p.m. in my view is on the low side. A figure around $4,000 p.m. is more

reasonable. Hence, my assessment based on $3,664.12 p.m. will still not change.</p>
<p align="justify">17. With the agreed 20% provision for income tax and transport expenses, his net

directors fee p.m. inclusive of employers CPF contribution would come to about $3,660 p.m. I

do not think the parties would have contemplated that this agreed directors fee would suddenly

balloon to $10,000 p.m. on the 3<sup>rd</sup> month following the plaintiffs appointment as a

director. It is far more likely for the plaintiff to continue on his agreed directors fee for the

next 10 months perhaps (i.e. making a total of 12 months before a review is carried out the

following year). Accordingly, I assess the plaintiffs loss for this first 10 months at <b><u>$36,600</u></b>.</p>
<p align="justify">18. For the following year, I factor in an increase of $1,000 p.m. In my view, a

27% increase over the directors fee for the previous year is not unreasonable. I assume that the

status quo remains in that he would continue as a non-executive director and chairman, not spending

more than a few hours a week on matters of the company. New management will usually introduce some

changes to the company. As soon as the initial teething problems arising from the changes get

resolved in due course, things will settle down and run smoothly. Thereafter, upper level management

will not need to spend as much time as before unless further strategic changes are made. Thus it is

reasonable to assume that the time spent on the company by the plaintiff in his second year as the

chairman and director is not likely to exceed that in his first year.</p>
<p align="justify">19. In any event, it is improbable in my view that the other directors would

support any request from the plaintiff to double or triple his own directors fee after merely a

year in office. The voting agreement will not apply here if the defendants decide to vote against it

on the basis that it is not in the interest of the company and the body of shareholders to reward a

non-executive director so extravagantly. Hence, applying the same calculations and adopting the 20 %

deduction as agreed by the parties, I estimate the plaintiffs gross directors fee inclusive of

employers CPF contribution at about $4,660 per month for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year. This will

continue for the next 11.5 months. Total amount is therefore <b><u>$53,590</u></b>.</p>
<p align="justify">20. After adding up the two amounts (underlined in bold above), the total loss of

income suffered by the plaintiff for the entire period of 21.5 months is about $90,190, which I then

rounded down to $90,000. Plaintiffs counsel made an issue of the fact that his investment of

$801,000 in the company is not getting him any returns. If I were to treat this $90,000 as his

return on his investment, then he would be getting a respectable return of 6.27% p.a. on his

investment which I believe is more than most bank interest rates on saving deposits at that time.</p>
<p align="justify">21. I conclude that the assistant registrar used a figure of $10,000 p.m. to

assess the plaintiffs loss because he was unduly influenced by the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant as the managing director was paid $11,000 p.m. The error in assessment is to give almost

equal weight to both the plaintiffs contribution on a part-time basis and the full time

contribution of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as the managing director, without regard to what the

plaintiff himself had initially agreed as the fair amount he was to be paid as a non-executive

director and chairman.</p>
<p align="justify">22. I have not deducted any loss that the plaintiff may suffer if he is

already occupied full-time in his other business activities. When he has to devote some time to this

company as its director and chairman, it may have to be at the expense of the time that he would

otherwise spend on his other business activities. As such, I think my award of $90,000 under this

head of claim without any deduction for loss elsewhere is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><u>
<p align="justify">(B) Loss of a chance to sell the factory premises before the property downturn in

late 1997.</p>
</u></b>
<p align="justify">23. It is clear from the evidence that the plaintiff and the other directors

signed a memorandum of understanding dated 26 March 1996 which indicated an intention to sell the

factory at 4 Joo Koon Road Singapore, and that part of the sale proceeds would be distributed among

the shareholders once the factory was sold. This memorandum was signed contemporaneously with the

voting agreement. According to the plaintiff, he wanted to sell the factory in Singapore as it was

underutilised. He wanted to use the cash proceeds to generate more sales.</p>
<p align="justify">24. On a balance of probability, it is more likely that he favoured a sale but

there is insufficient evidence to show that he was adamant that the factory must be sold as soon as

possible at the highest offer obtained, even if that offer was well below the valuation. During the

short period that he was the chairman (i.e. between 18 June 1996 and 8 August 1996), the plaintiff

said that there were discussions on the sale and everyone agreed that the factory should be sold.

Nevertheless he agreed with counsel for the defendants that after he was removed as a director, he

did not bring to the boards attention that the property should be sold. He certainly could have

written to the board of directors as a concerned shareholder if he was so keen to have the premises

sold urgently, but he did not.</p>
<p align="justify">25. According to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, all production had moved to Johore

Bahru by July 1997. However the defendants, who were then in the control of the company, made no

attempts to sell the factory although the production had completely shifted out leaving behind only

the administration in Singapore. Plaintiffs counsel attributed that to the defendants secret

agreement with the other directors not to sell out their shares prior to the sale of the factory. To

prevent the plaintiff from gaining control of the company by buying over the shares of the other

directors, counsel submitted that the defendants refused to take steps to sell the factory.</p>
<p align="justify">26. Since the plaintiff regained control of the company on 8 June 1998, he still

has not sold the factory premises in Singapore. He blames the depressed market. The plaintiff said

that reasonable offers have not been received but he is still contemplating selling it. In his view,

why should be sell at a low price when he can sell at a higher price although he did not need to

sell at the highest price.</p>
<p align="justify">27. To evaluate the value of the loss of his chance to sell the property before

the property downturn, I have to consider the interplay of various contingencies, the complexity of

human behaviour and the probable outcome of interactions of people within a group, and in this case,

it will be the board of directors.</p>
<p align="justify">28. The timeframe available to advertise, get interested buyers to view, bid for

the property in a tender, negotiate the terms of sale and finally to obtain the boards approval

for the terms of sale and more particularly the sale price is only about 6 to 7 months from about

April 1997 to September or October 1997 before the financial crisis erupted, prices became depressed

and the chance of selling the factory at a good price was lost. If the window of opportunity to sell

is large, then the probability of finding a buyer is high. When the time given to sell is short, the

probability of getting a sale through is lower. For the sale of a factory, a window of 6 to 7 months

is not exactly a relaxed timeframe within which to clinch a sale.</p>
<p align="justify">29. A factory is very different from commodities like oil, rubber, sugar and

cocoa for instance where there is a large market of buyers and sellers. For these commodities,

selling at the then prevailing market price in the international market is easy and can be done

almost immediately. A factory is unique and is not as readily saleable as the examples I have given.

Interested buyers will be limited in number. Further these buyers will have to assess, inter alia,

the duration of the lease, its particular locality, its size, the factory layout, the suitability

for their own specific purposes, and last but not least the price.</p>
<p align="justify">30. If the factory is priced substantially below its open market valuation, e.g.

in a forced sale situation, it will obviously be much easier and quicker to find a willing buyer. If

the sale price is pitched at the valuation price or worse above the valuation price, it will be

correspondingly more difficult to find a willing buyer. In other words, the cheaper the price, the

better is the chance of getting the factory sold within the limited timeframe before the financial

crisis descended. The higher the price, the more difficult it will be to achieve a sale within the

time period available.</p>
<p align="justify">31. In this case, I do not think that the directors including the plaintiff are

offering to sell their priced asset cheaply or at a forced sale price. I therefore assume that they

want to sell at a price close to or even above its valuation price if they can. The open market

value as at 31 October 1996 was estimated to be $3,950,000 by M/s Edmund Tie &amp; Company. See

their valuation report dated 24 September 1998. Given the relative short period of 6 to 7 months,

the probability of finding a buyer willing to pay the full valuation price of $3,950,000, is in my

judgment in the region of 20% i.e. a <b><u>1/5</u></b><u> <b>chance</b></u> of that contingency

happening within that limited timeframe.</p>
<p align="justify">32. There is also the chance that not all the directors will agree to sell even

at that price. Some may be undecided and may want to wait for an even better price as it is only

natural to think that perhaps another better offer will turn up later. I cannot rule out greed. One

cannot evaluate on the basis that all of them will readily agree to sell at any price offered at

that time because they can foretell that the market is going to drop drastically. That will be a

wrong assessment with the benefit of perfect hindsight. By waiting for a better offer to come by,

they may just miss the chance of selling before the unexpected financial crisis in late 1997. The

probability of missing the chance of selling due to greed is very real and must be considered. Once

the market downturn sets in, potential buyers for the factory can withdraw very quickly to the

sidelines. These acts of third parties are not within the control of the defendants or the

plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">33. As the factory is the major asset of the company, the board must give its

approval before that factory can be sold. If the plaintiff wants to push through the sale at a

particular price, he must convince the other directors that the price offered by the interested

buyer is the best price obtainable. I cannot ignore the possibility that the other directors might

in turn succeed in persuading the plaintiff to defer selling in anticipation of even higher prices.

To say that greed only affects the other directors but not the plaintiff is unrealistic. I do not

think that the plaintiff has ever taken the position that he will sell the factory at any price to

the 1<sup>st</sup> buyer that comes along and that he will use his voting agreement to bulldoze the

board into selling the factory without taking into account the views of the other directors. It is

not improbable to have differing and conflicting views on whether the price offered is the best

price. Having regard to these probabilities, I reckon that there is an <b><u>even chance</u></b>

that the board of directors as a whole might decide to wait for a better offer and not sell within

the window period referred to earlier. It is not uncommon for persons with an intention to sell to

miss selling at the right time because they want to hold on a bit longer to get a better price

before selling. Such are the dynamics of human behaviour.</p>
<p align="justify">34. With the 1/5 chance of a buyer coming along to offer to buy at the valuation

price and coupled with the even chance that the offer might still not be accepted by all the

directors as some might want to defer the sale in the hope of getting an even better price, the

resulting probability of an actual sale going through will be 10%.</p>
<p align="justify">35. Based on M/s Edmund Ties valuation of $3,950,000 as at 31 October 1996 and

the valuation of $3,300,000 as at 2 June 1998 for the factory, the difference in valuation is

$650,000. The plaintiffs shareholding is 21.3%. If the probability of a sale is 100% (meaning an

absolute certainty), then the plaintiffs loss would be 0.213x $650,000 i.e. $138,450. Since I

assessed the probability of a sale to be only 10%, the value of the chance lost by the plaintiff to

sell the factory at $3,950,000 before the market softened is computed at $13,845, which I rounded

upwards to $14,000.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b><u>
<p align="justify">(C) Loss in the value of the plaintiffs shareholding because he was not

allowed to control and manage the company for 21.5 months</p>
</u></b>
<p align="justify">36. If the defendants had abided by the voting agreement and had not removed the

plaintiff from the board of directors, the plaintiff will have effective control and management of

the company, but only in so far as his intended action plans and directions are not against the

companys interest or against the personal interest of the defendants. This is expressly provided

for in the voting agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">37. The defendants are entitled to exercise their independent judgment to decide

in good faith if any proposal is against the interest of the company or against their own interest.

If so, they are not bound to vote with the plaintiff. Thus, the defendants can still defeat the

plaintiffs proposed resolutions even though the plaintiff might have honestly believed that his

proposed plans are for the benefit of the company.</p>
<p align="justify">38. Apparently what the plaintiff would have done differently from the defendants

had he been in charge, is to introduce a series of cost-cutting measures to raise the intrinsic

value of the shares of the company. See pages 11 and 12 of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Ms

Reggie Thein. In my opinion, the cost-cutting measure involving the reduction of the defendants

salaries is not likely to be approved by the board of directors because the defendants will in all

probability vote against it, being a measure directed against their personal interest. Similarly,

given the negative feelings of the other directors and the defendants towards the plaintiff at that

time, it is more probable for the two defendants to vote against the plaintiffs proposal to

dismiss the rest of the other executive directors (i.e. Ong Tiong Guan, Tan Seng Teng and Teo Cher

Hoon) and certain staff (i.e. Adeline Loy Liang Sin, Teng Yew Nghee and Tee Mong Ling) just for

cost-saving purposes without showing how and why these 6 persons are redundant and not contributing.

Are their functions now totally unnecessary? If not, then how are their functions to be

redistributed? Is the plaintiff assuming those functions by himself? Will he later reward himself

with a very generous salary for performing those functions, which in turn will off-set the benefits

intended by the cost-cutting measures in the first place? Or will someone else be recruited to

replace these 6 persons? These questions are left unanswered. Without knowing the basis, I am not

able to assess whether the cost-cutting measures are indeed realistic and viable. I am more inclined

to believe that they are mere computations to jack up the damages claimed.</p>
<p align="justify">39. Without more details provided by the plaintiff, whose burden it is to prove

the damages sustained, I am not prepared to accept that the relatively small company is not going to

suffer by such a massive staff cut. If the defendants were to vote against this massive staff cut on

the basis that it is against the companys interest, I do not think that they have breached their

voting agreement. For this reason, I doubt that the mass dismissals can be carried through by the

plaintiff as the rest of the directors will probably vote against these draconian measures.</p>
<p align="justify">40. The other cost-cutting measures appear to be the reduction in commissions

paid to sales representatives and the reduction in the entertainment, travelling and advertising

expenses. I accept the submission of defendants counsel that it is unrealistic to expect the

level of sales to remain the same after commissions are cut. Cutting costs by reducing commissions

and advertising expenses will likely result in a decrease in sales revenue, which is not provided

for in the plaintiffs projections.</p>
<p align="justify">41. In my judgment, the plaintiffs cost-cutting measures are on the whole

overly simplistic and unrealistic, with insufficient attention paid to lowering of employees

morale, motivation and the likely problem of retention of experienced staff. All this will in turn

affect the companys performance and profitability over the longer term. Further, I doubt that any

of these cost-cutting measures can be carried through because I accept the affidavit evidence of

both defendants that they would not have agreed to these measures, which would not have been in the

interest of the company in their opinion.</p>
<p align="justify">42. In fact, when the defendants were in charge, the total sales generated for

the year ending 31 December 1997 was $5,701,314. But after the plaintiff took over, the total sales

generated for 5 months of 1999 from 1 January to 31 May 1999 was only $1,672,623.71. After

annualising it, the sales would be about $4,014,296.90 representing a reduction of some 30%. It is

also useful to compare the net earnings generated (without any deduction for directors fees) to

have some indication of the relative performance of the two managements. I note that the net

earnings (with the directors fees added back) for the year ending 31 December 1997 is $83,184

plus $443,358, which amounts to $526,542, and this is for 1997 when the defendants were managing the

company. Contrast that with the 5 months ending on 3 May 1999 when the plaintiff was in charge. The

figures are $94,975.02 plus $82,750 totalling $177,725. On an annualised basis, it is $426,540,

which represents a drop of 19 % in real net earnings generated. It appears that the company did

better overall in 1997 under the defendants management than in the year 1999 when the plaintiff

was in charge.</p>
<p align="justify">43. However, I am not prepared to conclude merely on the basis of one years

comparison that the defendants are more capable at managing the company than the plaintiff. There

are just too many imponderables. Generally, the more contingencies there are, the lower is the value

of the loss of that chance simply because the probability of two or more independent contingencies

happening is a multiplication or a product of the individual probability of each event happening. As

such, the more contingencies there are, the likelihood of a particular event happening, which is

dependent on all those contingencies, becomes more and more remote.</p>
<p align="justify">44. Nevertheless, I will be generous towards the plaintiff and assess his

contribution to the company to be at least equal to the amount to be paid to him as directors

fees for the 21.5 months. In other words, I have assessed his contribution to the company to be

$90,000 for the purpose of this assessment. The net effect is that his joining the management of the

company is neutral in that there is no loss nor gain to the net tangible asset value (NTA) of

the shares over the 21.5 months period.</p>
<p align="justify">45. I will elaborate. With the plaintiffs draw down of $90,000 in directors

fees, the companys NTA must fall by the same amount $90,000, unless the plaintiff is able to

generate for the company additional net earnings of $90,000 to off-set the amount of fees drawn down

by him as a director. I believe that an assessment on the basis that the plaintiff will at least

contribute enough to earn his own keep in the company so to speak is reasonable.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>Total award</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">46. For the reasons stated, I varied the order of the learned assistant registrar

and assessed the total damage at a global sum of $104,000 (i.e. $90,000 plus $14,000). I fixed the

cost at $8,000 to be paid by the plaintiff as the defendants had succeeded substantially in both

appeals.</p>
