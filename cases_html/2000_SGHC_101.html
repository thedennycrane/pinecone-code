<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The central issue in this case is

whether there was ever a concluded time charter party in respect of the Panamanian vessel <i>Ever

Wealthy</i> between the plaintiffs as charterers and the defendants as owners.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. There are five parties who played a

role in the negotiations relating to the charter. First, the plaintiffs: this company was

incorporated in Singapore in order to carry on the business of shipping cargo from Far </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Eastern and South East Asian ports to

Australia. The plaintiffs did not own any ships and therefore had to use chartered vessels

to carry the cargo. In early March 1997, the plaintiffs were looking for a suitable vessel

to carry cargo that month and approached and appointed the second party, Southern Cross

Maritime Service (Australia) Pty Ltd (‘Southern Cross’), an Australian company,

as their brokers for this purpose.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. Next, we have the defendants who carry

on business as shipowners. Although they are incorporated in Panama, their president, Mr

James Lan Chun Sheng, is Taiwanese and for all intents and purposes, they are run out of

Taiwan. The defendants are the owners of various vessels among them the m.v. <i>Ever

Wealthy</i> and m.v. <i>Ever Forest</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The fourth party is Pescadores Shipping

Pte Ltd (‘Pescadores’), a company incorporated in Singapore which acts as the

defendants’ Singapore representative. In this instance, Pescadores is also alleged to

have acted as the defendants’ brokers in connection with the charter of the <i>Ever

Wealthy</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. Finally, there is Oldendorff Asia

(‘Oldendorff’), a company carrying on business in Singapore as both a ship

charterer and a shipbroker. At all material times, Oldendorff was the charterer of the <i>Ever

Forest</i> and its Mr James Lough was often in communication with Mr Lan of the defendants

and Mr David Chua of Pescadores. Oldendorff acted as a broker in relation to the charter

of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> but it is a bone of contention between the plaintiffs and the

defendants as to whether Oldendorff was acting as the defendants’ broker or simply

acting independently as an intermediate broker in the hope of earning commission should

the charter be concluded. It is the defendants’ position that Oldendorff was never

their broker in these negotiations whereas the plaintiffs pleaded that Oldendorff was the

defendants’ broker and that the defendants were bound by Oldendorff’s actions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. The documents show that as early as 5

February 1997 Oldendorff informed Pescadores that the plaintiffs could be interested in

chartering the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> for three or six months if she was able to call at

Australian ports. At about the same time, Oldendorff told Southern Cross that the

defendants would consider a charter of three to six months of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> at a

rate of US$5,500 per day. The initial correspondence was exploratory only, however, and it

was not till March 1997 that negotiations became serious.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. On 4 March 1997, Southern Cross

informed the plaintiffs that the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> was available and would be free at

the Chinese port of Zhanjiangang on or about 8 March 1997 and would be an ideal vessel for

the plaintiffs’ purposes. The plaintiffs then requested Southern Cross to make an

offer to the owners of the vessel for the time charter of the vessel by the plaintiffs.

Southern Cross proceeded to relay the plaintiffs’ offer to Oldendorff. Oldendorff in

turn relayed it to Pescadores. It should be noted that throughout the negotiations

Southern Cross dealt only with Oldendorff and it was Oldendorff who was in contact with

Pescadores and the defendants. Southern Cross considered Oldendorff to be the

defendants’ broker as it was not aware of the role played by Pescadores.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The offer that Southern Cross made to

Oldendorff was in the following terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘ON BEHALF MY CLOSE CHTRS AM PLSD TO

  OFFER FIRM ASF FOR REPLY TO 60 MINS:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">AS ADVSD THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE CHTRS

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">PLS BRING OWRS CLOSEST COUNTER (PLS CALL

  ME WHEN SENDING AS I MAY HV TO LEAVE THE OFFICE FOR AN HOUR OR SO)’ </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. What the message quoted above meant was

that Southern Cross on behalf of its close charterers (ie the plaintiffs) was pleased to

make a firm offer for reply within 60 minutes. The offer went on to identify the

charterers as Pacific Orient SEA Transport of Singapore (a joint venture between parties

in Australia/Singapore/Hong Kong/Malaysia). Delivery was to be on departure of the vessel

from the outer pilot station at Zhanjiangang after completion of discharge of the cargo

carried on the current voyage. The charter period was to be about 70 to 80 days and the

vessel was to trade between the Far East, South East Asia and Australia and carry steel

and timber products, machinery and lawful general cargo. Redelivery would take place in

the range of Singapore/Colombo/Japan including Indonesia. The hire was US$5,000 per day

payable every 15 days in advance. The sentence in the offer ‘L/C 7/11 Mar’

97’ meant that the laydays cancelling period (or as it is usually called, the laycan)

was between 7 and 11 March. This was the period within which the vessel had to be

delivered to the charterers failing which they would be entitled to cancel the charter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. The above were the main terms of the

proposed charter. The offer was, however, made subject to agreement on three items: the

bunkers, the charter party details (for this purpose the New York Produce Exchange –

NYPE – form of charterparty was to be the basis of the negotiations) and approval

from the charterers’ board of directors. In the correspondence these items were

referred to as the ‘subs’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. As soon as it received Southern

Cross’s offer, Oldendorff transmitted it to Pescadores in practically the same

wording. Whilst Southern Cross had made its offer ‘on behalf my close chtrs’,

the first line of Oldendorff’s message read ‘on behalf of POST [the plaintiffs]

am pleased to offer firm as follows for reply in 60 mins’. At the end of its message,

Oldendorff asked Pescadores to let it have the defendants’ closest counter offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. Oldendorff’s message to

Pescadores was sent at about noon on 4 March. Just before 1pm the same day, Oldendorff

sent a message to Southern Cross reading as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘RE: <i>EVER WEALTHY</i>/POST</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">FURTHER TELECON OWNERS ACCEPT CHRS LAST.

  PLSE RUSH CHRS DTLS FOR OWNERS CONFIRMATION.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">AWAIT YOURS.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">BEST REGARDS’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Southern Cross and the plaintiffs regarded

this message as an acceptance of the plaintiffs’ offer and therefore considered that

the main terms of the charterparty had been fixed subject to agreement on the three

‘subs’ relating to the details, the bunkers and the plaintiffs’ board

approval. There is, however, no document in the file from the defendants to Pescadores or

from Pescadores to Oldendorff confirming the acceptance of the plaintiffs’ offer. The

defendants’ stand is that they never accepted the plaintiffs’ offer and that

Oldendorff’s acceptance was sent without authority or confirmation from them. The

defendants say further that it is clear from the correspondence between the parties that

there was no firm fixture for the following reasons:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) the vessel was not clean fixed in that

  the ‘sub’ on bunkers was never lifted;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the plaintiffs and defendants did not

  reach a consensus on the issue of the vessel’s laycan;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) the plaintiffs did not submit a valid

  performance guarantee to the defendants and therefore did not comply with a condition

  precedent imposed by the defendants for a firm fixture.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. To continue the narrative, that same

day Southern Cross sent a copy of the plaintiffs’ proforma charterparty document to

Oldendorff and also informed the latter that the plaintiffs were lifting their

‘sub’ on board approval so that the only ‘subs’ remaining to be

satisfied were those relating to the charterparty details and the bunkers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. On either 4 or 5 March, the defendants

told Oldendorff that they required a letter of guarantee from a Taiwan company to

guarantee the plaintiffs’ performance of the charterparty. On 5 March, a company

called Fantai Shipping Corp (‘Fantai’), the plaintiffs’ Taiwanese agents,

issued a letter of guarantee in favour of the defendants. This letter was delivered to the

defendants by hand but was subsequently returned to Fantai because its wording was not

satisfactory. Corrections were then made to it and the letter was then re-delivered to the

defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. In the meantime, on 5 March Oldendorff

informed Southern Cross that the vessel had been delayed while loading in Jakarta and that

the defendants were requesting whether laycan could be extended to 16 March. The

defendants expected the vessel to be ready on 11 or 12 March. The plaintiffs were unhappy

to receive this request and asked for further information on the vessel’s expected

arrival date at Zhanjiangang and the amount of cargo on board. Oldendorff relayed this

request to Pescadores and asked it to revert with accurate information soonest so that

Oldendorff could discuss the matter further with the plaintiffs and ‘obtain

extension’. The next day, Pescadores replied giving Oldendorff various details about

the vessel and informing them that its ETA at Zhanjiangang was 9 March.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. On 7 March Southern Cross contacted

Oldendorff seeking the defendants’ reply on the charterparty details. That same day

the defendants sent a telex to Pescadores stating that the charterparty details had been

reviewed and found to be in good order. The same telex also contained details of the

bunkers on board the vessel. Pescadores immediately passed on the information it had

received to Oldendorff and Oldendorff in turn sent the message on to Southern Cross at

about 2.25pm that afternoon.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. By a separate telex sent out on 7

March, Pescadores informed Oldendorff that the defendants required the plaintiffs’

firm acceptance of the charterparty with laycan between 7 and 16 March. They asked for

reply by 4.30pm the same day. The plaintiffs’ response was that they were willing to

agree on an extension of laycan up to and including 13 March on the basis of the

defendants’ prior advice that the vessel should complete discharge by 11 March. They

asked for the defendants’ confirmation that this proposal was in order. The

defendants’ response came in the form of a fax from Pescadores to Oldendorff that

stated ‘… owners have reluctantly agreed 13 March. However, should vessel not

ready by that time, we will treat this charter as null and void’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. Between 9 and 11 March Southern Cross

continued chasing Oldendorff to obtain updates on the position of the vessel from the

defendants. On 11 March, Pescadores informed Oldendorff that the defendants had decided to

berth the vessel and commence discharge on 12 March. They then requested that the

plaintiffs accept 16 March as the cancelling date and asked Oldendorff to ‘advise

charterers’ acceptance [to] enable firm fixture’. The plaintiffs were disturbed

by this news and could not understand why the defendants were berthing the vessel only the

next day. They anticipated further delays and losses to them as a result. Accordingly, on

12 March Southern Cross contacted Oldendorff requesting that the defendants agree to 15

March as the cancelling date instead.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. On 12 March, Southern Cross received

advice from Oldendorff that the vessel had been further delayed. Oldendorff asked whether

the plaintiffs would be willing to take delivery once the vessel had finished discharge at

Zhanjiangang. On 13 March, Southern Cross informed Oldendorff that the plaintiffs had no

choice but to persevere with the vessel despite the delay. The next day Southern Cross, on

the instructions of the plaintiffs, confirmed to Oldendorff that the plaintiffs would

accept the vessel whenever she completed discharge at Zhanjiangang. Oldendorff duly passed

on this information to Pescadores at 11.28am.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. The next communication between

Pescadores and Oldendorff was sent out by the latter at about 5.30pm on 14 March. In it,

Mr Lough advised Mr Chua that he had just spoken to Mr Lan of the defendants who had

advised that he wished for ‘this’ charter fixture to be cancelled. He further

stated that he had advised Mr Lan of the possible consequences of not performing the

fixture and that in any case, for the sake of good order, Pescadores should revert in

writing that the defendants considered the fixture with the plaintiffs to be null and

void. At about the same time, Southern Cross was informing the plaintiffs that they had

received a phone call from Oldendorff to say that the defendants wanted out of the

charter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. Thereafter, the plaintiffs put the

defendants on notice that as far as they were concerned, the defendants were obliged to

deliver the vessel to the plaintiffs under the agreed fixture. On 17 March, Pescadores

sent Oldendorff a message stating that the defendants had not given firm confirmation of

the charter and the fact that the proforma charterparty details had been reviewed and

found to be in order could not be construed as acceptance of the charterparty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. In the meantime, the plaintiffs had

learnt that the vessel had been fixed by the defendants to another charterer, Toko Line,

for a trip from Japan to South East Asia. It turned out that this latter charterparty had

actually been concluded on 13 March. The defendants duly delivered the vessel to Toko Line

rather than to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs subsequently commenced this action and

arrested the vessel in Singapore on 12 April 1997. They now seek to recover damages for

the defendants’ alleged breach of contract.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Issues</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. The issues that arise out of the

foregoing facts are:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) for whom Oldendorff was acting as

  broker;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) whether there was a concluded fixture

  on 7 March 1997 or at any time thereafter;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) if the answer to (ii) is in the

  affirmative, whether the plaintiffs had suffered loss as alleged and quantified.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Oldendorff’s position</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. In the defence, the defendants pleaded

that Oldendorff was not their broker and that at all material times it had no authority to

act on behalf of the defendants. Instead, Pescadores on behalf of the defendants

negotiated the charter of the vessel with Oldendorff acting as chartering broker on behalf

of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs in their reply averred that Oldendorff had, as the

defendants’ broker, dealt with and/or negotiated the charter agreement with Southern

Cross. Alternatively, Oldendorff had the actual and/or apparent and/or ostensible

authority of the defendants to negotiate and/or conclude the charter on behalf of the

defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. The evidence did not establish any

specific appointment by the defendants of Oldendorff as their agent. Mr Lan’s

testimony was that at no time had the defendants appointed Oldendorff to represent them in

the negotiations with the plaintiffs for the charter of the vessel. This testimony was not

shaken in the course of Mr Lan’s cross-examination nor was any documents produced

that could contradict it. Further, the plaintiffs did not produce any evidence of their

own to support their allegation of actual authority. Mr Christopher Mackey, the person in

Southern Cross who conducted the negotiations on the plaintiffs’ behalf, admitted

that he had not seen anything in writing from the defendants that appointed Oldendorff as

their brokers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26. It appears that the plaintiffs assumed

that Oldendorff was acting for the defendants because of Mr Mackey’s prior knowledge

of the connection between the two companies. When he was asked the basis on which he

concluded that Oldendorff was the defendants’ broker, he stated that he was aware

that Oldendorff had previously fixed the charter of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> to other

charterers in Australia. He thought (obviously being unaware of the existence of

Pescadores) that there was no other broker between Oldendorff and the defendants and he

was also aware, prior to commencing negotiations through Oldendorff, that Oldendorff had

itself chartered the <i>Ever Forest</i> from the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27. There is no proof either that

Oldendorff had ostensible authority to bind the defendants. Ostensible authority can only

be inferred if it is shown (a) that a relevant representation was made by the principal,

in this case, the defendants, and (b) that the plaintiffs entered into the contract on the

faith of the representation. Here, requirement (a) was not fulfilled. Neither the

defendants nor Pescadores on behalf of the defendants made any representation to Southern

Cross or the plaintiffs that Oldendorff had authority to negotiate and/or conclude a

charter of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> on behalf of the defendants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28. Whilst Oldendorff was not shown to

have been acting generally for the defendants, nor was it shown to have been acting for

the plaintiffs. Their position was that their only broker was Southern Cross and there was

no evidence to contradict this assertion. Secondly, although Oldendorff, in their message

of 4 March 1997 to the defendants, may have stated ‘on behalf of POST am pleased to

offer firm …’ this representation on its part that it was acting for the

plaintiffs could not bind the plaintiffs. As stated earlier, for Oldendorff to have

ostensible authority to act for any particular principal there must have been a

representation from that principal that Oldendorff was its agent. Like the defendants, the

plaintiffs did not make any representation that Oldendorff was their broker.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29. It appears to me that Oldendorff was

in fact acting for itself alone. Mr Mackey explained that there could be independent

brokers involved in a charterparty fixture negotiation. He said that there could be more

than two brokers in the chain of communication and that if in such a chain there was an

exclusive broker for the owner and an exclusive broker for the charterer, then the

intermediate brokers would not be working for anyone but themselves. They would be part of

the chain of communication and their role would be to pass on information one way and then

back the other.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30. In this case, Oldendorff did not act

simply as a post box. Mr Lough did not pass on verbatim to Pescadores every message sent

to him by Southern Cross. Further, he did not send Pescadores all messages received by him

from Southern Cross. In some cases, Oldendorff edited messages received from Southern

Cross before despatching them to Pescadores. The defendants may, therefore, have got the

initial impression that Oldendorff were the plaintiffs’ brokers. This, however, did

not stop Mr Lan of the defendants from talking to Mr Lough on a regular basis and

discussing the charterparty negotiations with him and it is probable that as a result of

these conversations, Mr Lan was aware that Oldendorff was not the plaintiffs’ broker

but had been involved in the negotiations on its own behalf.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31. The plaintiffs’ case would have

been made easier had they been able to establish that when Oldendorff wrote to them on 4

March 1997 stating that the defendants had accepted their offer on the charter of the

vessel, Oldendorff was the defendants’ broker. The fact that I have found that

Oldendorff was not the defendants’ broker does not, however, mean that

Oldendorff’s message of 4 March 1997 was not binding on the defendants. It would

still be binding on them if it had been sent with their specific authority. Such authority

could have been given by way of a letter or orally. No such letter was produced and there

was no evidence that such a letter had ever existed. The plaintiffs argued, however, that

authority to accept their offer was probably given to Mr Lough by Mr Lan in a telephone

conversation that day.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32. In Mr Lan’s affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, there was no mention of any telephone conversation, either on 4 March

or on any other date during the material period, between him and Mr Lough. The impression

given by the affidavit was that Mr Lan had dealt solely with Mr Chua of Pescadores in

relation to the proposed charter of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>. His references to the events

of 4 March were references only to written messages sent by Oldendorff to Pescadores and

to conversations that he had with Mr Chua. In para 6 of his affidavit, Mr Lan stated that

Oldendorff had in its fax of 4 March to Pescadores identified itself as representing the

plaintiffs because the fax stated that Oldendorff was making an offer to charter <i>Ever

Wealthy</i> on behalf of POST. In para 7 Mr Lan went on to say that as Mr Chua and he were

unfamiliar with the plaintiffs, Oldendorff sent a second fax on 4 March and provided some

information about the intended charterers. Mr Lan noted that the company was new and

therefore, on his instructions, Mr Chua informed Mr Lough that any fixture would be

conditional upon the charterers providing a performance guarantee from a third party. Mr

Lan could not recall the exact date of his conversation with Mr Chua but said it would

have been on either 4 or 5 March 1997.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33. During cross-examination Mr Lan was

asked whether he knew how Mr Chua had informed Mr Lough about the requirement for a

guarantee. His answer was no. He was asked to point out to the court any document in the

agreed bundle which mentioned that provision of a letter of guarantee was one of the

conditions. He replied he could not do this but he had instructed Mr Chua to tell Mr Lough

about it because the plaintiff company was unknown and was too new and too small to

charter the defendants’ valuable vessel. Mr Lan then went on to say that Mr Lough

asked for his help over the telephone and he told Mr Lough that if any Taiwanese company

could guarantee the performance of the plaintiffs, he would accept them. Later in his

cross-examination Mr Lan stated that after Mr Lough had sent out the plaintiffs’ firm

offer, he had asked Mr Lough who the plaintiffs were and told him that the defendants

wanted a guarantee. He confirmed the conversation took place on 4 March itself but

asserted it was not within the 60 minutes mentioned in the offer. He was then asked how

long it took him to speak to Mr Lough after the defendants received the firm offer. His

reply was ‘I can’t remember. James Lough told me there is a possibility like

this. I asked who is the charterer. Therefore when Mr Lough gave me the firm offer I told

him to give me the background of the charterers’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34. After listening to Mr Lan’s

evidence in the box, it was clear that the defendants had not been completely forthcoming

in their previous accounts of the circumstances in which Oldendorff had sent out its

message to Southern Cross on 4 March stating that the defendants had accepted the

plaintiffs’ firm offer. The impression given by the pleadings and the affidavit

evidence was that there was no contact between the defendants and Oldendorff and that

Oldendorff had for some mysterious reason of its own sent out the acceptance without any

input from the defendants. That picture changed substantially once Mr Lan admitted that he

had had more than one conversation with Mr Lough on the vital day, 4 March, itself. It

then appeared to me that there was a distinct possibility that during one of these

conversations Mr Lan could have told Mr Lough that he was prepared to accept the

plaintiffs’ offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35. There are other circumstances which

indicate this may have been so. First, according to Mr Lan, he often spoke to Mr Lough

during the period from 4 March to 12 March 1997. Bearing in mind that the defendants

already had Pescadores involved in the matter on their behalf, the fact that Mr Lan chose

to go directly to Mr Lough at various points during the negotiations shows that the

relationship between Oldendorff and the defendants was a fairly close one. It is therefore

possible that Mr Lan would have told Mr Lough over the phone that he was willing to accept

the plaintiffs’ main terms and that Mr Lough would have acted on the oral

communication without waiting for written confirmation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36. Secondly, according to Mr Lan himself,

the defendants often did business by telephone and did not need to send letters whether by

fax or otherwise in order to confirm contracts. He went on to say that Mr Chua was the

defendants’ general agent and could make any business on their behalf through a

telephone conversation. It was only when the defendants were dealing with unknown,

unreliable charterers that they needed to confirm a fixture by fax. He went on, however,

to qualify this evidence by stating that if there was a final fixture made by Mr Chua, he

would send the defendants a fax to confirm it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37. Thirdly, the defendants did not deny

that they had given direct instructions in this case to Oldendorff on amendments to the

main terms of the charterparty. Mr Lan confirmed during cross-examination that on 5 March

he had requested that the laycan be changed to 16 March because the vessel had been

delayed. He had made this request directly to James Lough and had not used Pescadores for

this purpose. There is no letter in the bundle from the defendants to Oldendorff on this

issue so the instruction must have been given verbally by Mr Lan to Mr Lough.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38. Fourthly, Oldendorff’s telex to

Southern Cross accepting the plaintiffs’ offer on behalf of the defendants was sent

out at 12.55pm. In the same telex, Oldendorff asked Southern Cross to rush

charterers’ details for owners’ confirmation. That afternoon at about 2.44pm

Oldendorff sent a fax to Pescadores which began ‘Further telcon many thanks your

last. Will revert with chrs subs asap mtime please advise ref bunkers rob …’ and

continued by giving Pescadores full details of the charterers and their key executives.

The first line of this message as quoted above in fact meant ‘Further telephone

conversation many thanks your last. Will revert with charterers’ subjects as soon as

possible. Meantime please advise reference bunkers remaining on board’. It appears to

me that the reference to the charterers’ subjects in this message only makes sense on

the basis that the plaintiffs’ offer of main terms had been agreed and thus all

parties were concentrating on clearing the subjects as soon as possible in order to

complete the fixture. If the offer had not been accepted, there would have been no need to

discuss the subjects.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39. Having considered all the

circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that, more probably than not, Mr Lan must

have told Mr Lough during one of their telephone conversations on 4 March that he was

prepared to accept the main terms of the plaintiffs’ offer. It also seems improbable

to me that without any input at all from the defendants or Pescadores, Oldendorff would of

its own accord have accepted the plaintiffs’ offer on the defendants’ behalf.

There was no reason for Oldendorff to put itself in the line of fire by doing this without

any idea of the defendants’ reaction to the proposal. Oldendorff was both a broker

and a charterer with an existing relationship with the defendants and no one has suggested

any credible reason why Oldendorff should want to jeopardise that relationship by sending

out an unauthorised acceptance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Whether there was a concluded fixture

between the plaintiffs and the defendants</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40. Given my findings as stated above, on

the afternoon of 4 March 1997, the position was that the parties had agreed on a

charterparty of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> to the plaintiffs on the basis that the vessel

would be delivered to the plaintiffs after it departed from Zhanjiangang for a voyage of

between 70 and 80 days trading between ports in the Far East, South East Asia and

Australia at a daily hire of US$5,000 per day payable every 15 days in advance. The laycan

for delivery was between 7 and 11 March. The charterparty was not yet firm as the

plaintiffs’ offer, as is usual in this type of negotiation, had been made subject to

further agreement on three items ie the charterparty details, the bunkers and board

approval from the plaintiffs’ board. Notwithstanding the need to negotiate further on

the three items, as Captain Wan of the plaintiffs testified, all the main terms as shown

in the plaintiffs’ offer had been agreed and could not be altered thereafter except

by mutual agreement. The laycan period was one of the main terms and, as such, on 4 March

it was fixed as per the plaintiffs’ offer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Board approval and charterparty

details</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41. The first subject to be lifted was

that relating to the plaintiffs’ board approval. This happened on 4 March itself at

about 6.30pm as was indicated in a message from Southern Cross to Oldendorff at that time.

On 7 March, the defendants sent a fax to Pescadores stating that the charterparty details

had been reviewed and found to be in good order. The same fax contained information about

the cost and quantity of the bunkers. Pescadores immediately passed this information on to

Oldendorff who sent it on to Southern Cross. By 7 March therefore, the ‘sub’ on

charterparty details had been resolved. The defendants did argue that stating that the

details had been found to be in good order was not the same as confirming or accepting the

details. I have no hesitation in rejecting this argument. The defendants were trying to

make a point of semantics with no real substance. I believe that all parties understood

that when the defendants said that the charterparty details were in good order, they meant

that the terms proposed were acceptable to them and that they had no counter proposals to

make on any of the terms. This must be so since the defendants had by then received the

proforma NYPE form with all amendments the plaintiffs required to be made indicated on the

document.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Bunkers</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42. The issue that remains is whether the

subject on bunkers was also resolved on 7 March. In order to resolve this issue, it is

necessary first to decide what exactly the subject on bunkers meant. The plaintiffs say

that the subject on bunkers was intended to refer only to the quantity of the bunkers

expected to be on board the vessel at the time it was delivered to them. They point to the

wording of this clause ie ‘SUB BUNKERS: PLS ADV QTY ROB (ie remaining on board)’

and say that it was the plaintiffs’ subject in that it was a condition imposed by the

plaintiffs prior to an agreement. If the plaintiffs as charterers were concerned with the

price of bunkers at delivery, they would have phrased the bunker clause to read ‘sub

bunkers: please advise quantity remaining on board and price’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43. The defendants, however, say that the

intention of this subject was to obtain agreement from both parties on both the price and

the quantity of bunkers. It is the defendants’ case that the subject on bunkers was

not lifted on 7 March or at all since the price of bunkers was not agreed. In support of

their contention, they point to cl 9 of the proforma charterparty which as far as relevant

reads:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘9. <u>Bunkers</u></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The Charterers on delivery, and

  the Owners on redelivery, shall take over and pay all fuel and diesel remaining on board

  the Vessel as hereunder. The Vessel shall be delivered with ______ metric tons of fuel at

  the price of _______ per ton; ______ tons of diesel oil at the price of _____ per ton; to

  be redelivered with about the same quantity as on delivery. Cost of bunkers on delivery to

  be paid to Owners together with first hire.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Since both the price and the quantity of

the bunkers had to be inserted in cl 9 in order to complete it, the defendants say that

the parties had to agree on both these items and that was what was intended by the subject

on bunkers. Further, correspondence from Southern Cross to Oldendorff after 4 March asked

for the defendants’ response on both price and quantity of bunkers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44. The defendants also rely on the oral

evidence of their witnesses. Mr Lan said that the subject on bunkers meant that the

parties would have to negotiate the delivery and redelivery ports and the price and

quantity of bunkers on delivery and redelivery. Mr Chua echoed this by saying that the

whole phrase ‘sub bunkers: please advise quantity remaining on board’ meant that

the charterers and the owners had to negotiate on the quantity and price to be paid on

delivery and the quantity, price and quality of bunkers on redelivery.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45. The defendants pointed out that on 7

March 1997 they had advised the plaintiffs of the quantity of bunkers and their prices.

They quoted US$115 per metric ton for fuel oil and US$213 per metric ton for diesel oil.

This advice constituted an offer to the plaintiffs and the subject on bunkers could not be

lifted until the plaintiffs had agreed to it. The plaintiffs did not respond to the

information on the prices of bunkers until 12 March 1997 when, at the plaintiffs’

request, Oldendorff asked Pescadores whether the owners would accept US$105 per metric ton

for fuel oil and US$205 per metric ton for diesel oil. This was a counter offer which the

defendants had not responded to by the time they decided to call off negotiations with the

plaintiffs. It is clear therefore that if the subject on bunkers referred to both quantity

and price, no agreement was reached on it before the defendants walked away from the

charter. In this scenario, there would have been no concluded charter agreement and the

defendants would have been entitled to act as they did.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46. The plaintiffs’ evidence,

however, was that the price of the bunkers was of secondary importance to them. The reason

why the bunkers were made a subject of the plaintiffs’ offer was that they desired to

protect themselves because they were taking delivery of the vessel outside a Chinese port

for a fairly lengthy voyage involving long runs to South East Asian and Australian ports.

Making the fixture subject to the quantity of bunkers on board the vessel at the time of

delivery would ensure that the plaintiffs knew before committing themselves to it what

quantity of bunkers they themselves would have to supply to the vessel and at what stage

of the voyage those bunkers would be required. According to Mr Mackey, no charterer in his

experience would ever fix a ship without knowing the quantity of bunkers that owners

expected would be remaining on board at the time of delivery. He explained that even at an

early stage of negotiations owners would be able to estimate fairly accurately the

quantity of bunkers that would remain on board at time of delivery because the owners

would know exactly what quantity of bunkers the vessel would consume in the ordinary

course of the voyage up to the time of delivery.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47. The quantity of bunkers remaining on

board the vessel at delivery would be very important to the plaintiffs as charterers

because they would need to arrange for bunkers supplies to the vessel during the course of

the charter and, depending on the voyage concerned, it may be that bunkers could be

difficult and/or expensive to supply during the initial stage of the voyage. In contrast,

the plaintiffs asserted the price of the bunkers was of secondary importance to them as

charterers (and even to the owners) because at delivery the charterers would pay for the

bunkers at prices quoted by the owners and on redelivery, when the charterers were

supposed to return the ship with about the same amount of fuel on board as it had had when

they took it over, the charterers would receive payment for the bunkers on board at the

same price as that paid by them on delivery. The charterers would not make a loss because

even if bunker prices fell after delivery, they would still be entitled to receive the

same price on redelivery. Mr Lan during cross-examination agreed that the same sum paid by

the charterers for bunkers at delivery and that paid by owners on redelivery were

substantially the same.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48. The plaintiffs’ position was once

the defendants had given them the requested information on the quantity of bunkers

estimated to be on board on delivery via the message of 7 March they were satisfied with

the situation and accordingly the subject on bunkers was lifted. They explained away their

subsequent messages to Oldendorff asking for updates on the bunker position by saying that

as an owner could only give an estimated figure for the bunkers remaining on board and the

consumption rate of the bunkers might vary depending on the activities of the ship, the

bunker figure could vary before delivery and therefore they needed to be updated on the

position frequently. Whilst this seems a rather feeble explanation, I note that throughout

the correspondence from 8 March onwards on this issue and on the defendants’ various

requests for change of the laycan, the charterers’ position was consistent with an

attitude that the vessel had been fixed and that there was no reservation on their part

with regard to taking the vessel. Their concern at all times was to get it on hire as

quickly as possible as they were being pressed by their shippers. In fact, they were

pressed so hard that eventually they informed Oldendorff that they were prepared to lift

their previous deadlines and take the vessel when it reached the outer pilot station at

Zhanjiangang whenever that might be.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49. The defendants’ insistence that

the subject on bunkers referred to both price and quantity was not entirely supported by

their evidence. First, although Mr Lan claimed that the price of bunkers was of utmost

importance, he had to admit under cross-examination that the sum paid for bunkers at

redelivery was substantially the same as that the plaintiffs would pay at delivery. The

implication of this admission was that the price was a neutral matter. Secondly, although

he asserted that the ‘sub’ on bunkers meant a negotiation on the redelivery

port, he had to concede during cross-examination that the defendants had not taken up the

issue of an appropriate redelivery port after 4 March but had simply accepted the

description proposed by the plaintiffs in the proforma charterparty. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50. Thirdly, the defendants’ dealings

with Toko Line, the party to whom they chartered the vessel on 13 March, where again the

price and quantity of bunkers were to be the same on delivery and redelivery, show that in

such a situation the price was not regarded as significant. The issue of bunkers in this

case was not settled between the defendants and Toko Line as cl 9 of the fixture

recapitulation issued in respect of this charter stated ‘Bunkers: to be negotiated

later’. In a subsequent fixture note for the same charter, cl 9 read ‘Bunkers:

to be nego later. Bunkers to as on board on delivery. And on redelivery to be about same

quantity as on delivery. Bunkers price to be charterer’s actual price’. During

cross-examination, it was pointed out to Mr Lan this clause stated that bunkers were to be

negotiated later. Mr Lan agreed. He was then asked whether he considered the vessel to be

fixed even though cl 9 provided for later negotiation on bunkers. His answer to that

question was, ‘yes’. This evidence was completely contradictory to his earlier

statement that once a charter negotiation contained the words ‘sub bunkers’

these meant that price, quality and quantity of the bunkers had to be agreed between the

parties and if all these items were not settled there would be no fixture. It should also

be noted that the issue of the quality of bunkers was not pursued by the defendants in

their closing submissions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51. Another indication that the issue of

bunkers was not as important to the defendants as they made it out to be was the fact that

they did not bring it up when they first informed the plaintiffs in March 1997 that there

was no existing charterparty agreement. This issue was not pleaded in the defence either

and was only raised by the defendants some two years into the proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52. On balance, I accept the

plaintiffs’ submission that the subject on bunkers was put forward by them in order

to ascertain the quantity that would be on board on delivery and that once this quantity

had been told to them it was up to the plaintiffs to indicate dissatisfaction otherwise

the subject on bunkers would be fulfilled. Accordingly, as the information on quantity was

given to the plaintiffs on 7 March and at no time thereafter did the plaintiffs reject

that information or state that it was insufficient to satisfy their subject on bunkers, as

at 7 or at the latest 8 March the subject on bunkers must be deemed to have been lifted.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) The guarantee</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53. The issue of a guarantee of the

plaintiffs’ obligations was not mentioned in Oldendorff’s telex of 4 March

accepting the plaintiffs’ offer on the main terms. Indeed, right up to 14 March when

Oldendorff informed Southern Cross that the defendants did not wish to proceed with the

charter, the requirement that the plaintiffs provide a guarantee to the defendants was not

referred to in any of the correspondence. It was Mr Lan’s evidence, however, that

when he spoke to Mr Lough on 4 March, he told the latter that he needed a guarantee from a

Taiwanese company if he was to accept the charter since he did not know the plaintiff

company. Mr Lan also said that when he was told by Mr Chua that the guarantee would be

provided by Fantai Shipping Corporation of Taiwan he found the proposed guarantor to be

accepted as he had known its president, Mr Rando Lee, for many years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54. The fact that the plaintiffs made

immediate arrangements to procure a guarantee in favour of the defendants from a Taiwanese

guarantor as requested shows that they accepted that provision of the guarantee was a

condition of the charterparty to be complied with by them. The defendants alleged that the

plaintiffs were in breach of this condition because the guarantee which Fantai provided

was not valid. In their final submissions, they asserted the invalidity arose because the

guarantee referred to a trip time charterparty dated 5 March 1997 and no such charterparty

actually existed. Thus, there was no concluded charter. The implication of this submission

is that the provision of the guarantee was a condition precedent to the conclusion of the

charterparty.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">55. There are two answers to the

defendants’ submission. First, it is not at all clear from the negotiations that the

provision of the guarantee was supposed to be a condition precedent to the conclusion of

the charterparty. The defendants could easily have made it so by sending a reply to the

plaintiffs’ offer which stated that their acceptance was subject to the guarantee.

They did not. Secondly, I have found that Mr Lan instructed Mr Lough that the defendants

accepted the plaintiffs’ offer on the main details. That being so, he cannot have

made the provision of the guarantee a condition precedent. At most, he made it a

fundamental obligation of the plaintiffs, breach of which would have entitled him to

repudiate the charter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">56. Going on the basis that the provision

of the guarantee was a fundamental term of the contract, the next issue is whether the

plaintiffs actually provided a valid guarantee. The facts are that the first letter of

guarantee which was sent by Fantai to the defendants was not acceptable to them and

therefore was returned to Fantai for corrections. The plaintiffs called Mr Rando Lee of

Fantai to give evidence and he stated that when he was told that the letter of guarantee

needed to be corrected, he discussed the necessary corrections with the defendants and

sent the corrected letter back to the defendants on 10 March 1997. The defendants did not

adduce any evidence to rebut Mr Lee’s contention that they had agreed to the wording

of the corrected guarantee and Mr Lee’s testimony to this effect was not challenged

by them. The corrected letter of guarantee was received by the defendants before 12 March

1997. If it was invalid because of a mistake in the dating of the charterparty the

defendants had time in which to ask for further corrections to be made. No amendments were

sought by them and their later conduct showed they did not regard the guarantee to be

lacking in force.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">57. The defendants did not take a

consistent position regarding the guarantee. Their final submission on the invalidity of

the guarantee was based on para 8 of Mr Lan’s affidavit where he asserted that the

guarantee was not valid because it referred to a trip charterparty dated 5 March 1997

which had never existed. Earlier, however, the defendants had taken a different position.

On 19 March 1997, they had sent a fax to Fantai objecting to Fantai’s purported

repudiation of its obligations under the letter of guarantee and stating that those

obligations would only be released after full settlement of any disputes or claims raised

by the plaintiffs. At that stage, the defendants had obviously considered the guarantee to

be a valid one.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">58. Mr Lan was asked during

cross-examination whether he agreed that the position taken in the fax of 19 March 1997

was different from that taken in court. His reply was incomprehensible. First he said that

the two positions were the same and then he went on to explain that there was something

‘behind’ his letter to Fantai. He said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">‘This company’s [Fantai’s]

  business cannot be the guarantee. The letter is illegal in Taiwan. They told me they can

  be the guarantor misleading me to the dispute with [the plaintiffs]. Therefore I

  don’t return to them because even if I win the case, my vessel already arrested by

  [the plaintiffs] for two days. I have the right to claim from Fantai in Taiwan. They gave

  me an illegal document.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The alleged illegality of the letter of

guarantee was not supported by any evidence adduced by the defendants nor did the

defendants make a point of it in their closing submissions. Further, no evidence was

adduced by them to support the contention that a mistake as to the date of the

charterparty (which was not surprising given the defendants’ insistence on a speedy

issue of that document) would invalidate the whole guarantee under Taiwanese law and/or

make it impossible for them to enforce it against Fantai if the plaintiffs had defaulted

in their charterparty obligations.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">59. In any case, the defendants appeared

to have seen some value in the letter of guarantee since in March 1997 they refused to

return it to Fantai. It would have served no purpose for them to hold on to an invalid

document. Further, according to the defendants, there was never a concluded charterparty

between them and the plaintiffs and as such, since the indemnity given by Fantai in the

guarantee was to indemnify the defendants for any losses that they may suffer due to the

non-performance and/or default of the plaintiffs under the charterparty, if the

charterparty never came into effect, neither did the guarantee. The letter of guarantee

did not allow the defendants to claim under it if the charterparty was not concluded. If

the defendants regarded the letter of guarantee as binding at any time, then at that time

they must also have considered the charterparty to be binding. What the defendants seemed

to be implying by their fax of 19 March 1997 to Fantai was that they would invoke their

rights under the guarantee if the plaintiffs were able to raise a successful claim for

their repudiation of the charterparty. Nothing else would explain why they continued to

hold on to the guarantee thereafter and even up to the date of trial. Certainly no

rational reason for doing so was given by Mr Lan.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">60. I therefore hold that the plaintiffs

duly fulfilled their obligation to provide a guarantee from a Taiwanese company and that

the defendants are not entitled to repudiate their obligations under the charterparty for

non-fulfilment of that condition.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Other observations</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">61. In their written submissions, both

parties laid a lot of emphasis on the issue of the agreed laycan dates if any. I have not

discussed that issue in any great detail here as I think it is redundant in the light of

my finding that the main terms were agreed on 4 March 1997. The main terms included the

laycan. The correspondence that took place thereafter must therefore be considered to be

attempts by the defendants to change the agreed laycan. These attempts were successful to

some extent in that the plaintiffs were so desperate to get the vessel that they agreed to

a change in the laycan and although initially they rejected the final change requested by

the defendants in the end they were willing not to impose a deadline for the vessel’s

delivery but to take it whenever it was free. This agreement was indicated to the

defendants on the morning of 14 March and could be construed as an acceptance of the

defendants prior request for laycan to be extended to 16 March as by then it was obvious

the vessel would not be free any earlier than 16 March. So if not before there was

agreement on the laycan before the defendants discarded the fixture.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">62. I must also mention that I found Mr

Lan to be a most unsatisfactory witness. Most of his testimony was given in English and

although his grammar was not particularly good, he was fluent and able to answer most of

the questions in English and at some length. Occasionally, though, he had recourse to the

assistance of a Mandarin-speaking interpreter. Given his facility in the language as a

whole, it appeared to me that he only needed help from an interpreter when he found a

particular question difficult and wanted some time in which to consider his answer.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">63. The plaintiffs submitted that Mr

Lan’s evidence on critical points was self-serving and shifted wherever he perceived

his case to be. There was some force in that submission. He certainly did not come across

as a forthright and candid witness. His evidence was particularly unsatisfactory in

relation to the defendants’ negotiations with the alternative charterer Toko Line.

Further, he insisted on maintaining that he had informed Mr Lough on 12 March 1997 that he

wished to break off negotiations with the plaintiffs although the correspondence that took

place between that date and 14 March 1997 showed that Oldendorff did not learn of the

defendants’ intentions until 14 March 1997. His evidence flies in the face of the

very clear statement in Mr Lough’s fax to Mr Chua at 5.24pm on 14 March that he had

‘just spoken to James Lan and was advised he wishes for this charter fixture to be

cancelled’. Mr Lan was obviously trying to put the defendants in a better light by

showing that they were free of the plaintiffs by the time they concluded their charter

with Toko Line. The truth seems to be that they were not willing to break off with the

plaintiffs until they had Toko Line committed and once that happened, Mr Lan was willing

to renege on his contractual obligation to the plaintiffs because Toko Line was a well

known and reputable company and the plaintiffs were strangers to him.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The defendants have submitted that the

plaintiffs are not entitled to recover any of the above items as they have not proved them

adequately. I will take each item in turn.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Loss of profits</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">65. The plaintiffs have quantified their

loss of profits by calculating that if the charter had taken place they would have earned

a total of US$663,617 as freight for cargo carried between the various ports of the

intended voyage and as against that they would have incurred expenses of US$523,153

leaving them a net profit of US$140,464. The details of these calculations are set out in

a costing projection prepared by Captain Wan on or about 13 March 1997 and annexed as an

exhibit to his supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">66. The defendants submitted that there

was no causal connection between their breach of contract and the plaintiffs’ alleged

loss. They relied on the fact that by Captain Wan’s evidence it appeared that the

plaintiffs had started booking cargoes for the intended voyage as early as a month before

its intended commencement. By so doing, the plaintiffs they said, bore the commercial risk

of things going wrong for example if they were unable to find a vessel to carry the

cargoes. Thus the breach of contract was not the effective cause of the plaintiffs’

loss. I am not able to accept that argument.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">67. As the plaintiffs submitted, it is

often necessary for charterers to open bookings for cargo prior to the intended voyage so

that they will know what type and size of vessel is required and also the profitability of

the intended voyage. Secondly, the fact that the plaintiffs here started looking for cargo

a month or so before fixing the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> does not mean that their loss was not

due to the defendants’ default. Once the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> was fixed, the

plaintiffs would have organised their schedules around that vessel and would have ceased

their efforts to find another vessel to carry the cargo that they had managed to book.

When the defendants failed to deliver the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> the plaintiffs had to start

looking for a carrier from scratch and many of their shippers were not willing to wait

till they found one. As Captain Wan testified, they lost cargo as a result of the

defendants’ default and in my judgment, as long as they were able to prove that this

cargo had been fixed with them and was intended to be shipped on the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>

they would be entitled to recover for damages sustained when that shipment could not take

place. As far as the quantum of damages recoverable is concerned, this would have to be

calculated based on the proved freight rates as against the proved expenses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">68. According to Captain Wan, the

following cargoes were booked with the plaintiffs to be loaded on the vessel:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">69. The defendants challenged the

plaintiffs’ assertion that they had the cargo listed above fixed for loading on the

vessel. This was because in many cases the plaintiffs were unable to produce documents

evidencing the fixture and/or the freight rate applicable. It should be noted, however,

that on 11 March 1997, the plaintiffs had sent detailed loading and sailing instructions

to the master of the vessel. These instructions mentioned all the loading and discharging

ports and all the cargoes which are set out in the table in para 69. It therefore provides

some circumstantial evidence that at the material time the plaintiffs expected to load

those cargoes on the <i>Ever Wealthy.</i></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">70. The plaintiffs’ problem is that

in respect of many of the shipments they had no documentation other than the letter of

instructions to the master to indicate that the cargo referred to in those shipments would

actually be loaded on the vessel. The plaintiffs explained that this was because many

fixtures were concluded by telephone. They also said that they were not able to call the

parties who had made those fixtures with them because it would have cost them an amount

that would have been unreasonable in the circumstances and/or would have led to delay.

Such difficulties might help in the admission of documents but they provide no help when

it comes to establishing an oral contract. The plaintiffs have the burden of proving the

existence of legally enforceable contracts for the shipment of these various cargoes and

this can only be done by the production of the contract document, where it is written, or

the other party to the contract, where the contract was made verbally. If no such evidence

is made available to the court, then the court has no basis on which to find that such

contracts existed notwithstanding the circumstantial evidence of the plaintiffs’

belief that the persons with whom they dealt were actually going to ship with them. Due to

the differing evidential positions with regard to the various shipments, it is necessary

to deal with each shipment in turn in order to see whether the plaintiffs have succeeded

in establishing the existence of the relevant contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 1</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">71. This shipment involved 1,000 cubic

metres of timber from Port Kelang. The freight rate was US$62 per cubic metre. In support

of the shipment, the plaintiffs produced the copy of a liner booking note between

themselves and a company called Scan-Trans Shipping &amp; Chartering Sdn Bhd dated 13

March 1997. The defendants’ objection to this was that the other party to the

contract was not called to confirm its issue of the document.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">72. The plaintiffs’ response was that

they had the letter to the master as corroboration of the shipment and that calling their

shipper to Singapore to support their cargo booking would have involved unreasonable

expense as compared to the amount of the cargo booked. They submitted that the court

should admit the booking note as evidence under s 32(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) as

being a statement made in the ordinary course of business. They also relied on the case of

<i>Mohsin Abdullah Alesayi v Brooks Exim Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[1993] 3 SLR 433</nobr> where the court

admitted in evidence certain cash receipts although the party relying on them did not call

the staff members who issued them because those particular persons could not be found at

the time of the trial. Whilst in this case the fixture involved 1,000 tons of cargo and

would have earned the plaintiffs approximately US$62,000 in terms of freight so that the

expense of calling a witness from Malaysia would not have been disproportionate to the

value of the evidence, I note that the plaintiffs had no way of compelling the

witness’ attendance since he was out of the jurisdiction and they had no leverage

with which to persuade a foreign witness to disrupt his normal business to attend a court

case in which he had no interest. In these circumstances, I consider the booking note

admissible under s 32(b) of the Act and therefore that this shipment has been proved.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 2</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">73. This involved the shipment of 500

cubic metres of timber from Port Kelang at US$70 per cubic metre. The name of the shipper

is not known. The plaintiffs were unable to produce any document evidencing this fixture.

It was one of those allegedly made by telephone. The oral evidence of Captain Wan is not

sufficient to prove it because his belief that the cargo would have been loaded had the

vessel called at Port Kelang could not in itself convince the court that the plaintiffs

would have had a legal right to call on the shipper to ship or to claim damages against

them for non-shipment.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">74. This involved a shipment of 813 cubic

metres of timber from Kota Kinabalu at a rate of US$95 per cubic metre. In court Captain

Wan said that this booking was evidenced by a freight statement forwarded to the

plaintiffs by their agent in Kota Kinabalu in respect of cargo shipped on <i>m.v. Zilina</i>.

According to Captain Wan, the <i>m.v. Zilina</i> was the substitute vessel that the

plaintiffs employed for the shipment of some of the cargo that had originally been

intended for the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>. The defendants’ objection to this document was

that it did not relate to the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> and also no one was called to prove it.

I admit this document under s 32(b) of the Act on the same basis as the booking note for

the first shipment. I also accept that this document establishes the booking and the

freight rate for the third shipment although it refers to the <i>m.v. Zilina</i> because

Captain Wan’s evidence as to his original intentions for this cargo are corroborated

by 11 March letter and in due course the cargo was sent to the original destination for

which it was intended. This booking has been proved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 4</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">75. This shipment involved 783 cubic

metres of timber to be carried from Ternate at a freight rate of US$95 per cubic metre.

The shipper of the cargo was Auspine International Pte Ltd (‘Auspine’). As

evidence of the shipment, the plaintiffs produced a document prepared by the shipper

setting out the details of this cargo that it was intending to ship to Melbourne and

Brisbane by the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> as well as correspondence sent by Auspine to its

shipper in Ternate. The plaintiffs also called Mr Tay Chin Joo who was employed as a

manager by Auspine. He confirmed that he had prepared all the documents in court relating

to the Ternate shipment including the document containing the cargo details. Mr Tay stated

that once his company got the name of the intended carrying vessel, it would prepare a

summary of the cargo to be shipped and fax that summary to its various suppliers to tell

them to load their cargo onto the vessel. The document produced in court had been sent out

by Auspine in March 1997 to its various suppliers of timber in Indonesia to instruct them

to load the parcels of timber onto the <i>Ever Wealthy.</i></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">76. Mr Tay further testified that when the

<i>Ever Wealthy</i> did not arrive, Auspine had looked for a substitute vessel and had

managed to ship one parcel of cargo on that substitute. The rest had been shipped out on

other vessels including a parcel on the <i>m.v. Zilina</i>. The defendants submitted that

I should not accept Mr Tay’s evidence because he did not produce the documents from

his suppliers that he used to prepare his instructions. This argument is specious. Mr Tay

as a representative of the shipper, an independent party, confirmed that the shipper had

agreed to ship shipment no. 4 aboard <i>Ever Wealthy</i> and produced a contemporaneous

document showing how the shipper had acted on that contract. That was all the proof I

required. The defendants also submitted that the freight rate had not been proven as Mr

Tay did not testify on the applicable freight rate. In this respect I accept Captain

Wan’s evidence that the freight for this voyage was the same as that which the

plaintiffs had previously charged Auspine for carriage of timber from Ceram to Melbourne

and Brisbane as evidenced by a freight invoice dated 4 February 1997. The defendants did

not produce any evidence that that was an exorbitant or even an unusual freight rate for

the voyage in question. I therefore find this shipment proved.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 5</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">77. This was another shipment of timber by

Auspine. The port of loading was Ceram. The quantity was 380 cubic metres and the freight

rate was US$95 per cubic metre. In this regard, the plaintiffs produced a letter written

by Mr Tay to his agent in Jakarta informing the latter that the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> would

arrive in Ceram around 30 March to load Auspine’s orders for March shipment. When Mr

Tay was in court, he confirmed preparing this letter and his evidence was not challenged.

I find this shipment proved.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 6</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">78. This was a shipment of 978 metric tons

of steel coils from Inchon to Brisbane at a freight rate of US$70 per metric ton. The

defendants conceded that the booking had been proved by the plaintiffs but argued that the

freight rate had not since none of the documents relied on specified the rate for the

voyage. I notice, however, that the message to the plaintiffs from their booking agents in

Korea confirming the bookings did mention that Dongbu Steel which was the supplier of

steel coils wanted to ship an additional 63 metric tons of this cargo to Brisbane and

would be charged US$65 per metric ton for the same. There is therefore evidence at least

of a freight rate of US$65 per metric ton which I accept. This shipment has been proved at

a rate of US$65 per metric ton. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 7</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">79. This was a shipment of 958 metric tons

of steel coils from Inchon at a rate of US$30 per metric ton. The defendants accept that

the booking was made but quarrel with the rate. Once again, I note that in the booking

agents’ fax of 11 March 1997 to the plaintiffs the agents mentioned a proposed rate

of US$30 per metric ton for this shipment from Inchon to Kuching and asked whether that

rate was correct. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence that that was the correct rate

for that shipment. This shipment has been proved.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 8</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">80. This was a shipment of 1,167 metric

tons of steel products from Kaoshiung at a rate of US$72.40 per metric ton. The plaintiffs

relied on a fax from Fantai dated 13 March confirming the shipment. Mr Rando Lee confirmed

that that fax was from Fantai and that the Mr YH Chen named in it as the sender of the fax

was Fantai’s shipping general manager. He identified the document as being a booking

list sent out for the purpose of booking space on the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>. Under

cross-examination, he was not able to remember whether the plaintiffs had responded to

confirm the booking. The defendants submitted that he was unable to prove the document. I

disagree. Mr Lee’s evidence was sufficient to establish that his company had desired

to ship the particular cargo on board the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> and had booked the space.

There was no evidence that the plaintiffs had not accepted this booking. Indeed, from

their message to the master of the vessel, it was clear that they expected the vessel to

load that cargo in Kaoshiung.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">81. The only problem relates to the

freight rate. There is no documentary evidence on the exact rate charged for this booking

nor was Mr Lee asked about it. Captain Wan’s evidence was that the plaintiffs’

shipping service from Asia to Australia was a service run on a monthly basis from 1991 or

1992 when he was working at Pine Seas Maritime. When Pine Seas stopped that service,

Captain Wan had started the plaintiff company to fill the gap and all agents, customers

and consignees were familiar with the service and the rates charged. He produced documents

showing that in January 1997 he had charged US$75 per metric ton for steel cargo shipped

from Kaoshiung to ports in Australia. I accept the plaintiffs’ evidence. I find it

probable that the rate charged by the plaintiffs for this shipment was the usual rate.

This shipment has been proved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 9</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">82. This was a shipment of a yacht from

Kaoshiung to Sydney. The rate charged was apparently US$45 per cubic metric for 380 cubic

metres. This booking was proved by the same document emanating from Fantai as that related

to the steel cargo. There is, however, no evidence at all on the applicable rate. I

therefore find that the plaintiffs have not proved their loss in respect of this shipment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 10</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">83. This was a shipment of 400 metric tons

of steel coils from Kuching to Australia at a rate of US$65 per metric ton. The shippers

of this cargo were Delta Bond and/or Pacific Sheet &amp; Coil. As proof, the plaintiffs

produced a letter dated 20 February 1997 from Delta Bond stating that Pacific Sheet &amp;

Coil were hoping to have 1,000 metric tons of steel coil available to ship to Australia

from Kuching in March 1997. There was another letter dated 19 March 1997 from Pacific

Sheet &amp; Coil to Delta Bond stating that because of the poor performance of Delta Bond

(ie the non-showing of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>), Pacific Sheet &amp; Coil had 1,800 metric

tons of goods sitting at Inchon and 400 metric tons of goods sitting at Kuching. The

letter also asked whether alternative shipping arrangements should be made for the cargo

that had been waiting for the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>. Mr Faulkner of Delta Bond who had sent

out the first letter and received the second was called as a witness and he confirmed

having sent out correspondence to the plaintiffs on behalf of Delta Bond in relation to

shipments by Pacific Sheet &amp; Coil. There was also a letter from the plaintiffs to

Delta Bond for onward transmission to Pacific Steel &amp; Coil explaining that they were

having difficulty trying to get a substitute vessel to carry the 400 metric tons from

Kuching. All in all, I am satisfied that there was a booking for the carriage of this

cargo by the <i>Ever Wealthy</i>. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support the

freight rate charged by the plaintiffs. I therefore hold that the plaintiffs have not

proved their loss.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 11</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">84. This was a shipment of 100 cubic

metres of timber cargo from Kuching at US$95 per cubic metre. There are no documents to

support this shipment. The plaintiffs submitted that Mr Faulkner was called to prove the

shipment but I cannot find anything in his evidence that talks about shipment of timber

from Kuching either in relation to quantity or in relation to rate. Such mention as there

was of timber in Mr Faulkner’s fax of 26 February 1997 appears to have been purely

exploratory. The plaintiffs have not proved this shipment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 12</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">85. This was a shipment of 238 metric tons

of steel pipes at US$65 per metric ton from Kuching for Delta Bond. Once again the

plaintiffs relied on Mr Faulkner’s evidence to prove this booking. Nothing was

mentioned about this shipment in his oral evidence and his letter of 26 February 1997 was

vague with no mention of quantity or rate. The plaintiffs have not proved this shipment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 13</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">86. This was a shipment of 400 metric tons

of drill pipes from Singapore at US$85 per metric ton. No documents were produced to

support this shipment apart from the letter of instruction to the master. Neither was

anyone called to testify that he had made this booking. This shipment has not been proved.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 14</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">87. This was a shipment of 3,000 metric

tons of copper slag from Singapore at the rate of US$22.50 per metric ton. The plaintiffs

produced a copy of an unsigned Gencon charterparty dated 11 March 1997 purportedly made

between Pan Abrasives Pte Ltd as charterers and themselves as disponent owner for the

carriage of this cargo from Singapore to Mackey. They did not call anyone from the

prospective charterers’ office to confirm the fixture had actually been concluded

although that company is a Singaporean company. Captain Wan, who testified that this

document had been prepared by Eastport Shipbrokers in Singapore around 11 March 1997, said

that he had tried to contact the shipbrokers to give evidence. When he called their

office, however, he had been informed that the two gentlemen who had dealt with him were

no longer with Eastport. One of them had gone to Japan and he did not know the whereabouts

of the other one though this latter person was probably a local. It must be noted that the

plaintiffs only tried to contact Eastport on the first day of this trial and, even though

hearing was subsequently adjourned, no further attempts were made to call either Eastport

or anyone from Pan Abrasives to confirm that there had been a concluded charter for the

carriage of the copper slag. The plaintiffs have not proved this charter.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 15</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">88. This was a shipment of 500 cubic

metres of plywood from Jambi at US$80 per cubic metre to be undertaken on behalf of

Auspine. The documents adduced by the plaintiffs and supported by Mr Tay’s evidence

show that this booking was made. As for the freight rate, although there is nothing in the

documents which directly supports the rate which the plaintiffs say had been agreed, the

documents also show a rate of US$95 per cubic metre for carriage of timber from Ternate to

Australian ports. In view of that, US$80 per cubic metre from Jambi which is further away

from Australia than Ternate would seem reasonable. The plaintiffs have proved this

shipment.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Shipment no. 16</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">89. This is another shipment undertaken on

behalf of Auspine from Ternate. It is of 85 cubic metres of plywood for which the

plaintiffs charged US$65 per cubic metre. This booking was proved by Mr Tay’s

evidence and documents which supported the plaintiffs’ stand. As for the freight

rate, the position is the same as that regarding shipment no. 15. I consider US$65 per

cubic metre reasonable in the circumstances. The plaintiffs have proved their loss.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">91. This means that the plaintiffs have

proved that had the charter of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> proceeded, they would have earned

US$472,045.80 as freight. That would have been their gross income from the charter. The

plaintiffs had, however, also calculated that in order to earn this freight, they would

have had to spend US$523,153. This figure comprised charter hire, cost of fuel, port

charges, loading/discharging costs and various miscellaneous charges. As their admitted

costs exceed their proved income, the plaintiffs have not proved that they would have

suffered any loss of profits by reason of the defendants’ breach of contract.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><font face="Times New Roman">Other items of the plaintiffs’

claim</font></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">92. The next item of the plaintiffs’

claim is US$6,607.37 which they spent in order to send cargoes booked with them on another

vessel from Inchon to Kuching. The substitute vessel was <i>AIS MAMAS</i> and the

plaintiffs produced documents issued by various companies in Korea including their agent

Tai Young Shipping Co., Ltd to substantiate these costs. The defendants object to the sum

on the basis that the plaintiffs have not proved that the original freight rate for this

cargo was US$30 per metric ton. I have, however, accepted the plaintiffs’ evidence in

this regard and the objection therefore has no further weight. I find that the plaintiffs

have proved this item of expense and accordingly award them US$6,607.37. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">93. The plaintiffs also incurred other

costs in relation to the substitute arrangements for the shipment of this cargo comprising

bill of lading surrender fees, courier service charges and booking commission. These total

US$723.67. These expenses were evidenced by a fax dated 28 March from Tai Young Shipping

Co., Ltd to the plaintiffs which said that these were expenses incurred as a result of the

withdrawal of the <i>Ever Wealthy</i> and the non-arrival of the vessel at Inchon. I

accept that document as evidence on the basis of s 32(b) of the Act. Accordingly I award

this sum to the plaintiffs as well.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">94. The next claim is for US$1,000 being

communication costs incurred by the plaintiffs and Southern Cross in communicating with

each other and with Oldendorff and Pescadores. Whilst it is clear from the evidence that

there was a great deal of communication between these various parties, it has to be noted

that the plaintiffs’ claim is for the estimated costs that they incurred and not the

actual costs. As the plaintiffs have not proved what their actual expenditure was on this

item, I cannot award it to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">95. The same objection must be made to the

plaintiffs’ next claim which is for US$1,500 being their estimated communication

costs when they communicated with various port agents regarding space/cargo booking and

the vessel. This estimate has not been substantiated by any bills and must be rejected.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">96. Finally, the plaintiffs wish to

recover US$1,200 as being the fees of their Australian solicitors. They point out that the

defendants did receive a letter of demand from these solicitors and that was clear

evidence of the legal expenses which the plaintiffs incurred by reason of the

defendants’ breach. The plaintiffs have not, however, produced any bill to show

either the exact amount charged by their Australian solicitors or the work for which this

sum was charged. The figure of US$1,200 is far too large to cover simply a letter of

demand. Therefore, the plaintiffs have not proved that the sum claimed relates directly to

the defendants’ breach of contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusion</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">97. In the result, there will be judgment

for the plaintiffs in the sum of US$7,331.04 and interest thereon at 6% per annum from the

date of the writ. As the plaintiffs have not succeeded on the most substantial portion of

their claim, however, some adjustment may have to be made in relation to costs. I will

hear the parties on costs.</font></p>
