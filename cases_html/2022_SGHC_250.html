</div>
</div> As for the issue of mitigation, that rested on disputed facts that ought fairly to be tried in court. It seemed to me that the applicant’s intended claim against the respondent for breach of contract could not be said to be shadowy. In any event, it was not necessary for me to decide whether the applicant was an interested person for purposes of making this application. As explained below, I found no reason to exercise my discretion to void the dissolution of the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether it was proper to void the dissolution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In deciding whether to void the dissolution of a company under s 343(1) of the CA, a court will exercise its discretion carefully and judicially; a winding up ought to be reversed if it is necessary to do so to ensure fairness and justice: <span class="font-italic">Lee Hung Pin </span>at [25]. Not every claim of unfairness, without more, should trigger reversal, though the standard should not be so high as to hinder <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>claimants: <span class="font-italic">Lee Hung Pin </span>at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In this regard, I agreed with the Former Liquidators that a relevant consideration was whether making the order would simply be an exercise in futility. This position is supported by authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Re Kilkenny Engineering Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) </span>(1976) 1 ACLR 285, Wells J observed that in deciding whether to void the dissolution of a company under s 307(1) of the Companies Act 1962–1972 (SA) (which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 343(1) of the CA), the court is entitled to consider whether “if the order sought were to be granted, good use could be made of it, or whether the order would be made in vain” (at 290). Wells J noted that (a) the purpose of the petitioner’s application was to enable it to sue the company, but that there were no assets in the company available for execution; and (b) any writ filed by the petitioner against the company would also be out of time, as the relevant limitation period had lapsed (at 293). Accordingly, Wells J concluded that the order sought by the petitioner would be in vain and dismissed the application (at 295).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Stanhope Pension Trust Ltd and another v Registrar of Companies and another</span> [1994] 1 BCLC 628 (“<span class="font-italic">Stanhope Pension Trust</span>”), the question was whether the dissolution of a company should be voided under s 651(1) of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK) (the “UK CA 1985”) (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 343(1) of the CA). Hoffman LJ noted that “[t]here is usually little point in reviving a company to enable a new claim to be made because … all its assets will have been distributed” (at 630h). Rather, the purpose of an order under s 651(1) of the UK CA 1985 would ordinarily be to enable the liquidator to distribute an asset of the company that had previously been overlooked, or to enable a creditor to obtain a judgment against the company that could be enforced against a third party, such as an insurer (at 632c–e).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the facts of the present case, even if the dissolution of the respondent were to be voided, it would have no assets available to meet the applicant’s intended claim. As stated earlier, the surplus assets of the respondent were distributed to its members on 23 June and 28 July 2020, a few months before the respondent was dissolved on 28 November 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The applicant did not appear to dispute that it would be pointless to make an order voiding the dissolution if the respondent had no assets to meet the applicant’s claim. The applicant tried to make the case that the distributions made to the respondent’s members, in particular Sing Holdings, could be recovered. However, the applicant’s submissions were less than clear, not least because it was changing its submissions during the course of the hearing. Ultimately, the applicant’s submissions appeared to be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 343(1) of the CA, the court could, in addition to declaring the dissolution void, also make orders which have the effect of voiding the distributions made by the Former Liquidators before the respondent was dissolved.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Voiding the dissolution could give rise to a possibility of recovery of the surplus assets that had been distributed to the respondent’s members.

More specifically, the applicant submitted that the court should void the steps taken by the Former Liquidators after April 2020, which would include the distributions made to Sing Holdings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The applicant’s arguments appeared to be as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sing Holdings became aware of the applicant’s claim against the respondent in April 2020 and should have informed the Former Liquidators of the claim.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I disagreed with the applicant. First, in my view, it was clear that I did not have the power under s 343(1) of the CA to make orders which voided or had the effect of voiding actions taken by the Former Liquidators (including the distributions of the surplus assets) before the date of the dissolution. There was simply no basis for the applicant’s arguments. In my view, the phrase “upon such terms as the Court thinks fit” in s 343(1) refers to terms that may be necessary to address the consequences of the dissolution being voided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, the authorities did not support the applicant’s contention that under s 343(1), the court can make an order voiding the distributions that had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Morris v Harris </span>[1927] AC 252, the House of Lords had to construe s 223 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 (c 69) (UK) (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 343 of the CA). Lord Sumner remarked (at 257) that the order referred to in s 223 “is not expressed to be one setting anything aside”. As he explained (at 259):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The object of the provision was, I think, to give a fresh start to proceedings, which owing to the dissolution had been impossible and had not been taken, and thereupon it was to be open to those concerned to take them in the future as if the dissolution had not happened. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">James Smith &amp; Sons (Norwood) Limited v Goodman</span> [1936] Ch 216, Lord Hanworth MR had this to say (at 231) about s 294(1) of the Companies Act 1929 (c 23) (UK) (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 343(1) of the CA):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The effect of such a declaration would be to restore the company to being, but with what result?

The Former Liquidators complied with the applicable rules and placed an advertisement notifying creditors to file their claims. The distributions were made on 23 June 2020 and 28 July 2020, more than six months after the deadline for creditors to file their claims had expired. The Former Liquidators were not aware of the applicant’s claim until 22 February 2022.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">Butler and another v Broadhead and others</span> [1975] Ch 97 (“<span class="font-italic">Butler</span>”), the company went into voluntary liquidation. The liquidator mistakenly conveyed a plot of land (which the company had previously conveyed to someone else) to the plaintiffs. The liquidator then paid the company’s debts and distributed the surplus assets amongst the contributories. The plaintiffs were dispossessed by the original buyer of the land and sued the company’s contributories for such sums overpaid to them by mistake, claiming that sums would otherwise have been available to the plaintiffs as compensation or damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The court struck out the claim. Templeman J held that r 106 of the Companies (Winding up) Rules 1949 (SI 1949 No 330) (UK) (“UK CWU Rules 1949”) applied to distributions to contributories and that under that rule, the plaintiffs were excluded from the benefit of any distribution made before they proved their claims (at 109G, 110D–E). It did not matter whether the creditor’s failure to put in a claim was due to his fault or not (at 110H). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Rule 106(1) of the UK CWU Rules 1949 provides that creditors are to prove their debts or claims on or before the date fixed by the liquidator or “be excluded from the benefit of any distribution made before such debts are proved”. In the present case, the applicable rule was r 91 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (1990 Rev Ed) (“CWU Rules”), which contains language identical to that set out above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In<span class="font-italic"> In</span><span class="font-italic"> re R-R Realisations Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(formerly Rolls-Royce Ltd) </span>[1980] 1 WLR 805, Sir Robert Megarry VC referred to <span class="font-italic">Butler</span> and said (at 810G):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Once the liquidators have duly advertised for creditors, any creditor who could have proved his debt in the liquidation has no claim against any of the assets in the hands of the creditors or the members of the company to whom that distribution has been made.

This was not the case here. Nevertheless, <span class="font-italic">Butler </span>showed that under the insolvency framework, the applicant in the present case would have no claim against the respondent’s members to recover any of the distributions that had been made to them. The applicant’s contention that under s 343(1) of the CA, the court could void those distributions was an attempt to achieve what it could not have achieved by suing the respondent’s members directly. I saw no reason why s 343(1) should be interpreted to allow this. On the contrary, s 343(1) should be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the jurisprudence in <span class="font-italic">Butler</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The applicant had only itself to blame for its failure to file its proof of debt within the timeline stated in the notice advertised by the Former Liquidators.
