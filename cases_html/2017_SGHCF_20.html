The order on ancillary matters was made on 15 July 2016. Time for the filing of a notice of appeal expired on 29 July 2016. The respondent obtained Final Judgment on 1 August 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Judge’s decision included an order that the applicant should transfer one of the properties jointly held by parties (“the Miltonia Property”) to the respondent. The applicant has neither complied with that order nor applied for a stay of execution of that order. In the meanwhile, the respondent is living in rented premises while paying the mortgage and expenses for the Miltonia Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 30 March 2017, I granted the applicant an extension of time, subject to the condition that he was to execute the transfer of the Miltonia Property to the respondent within stipulated timeframes (“the Condition”). The net value of the Miltonia Property accounted for about 17% of the asset pool. The order was made on the premise that, as the Judge’s property division orders concerned a much larger pool of assets, any appellate intervention regarding the property division would proceed on the basis that the transfer of the Miltonia Property had been effected. The applicant did not comply with the Condition. On 6 April 2017, after seeing parties, I granted a further extension of time as requested by counsel for the applicant, Mr Dhanwant Singh (“Mr Singh”). Again, the Condition was not complied with, and again, Mr Singh applied by letter for a further court appointment. I saw parties again on 18 April 2017 and decided not to grant any further extension. The applicant appeals against this decision of 18 April 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Principles for an extension of time to appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The principles for granting an extension of time are not in dispute.

Nevertheless, given the length of the applicant’s delay, the reasons for such delay and the prejudice that would be caused to the respondent, I decided that it would not be appropriate to grant a further extension of time.

I therefore considered the chances of the appeal succeeding in relation to the other categories of orders which the applicant intended to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 There is little merit in the applicant’s appeal against the order that the respondent receive sole care and control of the son. He has not been involved in the son’s life. The son, on his part, furnished a written statement that he wanted nothing to do with the applicant.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 There is also little merit in the applicant’s appeal against the order that he should pay $1,400 per month in maintenance for the son, which sum was reduced to $1,000 by the Judge with effect from April 2017. The applicant contends only that “at the time of the [ancillary matters] hearing, [he] was unemployed”, and that the part-time job that he found thereafter provides an income that is less than double the sum of $1,400.

</div> The applicant accepted that the “Family Court has on 29 March 2017, revised the maintenance to $1,000 commencing from April 2017”, but submitted that the “Court has no powers to revoke the earlier maintenance order or to back-date the present variation order to July 2016.”

</div> By this, the applicant appeared to suggest that the variation of the maintenance order on 29 March 2017 was insufficient to address any prejudice he allegedly suffered by virtue of having to pay maintenance in the sum of $1,400 prior to April 2017. However, in his submissions, the applicant does not refer to any evidence to show that his income is insufficient to provide either $1,000 or the earlier sum of $1,400 in maintenance for the son.

It was not clear that there was merit in the applicant’s appeal on the overall division of the assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Nevertheless, the test being whether the appeal is hopeless (see [7] above), the threshold for this factor was a very low one. While it was not clear that the applicant’s intended appeal had merit, it could not be said that the appeal was hopeless. An appeal would require detailed analysis of the range of factors that a court must consider in ordering the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter. In addition to challenging the global allocation of 59% to the applicant, the applicant may also have appealed against the individual orders made in respect of the various properties within the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In view of the above, it could not be said that the applicant had no prospects at all of succeeding upon appeal. The chances of his appeal succeeding were thus a neutral factor (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Hsien Loong </span>at [19]). However, this neutral factor was to be balanced against the other three factors, all of which weighed against the applicant. I turn now to the length of the delay.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Length of delay</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Procedural history leading to the present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16  Prior to bringing the present application, the applicant had filed a prior application (OSN 20/2016) for an extension of time to appeal against the Judge’s orders on 8 August 2016. This was 10 days after the time period permitted for filing a notice of appeal against the Judge’s ancillary orders had expired on 29 July 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 OSN 20/2016 was not served at the proper address. The court directed the applicant to rectify the error and to file and serve OSN 20/2016 as amended on the respondent by 24 August 2016. The Assistant Registrar also made an unless order requiring the applicant to pay the respondent costs of $600 within three days, failing which OSN 20/2016 would be struck out (“the Unless Order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On 31 August 2016, the court informed the parties that OSN 20/2016 had been struck out because the applicant had failed to pay the costs of $600. On 2 September 2016, the applicant filed an appeal (RAS 38/2016) against the Unless Order without first complying with the order or asking to restore OSN 20/2016. The appeal was dismissed on 13 October 2016, as OSN 20/2016 was no longer before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Subsequently, on 2 November 2016, the applicant filed the present application (OSN 36/2016) seeking leave to file a notice of appeal out of time. The originating summons was later amended, and the amended originating summons was re-filed on 17 November 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assessment of the length of delay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In view of the procedural history detailed above, the question arose as to how the length of delay should be assessed. The applicant argued that the period of delay was less than two weeks because he filed OSN 20/2016 on 8 August 2016 to seek an extension of time to file his notice of appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I did not agree that the length of the delay should be calculated with reference to 8 August 2016. I accept that in <span class="font-italic">Falmac Ltd v Cheng Ji Lai Charlie and another matter </span>[2014] 4 SLR 202, the Court of Appeal took the length of delay as the time between the last day for filing a notice of appeal and the day on which the applicant filed an originating summons seeking an extension of time (at [18]). In the present case, the originating summons filed on 8 August 2016 is not the same originating summons that was before me on 30 March 2017. Although the applicant <span class="font-italic">filed </span>OSN 20/2016 on 8 August 2016, he failed to <span class="font-italic">serve </span>OSN 20/2016 on the correct address. Consequently, the respondent did not receive notice of the application for an extension of time to appeal. When granted leave to amend and re-serve OSN 20/2016 on payment of $600 in costs to the respondent, the applicant neglected to pay the costs. OSN 20/2016 was then struck out. Rather than complying with the costs order in order to restore the OSN, the applicant waited until 2 November 2016 to file a new OSN. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The length of delay in this case was, at the very least, the time between the last day for filing a notice of appeal, 29 July 2016, and the day on which the applicant filed the <span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">resent</span> application, 2 November 2016.

This led to him filing OSN 20/2016, which was “struck out not on substantial issues but on the issue of an unless costs order.” Accordingly, he had to file OSN 36/2016 “due to the striking out of the first leave application.”

The fact that the applicant had been unwell and needed a lawyer to represent him accounted only for the delay between 29 July 2016 and 8 August 2016, when OSN 20/2016 was filed. The applicant gives no good reason for the delays thereafter that led to the striking out of OSN 20/2016 and his eventual filing of OSN 36/2016 on 2 November 2016. His only explanation for his need to file OSN 36/2016 is that OSN 20/2016 had been struck out. Yet it was the very dilatory conduct of the applicant that led to the striking out of OSN 20/2016 (see [18] above). He could have complied with the unless order or attempted to restore the OSN. He has offered no satisfactory explanation for why he waited until 2 November 2016 to file the present application. The applicant in an affidavit deposed on 16 January 2017 belatedly claimed that he had insufficient time to raise the $600 in costs that would have averted the striking out of OSN 20/2016,

After the ancillary orders were made, the applicant did not comply with them. On 21 November 2016, the respondent filed an application (SUM 3981/2016) for the Miltonia Property to be transferred to her pursuant to the ancillary orders, on account of the applicant’s failure to effect such transfer. SUM 3981/2016 was heard by the Judge on 14 December 2016. The Judge made no orders on SUM 3981/2016 because counsel for the applicant told him that only the High Court had jurisdiction to hear the matter, and in any event, the parties were discussing the transfer of the Miltonia Property from the applicant to the respondent.

This was the reason I made the extension of time subject to the Condition, which made it necessary for the applicant to do all that was necessary to transfer the Miltonia Property to the respondent. In making this order, I had in mind that the respondent required accommodation and had been making the mortgage payments for the Miltonia Property on the basis that the property would be transferred to her. Further, the appellate court would take the transfer into account when considering the details of the property division, and would proceed on the basis that the transfer had been effected. The net value of the Miltonia Property only accounted for 17% of the asset pool and any revision of the orders on appeal could take this into account. Counsel for the applicant specifically agreed to the Condition and the seven-day timeframe stipulated for compliance. I thus ordered the applicant to execute the transfer of the Miltonia Property and to file his notice of appeal within seven days of 30 March 2017.

</div> Despite the further extension, the relevant transfer documents remained unsigned by the applicant at the close of business on 7 April 2017. This was in spite of the fact that Ms Sharma had personally delivered the transfer documents to the office of Mr Singh at 3.25pm on 6 April 2017.

</div> Ms Sharma refused to accept them. Mr Singh followed up with two letters to the court, first at 1.47 pm and then at 9.19 pm, requesting further arguments (“the 10 April Letters”)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the letter sent to the court on 10 April 2017 at 9.19 pm, Mr Singh stated that he had misinterpreted my orders on 6 April 2017. It seems he had the mistaken impression that he had a total of eight days to sign and return <span class="font-italic">both</span> the transfer documents as well as the mortgage-in-escrow, rather than one day to sign and return the transfer documents and eight days to sign and return the mortgage-in-escrow. Case law is clear, however, that a mistake by a solicitor is insufficient reason to justify granting an extension of time to file a notice of appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Kunal Gobind Lalchandani v Konduri Prakash Murthy</span> [2005] SGHC 94 at [35] citing <span class="font-italic">Denko-HLB Sdn Bhd v Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 3 SLR 357 at [13]–[14]). More importantly, I found it difficult to accept Mr Singh’s explanation. On 6 April 2017, he clearly communicated that he understood the orders, which were explained and repeated to him. The claims about his alleged confusion were made only by way of letter, without the support of an affidavit. Moreover, the account given in the 10 April Letters was inconsistent with what Mr Singh told the court at the hearing on 18 April 2017 in several ways: First, Mr Singh stated in the 10 April Letters that “on 7 April 2017 [his] client was only able to come to our office to execute the Transfer [documents] after 6pm”. Before me he claimed that his “client only came at 4pm”.

Although in this judgment I have highlighted the delays since the time of the ancillary order, in fact, even before the ancillary orders were made, the applicant’s dilatory conduct throughout the divorce proceedings has made the proceedings a painful and protracted affair for the respondent. Almost five years have elapsed since the divorce proceedings were commenced by her. Even after the ancillary orders were made, the applicant neglected to comply with them by seeing to the transfer of the Miltonia Property to the respondent.

In balancing the parties’ competing interests, the court inevitably needs to consider the question of prejudice. Copious citation of case law will not be necessary (and also will not be helpful) as previous decisions will be no more than guides.
