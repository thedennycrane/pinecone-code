<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In perhaps the first case of its kind in
                    Singapore, the Court is asked: should the Court restrain a party, who has
                    pursued its claim for a particular remedy for no less than five years in
                    Singapore, all the way to the Court of Appeal, and lost, from pursuing the same
                    remedy in a foreign Court?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These are the interesting and novel issues
                    raised in this application which is but a chapter of a long-running saga between
                    the protagonists. The plaintiff, Beckkett Pte Ltd (“Beckkett”) is
                    a Singapore company. Beckkett and its subsidiary, PT Swabara Mining and Energy
                    (“SME”) (an Indonesian company) owned shares in an Indonesian
                    company, PT Asminco Bara Utama (“Asminco”) which in turn owned
                    shares in another Indonesian company, PT Adaro Indonesia
                    (“Adaro”). Adaro’s key asset was a coal mine in Kalimantan
                    which produced low-ash, low-energy coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is Deutsche Bank AG (“the
                    Bank”), a German bank with a branch in Singapore. The Bank extended a
                    Bridging Loan to Asminco which Beckkett provided a guarantee of. In exchange,
                    Beckkett and Asminco pledged their shares in SME, Asminco and Adaro to the Bank.
                    Asminco subsequently defaulted in paying the Bridging Loan. The Bank eventually
                    sold the pledged shares in SME and Adaro to PT Dianlia Setyamukti
                    (“DSM”) on 21 November 2001 and the sale was completed on
                    15 February 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Beckkett brought a claim against the Bank and
                    DSM for the following reliefs:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the sale of the P Shares was
                            invalid, null and void and for an order to set it aside;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the equity of redemption over
                            the Pledged Shares be restored to Beckkett, SME and
                        Asminco;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an order that the Bank and DSM return the Pledged
                            Shares to Beckkett, SME and Asminco;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">alternatively, damages to be
                        assessed.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the risk of oversimplifying an otherwise
                    complex and intricate set of exchanges between the parties thus far, the dispute
                    between the parties boils down to shares in two subsidiaries of Beckkett,
                    namely, SME and Adaro. The simplicity of the description of this dispute belie
                    the complex and intricate exchanges that had transpired between the parties
                    since Beckkett commenced its suit in Singapore in 2004. It has resulted in no
                    less than two judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore: one from the High
                    Court Judge after a 50-day trial (see <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v
                        Deutsche Bank AG &amp; Anor</em> [2007] SGHC 153) and one
                    from the Court of Appeal (see <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche
                        Bank AG &amp; Anor</em> [2009] SGCA 18).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The salient facts of the dispute between the
                    parties have been summarised succinctly in the Court of Appeal judgment at [3]
                    to [22] and they shall not be repeated here. Suffice to say that the matter is
                    now pending an assessment of damages in the Singapore High Court pursuant to the
                    Court of Appeal’s findings which may be found at [143] of the Court of
                    Appeal judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">“(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Bank, in exercising its power of sale,
                            did not take proper steps to sell the Pledged Shares, in particular, the
                            Adaro Shares and the IBT Shares, at the best price, and was therefore in
                            breach of such duty as pledgee.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Beckkett has adduced sufficient proof that the
                            Adaro Shares and the IBT Shares had been sold at an
                        undervalue.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It is not possible to determine whether the sale
                            of Beckkett’s 74.2% equity share in SME at US$800,000 was at an
                            undervalue and whether Beckkett has suffered a loss until the values of
                            the Adaro Shares and the IBT Shares have been determined and taken into
                            account in the valuation of the SME Shares.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(d)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Contrary to the Judge’s decision, the
                            Bifurcation Order did not require Beckkett to adduce at the trial
                            evidence of its actual loss at the 2001 valuations of the Pledged
                            Shares. It did not abrogate Beckkett’s pleaded claim that damages
                            were to be assessed after the issue of liability was
                        determined.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Beckkett is entitled to have its loss, if any,
                            determined at an inquiry for damages, at which it may prove the value of
                            the SME Shares by adducing evidence of the values of the Adaro Shares
                            and the IBT Shares.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(f)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Although Beckkett, as pledgor of the SME Shares,
                            has no direct claim for any loss arising from the sale of the Adaro
                            Shares and the IBT Shares at an undervalue, it is entitled, as guarantor
                            of the Bridging Loan, to prove any undervalue with respect to the
                            Pledged Shares and to set it off against the Bank’s
                            counterclaim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(g)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The sale of the Pledged Shares by the Bank to DSM
                            was not improper nor effected pursuant to a conspiracy between them,
                            whether by lawful or unlawful means.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(h)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Beckkett has failed to prove that DSM was not a
                            bona fide purchaser of the Pledged Shares.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Having regard to the subsequent developments
                            relating to the Adaro Shares and the IBT Shares and the conduct of
                            Beckkett, it would be wholly inequitable for the court to set aside the
                            sale of the Pledged Shares.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Court of Appeal then proceeded to make the
                    following orders (at [143] of the judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">“(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We dismiss, with costs, Beckkett’s
                            appeal against the Judge’s decision to dismiss its claims to set
                            aside the sale of the Pledged Shares against the Bank and/or DSM. The
                            costs payable to DSM shall be paid forthwith, but the costs to the Bank
                            will be stayed until the determination of Beckkett’s claim for
                            damages against the Bank as set out in the order in sub-para (b)

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before I end the narration of the judgments that
                    have thus far been rendered in the Singapore Courts on this dispute, and at the
                    risk of highlighting the judgments out of sequence, I ought to highlight a
                    portion of the High Court Judge’s decision on the issue of whether the
                    sale of the Pledged Shares was carried out by unlawful means. On this issue, the
                    High Court found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“125  This relates back to the <em>penetapan-putusan</em> question under Art 1156 of the
                            [Indonesian Commercial Code (“ICC”)] . There is no
                            controversy that the private sale had to be approved by the Indonesian
                            courts. The sale of the Pledged Shares was carried out after the
                                <em>penetapans</em> were obtained from the
                            South Jakarta District Court. However, those <em>penetapans</em> were set aside by the Jakarta High Court, and
                            have not been reinstated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    Under Indonesian law, the position must be that
                            there were no valid approvals for the sale. It would follow that the
                            sale was not carried out by lawful means, and was carried out by
                            unlawful means as no valid court approval was obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    This conclusion has different consequences for
                            each defendant. This fixes liability on [the Bank] as it was a failure
                            on its part as mortgagee to discharge its duties towards [Beckkett].
                            However, it does not attach liability on DSM unless they intended to
                            injure the Plaintiff when they agreed that the application to court was
                            to be made <em>ex parte</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For the purposes of the present application, and
                    at the risk of setting out what may appear at first blush to be a pedantic set
                    of dates, it is vital to set out the chronology of events, particularly after
                    the Court of Appeal judgment was rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sequence of Events</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Singapore High Court Trial &amp; Court of Appeal
                Hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The High Court trial began on 20 February
                    2006. After a 50-day trial, judgment was rendered on 21 September 2007.
                    Beckkett filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal on 22 October 2007
                    and the Bank filed a cross-appeal. The appeals were heard on 23 April 2008
                    and judgment was reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Beckkett Filed Suit in the District Court of South Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 2 May 2008, about a week after the
                    appeals were heard in Singapore, Beckkett filed a suit in the District Court of
                    South Jakarta. In the Indonesian suit, Beckkett claimed essentially that the
                    sale of the SME Shares were unlawful under Indonesian law. The basis of
                    Beckkett’s Indonesian proceedings can be distilled to the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The sale of the SME Shares was based on <em>penetapans</em> issued by the South Jakarta District

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As relief, Beckkett sought the return of the

                    had pledged to the Bank. In particular, Beckkett sought the following reliefs in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is important to highlight that at this
                    point in the proceedings, the Court of Appeal had reserved its judgment.
                    Consequently, the parties did not know if Beckkett would be successful in its
                    appeal and if so, what remedy would be awarded by the Court of Appeal. Two
                    remedies were possible if the appeal was allowed. First, the Court of Appeal
                    could find that the Bank was liable and award damages. Second, the Court of
                    Appeal could order a return of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Bank Challenged the Indonesian Courts’ Jurisdiction and
                Failed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 30 October 2008, the Bank filed an
                    application known as an “Absolute Competency Exception” in the
                    District Court of South Jakarta. In this application, the Bank, in essence,
                    sought a stay of the Indonesian proceedings on the ground that the Bridge
                    Facility Agreement between the parties designated the Courts of England or
                    Singapore as the proper forum of the dispute and that Beckkett had acted in bad
                    faith by filing its claim in Indonesia. Several other defendants against whom
                    Beckkett had filed the claim also filed similar applications (which are not
                    relevant for the purposes of determining this application).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 8 January 2009, the District Court of
                    South Jakarta rejected the Bank’s Absolute Competency Exception
                    application. It is not disputed that the Bank did not appeal against this

                    Beckkett’s suit in its entirety. On 13 April 2009, Beckkett filed an
                    appeal against that decision. (For convenience, and for reasons which shall
                    become apparent below at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a> and <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> below , this appeal shall be referred to in

                    rendered its judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Beckkett Appealed against the Indonesian Judgment at First
                Instance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 15 May 2009, the Bank’s
                    Indonesian counsel (Rahmat Bastian) received a notification from the District
                    Court of South Jakarta informing the Bank of the First Indonesian Appeal. On
                    25 May 2009, Beckkett filed a Summons for Directions (as required by Order
                    37 of the Rules of Court) for the assessment of damages in the Singapore High
                    Court. On 28 July 2009, the Bank’s Indonesian counsel received
                    another notification, this time from the District Court of Central Jakarta,
                    informing him of the First Indonesian Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 24 August 2009, the Bank’s
                    solicitors in Singapore wrote to Beckkett’s solicitors to ask Beckkett to
                    withdraw the First Indonesian Appeal. On 28 August 2009, Beckkett’s
                    solicitors replied asking for a copy of the Notice of Appeal referred to in the
                    letter from the Bank’s solicitors. This request was acceded to on
                    4 September 2009. After a period of silence from Beckkett, the solicitors
                    for the Bank sent a reminder to Beckkett’s solicitors. On
                    17 September 2009, Beckkett’s solicitors replied to say that Beckkett
                    did not intend to withdraw the First Indonesian Appeal. No reasons were given in
                    that letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 28 September 2009, the Bank’s
                    Indonesian counsel received a notice from the High Court of Jakarta informing
                    him that the High Court had received the documents in Beckkett’s First
                    Indonesian Appeal from the District Court of South Jakarta. Beckkett did not
                    file a Memorandum of Appeal setting out the aspects of the decision of the
                    District Court of South Jakarta which it was dissatisfied with. As a result, the
                    appeal was against the whole of the District Court of South Jakarta’s
                    judgment. It is common ground between the parties that in such a situation, the
                    High Court of Jakarta can decide the First Indonesian Appeal based solely on the
                    court record and documents tendered by the parties in the Indonesian District
                    Court Suit.</p>

                    out an anti-suit injunction on 7 October 2009. On 9 October 2009, the
                    present application was filed. The application was heard on 18 November
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Beckkett’s Reply Affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Before I move on to the parties’
                    respective submissions, I ought to point out a significant point made by
                    Beckkett through the reply affidavit filed by Mr Anthony Jeffrey
                    D’Cruz. At [87] of his affidavit, Mr D’Cruz stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“It is not and never has been Beckkett’s intention to keep
                        both damages and the Pledged Shares. If required by this Honourable Court,
                        Beckkett is prepared to give the necessary undertakings to that
                        effect.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Bank’s Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Counsel for the Bank submitted that the
                    present application concerned a clear and obvious case which merited the grant
                    of an anti-suit injunction. The Bank relied on two main prongs for its
                    submissions. The first key plank of its submission is that Singapore is the
                    natural forum for the dispute. In this regard, the Bank submitted that Singapore
                    was the forum chosen by Beckkett more than 5 years ago when the suit was first
                    commenced in Singapore in 2004. Further, the Bank also relied on
                    Beckkett’s decision to file the Summons for Directions for the assessment
                    of damages in Singapore after the Singapore Court of Appeal decision was
                    rendered. Against this set of facts, and relying on the decision in <em>Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd v Coral Oil Co Ltd</em>
                    [1999] 2 Lloyds Rep 606, counsel for the Bank submitted that a court
                    which is not originally the natural forum for a dispute can become the natural
                    forum as a result of the progress of litigation before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The second key plank of the Bank’s
                    submission lies in the argument that the First Indonesian Appeal was vexatious
                    or oppressive. Relying on the test laid down by the Privy Council in <em>Société Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui
                        Jak</em> [1987] AC 871 (“<em>Société
                        Nationale</em>”), the Bank attempted to show that the
                    continuation of the Indonesian proceedings was both vexatious and oppressive
                    because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It constituted an attempt by Beckkett to
                            re-litigate matters that were <em>res judicata</em>
                            between the parties by reason of the Singapore Court of Appeal decision;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">There was no legitimate reason for Beckkett to
                            maintain concurrent proceedings against the Bank in Singapore and
                            Indonesia.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     To maintain this submission, the Bank
                    submitted that at every stage of the Singapore proceedings, Beckkett had asked
                    for alternative remedies, namely: (a) to set aside the Bank’s sale of the
                    Pledged Shares and obtain a return of the Pledged Shares as a result; and (b)
                    alternatively, for damages to be assessed against the Bank. References were made
                    to Beckkett’s Re-Amended Statement of Claim filed on 28 February 2005
                    (at pages 33-35), Beckkett’s Opening Statement filed on
                    13 February 2006 (at pages 44-46) and Beckkett’s Closing
                    Submissions filed on 8 January 2007 (at pages 391-401). In the
                    Bank’s submissions, these two remedies are mutually exclusive, viz.
                    Beckkett can either seek a return of the shares, or seek compensation of its
                    loss (if any) by way of damages. The Bank submitted that Beckkett is not
                    entitled to both remedies because that would constitute double
                recovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With regard to the offer by Beckkett to make
                    the necessary undertakings to prevent double recovery, the Bank submitted that
                    Beckkett’s offer to elect between the remedy of damages and the return of
                    the Pledged Shares before executing any judgment from either Court was
                    inadequate. In the Bank’s view, such an offer does not address the
                    vexation and oppression created by Beckkett’s pursuit of concurrent
                    proceedings because it leaves the Bank exposed to the re-litigation of issues
                    that are <em>res judicata</em> between the parties and
                    would result in wasted costs in either the Indonesian or Singapore proceedings
                    (depending on which remedy Beckkett elects to keep if Beckkett has a choice).
                    The Bank also highlighted the risk of Singapore’s judicial resources being
                    wasted in conducting the assessment of damages if the Indonesian appeal was
                    decided in favour of Beckkett.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the circumstances, the Bank submitted that
                    an appropriate order which fulfilled the “ends of justice” would
                    be an anti-suit injunction. An order to put Beckkett to election would not be
                    appropriate because it would be inconsistent with the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment and would allow Beckkett a second bite at the
                    cherry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Beckkett’s Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In its 107-page written submissions tendered
                    at the hearing, Beckkett adopted a seven-pronged argument to resist the present
                    application. First, Beckkett submitted that there was no duplicity between the
                    proceedings in Singapore and those in Indonesia. Second, Beckkett argued that
                    even if there was duplicity, the application should be dismissed because the
                    Bank had not acted with “clean hands”. Third, Beckkett relied on
                    the argument that it would be contrary to the ends of justice to grant an
                    anti-suit injunction. Fourth, it argued that an injunction need not be granted
                    because the Bank’s concerns could be overcome by appropriate undertakings.
                    Fifth, even if the Court was satisfied that there were grounds to intervene, the
                    just and equitable solution would be to put Beckkett to its election. Sixth, it
                    would be unjust to grant an anti-suit injunction as it would deprive Beckkett of
                    its right to elect. Finally, even if the Court was not minded to allow
                    concurrent proceedings, it was only fair and just that Beckkett be put to an
                    election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As can be seen from a reproduction of the
                    seven-pronged approach, the arguments raised by counsel for Beckkett can be
                    essentially distilled to five key issues:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether there was duplicity between the
                            proceedings in Indonesia and those in Singapore;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Bank should be denied relief because
                            it did not come to Court with clean hands;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the requirements for an anti-suit
                            injunction were met;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Bank’s concerns could be
                            overcome with the necessary undertakings; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the just and equitable order would be to
                            put Beckkett to an election.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Beckkett’s submissions will be
                    summarised along the five issues that I have identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there is duplicity in the Indonesian and Singapore
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Beckkett commenced its arguments on this issue
                    by stating that multiplicity of proceedings is not to be confused with duplicity
                    of proceedings; multiplicity without more does not amount to duplicity. Relying
                    on the decision of Judith Prakash J in <em>Transtech
                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry &amp; Ors</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR 272 (“<em>Transtech
                    Electronics</em>”) at [16], Beckkett submitted that while it would
                    be undesirable for there to be two sets of proceedings in two different
                    jurisdictions: (a) involving the same parties, (b) involving the same
                    issues and (c) arising from the same underlying cause of action, this does not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> prevent one of those actions from
                    continuing. Beckkett reiterated that the Court always has to have regard to the
                    right of a party to invoke the jurisdiction available to him by the law of a
                    particular country and cannot deprive such a party of that right without good
                    ground. Further, Beckkett submitted that it was an essential ingredient of a
                    finding that there was a duplicity of actions that the plaintiff must have sued
                    the same defendant in two jurisdictions in substantially the same causes of
                    action: see <em>Multi-Code Electronics Industries (M) Bhd &amp;
                        Anor v Toh Chun Toh Gordon &amp; Ors</em> [2009] 1 SLR 1000
                    at [33] to [34].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On the facts of the present application,
                    Beckkett submitted that the causes of action underpinning both sets of
                    proceedings were “legally and conceptually distinct”: see [90] of
                    Beckkett’s Written Submissions. Beckkett sought to argue that its causes
                    of action in the Singapore proceedings were based on the illegality of the Sale
                    Agreement, breach of the Bank’s duties as mortgagee and conspiracy between
                    the Bank and DSM. At the trial, Articles 1155 and 1156 of the ICC were relevant
                    to Beckkett’s case on the illegality of the Sale Agreement.
                    Beckkett’s case at the trial was that the Sale and Purchase Agreement was
                    an agreement with an unlawful <em>causa</em> and was hence
                    illegal and void from the outset. Although Beckkett’s cause of action on
                    the illegality of the Sale Agreement was premised on the breach of Articles 1155
                    and 1156, Beckkett submitted that this cause of action was not even adjudicated
                    upon in the Singapore proceedings. In particular, Beckkett pointed to the
                    Bank’s Respondent’s Case at the Singapore Court of Appeal where the
                    Bank contended as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“1141 Beckkett’s case on illegality was
                            that the Sale Agreement should be set aside because it involved
                            performance of an act which was alleged illegal under foreign law. This
                            relates to the rule in <em>Foster v Driscoll</em>
                            [1929] 1 KB 470 and the principle in <em>Ralli
                                v Compania Naviera Sota v Anzar</em> [1920]
                            2 KB 287. <b>Beckkett does not pursue its case
                                on illegality before this Court</b>.” [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is interesting and pertinent to note that
                    although Beckkett submitted that, at the trial, it did not pursue its case on
                    illegality, it conceded in its written submissions at [94] that “[o]n
                    appeal, however, [Beckkett] argued, as part of its case on conspiracy (by
                    unlawful means), that the <em>penetapans</em>, having been
                    obtained by <em>ex parte</em> applications, constituted the
                    unlawful means by which the conspiracy was perpetrated. The issue of the breach
                    of Article 1156 was a mere ingredient (i.e. the unlawful act) that was part of
                    [Beckkett’s] cause of action on conspiracy by unlawful means.” In
                    other words, Beckkett sought to argue that for the Singapore proceedings, it had
                    focussed its efforts on the guilty intent of the purchaser of the shares by
                    proving that DSM was an accomplice of the Bank and that both of them had taken
                    part in a conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In contrast, Beckkett argued, the Indonesian
                    proceedings were based on the Bank’s failure to comply with the Articles
                    1155 and 1156 of the ICC: Beckkett’s case was that the breach constitutes
                    a tort and rendered the purported transfer of the Pledged Shares ineffective
                    (null and void). Beckkett took pains to argue that the causes of action were
                    different and that it could not have pursued, and did not pursue, a separate and
                    distinct cause of action based on the breach of the Articles. Rather, the issue
                    of the breach of the Articles was merely an ingredient of its cause of action
                    that there had been a conspiracy by unlawful means. Beckkett then argued that it
                    did not follow that, just because Beckkett could not prove that DSM was an
                    accomplice of the Bank, Beckkett had lost its rights under Indonesian law to
                    challenge the validity of the purported transfer of the Pledged
                Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Bank came to the Court “with clean hands”
            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Next, Beckkett argued that the Bank’s
                    application ought to be dismissed because the Bank did not come to the court
                    with clean hands. The arguments under this heading were fairly simple to
                    understand. As anti-suit injunctions are equitable remedies, the Court ought to
                    exercise its discretion only if the party seeking the Court’s relief comes
                    to the Court “with clean hands”. In short, Beckkett relied on the
                    long-established maxim that “he who seeks equity must do
                    equity”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Beckkett relied on four acts for its
                    allegation that the Bank did not come to the Court with clean hands. First,
                    Beckkett pointed out that the Bank had been inconsistent (viz. “blowing
                    hot and cold”) with regard to the Indonesian proceedings. For this
                    argument, Beckkett turned to various passages in the Bank’s submissions
                    made in its Appellant’s Case before the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal
                    No 126 of 2007. For example, at [603] of the submissions, the Bank had
                    submitted as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“603  The learned Judge appears to have assumed
                            that Article 1156 requires an <em>inter partes</em>
                            application. [The Bank] of course disputes that assumption. That aside,
                                <b><em>even if Article 1156 requires an</em></b><b>inter partes</b><b><em>
                                application, [Beckkett] would have to file a claim before the
                                Indonesian courts and argue, in contested proceedings, that there
                                was a deliberate and wilful breach of Article 1156 and that the sale
                                of the Pledged Shares should be annulled</em></b>.”
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Relying on this passage, Beckkett argued that
                    the Bank had been blowing hot and cold in these proceedings. Making reference to
                    the recent Court of Appeal decision in <em>John Reginald Stott
                        Kirkham &amp; Ors v Trane US Inc &amp; Ors</em>
                    [2009] SGCA 32 (“<em>John Reginald
                        Stott</em>”) , Beckkett submitted that the conduct of the Bank
                    was even more egregious than that of the unsuccessful applicants in <em>John Reginald Stott</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, Beckkett alleged that there was
                    material non-disclosure on the part of the Bank. Indeed, this was a point
                    forcefully pursued by counsel for Beckkett at the hearing in oral submissions.
                    For this point, Beckkett pointed out that the Bank had inexplicably failed to
                    disclose in the affidavits filed in support of the application the material fact
                    that the Bank had previously applied, but failed, to stay the Indonesian
                    proceedings on the grounds of concurrent Singapore proceedings. Beckkett then
                    sought to paint a picture of a party (i.e. the Bank) who had been successful at
                    first instance seeking, by means of the present application in another
                    jurisdiction, to stymie the unsuccessful party’s (i.e. Beckkett’s)
                    chances at an appeal in the first jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, Beckkett pointed out that after having
                    its stay application in Indonesian dismissed and failing to appeal against that
                    unfavourable decision, the Bank continued to defend the Indonesian action
                    vigorously on its merits. By participating in and defending both sets of
                    proceedings in Indonesia and Singapore, Beckkett submitted that the Bank had
                    submitted to the jurisdiction of the Indonesian Courts. Having accepted the
                    jurisdiction of both the Indonesian and Singapore courts without putting
                    Beckkett to an election, and having fought in both jurisdictions, Beckkett
                    submitted that the Bank must be taken to have waived its rights to fight one
                    action only. To that end, Beckkett relied on the cases of <em>The
                        Delta</em> (1876) 1 PD 393 and <em>Morrison
                        Rose &amp; Partners v Hillman</em> [1961] 2 QB 266
                        (“<em>Morrison Rose</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Fourth, Beckkett submitted that there was
                    significant delay in the Bank’s taking out of this application for an
                    anti-suit injunction. Beckkett pointed out that when the Bank’s solicitors
                    in Singapore wrote to Beckkett’s solicitors in Singapore on 24 August
                    2009, the Bank had given the false impression that it had only learnt of
                    Beckkett’s appeal to the High Court of Jakarta (i.e. the First Indonesian
                    Appeal) on 28 July 2009. In actual fact, it was alleged, the Bank knew
                    about the appeal as early as 15 May 2009 when the first notification was
                    sent from the District Court of South Jakarta to the Bank’s solicitors in
                    Indonesia. In other words, by the time Beckkett took out the Summons for
                    Directions on 28 May 2009, the Bank already knew that an appeal had been
                    filed in the Indonesian Courts. Yet, it took the Bank up to 24 August 2009
                    (some three months later) to write to Beckkett on this issue and up to
                    9 October 2009 to file the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Relying on the decision of Kan Ting
                    Chiu J in <em>VH v VI &amp; Anor</em>
                    [2007] SGHC 221, Beckkett submitted that the inexplicable and
                    inordinate delay on the Bank’s part was sufficient for the Court to refuse
                    the Bank relief in the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the requirements for an anti-suit injunction were met </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was common ground between Beckkett and the
                    Bank that the principles considered by the Court of Appeal in <em>John Reginald Stott</em> were applicable. The parties differed on
                    their application of those principles to the facts of the present
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Relying on the factors identified in that
                    judgment, Beckkett submitted that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Indonesia was the natural forum for the
                            adjudication of the issues in question;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Indonesian proceedings were not vexatious,
                            oppressive or unconscionable because Beckkett had good reason for
                            bringing the Indonesian proceedings and because Beckkett was not
                            pursuing mutually exclusive remedies;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">On the contrary, it would be unjust to Beckkett
                            if it was restrained from proceeding in Indonesia because it had
                            expended significant time, resources, effort and costs in pursuing the
                            Indonesian proceedings and because significant detriment would be
                            occasioned to it; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The discretion to grant an anti-suit injunction
                            ought to be exercised sparingly and with great caution.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the first factor, Beckkett contended that
                    the Bank’s affidavits filed in support of the application failed to
                    contend that Singapore was the natural and proper forum for the resolution of
                    parties. Beckkett further submitted that the Bank did not do so because it could
                    not make such an assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Beckkett then argued that the relevant dispute
                    was the one in Indonesia for the return of the Pledged Shares on account of the
                    fact that the sale was based on <em>penetapans</em> issued
                    by the District Court of South Jakarta which were in violation of Articles 1155
                    and 1156 of the ICC. Given the backdrop of this dispute, the Indonesian Courts
                    were the natural forum to adjudicate on the issue of whether the sale had
                    contravened Articles 1155 and 1156 of the ICC. Further, Beckkett pointed out
                    that the Share Pledge Agreements were governed by Indonesian law and provided
                    for the District Court of Central Jakarta to have non-exclusive jurisdiction of
                    any disputes arising from the Share Pledge Agreements. Therefore, in
                    Beckkett’s view, only the Indonesian courts had the actual power,
                    authority and jurisdictional competence to enforce an order to rescind the sale
                    of the Pledged Shares and to grant a declaration that Beckkett was the legal
                    owner of the Pledged Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On the second factor, Beckkett’s
                    position is that the Bank did not, in its affidavits supporting the application,
                    point to some inconvenience, much less prejudice, in having to defend both the
                    Indonesian proceedings and the assessment of damages in Singapore. Further,
                    Beckkett pointed out that the Bank failed to allege any bad faith on
                    Beckkett’s part in pursuing the Indonesian proceedings or that
                    Beckkett’s Indonesian proceedings were bound to fail. Relying on the cases
                    of, amongst many others, <em>McHenry v Lewis</em> [1882]
                    22 Ch. D 397 and <em>Peruvian Guano Company v
                        Bockwoldt</em> [1883] Ch. D 225, Beckkett submitted that
                    there was no presumption in law that a multiplicity of proceedings in different
                    jurisdictions was vexatious, or that the mere fact of a multiplicity of
                    proceedings was sufficient, without more, to justify the granting of an
                    anti-suit injunction. Citing the clear and proper advantages that it had in
                    pursuing its remedy in Indonesia, Beckkett sought to argue that its pursuit of a
                    legitimate advantage in Indonesia was not vexatious, as unpleasant as it might
                    be to the Bank to be sued twice in two jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For the third factor, Beckkett alleged that
                    that to restrain the continuation of the Indonesian proceedings at this very
                    late stage would result in substantial wasted time, resources, effort and
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Finally, on the last factor, Beckkett relied
                    on the cases of <em>Société Nationale</em> and <em>Royal Bank of Canada v Cooperative Centrale
                        Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA</em> [2004] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 471 as authorities for the proposition that anti-suit injunctions ought
                    to be rarely given in the wider context of comity amongst nations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Bank’s concerns can be addressed by undertakings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Beckkett relied on the following passage of
                    Lord Goff’s judgment in <em>Société Generale</em>
                    where Lord Goff opined (at pg 896F-H):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“since the court is concerned with the ends of justice, …
                        account must be taken not only of injustice to the defendant if the
                        plaintiff is allowed to pursue foreign proceedings, but also of injustice to
                        the plaintiff if he is not allowed to do so. So the court will not grant an
                        injunction if, by doing so, it will deprive the plaintiff of advantages in
                        the foreign forum of which it would be unjust to deprive him. Fortunately,
                        however, as the present case shows, <b>that problem can
                            often be overcome by appropriate undertakings</b> given by the
                        defendant, or by granting an injunction upon appropriate terms”
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Court may put Beckkett to an election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Beckkett admits that where a plaintiff has
                    commenced two sets of proceedings, ostensibly involving the same defendant and
                    where the same issues arise, one of the options that could arise is where the
                    defendant invites the Court to compel the plaintiff to make a positive election
                    as to which of the proceedings to pursue: see [214] of the Beckkett’s
                    Written Submissions. Beckkett then goes on to submit that to grant an anti-suit
                    injunction would be to deprive it of its right to elect between the two sets of
                    proceedings when the time for election has not yet arrived. Beckkett’s
                    position is that it is only where a party is placed in a position in which he is
                    confronted with two mutually exclusive courses of action that he must choose
                    between them: see <em>Spencer Bower: The Law Relating to Estoppel
                        by Representation</em> (LexisNexis UK, 4<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed, 2004) at [XIII.1.8] (“<em>Spencer
                    Bower</em>”). As this passage has the potential to play a critical
                    part in the eventual outcome of this application, I will reproduce the relevant
                    text here for ease of reference:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“XIII.1.8    Election comes into play, therefore,
                            when a party is placed in the position where he is confronted by two
                            mutually exclusive courses of action and must choose between them. A
                            number of points may be made about this doctrine. First, it is clearly
                            distinct from promissory estoppel because it arises where one party is
                            faced with a choice. Although a finding of promissory estoppel may often
                            be made where a party has made a promise not to exercise a particular
                            right or a declaration of intention to that effect, there are many
                            occasions on which a party may be bound by a promise where the law does
                            not require him to make a choice at all. Secondly, the doctrine of
                            election is usually expressed in terms of ‘courses of
                            action’ but the courses of action open to a party faced with an
                            election may involve a choice between (a) remedies, (b) substantive
                            rights, (c) procedural steps or requirements, or (d) parties. In the
                            last case where the two persons are liable for the same debt or
                            performance of the same obligation and the creditor elects to take
                            proceedings against one debtor rather than the other then he or she will
                            be precluded from later taking proceedings against the other debtor if
                            the remaining conditions of a valid election are met.
                            […]”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Beckkett then referred the Court to <em>Ross v Ross</em> [1950] P 160, a decision of the Probate
                    Division of the High Court in England. There, after a <em>decree
                        nisi</em> (or what is now known as an interim judgment) was granted,
                    counsel for the successful wife stated that no question of maintenance would
                    arise as the wife intended to rely on an existing maintenance order of a court
                    of summary jurisdiction. Two months after the decree absolute was granted, the
                    wife applied to the High Court for maintenance. While that application was
                    pending, she took out a summons for arrears under the order made by the court of
                    summary jurisdiction, contending that she had, by her conduct, made an
                    irrevocable election to rely on the earlier order. The English High Court
                    rejected this contention. The Court explained at p 163 of the report:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The doctrine of election, as I understand it, applies in a case
                        where a plaintiff has alternative remedies, and it is held that where he has
                        once elected to pursue one he has waived his right to the other and is for
                        ever precluded from asserting it […] In the present case, as it seems
                        to me, the wife was never in the position of having alternative or
                        inconsistent remedies; she never had more than one remedy open to her,
                        namely an order for maintenance against the husband; but she had a choice of
                        courts in which she might pursue that remedy. The position, as I see it, is
                        somewhat analogous to the case where proceedings in respect of substantially
                        the same cause of action are pending at the same time in two different
                        courts. Of this class of case, <em>McHenry v Lewis</em>
                        (1882) 22 Ch. D. 397, is a well known example. In such cases it
                        has never, so far as I know, been suggested that a plaintiff, by instituting
                        proceedings in one court, has irrevocably elected to pursue his remedy only
                        in that court, so as to be precluded for all time from proceeding elsewhere.
                        On the contrary, it is clear that, on a motion to stay proceedings on the
                        ground of lis alibis pendens, the court has a discretion to stay or not to
                        stay the proceedings, <b>and may at that stage put the
                            plaintiff to his election as to the court in which he will
                            proceed</b>. I very much doubt, therefore, whether the doctrine
                        of election as enunciated in the cases referred to, could ever be applied to
                        a case such as the present, where the wife’s only choice so far has
                        been as to the court in which she will pursue the remedy which she
                        undoubtedly has.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Beckkett then goes on to submit that as
                    damages have yet to be assessed in Singapore, it has yet to obtain an
                    enforceable and quantifiable judgment for damages against the Bank. Similarly,
                    as the Indonesian courts have not granted an order to rescind the sale of the
                    Pledged Shares and a declaration that Beckkett is the legal owner of the shares,
                    Beckkett has never been in a position where it has available to it alternative
                    and inconsistent remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Beckkett also referred the Court to the very
                    recent decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <em>Main-Line
                        Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd &amp; Anor</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 232 (“<em>Main-Line</em>”). There, the Court held, albeit in the context of
                    electing between two remedies pursuant to a provision under the Patents Act
                    (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed) against two different defendants (at
                    [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    The rationale for the principles of election
                            between alternative remedies is to prevent double recovery since a
                            plaintiff should not be permitted to recover more than he has lost. The
                            other reason (associated with equitable election) is that the plaintiff
                            is not permitted to approbate and reprobate. <b>What
                                this means is that the plaintiff cannot take the benefits without
                                the burdens</b>.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In this connection, Beckkett relied on a
                    passage of Viscount Simon LC from the Privy Council’s decision in
                        <em>United Australia Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd</em>
                    [1941] AC 1 (“<em>United
                    Australia</em>”), which was a decision cited by Belinda Ang J in
                    her judgment in <em>Main-Line</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The substance of the matter is that on certain facts [the
                        plaintiff] is claiming redress either in the form of compensation, i.e.,
                        damages as for a tort, or in the form of restitution of money to which he is
                        entitled, but which the defendant has wrongfully received. The same set of
                        facts entitled the plaintiff to claim either form of redress. At some stage
                        of the proceedings the plaintiff must elect which remedy he will have.
                            <b>There is, however, no reason of principle or
                            convenience why that stage should be deemed to be reached until the
                            plaintiff applies for judgment</b>” [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Finally, and for the sake of completeness,
                    Beckkett concedes that “it is … clear that a plaintiff may
                    postpone election for a reasonable period, provided such delay is necessary in
                    order to make an informed choice between alternative remedies available”:
                    see [235] of the Beckkett’s Written Submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Before I leave Beckkett’s submissions on
                    this final but critical point, I should point out that in the course of oral
                    submissions, counsel for Beckkett submitted to the Court that Beckkett’s
                    “bottomline submission” (in the event that the Court was not
                    prepared to dismiss the application in its entirety) would be for an order to
                    put Beckkett to an election. This appeared to me to be a fall-back position that
                    Beckkett was prepared to take on the issue of what would be a fair and just
                    order given the present circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Post-Hearing Events </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Parties subsequently filed supplementary
                    written submissions on 19, 20, 23 and 30 November and 4 December 2009.
                    This set of supplementary submissions was precipitated by a letter from counsel
                    for the Bank dated 19 November 2009 pointing out that it had omitted to
                    address the Court on the issue of whether Singapore was the natural forum for
                    the dispute. Attention of the Court was drawn to paragraph 8 of the affidavit
                    filed by Mr Arthur Ling on 28 March 2005 where, in essence,
                    Mr Ling deposed on affidavit that after seeking legal advice from
                    solicitors in Indonesia and Singapore, Beckkett came to the view that there was
                    potential overlap between the subject matter in both suits (in Indonesia and
                    Singapore) and therefore chose to discontinue the action in Indonesia on or
                    around 11 February 2005. This, Mr Ling averred, demonstrated
                    Beckkett’s intention to pursue its claims in the Singapore Courts. The
                    submission from the Bank was therefore that Beckkett’s position had always
                    been that Singapore was the natural forum for the subject matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Quite naturally, counsel for Beckkett did not
                    let matters rest there. A day after the Bank’s letter, on 20 November
                    2009, counsel for Beckkett wrote a short holding letter to state that Beckkett
                    took objection to the letter from the Bank written the day before and reserved
                    its rights to reply. Three days later, on 23 November 2009, counsel for
                    Beckkett replied with a substantive letter to assert that Mr Ling’s
                    affidavit was historical and completely irrelevant to the application. It then
                    sought to trace the chronology of events in or around January 2005 to March 2005
                    for the proceedings in both Indonesia and Singapore. Counsel sought to impress
                    upon the Court that there was a fundamental change of circumstances subsequent
                    to the particular affidavit filed by Mr Ling on 28 March 2005. Counsel
                    then reiterated its argument that this did not preclude Indonesia from becoming
                    the natural forum due to the subsequent events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It was not surprising that this led to yet
                    another reply from counsel for the Bank. Seeing that the utility of the letters
                    was getting inversely proportional to their lengths and their ability to raise
                    peripheral issues, I granted leave to counsel for Beckkett to put in a final
                    reply submission at a PTC in early December 2009. The letter from counsel for
                    Beckkett dated 4 December 2009 finally closed the loop in this round of
                    supplementary submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     On 15 January 2010, both counsel for
                    Beckkett and counsel for the Bank wrote in to inform the Court that the outcome
                    of the High Court of Jakarta had been released on 12 January 2010. A PTC
                    was called. At the PTC on 21 January 2010, parties informed the Court that
                    the High Court of Jakarta had dismissed Beckkett’s appeal. Counsel for
                    Beckkett informed the Court that their client might wish to appeal further
                    (“the Second Indonesian Appeal”) to the Supreme Court of Indonesia
                    and that they had up to 26 January 2010 (14 days from 12 January 2010)
                    to file the memorandum of appeal. I adjourned the PTC to allow the parties to
                    take some quick instructions on whether the turn of events had an impact on the
                    outcome of this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The parties reverted at a PTC the next day (on
                    22 January 2010) to inform the Court of the impact, if any, of the decision
                    from the High Court of Jakarta. Essentially, the parties updated the Court that
                    their respective positions were the same. In particular, counsel for Beckkett
                    added that if the judgment in this application was not released prior to the
                    deadline for filing a memorandum for appeal to the Supreme Court of Indonesia,
                    Beckkett would file the memorandum to preserve its position, but undertook to
                    withdraw the appeal if the Court ordered an election to be made and Beckkett
                    elected to pursue its action in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     By way of laying a framework and foundation
                    for the reasoning and decision to follow, I will cite a few key passages from
                    the leading authorities on the issue of anti-suit injunctions and the remedies
                    available to the Court when faced with such applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     A useful starting point to consider would be
                        <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of
                        Laws</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14<sup>th</sup> Ed,
                    2006) (“<em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em>”) at
                    [12-069] to [12-074], a common resource relied upon by both sets of counsel. The
                    pertinent passages on how the discretion ought to be exercised in an application
                    for an anti-suit injunction are set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[12-069] <b>The exercise of the discretion</b>. The
                        underlying principle is that the jurisdiction is exercised “where it
                        is appropriate to avoid injustice” or as it was once put, where the
                        foreign proceedings are “contrary to equity and good
                        conscience”. Although it is possible to identify certain categories
                        of cases in which the jurisdiction has been exercised “the width and
                        flexibility of equity are not to be undermined by categorisation”.
                        […] [I]n the most recent authoritative formulation of the principles
                        there is no indication that the exercise of the discretion is limited by the
                        need to demonstrate a legal or equitable right not to be sued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[12-070] […] The court will also restrain proceedings which
                        interfere with “the due process of the court” or with the
                        court’s jurisdiction to decide cases pending before it.
                        […]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     At the risk of excessive citation, the
                    following passages (also from <em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em>)
                    provide a useful summary and cross-section of the approach taken in the
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[12-071] It is also clear that the court may restrain foreign proceedings
                        which are “oppressive or vexatious” in the traditional sense.
                        For some years it was not clear what effect the modern development of
                            <em>forum non conveniens</em> principles in the
                        staying of <em>English</em> actions was to have on the
                        exercise of the jurisdiction to enjoin <em>foreign</em>
                        proceedings. […] In the [<em>Société
                            Nationale</em>] case, […], the Privy Counsel (speaking
                        through Lord Goff of Chievely) held that it was not right to treat the
                        principles applicable in injunction cases as equivalent to those in
                            <em>forum non conveniens cases</em>, as developed
                        in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</em>. If
                        the principles were the same, it would mean a party could be restrained from
                        proceeding in a foreign court on the sole ground that England was the
                        natural forum. That could not be right, because it would lead to the
                        conclusion that, in a case where there was simply a difference of view
                        between the English court and the foreign court as to which was the natural
                        forum, the English court could arrogate to itself, by the grant of an
                        injunction, the power to resolve the dispute: such a conclusion would be
                        “inconsistent with comity” and “disregard the
                        fundamental requirement that an injunction will only be granted where the
                        ends of justice so require”. The Privy Council held that where a
                        remedy was available both in England and in the foreign court, the English
                        court would in general only restrain the plaintiff from pursuing proceedings
                        in the foreign court if the pursuit would be vexatious or oppressive. The
                        English court must be the natural forum for the action, and it must take
                        account of the injustice to the defendant if the plaintiff is allowed to
                        pursue the foreign proceedings, and also the injustice to the plaintiff if
                        he is not allowed to do so. The Supreme Court of Canada has broadly accepted
                        the same principles while preferring to utilise the terminology of what is
                        required for “the ends of justice”, and by making a more
                        direct assessment of whether the jurisdictional rules of the foreign court
                        correspond to the Canadian principle of <em>forum
                            conveniens</em>. The High Court of Australia, by contrast, has
                        adopted a rather narrower definition, namely that “foreign
                        proceedings are to be regarded as vexatious or oppressive only if there is
                        nothing which can be gained by them over and above what may be gained in
                        local proceedings”, but it also characterised as oppressive
                        proceedings which were instituted in one court after an action had been
                        begun in another court and which appeared to be brought for the dominant
                        purpose of preventing the first action from continuing.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The above passages demonstrate that the
                    general thread to be drawn from the case law in the various Commonwealth
                    jurisdictions is that the discretion to grant an anti-suit injunction may be
                    exercised in the interests of justice, or conversely, to prevent injustice.
                    While the various jurisdictions may appear to differ on what their respective
                    thresholds are for issuing such injunctions, the baseline appears to be clear:
                    the pursuit of a set of proceedings in another jurisdiction will be enjoined
                    only if it is required for the “ends of justice”. Ultimately, the
                    Court is tasked to weigh and balance the justice to the applicant if the
                    respondent is allowed to pursue a concurrent set of proceedings overseas, and
                    the injustice to the respondent if he is enjoined from pursuing the overseas
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In Singapore, a useful starting point would be
                    the recent Court of Appeal decision in <em>John Reginald
                        Stott</em>. There, a High Court Judge granted an anti-suit injunction
                    restraining the appellants from proceeding with an action in Indonesia against
                    the respondents. The Judge found that: (a) Singapore was the natural forum;
                    (b) the continuation of the Indonesian action would be vexatious and
                    oppressive, as it would be inappropriate for the Indonesian court to decide
                    whether liability existed independently of three critical documents; and
                    (c) it would be highly undesirable if the Singapore court and the
                    Indonesian court arrived at different conclusions as to whether liability
                    existed independently of contract. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appeal
                    was allowed. In coming to its judgment, Chao Hick Tin JA (who delivered the
                    judgment of the Court) cited the principles established by Lord Goff in
                        <em>Société Nationale</em>, namely:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The jurisdiction is to be exercised when the
                            “ends of justice” require it;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Where the Court decides to grant an injunction
                            restraining proceedings in a foreign court, its order is directed not
                            against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or
                            threatening to proceed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It follows that an injunction will only be issued
                            against a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court and
                            against whom an injunction will be an effective remedy;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">It has been emphasised on many occasions that,
                            since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the
                            jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     After citing the passages from <em>Dicey &amp; Morris</em>, in particular para 12-072,
                    Chao JA went on to make the following observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In <em>Evergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte
                                Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR 457 (“<em>Evergreen International SA”</em>), Belinda Ang
                            Saw Ean J (“Ang J”) stated that she had to consider
                            the following elements in determining whether an anti-suit injunction
                            ought to be granted in the case (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    whether the defendants are amenable to the
                                jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the natural forum for resolution of the
                                dispute between the parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the alleged vexation or oppression to the
                                plaintiffs if the foreign proceedings are to continue;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the alleged injustice to the defendants as an
                                injunction would deprive the defendants of the advantages sought in
                                the foreign proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    In our view, this is as good a list as any with one
                            qualification, which would constitute a fifth element – whether
                            the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement
                            between the parties (see <em>South Carolina Insurance Co
                                v Assurantie Maatschappij “De Zeven Provincien”
                                NV</em> [1987] AC 24). Where there is such an
                            agreement, the court may not feel diffident about granting an anti-suit
                            injunction as it would only be enforcing a contractual promise and the
                            question of international comity is not as relevant (see <em>The Angelic Grace</em> [1995] 1 Lloyd’s
                            Rep 87 at 96 and <em>WSG Nimbus Pte Ltd v Board of
                                Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka</em> [2002]
                            3 SLR 603 at [91]).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Before leaving the discussion on the law and
                    embarking on an application of the above principles to the facts, it is
                    imperative for the purposes of this application to provide a closer examination
                    of two other legal issues. First, on the issue of whether the overseas
                    proceedings are “vexatious and oppressive”, it appears that an
                    examination of this factor requires a survey beyond the immediate rights of and
                    prejudices to the parties. Para 12-073 of <em>Dicey &amp;
                        Morris</em> helpfully states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In the result, an injunction may be granted if England is the
                        natural forum for the resolution of the dispute and the proceedings in the
                        foreign court are vexatious or oppressive. English courts have refrained
                        from giving a comprehensive or limiting definition of these expressions;
                        indeed, they have deliberately refrained from marking the outer extent of
                        their power to act to restrain conduct which may give rise to injustice or,
                        if the need for caution is given its due weight, serious injustice. It has
                        been held that vexation or oppression may be indicated by the following:
                        subjecting the other party to oppressive procedures in the foreign court,
                        especially a party with no substantial connection with that jurisdiction,
                        bad faith in the institution of the proceedings, or the institution of
                        proceedings which are bound to fail; extreme inconvenience caused by the
                        foreign proceedings; multiplicity of actions, especially where the foreign
                        action might spawn further consequential litigation which might not be
                        reconcilable with the foreign decision; <b>bringing
                            proceedings which interfere with or undermine the control of the English
                            court of its own process</b>; <b>bringing
                            proceedings which could and should have formed part of an English action
                            brought earlier</b>; bringing proceedings for no good reason in a
                        court which will disregard an express choice of English law.”
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The factors emphasised above suggest that in
                    assessing whether the respondent to an application had been vexatious or
                    oppressive, the Court may be permitted to look at other factors, such as its
                    ability to control its own proceedings and whether there is a risk that the
                    failure to grant an anti-suit injunction (or other associated relief, e.g. an
                    election) could undermine the control of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the same vein, it may be useful to refer to
                    the fairly recent decision of the English Court of Appeal in <em>Masri v Consolidated Contractors International (UK) Ltd &amp; Ors (No
                        3)</em> [2008] EWCA Civ 625 (“<em>Masri</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff had succeeded in an
                    English action in proving that he had an interest in an oil concession in Yemen.
                    The judgment debtors, who were incorporated in Lebanon, had submitted to the
                    jurisdiction of the English court in that claim. The judgment debtors, who did
                    not pay any part of the judgment debt, subsequently brought an action in Yemen
                    for a declaration that they were not liable to the plaintiff. The Court of
                    Appeal granted an anti-suit injunction restraining the proceedings in Yemen. In
                    delivering the judgment of the Court, Lawrence Collins LJ made the following
                    observations at [82], [83] [85] and [100] of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“82    I do not accept the judgment debtors’
                            argument that there is a principle […] that the English court

                            the subject of an English judgment adverse to the person seeking
                            relitigate abroad. <b>It has been established since at
                                least 1837 that the fact that the respondent is seeking to

                                judicata between himself and the applicant by reason of an English
                                judgment can be a sufficient ground for the grant of an anti-suit
                                injunction</b>.[…]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">83    In <em>Bank of Tokyo Ltd v Karoon
                                (Note)</em> [1987] AC 45, 63, Robert Goff LJ
                            referred to the <b>public interest in the finality of
                                litigation, and said that there were authorities in England and the
                                United States in which courts had granted injunctions restraining
                                persons properly amenable to their jurisdiction from relitigating
                                matters which had already been the subject of a judgment of the

                            has submitted) from seeking to relitigate the same issues
                        abroad.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100    […]It is consistent with principle for an

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In my view, these passages serve to highlight
                    the importance of the principle of finality in legal proceedings. The need for
                    the Court to protect its jurisdiction, processes and judgments by issuing
                    injunctions in appropriate cases is a well-established one. I would go further
                    to say that if the need for finality as well as the need for the Court to
                    protect its jurisdiction, processes and judgments are so important as to warrant
                    the grant of an anti-suit injunction in appropriate cases, a fortiori, it is an
                    important consideration for the Court to bear in mind when deciding whether the
                    Court should turn to an equitable relief which falls short or shy of an
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Apart from these legal principles to be
                    considered by the Court when it is faced with an application for an anti-suit
                    injunction, it is also pertinent to consider the situations in which the Court
                    may order that a party be put to an election. In <em>Yusen Air
                        &amp; Sea Service (S) Pte Ltd v KLM Royal Dutch Airlines</em> [1999]
                    4 SLR 21 (“<em>Yusen Air</em>”),
                    the Court of Appeal considered this issue at [27] and [34] of its
                    judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“27    In our judgment, when a plaintiff sues the
                            same defendant in two or more different jurisdictions over the same
                            subject matter, the defendant can take up an application to compel the
                            plaintiff to make an election as to which set of proceedings he wishes
                            to pursue. For the purposes of an election, the considerations of forum
                            conveniens do not come into play. However, the defendant would need to
                            demonstrate <b>a duplicity of actions in the different
                                jurisdictions. Once this is established, the burden of proof then
                                shifts to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of the concurrent
                                proceedings by showing ‘very unusual circumstances’. If
                                the plaintiff fails to demonstrate such unusual circumstances, he
                                would have to make an election</b>. […]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    It is also our considered view that the
                            plaintiff’s election is not the only way to resolve this issue.
                            Apart from compelling the plaintiff to elect, it remains open to the
                            defendant to take up an application for a stay of local proceedings or a
                            restraint of foreign proceedings if the defendant wishes to have the
                            action tried in one of the jurisdictions where the plaintiff has
                            commenced an action.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     This case stands for the proposition that
                    where an applicant for an anti-suit injunction is able to demonstrate that there
                    is a duplicity of proceedings in Singapore and the foreign jurisdiction, the
                    burden shifts to the respondent to justify the continuance of concurrent
                    proceedings by showing “very unusual circumstances”. If the
                    respondent in the application is unable to do so, then the Court may order him
                    to make an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Finally, as cited in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above, the decision in <em>Main-Line</em> provides an analysis for the reason as to why a party
                    may be put to an election: namely, to prevent double recovery, where there are
                    alternative and inconsistent remedies, the plaintiff must choose or elect
                    between those remedies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The issues may be considered in three broad
                    areas. First, I propose to deal with the two (what I term)
                    “threshold” issues of duplicity and clean hands presented by
                    counsel for Beckkett. Next, I will come to the crux of the decision, viz. how
                    the Court’s discretion ought to be exercised on the issue of whether an
                    anti-suit injunction ought to be granted. Third and finally, in the event that
                    the Court finds that an anti-suit injunction ought not be granted, I will
                    evaluate whether the Court should nevertheless order Beckkett to elect between
                    the Indonesian and the Singapore proceedings and if so, the form and terms that
                    such an order for election should take.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Special Facts Present in the Present Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Before I turn to the substantive analysis, I
                    should point out three facts in the present application which stood out in my
                    mind. First, Beckkett commenced the Indonesian suit while the parties were
                    awaiting the Singapore Court of Appeal’s decision. Based on a survey of
                    the reported cases, it is quite rare to find a party (such as Beckkett)
                    commencing a foreign proceeding when the local proceedings are at a very
                    advanced stage, viz. where parties are waiting for the outcome of an appeal to
                    the highest Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Second, the Bank’s application for an
                    anti-suit injunction was likewise taken out when the Indonesian proceedings were
                    at a fairly advanced stage. When the application was taken out, the parties had
                    gone through in Indonesia both a challenge on jurisdictional grounds as well as
                    a hearing on the merits of the action. At the point of the application, the
                    parties were waiting for the outcome of the appeal to the High Court of Jakarta.
                    As at the date of this judgment, Beckkett had intimated that it wished to appeal
                    further further to the Supreme Court of Jakarta (the Second Indonesian Appeal).
                    Much has been said about the lateness of the Bank’s application which I
                    have summarised above and will not repeat here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Third, given the reliefs sought by Beckkett in
                    the Indonesian proceedings and the judgment of the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    awarding damages which are to be assessed, Beckkett’s rights to a remedy
                    are presently in a state of flux in both jurisdictions, given that the quantum
                    of damages has not been fixed in Singapore and relief has not been granted in
                    its favour (thus far) in the Indonesian Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Against the backdrop of these three facts
                    which stand out in my mind for the purposes of this application, I now turn to
                    the substantive analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there is a duplicity of proceedings in Indonesia and
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Beckkett sought to dispose of the application
                    by first submitting that the Indonesian proceedings and the proceedings in
                    Singapore are not duplicitous. The essence of their submissions lie in the
                    ostensibly well-crafted argument that the causes of action in the Singapore
                    proceedings were illegality, breach of contract and conspiracy, whereas in
                    Indonesia, the cause of action is purely the illegality of the Sale Agreement.
                    References were made to the Bank’s Respondent’s Case where the Bank
                    appeared to have conceded that Beckkett did not pursue its case on illegality
                    before the Singapore Courts. The argument also sought to distinguish between
                    illegality being a “mere ingredient” of Beckkett’s cause of
                    action in conspiracy (in Singapore) as opposed to its being the foundation of
                    Beckkett’s cause of action in Indonesia (Beckkett’s Indonesian
                    action being based on the Bank’s failure to comply with Articles 1155 and
                    1156 of the ICC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As attractive as the arguments on this issue
                    appear at first blush, I cannot agree with Beckkett. To my mind, the flaw in
                    this argument lies in the fact that it fails to see the forest for the trees. By
                    focussing on what I may loosely term as the “nitty-gritties” of
                    what each set of cause(s) of action entails, Beckkett has obfuscated the
                    fundamental point that the reliefs sought in both jurisdictions vis-à-vis the
                    return of the Pledged Shares are essentially the same. The issues may be
                    masqueraded in different forms but, stripped of the unnecessary details, the
                    following identical features of both sets of proceedings may be distilled. In
                    Singapore, Beckkett sought to rely on a failure to comply with Articles 1155 and
                    1156 as the fundamental underlying basis for claiming that the Pledged Shares
                    ought to be returned. One must not forget that at para 45B of its Amended
                    Statement of Claim in the Singapore proceedings, Beckkett did plead that the
                    Sale Agreement was unlawful by the laws of Indonesia. In Indonesia, Beckkett has
                    used an identical approach: a failure to comply with Articles 1155 and 1156 is
                    the fundamental underlying basis of its cause of action there. Where, as in this
                    case, the reliefs sought are the same, where the parties are the same, where the
                    underlying bases for the causes of action are the same, and where the underlying
                    transaction is the same, in both jurisdictions, I am of the view that the
                    present situation has gone beyond mere multiplicity of proceedings and has
                    entered into the realm of duplicitous proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Further, I found Beckkett’s reliance on
                    the case of <em>Transtech Electronics</em> misguided.
                    There, Judith Prakash J found that there was only some overlapping of issues
                    between the action in Singapore and the action in New York: see [20] of the
                    judgment. The present case is vastly different from the situation found there.
                    Here, as I have explained, the same plaintiff is seeking the same relief against
                    the same defendant, and the relief in question is one that has been sought in
                    Singapore previously but without success. While Beckkett may not be faulted in
                    commencing the action in Indonesia while it was waiting for the Singapore Court
                    of Appeal’s judgment, I am of the view that once the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment was rendered, or once a reasonable period of time
                    thereafter had lapsed (e.g. for the parties to digest the impact and import of
                    the Court of Appeal judgment), Beckkett’s justification for maintaining
                    the Indonesian action out of prudence evaporated. In such a situation, it must
                    be said that there were duplicitous proceedings. Further, and before I leave the
                    decision of <em>Transtech Electronics</em>, it is to be
                    noted that in <em>Transtech Electronics</em>, the
                    proceedings in both jurisdictions were at a fairly early stage. That is very
                    different from the situation in this case where, as I have highlighted above,
                    the proceedings in Singapore had reached an advanced stage at the point when
                    Beckkett commenced the Indonesian proceedings. While Beckkett may not be faulted
                    for commencing the proceedings out of prudence before the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment was rendered, I am of the view that a situation where
                    there were clearly duplicitous actions being maintained in the two jurisdictions
                    arose when (or, as just mentioned, within a reasonable period of time after) the
                    Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     For the reasons which I shall come to below as
                    the analysis develops, I agree with the approach adopted by Chan Seng Onn J in
                        <em>Multi-Code Electronics Industries (M) Bhd &amp; Anor v
                        Toh Chun Toh Gordon &amp; Ors</em> [2008] SGHC 193
                        (“<em>Multi-Code</em>”), particularly, at
                    [32] onwards of the judgment where the case of <em>Australian
                        Commercial Research and Development Ltd v ANZ McCaughan Merchant Bank
                        Ltd</em> [1989] 3 All ER 65 (“<em>Australian Commercial Research and Development Ltd</em>”),
                    which was cited with approval by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Yusen Air</em>, was discussed. As Chan J rightly pointed out
                    at [33] of his judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[I]t is important to discern between three different situations:
                        (a) where the same plaintiff “A” sues the same defendant
                        “B in two jurisdictions on substantially the same causes of action;
                        (b) where the plaintiff “A” sues the defendant
                        “B” in Singapore but “A” is the defendant in a
                        suit brought by “B” in a foreign jurisdiction; and (c) where
                        “A” is the defendant in Singapore but is the plaintiff in the
                        suit in the foreign jurisdiction, and “B” is the plaintiff in
                        Singapore but the defendant in the foreign suit. Clearly, the legal
                        principles applicable for situation (a) would be quite different from those
                        applicable for situations (b) and (c).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Like Chan J did on the facts of <em>Multi-Code</em>, I am prepared to find that the present facts
                    gave rise to situation (a) as described in the above quotation. Applying the
                    test in <em>Yusen Air</em>, once the defendant has
                    established that the actions in the two jurisdictions are duplicitous (i.e.
                    situation (a)), the burden shifts to the plaintiff to justify the continuance of
                    the concurrent proceedings by showing “very unusual
                    circumstances”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Consequently, I dismiss Beckkett’s
                    arguments on this threshold issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Bank came to the Court with clean hands</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The next threshold issue that Beckkett
                    identified was whether the Bank came to the Court with clean hands. Overall,
                    while I appreciate that there may have been some delay between the time when the
                    Bank knew about the First Indonesian Appeal and the time when the Bank took out
                    the present application, that is insufficient (for the reasons which I shall
                    expand on below) to establish that the Bank failed to come to the Court with
                    clean hands. I will deal with each of the arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     To my mind, the argument that the Bank has
                    been blowing hot and cold is a misplaced one. The submission in the Bank’s
                    Appellant’s Case has been taken entirely out of its proper and appropriate
                    context. One argument in a tirade of arguments, attempting to cover all bases,
                    does not amount to blowing hot and cold. After a due and careful reading of the
                    relevant passages in the Bank’s Appellant’s Case, it is my
                    considered view that the Bank did not put Beckkett to a “dare”,
                    and the Bank did not – through those submissions – openly challenge
                    Beckkett to bring a suit in Indonesia. A reasonable and objective reading of
                    those passages must be achieved by setting the passages in their proper context
                    of a long and antagonistic history in the parties’ litigation in
                    Singapore. Having defended the claims in Singapore all the way to the Court of
                    Appeal, it would be a leap of faith and logic to suggest that the Bank, those
                    few lines of submissions in its Appellant’s Case as highlighted by
                    Beckkett, effectively issued an open challenge to Beckkett to bring a suit in
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     To my mind, the facts and circumstances here
                    are different and distinguishable from those found in <em>John
                        Reginald Stott</em>. There, the party who was alleged to have blown
                    hot and cold had filed a quarterly report stating in no uncertain terms that it
                    intended to “vigorously contest the allegations” raised in the
                    foreign (coincidentally Indonesian) action and that it had further written a
                    letter to inform its customers that “legal matters at issue [would] be
                    decided in the Indonesian courts”: see [51] of the Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     A logical and rational distinction can be made
                    between statements made by parties in company reports and open letters to
                    customers on one hand, and comprehensive and vigorous arguments made in written
                    submissions on the other. Reading the passage highlighted by counsel for
                    Beckkett (as quoted in <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above), one
                    witnesses the evident work of a diligent counsel in an attempt to make his
                    client’s submissions as thorough as possible: see the use of “even
                    if” in the statement. In such an instance where the statements in issue
                    were made contingent upon a hypothetical scenario, I would be extremely hesitant
                    and reluctant to find that there has been a clear case of inconsistent positions
                    being taken by the Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Next, I come to the issue of the Bank’s
                    failure to appeal against the Indonesian Court’s decision on jurisdiction
                    (viz. the decision on the Absolute Competency Exception application). Beckkett
                    relied heavily on this fact to argue that the Bank could not be allowed to blow
                    hot and cold by failing to challenge the Indonesian Court’s finding on
                    jurisdiction on the one hand and seeking the Court’s equitable relief of
                    an anti-suit injunction in Singapore on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     This argument has its attractiveness. A very
                    prudent party in a foreign proceeding who has lost an interlocutory application
                    on grounds of jurisdiction may appeal against that unfavourable decision.
                    However, to my mind, to apply that very high standard to the Bank would not be
                    reasonable. After its application on grounds of jurisdiction was dismissed, the
                    Bank had two options: defend the main action or appeal against the decision on
                    jurisdiction. Viewed with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it is very easy
                    – and indeed, tempting – to find that the Bank could and should have
                    appealed against that decision. However, in my judgment, that would be expecting
                    too much from the Bank. A reasonable litigant in the Bank’s position could
                    do either. Indeed, one may be so bold as to suggest that the Bank, in deciding
                    not to appeal against that decision, may have been prompted by an interest in
                    seeing a speedy resolution of its dispute in Indonesia. Seen in that light, I
                    find it very difficult to rely on the lack of an appeal as a basis to find that
                    the Bank did not come to the Singapore Courts with clean hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Next, Beckkett argued that the Bank had waived
                    its right to an election. To that end, Beckkett relied on the decisions in
                        <em>The Delta</em> and <em>Morrison
                        Rose</em>. In an effort to keep this judgment brief and to the point,
                    I shall merely state that I find the reliance on both cases misplaced. In
                        <em>The Delta</em>, the factual matrix was quite
                    different from that found in the present case. First, the order of the parties
                    was reversed in that the plaintiff (the owners of <em>The
                        Delta</em>) who had obtained judgment in the foreign Court were being
                    sued in England by the party which had been the defendant in the foreign Court
                    (the owners of the <em>Erminia Foscolo</em>). In short, the
                    roles of the parties were reversed in the two sets of proceedings. The owners of
                        <em>The Delta</em> (the defendants in the English
                    proceedings) sought to argue that the foreign judgment amounted to an estoppel.
                    The Court roundly dismissed that argument but found that <em>lis
                        alibi pendens</em> was established. The Court then held that if the
                    defendants in the English action (the owners of <em>The
                        Delta</em>) wanted to avoid having two suits against them for the same
                    matter brought to a hearing, they should have put the plaintiff in the English
                    action (the owners of the <em>Erminia Foscolo</em>) to an
                    election. Moreover, in the decision of <em>The Delta</em>,
                    much comment was made by the Court about how the owners of the <em>Erminia Foscolo</em> had not participated in the foreign
                    proceedings and the fact that the foreign judgment was a judgment obtained in
                    default. Given the present interest in promoting international comity, I would
                    be surprised if the sentiments of the Court in <em>The
                        Delta</em> were pursued with similar vigour in the present era. In any
                    event, the case stands not so much for the proposition that there had been
                    waiver, but that where there is a finding of <em>lis alibis
                        pendens</em>, a party may be put to an election between its remedies
                    in the two jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The criticisms against the decision in
                        <em>Morrison Rose</em> may be levied along similar
                    lines. In essence, given the rather doubtful value of <em>The
                        Delta</em> as an authority, I was not impressed by the fact that
                        <em>Morrison Rose</em> relied on the passages of
                    doubtful value in <em>The Delta</em>. With all these
                    problems, I find great difficulty in relying on these two cases as authority for
                    a finding that the Bank had waived its rights to an election. As I alluded to
                    above, the Bank’s conduct in defending the action on the merits in
                    Indonesia was reasonable and cannot be faulted. Seen in that light, I am unable
                    to agree with Beckkett’s arguments that there was a waiver by the Bank of
                    the right to an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I now come to the issue of delay. This was
                    perhaps the most thorny issue for the Bank under the “clean hands”
                    arguments. To my mind, the period of delay cannot be said to be an insignificant
                    one. Given the well-established principles that delay can be a factor to
                    consider in equity, one has to pay particular attention to this
                    allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Taking a step back and looking at the conduct
                    of the parties as a whole, and after a thorough analysis of the situation, I
                    take the view that, while there may have been some delay on the part of the Bank
                    in bringing this application, that delay falls short of a successful attack on
                    the lack of bona fides on the Bank’s part. One has to evaluate the
                    situation in both jurisdictions and not just the situation in Indonesia. While
                    the action was afoot in Indonesia, the parties were similarly preparing with
                    haste to proceed with the assessment of damages in Singapore. It cannot be said
                    that the Bank, in taking some time before bringing the present application, had
                    been sitting on its laurels and doing nothing. Moreover, to my mind, the delay
                    is not such a significant one that the Court can reasonably and safely impute a
                    certain level of mischief or bad faith on the Bank’s part. Bearing in mind
                    all the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that the delay –
                    although not insignificant – is not sufficient to warrant a finding that
                    the Bank had come to the Court with unclean hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Therefore, on this second issue, I am unable
                    to agree with Beckkett as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the requirements for an anti-suit injunction were
                met</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I now come to the crux of the application,
                    viz. whether the Bank has met the substantive requirements for an anti-suit
                    injunction to be ordered on the present facts and circumstances. I propose to
                    adopt the framework in <em>John Reginald</em>, which
                    identified five factors (adapting those found in <em>Evergreen
                        International SA</em> (see <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>
                    above)) for the Courts to consider in deciding whether an anti-suit injunction
                    ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the parties are amenable to the Singapore Courts’
                jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     To my mind, this factor may be most easily
                    dealt with. Here, we find the parties in a situation where they had proceeded
                    for a period of no less than 5 years before the Singapore Courts, leading up to
                    appeals before the Court of Appeal which were heard and disposed of. Given that
                    the parties had participated at great lengths in the Singapore proceedings, it
                    can be said with great certainty that they are definitely amenable to the
                    Singapore Courts’ jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Singapore is the natural forum for the dispute </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     This issue is a close one for a number of
                    reasons. If one looks solely at the very micro issue of the return of the
                    Pledged Shares, counsel for Beckkett may not be wrong in saying that Indonesia
                    has become the natural forum for the dispute, relying on the decision in
                        <em>Shell International Petroleum Co Ltd v Coral Oil Co Ltd
                        (No 2)</em> [1999] 2 Lloyds Rep 601. Counsel for Beckkett is
                    also not wrong in identifying the legal principle that a forum which was not
                    initially the natural forum for a dispute may evolve through the course of
                    litigation to become the natural forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    However, assessing the matter as a whole, I
                    cannot agree with counsel for Beckkett that Indonesia has become the natural
                    forum of the dispute. To my mind, as with the issue on whether there are
                    duplicitous proceedings, one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees.
                    The issue of whether Singapore or Indonesia is the natural forum <em>at this point in time</em> must be evaluated bearing in mind
                    all the facts and circumstances as well as the history of the litigation between
                    the parties. What Beckkett cannot run away from is the fact that the parties
                    have a more than 5-year long history of litigation in the Singapore Courts but a
                    less than 1-year history of litigation in the Indonesian proceedings. Granted,
                    the Indonesian proceedings are at a fairly advanced stage in Indonesia now.
                    However, one does not and should not evaluate which is the natural forum based
                    purely on the advanced nature of the proceedings. One also has to bear in mind
                    where the parties have litigated in the past <em>and, more
                        importantly</em>, whether they are continuing to litigate there at the
                    present moment. Evaluating all the facts and circumstances as a whole, I am led
                    to the inevitable conclusion that both the history and the present point to
                    Singapore being the natural forum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    As I mentioned above, there were
                    supplementary written submissions exchanged on this issue after the hearing.
                    Without going into the details of those submissions, which I have gone through
                    in detail, I am of the view that those supplementary submissions – as
                    detailed and diligently prepared as they may have been – do not detract
                    from my overall impression that Singapore is the natural forum of the
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Bank had shown a <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">prima
                    facie</span> case that Beckkett’s actions were vexatious or
                oppressive</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The next two factors are probably the most
                    thorny issues and warrant the most careful deliberation. In essence, bearing in
                    mind the authorities which I cited above on what could amount to vexatious or
                    oppressive conduct, I am of the view that the Bank has established a <em>prima facie</em> case that the conduct of Beckkett had been
                    vexatious and oppressive, but that it has only barely done so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The key factor in my mind is the conduct of
                    Beckkett after the Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment was rendered. When
                    Beckkett first commenced the Indonesian proceedings, it did so while the
                    judgment of the Singapore Court of Appeal was reserved. Seen in that light, up
                    to the point of the Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment being rendered,
                    it could be said that the Beckkett’s conduct was not vexatious or
                    oppressive because it did not know what the outcome of the Singapore action
                    would be. A reasonable and prudent litigant could, as Beckkett did, bring a suit
                    in Indonesia in the hope that it may be able to get the relief that it prays for
                    in Indonesia before the Singapore judgment is rendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    However, once the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    judgment’s was rendered, or shortly therefore, things took on a very
                    different complexion. The Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment, in
                    essence, dismissed Beckkett’s relief for a return of the Pledged Shares
                    and ordered a remedy of damages only. Armed with that final judgment of the
                    Singapore Courts, it is my view that it was vexatious and oppressive on the part
                    of Beckkett to concurrently maintain the Indonesian proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In making that finding, I am acutely aware
                    of Beckkett’s submissions that right up to the point of enforcing its
                    judgment, it does not have to elect between the two remedies. However, for three
                    reasons, I find that such an argument is insufficient to defeat the claim that
                    there was a prima facie case of vexatious or oppressive conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    First, the prejudice to both parties in
                    pursuing concurrent proceedings is not capable of compensation by any order of
                    costs. In the course of oral submissions, counsel for both parties candidly
                    mooted with the Court on whether the prejudice to both parties in terms of (what
                    I termed) “burning the candles at both ends” could be compensated
                    by an order of costs. After careful reflection, it is my view that the prejudice
                    to the Bank of defending both actions is not one that can be met by a just order
                    of costs. It is trite that in practice, any order of costs by the other party,
                    even on an indemnity basis, is unlikely to compensate a party for its entire
                    solicitor-and-client costs. If Beckkett wants to pursue both remedies as a
                    matter of legal right and while it may be entitled to do so, it cannot pursue
                    that right at the cost of creating a loss that is quite incapable of
                    compensation on a full indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Second, as rightly identified by the
                    decision in <em>Masri</em>, the Courts, in evaluating the
                    issue of vexatious or oppressive conduct, are not limited to the conduct of the
                    immediate parties. The Courts are entitled to take into account the importance
                    of the principle of finality in legal proceedings as well as the need for Courts
                    to protect their jurisdiction, processes and judgments by issuing injunctions in
                    appropriate cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Applying those principles to the present
                    facts, I am of the view that part of the Court’s protection of its
                    jurisdiction, processes and judgments, as well as its preservation of the
                    principle of finality requires a finding that Beckkett’s persistence in
                    both jurisdictions <em>after</em> the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment was rendered, is vexatious and oppressive. Quite simply,
                    the Singapore Court of Appeal had dismissed Beckkett’s claim for a return
                    of the Pledged Shares. To condone Beckkett’s persistence in the Indonesian
                    proceedings without any sanction runs the risk that Beckkett may end up with a
                    remedy that is inconsistent with the finding of the Singapore Court of Appeal.
                    That would erode the sanctity to be found in the principle of finality, and may
                    even send a wrong signal to future litigants that a Singapore Court of Appeal
                    judgment is not worth much if one has sufficiently deep pockets to pursue
                    another remedy in a foreign (and probably more favourable) jurisdiction after
                    exhausting all avenues in Singapore and failing here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Related to that point is the third issue of
                    a possible waste of judicial resources. By that, I mean a possible waste of
                    judicial resources in either Singapore or Indonesia. This, to my mind, is a real
                    and possible risk that can arise if there is no finding that Beckkett’s
                    conduct in continuing the Indonesian proceedings is vexatious or oppressive. By
                    allowing both sets of proceedings to continue abreast, one runs the inevitable
                    risk that one set of judicial resources will be wasted. If Beckkett is not put
                    to an election now, the Singapore Courts run a very real risk that Beckkett
                    could elect to pursue its remedy in Indonesia at a later point and thereby
                    render all judicial resources expended in Singapore hitherto (up to the point of
                    eventual election) a waste.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Bearing in mind these three reasons which
                    turn on the facts that have arisen in this application, I am of the view that
                    the ends of justice require a finding that the conduct of Beckkett in pursuing
                    both sets of remedies concurrently after the Singapore Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment was rendered has been oppressive and vexatious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Beckkett has discharged its burden to show that it would be
                unjust to grant an anti-suit injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I now turn to an evaluation of whether
                    Beckkett has discharged its burden of demonstrating that it would be unjust to
                    grant an anti-suit injunction. After due and careful consideration, I am of the
                    view that, given the possibly unique circumstances of the present case, Beckkett
                    has discharged its burden of demonstrating that it would be unjust for an
                    anti-suit injunction to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The key issue to be considered is whether an
                    anti-suit injunction would deprive Beckkett of a remedy which it is entitled to
                    pursue under the law. For the reasons mentioned above, Beckkett is correct in
                    saying that it is entitled to make an election of its remedy only at the point
                    of enforcement. To order an injunction right now would be tantamount to staying
                    the Indonesian proceedings; this may in turn rob Beckkett of the fruits of the
                    labour that it has sown thus far in the course of the Indonesian proceedings.
                    Bearing in mind that Beckkett cannot be faulted for commencing those proceedings
                    (while waiting for the Singapore Court of Appeal’s decision), but can only
                    be faulted for maintaining those proceedings after the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal’s decision was rendered, it would be unjust for an anti-suit
                    injunction to be granted now. Indeed, it does give force to Beckkett’s
                    arguments that such an order would be tantamount to robbing Beckkett of the
                    right of a successful appeal in Indonesia. Given the present state of
                    international comity, a Singapore Court would be loathe to deprive a litigant of
                    any rights that it may rightfully obtain in a foreign
                jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Therefore, bearing in mind the potential
                    prejudice to Beckkett, I am prepared to find that Beckkett has demonstrated that
                    it would be unjust for an anti-suit injunction to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Beckkett ought to be put to an election</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether it is satisfactory to leave matters in <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">status quo</span> (and without an injunction)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Nevertheless, the enquiry cannot and should
                    not end with a dismissal of the Bank’s application. To let things remain
                    in status quo would also lead to an unjust result. The Bank would have to burn
                    its candles on both ends. The Singapore Courts run a risk that the finality of
                    their judgments is not accorded its proper sanctity. More importantly, there is
                    a real risk that the judicial resources in Singapore may be wasted if Beckkett
                    eventually elects for the remedy given in Indonesia (if it succeeds there in the
                    Second Indonesian Appeal). The Court’s discretion to enjoin a party from
                    proceeding in another jurisdiction to protect the jurisdiction of the local
                    Court is not limited to enjoining the party from proceeding in the foreign
                    jurisdiction. It necessarily extends to an order for an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    To my mind, while Beckkett has demonstrated
                    that it would be unjust to grant an anti-suit injunction, it has not
                    demonstrated that it would be just to leave things in status quo either. To
                    borrow the language of <em>Yusen Air</em> and <em>Australian Commercial Research and Development Ltd</em>, it
                    is my view that Beckkett has not demonstrated such special circumstances in the
                    present case that it ought not to be put to an election. To put it in a positive
                    form, it is my view that Beckkett ought to be put to an election now between its
                    remedies in Singapore and its remedies in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether undertakings are good enough </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Before I turn to the issue of the form that
                    the election should take, I should deal with Beckkett’s submission that
                    undertakings would be sufficient. Looking at the facts as a whole, I fail to see
                    how any undertaking would be sufficient to address the potential prejudice, both
                    to the parties as well as to the sanctity of the principle of finality in the
                    Singapore Courts. Simply put, to my mind, the prejudice to the Court’s
                    jurisdiction, processes and judgments is not something that is capable of an
                    undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Form of the Order for an Election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I next turn to the nature of the order for
                    an election. Counsel for Beckkett submitted that Beckkett should be permitted to
                    make the election only at the point when it enforces judgment. That way, the
                    Bank can be assured that there will be no double recovery and Beckkett will be
                    allowed to pursue all the remedies that are available to it under the laws of
                    both countries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I am unable to agree with counsel for
                    Beckkett that that would be a just and equitable outcome for the purposes of
                    this application. At para 235 of its Written Submissions, Beckkett
                    submitted that the case authorities show that a plaintiff may postpone election
                    for a reasonable period, provided that such delay is necessary in order for the
                    plaintiff to make an informed choice between the alternative remedies available.
                    My views on this issue are these: in the colloquial context of choosing between
                    two remedies in one jurisdiction, that principle is well-established and must be
                    correct. However, where the choice is between different remedies in two
                    jurisdictions, <em>and where the Court in one jurisdiction has
                        decided by way of a final judgment of its highest Court</em> that a
                    particular remedy is not available, it throws the issue into a different light.
                    It is no longer just a matter of making an informed choice between two remedies,
                    but whether the plaintiff should be allowed to be in a position to take its
                    chances in the other jurisdiction (Indonesia) and then cherry-pick between the
                    two sets of remedies. To my mind, the principle that election comes at the point
                    of entering judgment cannot be turned on its head and taken to the extreme by
                    allowing rgw plaintiff to pursue the same remedy in two jurisdictions <em>after one jurisdiction has decided that it is not entitled to that
                        remedy</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In my view, an order for an election has to
                    be one which is final and irrevocable after giving Beckkett sufficient time to
                    decide which of the two jurisdictions it wishes to pursue its claim in. Once
                    Beckkett makes that election, it signals to the jurisdiction which it elects
                    that it will abide by whatever outcome that jurisdiction provides for it. Given
                    the present state of proceedings, if it chooses Indonesia, Beckkett will allow
                    the Supreme Court of Indonesia to decide whether it is entitled to a return of
                    the Pledged Shares. Once it elects that remedy, it will not be allowed to pursue
                    the assessment of damages in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Conversely, if it elects for Singapore,
                    Beckkett ought not to be allowed to pursue its Indonesian proceedings. Steps
                    would have to be taken by Beckkett to withdraw from the Indonesian proceedings
                    (either actively, or by allowing the appeal to lapse, e.g. through the effluxion
                    of time, if the Indonesian Court’s rules so allow) so that the Singapore
                    Courts as well as the Bank are assured that the orders set out in this decision
                    are rendered effective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    To my mind, only an order for a final and
                    irrevocable election within a reasonable time would allow Beckkett to pursue its
                    remedies without the added costs to the Bank or to the Courts of both
                    jurisdictions as a result of Beckkett’s vexatious and oppressive conduct
                    in persisting with its actions in both Indonesia and Singapore. While Beckkett
                    may have demonstrated that it would be unjust for an anti-suit injunction to be
                    granted, it cannot evade from the reality that an order for an election is the
                    just and equitable order to move the litigation between the parties
                    forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In conclusion, I find that there are
                    duplicitous proceedings in Indonesia and Singapore. I also find that the Bank
                    did come to the Singapore Courts with clean hands and is therefore, contrary to
                    Beckkett’s submissions, entitled to equitable relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I further find that parties are amenable to
                    the jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts and that Singapore is the natural
                    forum. On the issue of vexatious and oppressive conduct, I am of the view that
                    the Bank has established – but just barely so – that the conduct of
                    Beckkett in maintaining suits in both Indonesia and Singapore after the
                    rendering of the Singapore Court of Appeal’s judgment, is vexatious and
                    oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    However, I agree with Beckkett that the
                    circumstances are such that it would be unjust for an anti-suit injunction to be
                    granted in the present application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Nevertheless, I come to the view that the
                    maintenance of the status quo with an outright dismissal of the Bank’s
                    application would not be tenable either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Therefore, I order Beckkett to make an
                    election between proceeding in Singapore for an assessment of damages and
                    pursuing its claim through further appeal(s) in Indonesia within 14 days from
                    the date of this judgment. I further order that this election shall be final and
                    irrevocable. This means that Beckkett shall not be allowed to make an election
                    contingent on the outcome of the Indonesian appellate proceedings. I will hear
                    parties on costs and any other consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Coda</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I have given due and careful consideration
                    to this chapter in the parties’ long and arduous legal saga. More than 5
                    years’ worth of legal effort has been spent in Singapore pursuing the
                    remedies between the parties. Much ink has been spilt in the comprehensive
                    judgments given by both the Singapore High Court and the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal, not to mention the judgments rendered by our Indonesian
                    counterparts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    With those judgments at hand, the parties
                    are now at the tail end of evaluating the damages to be paid to Beckkett for its
                    claim. Rather than burning the parties’ candles at both ends, it is my
                    fervent hope that the orders that I have made in this application will
                    facilitate the making of a wise and practical decision on the part of the
                    parties.</p>
