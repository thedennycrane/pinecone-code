<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns an application by a receiver
                    appointed by a judgment creditor to claim for “bonus” shares in a
                    Singapore listed company that the judgment debtor was allegedly entitled to.
                    However the application was challenged at the threshold level that the receiver
                    lacked <em>locus standi</em> to claim the
                    “bonus” shares as the receivership order did not purport to permit
                    the receiver to bring the action on behalf of the judgment debtor. Instead the
                    receivership order merely authorised the action to be brought in the name of the
                    judgment creditor and indeed the application was filed on that
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In addition, the application was also opposed on
                    the merits that the judgment debtor was not entitled to the
                    “bonus” shares in the first place and if it did, the right had
                    been transferred to another party in any event. After hearing the parties, I
                    dismissed the application both on the <em>locus standi</em>
                    issue as well as on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In dismissing the application, I had provided my
                    brief oral grounds which I have elaborated below. This decision will examine the
                    circumstances under which a receiver could be appointed by way of equitable
                    execution in respect of a chose in action allegedly vested in a judgment debtor.
                    The facts of this case were rather complex and needed to be set out in some
                    detail in order to fully understand the nature and origin of the application. It
                    underwent several routes with a view to achieving its objective and along the
                    way, the pivotal <em>locus standi</em> issue was raised but
                    unfortunately, it remained unresolved when the application finally came before
                    me for determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff, Tan Holdings Pte Ltd (“Tan
                    Holdings”), is a company incorporated in Singapore. On 20 June 2006, Tan
                    Holdings was placed under insolvent voluntary liquidation pursuant to section
                    290 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Mr Bob Yap Cheng Ghee
                    (“Mr Bob Yap”) of KPMG Advisory Services Pte Ltd
                    (“KPMG”) was appointed as the sole liquidator of Tan
                    Holdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first defendant, Prosperity Steel (Asia)
                    Company Limited (“Prosperity”), is a company incorporated in Hong
                    Kong. It is currently inactive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The second defendant, Abterra Limited
                    (“Abterra”), is a company incorporated in Singapore, and is listed
                    on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. Abterra
                    was formerly known as Hua Kok International Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The third defendant, General Nice Resources
                    (Hong Kong) Limited (“GNR”), is also a company incorporated in
                    Hong Kong. Unlike Prosperity, GNR is presently still an active
                company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Strategic Subscription and New Business Agreement between
                Prosperity and Abterra</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sometime in 2004, Abterra ran into financial
                    difficulties. As part of Abterra’s efforts to restructure its debts, it
                    entered into a Scheme of Arrangement (“the Abterra Scheme”) with
                    its creditors. The Abterra Scheme was sanctioned by an order of court dated 12
                    January 2005 and Mr Bob Yap was appointed as the Scheme Manager of the Abterra
                    Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Prior to the sanction of the Abterra Scheme, on
                    30 August 2004, as part of Abterra’s efforts to raise capital, Abterra had
                    entered into a Strategic Subscription and New Business Agreement
                    (“SSA”) with Prosperity. The SSA provided that Prosperity would
                    invest S$6 million in Abterra by subscribing for shares in Abterra with the
                    result that Prosperity became its majority shareholder that ultimately
                    translated into a 70% stake in Abterra. Essentially, Prosperity was to be the
                    “white knight” of Abterra.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Under the Abterra Scheme, “Contingent
                    Creditors” were to receive “Contingent Conversion Shares”
                    in lieu of their claims against Abterra upon the crystallization of
                    “Contingent Liabilities” as defined under the SSA. In order to
                    preserve Prosperity’s 70% shareholding in Abterra, Prosperity was entitled
                    to call on Abterra for the allotment of “Further Strategic Shares”
                    (“FSS”) whenever “Contingent Conversion Shares” were
                    allotted to the “Contingent Creditors” under clause 8A.5 of the
                    SSA which provided, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 29 December 2004, before the court
                    sanctioned the Abterra Scheme, Prosperity and Abterra entered into the First

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Paragraph 2.9 of the First Supplementary SSA

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 14 March 2005, after the court had
                    sanctioned the Abterra Scheme, Prosperity and Abterra entered into a Second
                    Supplementary SSA to vary certain terms of the SSA as amended by the First
                    Supplementary SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Paragraph 3.11 of the Second Supplementary SSA
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.11  
              <u>Clause 8A.5</u>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The existing Clause 8A.5 shall be deleted and replaced with the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I pause to observe that the reference to the
                    “Agreed Period” in clause 8A.5 of the SSA was initially
                    removed <em>via</em> the First Supplementary SSA, but was
                    reinstated pursuant to the Second Supplementary SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 17 May 2005, Prosperity and Abterra entered
                    into a Third Supplementary SSA. However, as the Third Supplementary SSA did not
                    vary clause 8A.5 further, it is not relevant to the present
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Loan Agreement between Tan Holdings and Prosperity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The genesis of this application could be
                    traced to a Loan and Assignment Agreement dated 20 January 2005 (“the
                    Loan Agreement”) between Tan Holdings, Prosperity and Bumiputra Commerce
                    Bank Berhad, Singapore (“BCB”). Under the Loan Agreement,
                    Prosperity extended a loan of S$800,000 to Tan Holdings in exchange for which
                    Tan Holdings pledged 60 million shares that it held in Abterra to
                    Prosperity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Tan Holdings in turn used the S$800,000 loan
                    to purchase Abterra’s outstanding debt to BCB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Suit No 899 of 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A dispute eventually arose in relation to the
                    Loan Agreement that led to the commencement of Suit No 899 of 2008
                    (“S 899/2008”) on 28 November 2008 by the
                    liquidator of Tan Holdings (“the Liquidator”) against Prosperity
                    for breach of certain implied terms of the Loan Agreement. The details of the
                    Liquidator’s claim in S 899/2008 are strictly irrelevant to the present
                    application. Suffice it to say that Prosperity did not enter an appearance to S
                    899/2008, and consequently, on 27 February 2009, default judgment was
                    obtained by the Liquidator against Prosperity for the sum of some S$4.4
                    million.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons No 2983 of 2009: Receivership Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     To enforce the default judgment, on 2 July
                    2009, the Liquidator applied by way of an <em>ex parte</em>
                    summons before Judith Prakash J in Summons No 2983 of 2009 (“SUM
                    2983/2009”) and obtained an order (“the Receivership
                    Order”) appointing Mr Lai Seng Kwoon as receiver (“the
                    Receiver”) to receive the profits and moneys receivable in respect of
                    Prosperity’s interest in the FSS under the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Liquidator took the position that
                    Prosperity was entitled to 291,515,259 FSS which was derived as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, he relied on two
                        announcements made by Abterra dated 28 December 2007 and 24 December 2008 on
                        the allotments of Contingent Conversion Shares to Contingent
                        Creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Pursuant to the 28 December 2007 announcement under which United Overseas
                        Bank’s (“UOB”) claim for S$397,800.28 under a corporate
                        guarantee (“the 2007 UOB claim”) was admitted, Abterra
                        allotted 3,043,800 Contingent Conversion Shares to UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Pursuant to the 24 December 2008
                        announcement under which ECICS Credit and Guarantee Company (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd’s (“ECICS”) claim for S$9,307.36 under a performance
                        guarantee (“the ECICS claim”), UOB’s claim for
                        S$1,587,572.51 under a corporate guarantee (“the 2008 UOB
                        claim”) and Malayan Banking Berhad’s (“MBB”)
                        claim for S$1,084,728.97 under a corporate guarantee (“the MBB
                        claim”) were admitted, Abterra allotted a total of 121,891,311
                        Contingent Conversion Shares to the said Contingent
                    Creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Given
                        that seven FSS were to be allotted for every three Contingent Conversion
                        Shares under clause 8A.5 of the SSA, the total number of FSS that Prosperity

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Following the Receivership Order, the Receiver
                    wrote to Abterra to issue 78,694,000 FSS in satisfaction of the judgment debt.
                    In response, Abterra through its solicitor’s letter dated 13 August 2009,
                    declined to do so, <em>inter alia</em>, on the premise that
                    the Receivership Order did not empower the Receiver to request for the FSS on
                    behalf of Prosperity. It would appear that the <em>locus
                        standi</em> issue was flagged by Abterra at a very early
                stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons No 4903 of 2009: Construction of clause 8A.5 before Kan
                J</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Given Abterra’s refusal to allot the FSS
                    to the Receiver, the Liquidator took out Summons No 4903 of 2009 (“SUM
                    4903/2009”) on 1 October 2009 in S 899/2008 before Kan Ting Chiu J for
                    determination of the true and proper construction of clause 8A.5 as it stood
                    amended by the Second Supplementary SSA and that pending such determination, the
                    Receiver was not required to comply with paragraph 5 of the Receivership Order.
                    The application in SUM 4903/2009 was contested by both Abterra and GNR as
                    interested parties even though they were not direct parties to S
                    899/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At the hearing of SUM 4903/2009, Kan J noted
                    that since Abterra was not a party to S 899/2008, it was not desirable to make a
                    determination on the effect of clause 8A.5. The Liquidator then applied for
                    leave to withdraw SUM 4903/2009 so that a fresh application could be filed
                    for the same relief naming Abterra as a party. Kan J granted the leave sought
                    and ordered, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Sale and Purchase Agreement between Prosperity and GNR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At this juncture, I would pause to take note
                    of one other event. Prior to the commencement of S 899/2008, an intervening
                    development took place in relation to Prosperity’s shares in Abterra which
                    has a material bearing on the right to the FSS. On 1 September 2006, Prosperity
                    entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with GNR
                    whereby Prosperity sold some 1.337 billion shares it held in Abterra to GNR
                    at the price of about S$4.95 million. According to GNR, the sale took place
                    because Prosperity was looking to exit from Abterra and, at the same time, GNR
                    was looking to acquire a controlling interest in a Singapore listed
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The two material clauses in the SPA which were
                    relevant to the issues before me were clauses 2.1 and 1.1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Clause 2.1 of the SPA read:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Subject to the terms and conditions of this
                            Agreement, the Vendor agrees to sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser

                            clear from all Encumbrances of whatsoever nature and <em>with all rights, benefits and entitlements now or thereafter

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The term “Sale Shares” was
                    defined in clause 1.1 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“<b>Sale Shares</b>” means
                            1,337,592,585 ordinary shares, representing 65% of the issued shares of
                            the Company as at the date hereof, to be sold by the Vendor to the
                            Purchaser under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At the time of sale under the SPA, Prosperity
                    held 70% of the shares in Abterra. As a result of the sale, Prosperity was left
                    with only 5% of the shares in Abterra, whereas GNR, having bought shares in
                    Abterra from Prosperity as well other sources, now holds over 92% of the shares
                    in Abterra.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Originating Summons No 726 of 2010: The present action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Arising from the order made by Kan J in SUM
                    4903/2009, the Liquidator then commenced the present action in Originating
                    Summons No 726 of 2010 (“OS 726/2010”) on 16 July 2010,
                    naming Prosperity, Abterra and GNR as the first, second and third defendants
                    respectively. In OS 726/2010, the Liquidator sought a declaration
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     on a true and proper construction of
                        clause 8A.5 of the SSA dated 30 August 2004 and amended by the Second
                        Supplementary SSA on 14 March 2005, Prosperity had a present right to call
                        on Abterra to issue the FSS as defined in the SSA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     the right to call on the FSS did not
                        pass from Prosperity to GNR pursuant to the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons No 2161 of 2011: Amendment of the Receivership
                Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     About a year later, on 19 May 2011, the
                    Liquidator applied by way of <em>ex parte</em> summons to
                    amend the Receivership Order in Summons No 2161 of 2011 (“SUM
                    2161/2011”). It was necessary to first explain the circumstances that led
                    to the amendment application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In a separate application initiated by Abterra
                    in Originating Summons No 1185 of 2010 to enjoin the Liquidator from using
                    information which came into his possession <em>qua</em>
                    scheme administrator of the Abterra Scheme, Woo Bih Li J remarked during the
                    hearing on 25 March 2011 that the correct plaintiff for OS 726/2010 should
                    perhaps have been the receiver of Prosperity instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     During the hearing before me, Mr David Chan,
                    counsel for the Receiver (“Mr Chan”), accepted that the <em>locus standi</em> of the proper applicant to claim for the
                    FSS became a “live issue” following the observation by Woo J and
                    that the amendment application was made to address the shortcomings of the
                    Receivership Order. The Receiver in his supporting affidavit explained,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the Receivership Order did
                    not expressly empower him to call on Abterra to issue the FSS or to commence
                    proceedings to claim for the FSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I found it curious that the amendment
                    application was heard on an <em>ex parte</em> basis.
                    Thereafter I discovered that although the solicitors of Abterra were initially
                    notified of the amendment application by the Registry of the Supreme Court
                    (“the Registry”), following a telephone call from the solicitors
                    for the Liquidator, the Registry subsequently notified Abterra’s
                    solicitors in writing that their attendance was not required “since you
                    are not acting for any party in this matter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As I was concerned about the circumstances
                    that eventually resulted in the amendment application being heard on an
                        <em>ex parte</em> basis, I directed the
                    Liquidator’s solicitors to formally explain the circumstances surrounding
                    the telephone call to the Registry. Following their detailed explanation as well
                    as Abterra’s response, I was satisfied that there was nothing improper in
                    the telephone call by the Liquidator’s solicitors. In essence, they
                    explained that they did not believe that the amendment application needed to be
                    served on Abterra since they were not direct parties to S 899/2008 or to the
                    original application that led to the Receivership Order. Indeed, the
                    notification of the amendment application to Abterra’s solicitors was
                    subsequently withdrawn by the Registry on this basis. It was also clear that
                    Abterra’s solicitors were at least aware of the amendment application
                    through the notification from the Registry and therefore could have sought for
                    more information if they were interested to attend the hearing even though the
                    amendment application was never formally served on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Having said that, given the contentious
                    background, particularly the acknowledged shortcomings of the Receivership Order
                    and the earlier participation of Abterra and GNR in SUM 4903/2009 before Kan J,
                    the better and prudent course was for the Liquidator’s solicitors to have
                    served the amendment application on all the interested parties including Abterra
                    and GNR so that all relevant arguments could have been adequately ventilated at
                    an earlier stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In any event, Prakash J heard the application
                    on an <em>ex parte</em> basis in SUM 2161/2011 and granted
                    the amendments to the Receivership Order sought by the Liquidator (“the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     To succeed in OS 726/2010, Mr Chan accepted
                    that the Receiver had to overcome all three hurdles. Having considered the
                    evidence before me and the respective parties’ submissions, I arrived at
                    the conclusion that the Receiver had failed in all three respects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of a Receivership Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Before examining the <em>locus
                        standi</em> issue, it is perhaps useful to understand the nature of a
                    receivership order and, in particular, whether a chose in action could properly
                    be the subject matter of such an order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     A clear exposition of the effect and nature of
                    a receivership order was expounded by Collins LJ in <em>Masri v
                        Consolidated Contractors Int (UK) Ltd (No 2)</em> [2009] 1 QB 450.
                    Collins LJ held (at [52]–[53]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    The starting point
                            is the effect of the receivership order. Receivership by way of
                            equitable execution is summarised in <em>Snell</em>, <em>Equity</em>, 31st ed (2005),
                            para 17-25:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A judgment creditor normally obtains satisfaction of his
                            judgment by execution at common law, using the writ of fieri facias,
                            attachment of debts and, formerly, in the case of land, the writ of
                            elegit. There were cases, however, where the creditor could not levy
                            execution at law owing to the nature of the property, the principal case
                            being where the property was merely equitable, such as an interest under
                            a trust or an equity of redemption. Another example was a covenant of
                            indemnity or other chose in action of which the debtor has the benefit,
                            but which could not be reached by attachment. In order to meet this
                            difficulty, the Court of Chancery evolved a process of execution by way
                            of appointing a receiver of the equitable interest, and if necessary
                            supplemented this by an injunction restraining the judgment debtor from
                            disposing of his interest in the property. This process was not
                            ‘execution’ in the ordinary sense of the word, but a form of
                            equitable relief for cases where execution was not possible. The effect
                            of such an appointment ‘is that it does not create a charge on the
                            property, but that it operates as an injunction against the judgment
                            debtor receiving the income’ or dealing with the property to the
                            prejudice of the judgment creditor.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53    The authorities bear out the proposition, important
                            in this case, that the appointment does not have a proprietary effect.
                            It has effect as an injunction restraining the judgment debtor from
                            receiving any part of the property which it covers, if that property is
                            not already in his possession, but it does not vest the property in the
                            receiver. As Lindley LJ said in <em>In re
                                Sartoris’s Estate</em> [1892] 1 Ch 11, 22 :
                            “It operates as an injunction restraining the defendant from
                            getting in money which the receiver is appointed to receive.” See
                            also <em>Stevens v Hutchinson</em> [1953] 1 Ch 299,
                            305. The judgment creditor receives no interest in the received property
                            until it is transferred to him in satisfaction of the judgment debt:
                                <em>In re Potts</em> [1893] 1 QB 648,
                            661.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Cotton LJ observed in <em>In re
                        Shephard</em> (1889) 43 Ch D 131 that it might be somewhat confusing
                    to refer to the appointment of a receiver as a form of “equitable
                    execution”. Cotton LJ held (at 135) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Confusion of ideas has arisen from the use of the term “equitable
                        execution.” The expression tends to error. It has often been used by
                        judges, and occurs in some orders, as a short expression indicating that the
                        person who obtains the order gets the same benefit as he would have got from
                        legal execution. But what he gets by the appointment of a receiver is not
                        execution, but equitable relief, which is granted on the ground that there
                        is no remedy by execution at law; it is a taking out of the way a hindrance
                        which prevents execution at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subject matter of a receivership order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The power of the court to appoint a receiver
                    is set out under paragraph 5(a) of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court
                    of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5. Power before or after any proceedings are commenced to provide for
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the interim preservation of property which is the subject-matter of
                        the proceedings by sale or by injunction or the appointment of receiver or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Here, the “property” over which
                    the Receivership Order was obtained related to an alleged right of the judgment
                    debtor, <em>ie</em>, Prosperity’s right to the FSS
                    under clause 8A.5 of the SSA. It was accepted by all parties that such a right
                    was strictly a chose in action. All parties were also in agreement that a chose
                    in action could legitimately be the subject matter of a receivership order and
                    relied on the same authorities in support of this proposition of
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Bourne v Colodense
                        Ltd</em> [1985] ICR 291 (“<em>Bourne</em>”), the plaintiff developed health issues which were
                    believed to have been caused by the defendant’s negligent use of a toxic
                    substance at the work place. The plaintiff then applied to his trade union for
                    assistance to sue the defendant whereupon the trade union appointed a solicitor
                    to act on his behalf. The action was eventually dismissed with costs after a
                    lengthy trial. As the plaintiff was elderly and sick with no assets, it was
                    accepted that bankruptcy and execution would not produce any recovery for the
                    defendant. It was the understanding that the trade union had financed the
                    litigation and would pick up the costs which the plaintiff was liable to pay to
                    the defendant but it refused to do so. As the trade union was not a direct party
                    to the litigation, it could not be ordered to pay the costs of the action. Under
                    those circumstances, the defendant applied for and obtained an order to appoint
                    a receiver by way of equitable execution for liberty to commence proceedings in
                    the name of the plaintiff to claim an indemnity against the trade union in
                    respect of costs which the plaintiff was liable to pay the defendant following
                    the dismissal of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     
          <em>Bourne</em> was cited
                    with approval in <em>Maclaine Watson v International Tin
                        Council</em> [1987] 3 WLR 508 (“<em>Maclaine</em>”). Like <em>Bourne</em>,
                    the subject matter of the application for the appointment of a receiver in
                        <em>Maclaine</em> was also a chose in action. In an
                    arbitration to which the International Tin Council (“ITC”)
                    submitted, an award was made against the ITC which it defaulted in paying. Leave
                    of court was subsequently obtained to enforce the award and judgment was
                    accordingly entered. When the judgment remained unsatisfied, the applicant
                    applied to appoint a receiver over the assets of ITC in order to make formal
                    demands in the name of ITC against its member states for contributions in
                    respect of the judgment debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As a matter of principle, Millett J held in
                        <em>Maclaine</em> that he had the jurisdiction to
                    appoint a receiver. However, the application was disallowed because Millett J
                    found (at 518E) that the applicant had failed to demonstrate an <em>arguable case</em> that ITC had any cause of action against
                    its member states which was not derived from international treaty, it being
                    accepted that a claim based on an international treaty was not justiciable
                    before the English court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Having stated the position in law that a chose
                    in action could properly be the subject matter of a receivership order, it is
                    necessary to explain when a chose in action is suitable and appropriate for the
                    appointment of a receiver. Can a receiver be appointed in respect of a <em>disputed</em> chose in action? In this respect, it was also
                    common ground amongst all parties that a receiver could be appointed even if the
                    chose in action was disputed. In both <em>Bourne</em> and
                        <em>Maclaine</em>, the courts held that it was
                    essential for the applicant to show an arguable case (see <em>Maclaine</em> at 513H) or a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case on the merits (see <em>Bourne</em> at 294). On the
                    other hand, it is equally clear that a court would not appoint a receiver if it
                        “<em>was satisfied that the appointment would be
                        fruitless because there was nothing for the receiver to get
                    in</em>” (<em>per</em> Dhillon LJ in <em>Bourne</em> at 302) [emphasis added].</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Receiver’s <em>locus

                    Holdings was not a party to the SSA and that the Amended Receivership Order did
                    not purport to empower the Receiver to commence proceedings in the name of
                    Prosperity who was the relevant party under the SSA to take out the

                    which it could claim for itself. In so holding, the Court of Appeal endorsed the
                    approach of Lord Diplock in <em>Gouriet v Union of Post Office

                    to the jurisdiction of the court and must be satisfied even if it was not
                    contested. In <em>ex parte CPAG</em>, Woolf LJ held at 556

                        court had been minded to grant declaratory relief, would have had to advance

                    Receivership Order, it is apposite to note that in <em>Bourne</em> and <em>Maclaine</em> where
                    receivers were appointed to enforce a chose in action, the receivership order
                    had specifically empowered the receiver to take steps or commence proceedings
                        <em>in the name of the judgment debtor</em>. In
                        <em>Bourne</em>, the order expressly authorised the
                    receiver to recover the costs <em>in the name of the
                        plaintiff</em> against the trade union. Similarly, in <em>Maclaine</em>, the applicant sought an order to appoint a
                    receiver by way of equitable execution to authorise the receiver, <em>in the name of ITC</em> to make formal demands against its
                    member states for contributions. In this way, there would be no issue of a party
                    seeking a declaration of rights concerning <em>other
                        parties</em> as was disapproved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Karaha Bodas</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The law of receivership is well settled in
                    Singapore. In <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another and
                        other suits</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 328, Lai Kew Chai J held (at
                        [7]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    [...] His main function is the identification,
                            collection and protection or preservation of property which he must hold
                            to abide by the outcome of the action in which he is appointed.
                                <em>A receiver appointed by a court derives his
                                powers from the terms of the order appointing him</em>. If
                            necessary, he may apply to court for further powers and
                            directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     A receiver, as an officer of the court,
                    derives his powers solely from the terms of the court order appointing him. It
                    follows that his powers are defined by the terms of the court order. What the
                    receiver can or cannot do is a matter of construction of the terms of the
                    receivership order. If a receivership order does not specifically empower the
                    receiver to bring an action on behalf of a particular party, it must follow that
                    he has no power to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Under paragraph 1 of the Amended Receivership
                    Order, the Receiver was only empowered to “call on and/or demand and
                    receive the Further Strategic Shares”. The Amended Receivership Order did
                    not expressly empower the Receiver to bring an action on behalf of Prosperity.
                    Given that Prosperity was the first defendant in OS 726/2010, it would have been
                    odd for the Receiver to obtain an order empowering him to proceed in the name of
                    Prosperity against several defendants <em>including</em>
                    Prosperity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The lack of power on the part of the Receiver
                    to commence proceedings in the name of Prosperity became even clearer when
                    paragraph 2(b) of the Amended Receivership Order was examined.
                    Paragraph 2(b) stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. The Receiver shall be permitted and empowered, if necessary, to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">b.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>Bring or defend and/or continue
                                any action or other legal proceeding in the name and on behalf of
                                the Plaintiff</em> but only in so far as it is necessary and
                            in pursuance and/or facilitation of paragraph 1 above.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The language used here was plain. Paragraph
                    2(b) of the Amended Receivership Order <em>only</em>
                    empowered the Receiver to bring an action on behalf of the plaintiff and not on
                    behalf of Prosperity. Consistent with the lack of power to commence OS 726/2010
                    in the name of Prosperity, the Receiver had instead commenced proceedings in the
                    name of Tan Holdings. Paragraph 3 of the Amended Receivership Order merely
                    empowered the Receiver to receive and sell the FSS and did not assist in
                    addressing the <em>locus standi</em> issue
                either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In response to Abterra’s solicitors, the
                    solicitors for the Receiver by letter dated 30 May 2011 stated that the Receiver
                    “is now empowered and does again make a request <em>on
                        behalf of Prosperity</em>” [emphasis added] for the allotment
                    of the FSS and therefore had implicitly recognised that the claim ought to
                    brought in the name of Prosperity. In spite of that, it was puzzling that the
                    Amended Receivership Order only empowered the Receiver to claim in his capacity
                    as Receiver <em>on behalf of the Liquidator of Tan
                        Holdings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mr Chan, in his further submissions after
                    delivery of my oral decision, relied on the English Court of Appeal’s
                    decision in <em>Guaranty Trust Company of New York v Hannay &amp;
                        Company</em> [1915] KB 536 (“<em>Guaranty
                        Trust</em>”) at 562 for the proposition that O 15 r 16 allowed
                    “any party who is interested in the subject matter of the
                    declaration” to seek declaratory relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In my view, the decision in <em>Guaranty Trust</em> did not advance the Receiver’s case any
                    further on the <em>locus standi</em> issue. That case
                    concerned an application by a plaintiff for a declaration that it was not liable
                    to the defendant in respect of monies paid under a bill of exchange. The
                    objection to the declaration was that the plaintiff had no cause of action and
                    further that it was seeking a declaration that it had no obligation instead of a
                    declaration of a right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The same passage in <em>Guaranty Trust</em> was in fact considered in <em>Karaha Bodas</em> (at [16])
                    where the Court of Appeal observed that the plaintiff in <em>Guaranty Trust</em> was “asserting the recognition of a
                    ‘right’ personal to him even if he was not making a
                    ‘claim’ against the defendants in England”. The plaintiff was
                    a United States bank which purchased the bill of exchange which was drawn by the
                    defendant. It was therefore a party to the bill of exchange unlike the present
                    case where Tan Holdings was neither a party to the SSA nor the
                SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As such, there was no question of Tan
                    Holdings, and consequently the Receiver, asserting any right <em>personal</em> under the SSA or the SPA. Furthermore, in <em>Karaha Bodas</em>, the Court of Appeal also noted the dictum
                    by Pickford LJ in <em>Guaranty Trust</em> that was
                    considered in <em>In re S (Hospital Patient: Court’s
                        Jurisdiction)</em> [1995] Fam 26. It was held in <em>Karaha Bodas</em> (at [16])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    [...] As was noted
                            in <em>Re S</em> by Hale J ([12] <em>supra</em> at 34):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is argued on behalf of the plaintiff that declaratory
                            relief can be sought by anyone with a sufficient interest even if that
                            person’s own legal rights or liabilities are not in issue.
                            Reliance is placed on the well known words of Pickford L.J. in
                                [<em>Guaranty Trust Co</em>]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">I think therefore that the effect of the rule [the predecessor to
                                R.S.C., Ord. 15, r. 16] is to give a general power to make a
                                declaration whether there be a cause of action or not, and at the
                                instance of any party who is interested in the subject matter of the
                                declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">However, <em>it is noteworthy in that case
                                that it was the plaintiff’s own legal position which was in
                                issue</em>. Moreover, Pickford L.J. [in <em>Guaranty Trust Co</em>] went on to say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">
<em>It does not extend to enable any stranger to
                                    the transaction to go and ask the court to express its opinion
                                    in order to help him in other transactions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the present context, Tan Holdings was
                    indeed a <em>stranger</em> to both the SSA and the SPA. In
                    my view, the holding in <em>Guaranty Trust</em> as regards
                    “a party having an interest in the subject matter of the
                    declaration” was intended to address the issue that the plaintiff need
                    not have a cause of action against the defendant in seeking declaratory relief.
                    It was not intended to dispense with the overarching requirement to demonstrate
                        <em>locus standi</em> in order to pursue declaratory
                    relief under O 15 r 16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In my judgment, the Amended Receivership Order
                    failed to adequately address the lack of <em>locus
                        standi</em> on the part of the Receiver to commence OS 726/2010
                    to claim for the FSS under the SSA. Tan Holdings was not a party to the SSA and
                    had no rights thereunder. On this ground alone, the application failed <em>in limine</em>. However, in case I was wrong on the threshold
                        <em>locus standi</em> issue, I had nonetheless
                    considered the merits of the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For completeness, after delivering my oral
                    grounds, I invited all parties to address the court as to whether the Receiver
                    could have validly obtained an order to commence proceedings to claim for the
                    FSS in the name of Prosperity. In this connection, all parties, relying on
                        <em>Bourne</em> and <em>Maclaine</em>, were also in agreement that such an order <em>could</em> in principle have been obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     However, parties adopted different positions
                    as to whether such an order <em>would</em> or <em>should</em> have been issued on the specific facts in this
                    case. Mr Giam SC submitted it was not “just and convenient”
                    for the Receiver to have been appointed as Prosperity was in all likelihood
                    insolvent. As such, any disposal or sale of the FSS (believed to be the only
                    known “asset” of Abterra) for the benefit of Tan Holdings would
                    infringe the <em>pari passu</em> distribution rule for all
                    unsecured creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     More fundamentally, Mr Giam SC added that
                    given the court’s finding on the lack of merits in the Receiver’s
                    construction of clause 8A.5 of the SSA (which is dealt with below), there would
                    be no purpose in granting an order for the Receiver to claim the FSS in the name
                    of Prosperity. Therefore, while a receiver could be appointed in respect of a
                        <em>disputed</em> chose in action in the sense that the
                    defaulting party has refused to pay without the commencement of court
                    proceedings, such an order should not be made if it is clear that there is no
                    arguable case as was found to be the case in <em>Maclaine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the present case, the substantive merits of
                    the application ultimately turned on the true construction of the terms of the
                    SSA and the SPA, both of which could be dealt with summarily given that there
                    was no dispute on the material facts. On that note, I now turn my attention to
                    deal with the construction of the terms of the SSA and the SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Construction of clause 8A.5 of the SSA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Receiver’s claim for the FSS rested
                    on clause 8A.5 of the SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Clause 8A.5 of the SSA referred to the
                    following four essential terms:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In my view, clause 8A.5 was to be construed as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Contingent Creditors must
                        become bound to receive the Contingent Conversion Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the obligation of the
                        Contingent Creditors to receive the Contingent Conversion Shares was in
                        discharge of Crystallized Liabilities, <em>ie</em>, the
                        Liabilities must first become crystallized.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, Prosperity’s right to request for
                        the FSS would only arise if the Contingent Creditors became bound to receive
                        the Contingent Conversion Shares in the Agreed Period, <em>ie</em>, by 29 August 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Both the Abterra Scheme and the SSA were
                    inextricably linked. In fact, under clause 2.1(c) of the SSA, the rights and
                    obligations of the parties under the SSA were made conditional upon the approval
                    of the Abterra Scheme. Under the Abterra Scheme, crystallization of liabilities
                    occurred when the Contingent Creditors made payment and thereafter upon demand
                    being made against Abterra. I therefore disagreed with Mr Chan that the
                    Contingent Liabilities became crystallized when the Abterra Scheme became
                    effective on or about 17 May 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In support of its claim for the FSS, the
                    Receiver relied on two announcements as described in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above under which various Contingent Liabilities became
                    crystallized which led to the allotment of various Contingent Conversion
                    Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The “Agreed Period” of three
                    years from the date of the SSA expired on 29 August 2007. Therefore, save for
                    the 2007 UOB claim, the other Contingent Liabilities had crystallized outside
                    the “Agreed Period”. Prosperity, therefore, had no entitlement to
                    request for the FSS in respect of the 2008 UOB claim, MBB claim and ECICS claim
                    since those claims had crystallized outside the “Agreed
                    Period”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In an attempt to overcome the above finding,
                    Mr Chan submitted that the reinstatement of the “Agreed Period” to
                    clause 8A.5 in the Second Supplementary SSA was a mere clerical mistake. I
                    disagreed. First, there was no evidence to support such an alleged mistake. None
                    of the parties to the SSA had alleged any mistake. It certainly did not lie in
                    the mouth of a non-party of the SSA to allege such a mistake. Second, given the
                    history behind the various amendments to clause 8A.5, specifically in relation
                    to the “Agreed Period”, it was clear from the objective evidence
                    before me that it was <em>deliberately</em> reintroduced to
                    restrict Prosperity’s entitlement to the FSS provided the Contingent
                    Liabilities became crystallized within the “Agreed
                Period”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As regards Mr Chan’s alternative
                    submission that the reference to the “Agreed Period” in clause
                    8A.5 was superfluous, counsel for the Scheme Administrator, Mr Tan Cheng Han SC
                    (“Mr Tan SC”), raised three succinct and cogent reasons why this
                    could not have been the case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_a"></a>(a)     He first pointed out that although
                        Recital F of the SSA referred to both “Contingent Liabilities”
                        and “Contingent Creditors”, conspicuously, it was not
                        qualified by any reference to the “Agreed Period”. He reasoned
                        that although the “Contingent Creditors” might be bound to
                        receive the “Contingent Conversion Shares”
                        <em>during</em> and <em>after</em>
                        the “Agreed Period”, Prosperity’s rights under clause
                        8A.5 of the SSA to receive the FSS, on the other hand, was restricted only
                        if the Contingent Creditors became bound to receive the Contingent
                        Conversion Shares within the “Agreed Period”. In other words,
                        the “Agreed Period” only governed the allotment of FSS between
                        Prosperity and Abterra.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further, Mr Tan SC added that under clause 8A.8 of the
                        SSA, the directors of Abterra who were connected directly or indirectly with
                        Prosperity were required to abstain in any discussion in dealing with the
                        “Contingent Creditors” or “Contingent
                        Liabilities” or “Crystallized Liabilities” because
                        Prosperity’s entitlement to the FSS was dependent on whether and when
                        crystallization of the Contingent Liabilities occurs. It would therefore
                        follow that the reinstatement of the “Agreed Period” in clause
                        8A.5 was intentional so as to restrict Prosperity’s entitlement to the
                        FSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_c"></a>(c)     For this
                        reason, it was brought to my attention that of the two allotments, the first
                        allotment of 3,043,800 Contingent Conversion Shares was within the
                        “Agreed Period” while the second and significantly larger
                        allotment for 121,891,311 Contingent Conversion Shares was <em>outside</em> the “Agreed Period”.
                        Consistent with the purpose of reinstating the “Agreed Period”
                        to clause 8A.5, Prosperity’s entitlement to the FSS was <em>in fact</em> restricted by the actual timings in the
                        allotments of the Contingent Conversion Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Further, and more importantly, I find that the
                    purpose of clause 8A.5 was to maintain Prosperity’s 70% shareholding in
                    Abterra and to ensure that such 70% shareholding was not diluted by the issuance
                    of the Contingent Conversion Shares to the Contingent Creditors. This was clear
                    from the ratio of FSS to the Contingent Conversion Shares as stipulated in
                    clause 8A.5 as well as clause 4.2 of the SSA which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">4.2</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Subject to the terms and conditions of [the SSA],
                            [Abterra] shall issue and allot on Completion the Strategic Shares, each
                            Strategic Share at the Deemed Strategic Share Issue Price such that the
                            number of Strategic Shares in the capital of [Abterra] to be issued is
                            equivalent to 70% of the enlarged share capital of [Abterra] (such
                            enlarged issued share capital to be ascertained after taking into
                            account the Strategic Shares, the Unsecured Conversion Shares and the
                            Secured Conversion Shares).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Although the 2007 UOB claim was technically
                    within the “Agreed Period”, Prosperity nonetheless had no right to
                    request for the FSS because by the time the 2007 UOB claim became crystallized,
                    Prosperity had already sold 65% of its shares to GNR. The shares were sold by
                    Prosperity to GNR one year <em>prior</em> to the
                    crystallization of the 2007 UOB claim, pursuant to the SPA entered into on 1
                    September 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     For the above reasons, I found that Prosperity
                    was, in any event, not entitled to the FSS under clause 8A.5 of the
                SSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the right to the FSS transferred to GNR pursuant to the
                SPA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     This issue would only arise for determination
                    if Prosperity was found to be entitled to claim for the FSS in spite of the
                    allotment of the Contingent Conversion Shares outside the “Agreed
                    Period” or that Prosperity had since ceased to own 70% of the Abterra
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     As explained above, 65% of the Abterra shares
                    were sold by Prosperity to GNR pursuant to the SPA on 1 September 2006, one year
                        <em>prior</em> to the expiration of the “Agreed
                    Period”. Was there any compelling reason why the right to the FSS had not
                    been transferred to GNR pursuant to the SPA? In this regard, the Receiver
                    submitted that the right to the FSS was not transferred to GNR since consent had
                    not been obtained from Abterra in breach of clause 10.3 of the SSA which
                    provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">10.3</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No Party may assign or transfer all or part of
                            its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent in
                            writing of the other Party.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In my view, such a breach did not affect the
                    validity of the transfer. Furthermore, the breach was for Abterra to object to
                    and I have noted that no such objection was ever raised by Abterra. As was
                    correctly pointed out by counsel for GNR, Mr Chew Kei-Jin, the plaintiff’s
                    lack of <em>locus standi</em> was equally relevant in this
                    context. The Receiver was essentially seeking a declaration on the construction
                    of certain clauses of the SPA, to which Tan Holdings was not a party
                to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Nonetheless, under clause 2.1 of the SPA (see
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above), all the rights, benefits
                    and entitlements attaching to the shares were transferred to GNR upon sale. Such
                    rights, benefits and entitlements clearly included the right to the FSS. It must
                    be right as a matter of construction since the FSS did not exist independently
                    without reference to the shares in Abterra.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     There was no merit in Mr Chan’s
                    submission that the right to the FSS could not have been transferred to GNR
                    because there was no evidence that GNR was even aware of the FSS at the time of
                    the sale. The right to the FSS was a contractual right arising from the SPA.
                    Such a right exists as a matter of construction of the terms of the SPA and not
                    upon the subjective knowledge of GNR. On a true construction of clause 2.1 of
                    the SPA, it clearly covered all rights, benefits and entitlements attaching to
                    the shares including the right to the FSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In summary, I found that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Receiver lacked <em>locus
                                standi</em> to claim for the FSS;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">on a true construction of clause 8A.5 of the SSA,
                            Prosperity no longer had the right to claim for the FSS;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the right to the FSS, if any, had been
                            transferred from Prosperity to GNR under the SPA.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the result, I dismissed the
                    Receiver’s application with costs fixed at $25,000 payable to Abterra
                    together with reasonable disbursements and $10,000 payable to GNR inclusive of
                    disbursements.</p>
