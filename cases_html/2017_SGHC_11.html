It should be noted, however, that due to the statutory demand in OSB 66 being set aside by Leow JC on appeal (in favour of the Plaintiff) and due to the Plaintiff having paid the interlocutory costs orders which arose in Suit 92, what remained unpaid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant (when I made the present orders) were the outstanding costs and the Judgment Debt in OS 381 only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The central issue before the court was therefore whether Suit 92 should be stayed because of the non-payment of the costs and the Judgment Debt.

</div> In summary, the Plaintiff asserted that the court should only stay proceedings in one of the following two situations: (a) where the same plaintiff having failed in one action, with costs ordered against him, brought a second action for the <span class="font-italic">same cause of action</span> without paying the costs ordered in the first action; and (b) where the non-payment of <span class="font-italic">interlocutory costs orders</span> was held to be vexatious and where innocent parties would be affected and prejudiced.

</div> [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I did not think, however, that the court should be constrained in the exercise of its discretion in the pedantic and technical manner advocated for by the Plaintiff.  Neither should the two categories of cases identified by the Plaintiff in which a stay of proceedings had been granted be a closed list. In the present case, the Plaintiff had lost in other proceedings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, OS 381) and incurred costs to be paid to the Defendant.  I did not think that it should be determinative that the Defendant was the claimant in the adjudication proceedings under SOPA and correspondingly the Plaintiff was the respondent. The fact remained that the Adjudication Determination, which formed the basis of OS 381, arose from the same construction contract and, at the very least, was one of the issues which would be canvassed in Suit 92. This was therefore a situation where the same parties were involved and the same subject-matter was engaged, with the SOPA proceedings being the precursor of the present proceedings to finally resolve the parties’ dispute.  Hence, I found that the necessary nexus was present – OS 381 emanated from the same dispute (“the same transaction, i.e. the construction contract” as the Plaintiff stated) that animated the present Suit 92. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Ultimately, whether a stay should be granted in such a situation would depend on the justice of the case and would include considerations such as whether there had been an abuse of process although this would be balanced against the right of the defaulting party to be heard. In <span class="font-italic">Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 353, the Court of Appeal made the following observation (at [19]), albeit in the context of whether a stay of an appeal for non-payment of costs in the first instance hearing should be ordered:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Accordingly, the circumstances where such an order may be made must be rare indeed. We do not wish to prejudge matters or lay down any definite considerations. <span class="font-italic font-underline">It is the twin criteria of prejudice/justice which would be decisive</span><span class="font-underline">.</span> Purely as an example, if a plaintiff was required by the court below to furnish security, and failed to do so, and the case went on to trial as the defendant wished to have the matter disposed of expeditiously, and the plaintiff then failed and appealed, this may be the sort of circumstance where the appeal court could invoke that jurisdiction to order payment of the costs below before the appeal may be allowed to proceed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The twin criteria of prejudice/justice appeared to be similarly relevant in the United Kingdom. An example would be that of the English decision of <span class="font-italic">In re Wickham, </span><span class="font-italic">Marony v Taylor </span>(1887) 35 Ch D 272 where the defendant sought a stay of all further proceedings by the plaintiff until the latter had paid the costs for certain interlocutory proceedings. In deciding to stay the proceedings, Lindley LJ observed (at p 282) that while the non-payment of costs <span class="font-italic">per se</span> was not ground for staying proceedings, “whenever it can be shewn that a person is <span class="font-italic font-underline">proceeding </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">vexatiously in not paying costs</span> which he has been ordered to pay, the Court has jurisdiction to stay the proceedings” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the present case, I found that the Plaintiff had the capacity and means to pay the outstanding costs ordered but was simply <span class="font-italic">refusing</span> to do so.  The best case that Plaintiff’s counsel could put forward for her during the hearing was to say that “Plaintiff has not said that she can pay but she has not said that she cannot pay” (see Notes of Proceedings dated 27 September 2016).  I note that the Assistant Registrar, in SUM 6188, had made the similar finding that the Plaintiff was refusing to pay the sums owed.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Notes of Proceedings dated 26 February 2016, p 6.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  Quite apart from the fact that the Plaintiff had never once asserted that she was unable to pay the outstanding costs (and the Judgment Debt), her course of conduct before me further reinforced my view that she had the means to pay but chose to make a mockery of the court process. When RA 94 came before me on 5 September 2016, apart from the costs and the Judgment Debt in OS 381, there was an outstanding amount of $500 costs which had arisen because of a prior adjournment of RA 94.  Additionally, at the hearing on 5 September 2016, I allowed an application by the Plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, HC/Summons No 1703 of 2016<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>in Suit 92)<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>for an extension of time to serve the notice of appeal but ordered the Plaintiff to pay costs of $800 to the Defendant.  The matter was then adjourned for written submissions on whether the court had the power to stay proceedings for the non-payment of costs and the Judgment Debt. I further directed that the Plaintiff should, by the next hearing, pay the said costs of $500 and $800. Subsequently, on 26 September 2016, the Plaintiff filed her written submissions where she took the position, as noted above (at [8]), that a stay of proceedings should only be granted in the two enumerated circumstances, one such circumstance being where the non-payment of <span class="font-italic">interlocutory</span> <span class="font-italic">costs orders</span> in the same suit was vexatious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 At the hearing on 27 September 2016, the Plaintiff’s counsel then informed me that all the <span class="font-italic">interlocutory</span> <span class="font-italic">costs orders</span> in Suit 92 had been satisfied and submitted that since a stay should only be granted where the costs from interlocutory<span class="font-italic"> </span>proceedings in the same suit had not been paid, the court should not order the stay (notwithstanding that the costs and the Judgment Debt in OS 381 remained unsatisfied by the Plaintiff).  It was evident to me that the Plaintiff was simply picking and choosing which outstanding orders of court to comply with so that she would not contradict or weaken the legal position she was adopting.  This brought to light the Plaintiff’s attempt to game the system and there was no reason to believe that the Plaintiff was unable to satisfy the other outstanding orders of court.  In this regard, I agreed with the observations of the Assistant Registrar below that “[i]n effect, the [P]laintiff will use the power of this Court when it suits her and disregard it when it does not”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 A stay of the proceedings would therefore not cause the Plaintiff “prejudice” in the usual way that the concept was understood.  This was unlike the situation in <span class="font-italic">Morton v Palmer</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1882) 9 QBD 89 where it was noted by Cave J (at p 91) that it would be “entirely contrary to justice” if the court prevented a litigant from bringing a just claim simply because “he may be <span class="font-italic font-underline">unable</span> to pay the costs of some interlocutory proceeding in which <span class="font-italic font-underline">he may have failed perhaps from no fault of his own</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15  The above cases reminded us of an important safeguard: that the court should be careful not to stifle a genuine claim. Indeed, the law and its particular rules sought to hold the ring between parties. However, as against a recalcitrant party who was gaming the system this way, there was no question of stifling a genuine claim. The Plaintiff simply needed to play by the rules and pay up the outstanding costs (which she was able to do) to re-activate the present proceedings. In my view, her conduct amounted to an abuse of the process of the court and could not be countenanced.  I therefore ordered that Suit 92 be stayed if the Plaintiff did not satisfy the outstanding costs orders within a month.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Non-payment of judgment debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The parties did not submit a direct authority addressing the court’s power to order a stay in the face of non-payment of a judgment debt.  I did take into account, however, that one of the grounds on which the courts would exercise its inherent power to stay proceedings was where the proceedings were “likely to cause an abuse of process of court” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 201</span><span class="font-italic">7: Volume I</span> (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) at para 92/4/4).  The question was therefore whether the Plaintiff’s conduct of the proceedings was or was likely to cause an abuse of process.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It was relevant here to consider that the Judgment Debt originated from an adjudication determination under SOPA, which was converted into a judgment debt in OS 381.  The policy and purpose undergirding SOPA was articulated by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 as follows (at [59]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have said above that the purpose of the Act is to ensure (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) that even though adjudication determinations are interim in nature, <span class="font-italic font-underline">successful claimants are paid</span><span class="font-underline">.</span> … If the respondent intends to apply for a review of the adjudication determination, he must first pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant: see s 18(3). If the respondent wants to set aside the adjudication determination, he must pay into court as security the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount: see s 27(5). This requirement is repeated in O 95 r 3(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). <span class="font-italic font-underline">These provisions all point to one thing: where a claimant succeeds in his adjudication application, he is entitled to receive the adjudicated amount quickly and cannot be denied payment without very good reason</span><span class="font-underline">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The above cited passage was illustrative for at least two purposes. First, it showed that the entire SOPA scheme was based upon successful claimants being paid speedily.  The concept of temporary finality found concrete expression and implementation in the prompt payment by the employer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Plaintiff here) of any sums found due to the contractor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Defendant) by the adjudicator.  The payment had to be made pending the resolution of the disputes and issues in the underlying construction contract between the parties.  Amongst other purposes, the payment of sums found due would enable the contractor to avoid cash flow problems and continue with the works under the contract.  When the underlying dispute in the construction contract was finally determined – whether by litigation or arbitration – the accounts between the parties would be adjusted by the appropriate order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Secondly (and flowing from the first point), even if any respondent wished to challenge the outcome of an adjudication determination, he must still either pay the adjudicated amount to the claimant or pay the unpaid amount into court as security. This point was germane in guiding my decision to stay the proceedings if the Plaintiff did not pay the Judgment Debt. While I noted that the Plaintiff was not in fact seeking to review the Adjudication Determination, and therefore the above cited provisions did not apply to the Plaintiff, it would be perverse for the reasons herein for her to be allowed to deprive the Defendant of its right to prompt payment. The Plaintiff was effectively choosing not to pay the Judgment Debt in the hope that upon having the matter determined at trial, the court would find in her favour and she would never have to pay this sum to the Defendant. I saw no reason why someone in her position should be better off, for instance, than a respondent who was seeking to challenge the validity of an adjudication determination (who would be compelled to make the payment pursuant to provisions of SOPA before such a challenge could proceed). In fact, it could be said that it was even more imperative for someone in the Plaintiff’s position to pay the Judgment Debt in the interim since she herself recognised the validity of the Adjudication Determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I also took into consideration two Australian decisions which were cited to me by the Defendant: <span class="font-italic">Tombleson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Dancorell Constructions Pty Limited </span>[2007] NSWSC 1169 and <span class="font-italic">Nazero</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Pty Ltd v Top Quality Construction Pty Ltd</span> [2015] NSWSC 232. In both cases, instead of applying to set aside the adjudication determination in question, the plaintiffs sought an order quashing the decision of the adjudicator and an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the adjudication determination. In so doing, s 25(4) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (NSW), which provided that the judgment debt must be paid into the court as security pending a setting aside hearing, was not triggered. Against that backdrop, the Supreme Court of New South Wales found that it could and should exercise its inherent power to stay the proceedings until the plaintiffs paid the adjudicated sum into court as security. While the facts of these two cases differed from the present one, in my view, the common theme emanating from those decisions was that parties should not be allowed to withhold payment of the adjudicated sum whilst seeking to effectively overturn the adjudication determination at the same time.  The Plaintiff’s attempt to withhold payment while using Suit 92 to overturn the Adjudication Determination must be construed as an abuse of the process of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Based on the Defendant’s research, this could be the first case where a party in the Plaintiff’s position elected not to pay the judgment debt pending the determination of their dispute in the underlying contract.  It would be fair to say that such unilateral action on the Plaintiff’s part drove a coach and horses through the scheme established under SOPA and cynically defeated its legislative intent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 While I noted that the Adjudication Determination in OS 381 only pertained to one of the many claims which would be considered in Suit 92, it was again significant to me that the Plaintiff was ultimately able but unwilling to pay the Judgment Debt (as noted above at [12]).  There was, therefore, to my mind no issue of depriving  her of the right of access to the court to have her case heard in Suit 92 because it was within her control to pay the Judgment Debt and have the matter revived. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I was also unconvinced by the Plaintiff’s argument that since enforcement proceedings were available to the Defendant, a stay should not be granted.  Quite apart from the fact that the Defendant had satisfied me that it had taken all reasonable steps to enforce the costs orders and the Judgment Debt against the Plaintiff, I did not think that the availability of possible enforcement measures which the Defendant could concurrently pursue should be a fetter on the court’s power to stay the proceedings.  In my view, the court could not stand by while the Plaintiff was abusing its process; it was incumbent upon the court to bring such abuse to an end.  This was also to disabuse the Plaintiff of any further ideas<span class="font-italic"> </span>she might have of circumventing the rules, for instance, by refusing to pay the Defendant (pending an appeal) should she fail in Suit 92.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the light of the Plaintiff’s deliberate conduct, I therefore found it necessary to exercise the court’s inherent power to stay the proceedings in Suit 92 until she paid all outstanding costs ordered by the court and the Judgment Debt in OS 381. As noted above (at [5]), however, I granted her one final indulgence to pay these outstanding sums; in default all proceedings in Suit 92 were to be stayed. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Foo Chee Hock<br/>Judicial Commissioner </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Ignatius and Chong Xin Yi (Ignatius J &amp; Associates) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Alvin Chang and Hannah Alysha (M &amp; A Law Corporation) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
