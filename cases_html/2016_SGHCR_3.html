class="font-weight-bold">Tan Teck Ping Karen AR:</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 The two Originating Summons (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Applications</span>”) are the plaintiffs’ application for discovery against the respective defendants who are non-parties to the dispute between the plaintiffs and Zhang Lan (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Founder</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The 1st plaintiff (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Buyer</span>”) and the 2nd plaintiff (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Investor</span>”) are majority owned by the CVC Group (a private equity group) which consist of CVC Capital Partners SICAV-FIS S.A. and its subsidiaries (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CVC</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The 1st defendant in OS 305 is Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (“<span class="font-weight-bold">DB</span>”). The 1st Defendant in OS 307 is Credit Suisse AG (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CS</span>”). Both are banks in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The 2nd defendant in each of the applications is Success Elegant Trading Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SE</span>”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The Founder held the sole share in SE till 4 June 2014 when she transferred this sole share to Asiatrust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiffs believe that the Founder may have transferred to third parties all or part of funds paid to the Founder arising from transactions which are alleged to be fraudulent. As the plaintiffs believe that SE is owned by the Founder, the plaintiffs seek documents relating to SE’s accounts in the respective banks in the Applications to assist them to trace these funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As customer information is being sought from the respective banks, the plaintiffs seek an order of the Supreme Court or Judge for disclosure of the documents under one of the exceptions within the Third Schedule of the Banking Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Investor is the majority shareholder of Dolce Vita Fine Dining Holdings Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">EquityCo</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Buyer is owned 100% by EquityCo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Founder is the 100% owner of Grand Lan Holdings Group (BVI) Limited (”<span class="font-weight-bold">Founder Holdco</span>”) and South Beauty Development Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Management Holdco</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 By way of a series of transactions, the plaintiffs acquired shares in a food and beverage business owned by the Founder and other companies owned or controlled by her (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Acquisition</span>”), details of which are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Buyer purchased all the shares in South Beauty Investment Company Limited (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Company</span>”), a Cayman Islands company which was in the restaurant business in China from Founder Holdco and Management Holdco (collectively “the <span class="font-weight-bold">Sellers</span>”) for the total consideration of US$235,066,678 which was paid into the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account</span>”) with Bank J. Safra Sarasin, Hong Kong Branch (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Bank Sarasin</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The investor also purchased shares in EquityCo from the Founder Holdco for the total consideration of US$51,784,209 which was paid into the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It is alleged that the Founder also represented to CVC at a number of meetings prior to the Acquisition that the Company and its subsidiaries (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Group</span>”) was a thriving and successful brand which was resistant to the economic and consumption slowdown in the People’s Republic of China.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 After the transactions were completed, the plaintiffs say that in 2015 they discovered what is alleged to be manipulation of the Company’s accounting/financial records by the Founder in 2013 to give a higher valuation which induced the Buyer and Investor to think the Company was more profitable than it really was and to buy into the Company at a higher price than what should have been paid. As a result, it is alleged that the price paid for the Company was grossly and artificially inflated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 FTI Consulting was appointed by the plaintiffs to analyse the 2014 records and documents in relation to the Company. It prepared a report dated 25 February 2015 which found, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that “there was pervasive manipulation of South Beauty’s transaction sales data between January and April 2014 in the form of recognition of fictitious high value transactions paid on account; and manipulation of data in this way is consistent with inflated revenue and a rapidly increasing trade receivables balance, the same patterns [FTI] observed in South Beauty’s financial statements and [FTI] therefore consider it highly likely that similar manipulation took place in 2013.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The 1st and 2nd plaintiff have each commenced separate arbitration proceedings against the Sellers in the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CIETAC</span>”). In essence, the claim in the respective Request for Arbitration asserts that the Sellers fraudulently manipulated the accounting information of the Company, which was relied on by the plaintiffs when deciding whether or not to proceed with the Acquisition. It is also asserted that the Sellers have breached various warranties within the SPA and had made fraudulent misrepresentations in connection with the Acquisition. As such, the plaintiffs seek a rescission of the SPA, return of the purchase price paid to the Sellers under the SPA and damages to be assessed. In the alternative, if rescission is not granted, damages and/or an indemnity for all losses caused by the Sellers’ fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Orders made by the respective Courts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The plaintiffs also filed various applications in the Hong Kong and Singapore courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 26 February 2015, the Hong Kong court granted the following orders against the Founder and Founder HoldCo:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Injunction orders to restrain them from disposing of their assets worldwide (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Hong Kong Injunctions</span><span class="font-weight-bold">”</span>);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Disclosure of information orders requiring them to disclose all assets worldwide in excess of HK$500,000 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Hong Kong Disclosure Orders</span>”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Disclosure of information orders against their bank, Bank Sarasin; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Evidence preservation orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 2 March 2015, in Originating Summons No. 178 of 2015 and Originating Summons No. 180 of 2015, the Singapore court, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, granted orders prohibiting the Founder from disposing of or dealing with or diminishing the value of her assets in Singapore whether in her name or not and whether solely or jointly owned (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Singapore Injunctions</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Various banks in Singapore were notified of the Singapore Injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As the plaintiffs believed that SE is owned by the Founder and that SE has an account with CS (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CS Account</span>”), confirmation of this was sought from CS on 9 March 2015. On 12 March 2015, Messrs Herbert Smith Freehills in Hong Kong, solicitors for CS, confirmed that steps have been taken to comply with the Singapore Injunctions in particular, to ensure there are no dealings in monies or assets held in the CS Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 14 March 2015, the plaintiffs’ solicitors were notified by solicitors for DB, Messrs Allen &amp; Gledhill, that DB believed that SE’s DB account (“<span class="font-weight-bold">DB Account</span>”) is subject to the terms of the Singapore Injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As the plaintiffs believe that the Founder had transferred funds from the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account to the CS Account and the DB Account to put the funds out of the reach of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs filed these applications for the following purposes:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To identify third parties for the potential commencement of proceedings against them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To ascertain the full nature of the wrongdoing perpetrated by the Founder and to enable the plaintiffs to plead their case properly; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To trace assets in support of the plaintiffs’ proprietary claim against the Founder and third parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The following issues were considered by the Court:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the requirements for obtaining an order for pre-discovery pursuant O24 r 6(5) of the Rules of Court (“ROC”) and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court have been satisfied</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the plaintiffs had shown that there was a likely prospect of subsequent proceedings being held in Singapore pursuant to Order 24 rule 6(5) read with Paragraph 12 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (“SCJA”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the requirements under the Banking Act read together with section 175 of the Evidence Act for discovery of documents from the respective defendant banks have been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Pre-Action Discovery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Court has power to order discovery against a non-party under O 24 r 6(5), which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings or for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or <span class="font-italic">with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks i</span><span class="font-italic">t just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just</span>. (emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The words in O 24 r 6(5) give statutory effect to the <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> order, which is traditionally sought when it is necessary to obtain information for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of a potential defendant so that proceedings may be commenced against him. See <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice 2014 at 24/6/5 and 24/6/6</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In addition, the Court also retains its inherent jurisdiction to order disclosure from a non-party. This was recognised by Sundaesh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">UMCI Ltd v Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 95 (“<span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine</span>”), where he observed at [91] that the Court’s jurisdiction to order the discovery of documentary samples from non-parties under O 24 r 6(5) overlaps with a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>order which may be made under the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. This was an acknowledgement that the Court had concurrent jurisdiction under O 24 r 6(5) and its inherent jurisdiction to order discovery against a non-party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Before examining the law and facts to determine whether the documents sought  by the plaintiffs should be granted, it is timely at this point to note the Court of Appeal’s caution regarding pre-action disclosure in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 208 (“<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James”)</span> at [27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The utility and benefits of this procedure, however, must be calibrated against the fact that pre-action disclosure of any sort is quintessentially intrusive in nature – especially when it involves individuals who may ultimately not (or cannot) be parties to the litigation. … An application has to be confined to what is strictly necessary for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs in the pending or potential proceedings. Deep-sea fishing must be discouraged. Most crucially, in the final analysis, the making of any order must be “just” in all the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The prescribed test for pre-action discovery is justness and necessity (see O 24 r 6(5) and r 7).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">O 24 r 6(5) and Norwich Pharmacal Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As O 24 r 6(5) gives statutory effect to a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>order, the principles which guide the Court in granting a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal </span>order are  relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> considered the principles which would determine whether pre-action disclosure pursuant to <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> orders would be made. While <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>dealt primarily with pre-action interrogatories, the Court of Appeal noted that “the principles underlying both pre-action discovery and pre-action interrogatories (both constituting what [the Court of Appeal] shall henceforth refer to as “pre-action disclosure”) remain broadly the <span class="font-italic">same</span>” (at [25]). Accordingly, the principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> in respect of pre-action interrogatories would apply equally to my consideration of the <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> orders (pre-action discovery) which are sought in these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> laid out the 3 principles that would guide a court in its decision whether to grant a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> order:</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  Facilitation of wrongdoing</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Significantly, the person possessing the information sought must have been involved in the wrongdoing. This presupposes some degree of actual involvement, even if the involvement is completely innocent (<span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2)  Requirement of “real interest” in ascertaining a “source”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>referred at [40] to the seminal decision of <span class="font-italic">British Steel Corporation v Granada Television Ltd </span>[1981] AC 1096 (“<span class="font-italic">British Steel</span>”) where Lord Wilberforce declared that in compelling disclosure of sources “it is only <span class="font-weight-bold">exceptionally</span>, that the aggrieved person would have, and could demonstrate, <span class="font-italic">a real interest in suing the source</span>” [emphasis added in bold and in italics] (at 1173F). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Court of Appeal considered “the practical issue of how clear and obvious it should be that the “source” had committed some wrongdoing before the disclosure would be granted, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to what extent must the basis for the alleged impropriety by the ultimate wrongdoer be shown?” and observed that “[i]n essence this is a question of what the required standard of proof is for showing that a wrong had been carried out, or at least arguable carried out, by the wrongdoer (whom information is being sought <span class="font-italic">of</span>, not <span class="font-italic">from</span> should be” (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Reference was made to <span class="font-italic">United Company Rusal plc v HSBC Bank plc </span>[2011] EWHC 404 (QB) (at [50] ) where it was observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no dispute that the standard of proof which an applicant must attain before a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> order may be granted is that he has <span class="font-italic">at least an arguable case </span>…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Considering the above authorities, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> concluded at [44] that “ordinarily, the claimant must be able to show a reasonable <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of wrongdoing against the person(s) whom information/identity is sought <span class="font-italic">of</span> (not <span class="font-italic">from</span>)”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Therefore, the applicant has to show an arguable or prima facie case of wrongdoing against the person of whom information is sought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Necessary, Just and convenient</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> stated at [45] that</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A crucial requirement for obtaining a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> order is that the claimants have to show that the disclosure sought is necessary to enable him to take action, or at least that it is just and convenient in the interest of justice to make the order sought. … In other words, the information sought must be shown to be <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> “for the purposes of the claimant asserting his legal rights” … Yet another significant element in this requirement is the consideration of whether there exist an <span class="font-italic">alternative and more appropriate </span>method to obtain the information sought. In addition, there is the consideration of proportionality, where the court always maintains a residual discretion as to whether the order should be made in all the circumstance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Should the discovery sought by the plaintiffs be granted?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  Facilitation of wrongdoing</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On 3 March 2015, pursuant to the orders made by the Hong Kong Court, Bank Sarasin provided 4 arch lever folders (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Safra Sarasin Documentation</span>”) relating to the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account to the plaintiffs’ solicitors in Hong Kong. These documents show that a portion of the Purchase Funds were paid into the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account. It also showed that a number of remittances were made out of the Founder’s Hong Kong Bank Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Safra Sarasin Documentation also disclosed an email dated 13 March 2014 from the account manager of the Founder’s Hong Kong Account where it was noted that the Founder indicated that she wishes to “transfer the assets to other structure”.

The Hong Kong Court was of the view that this by itself was not sufficient reason to deny the order sought. Geoffrey Ma J (as he was then) expressed the view that it is not a requirement that the plaintiff must have sufficient information to establish a tracing claim before establishing an entitlement to relief. What is more important is that “there should be sufficiently cogent evidence of wrongdoing”  (at para 27(4)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>at [43] referred to Paul Matthews and Hodge M Malek QC, <span class="font-italic">Disclosure</span> (Thomas Reuters (Legal) Limited, 4th Ed, 2012) at para 3.06 where it is stated that “[i]t is not necessary for the claimant to establish that there has <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> been a wrong, although there must be at least <span class="font-italic">some reasonable basis</span> for contending that a wrong may have been committed” [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal expressed the view that having a “good arguable case” and “at least some reasonable basis” means not having to enter into speculative territory – there is a difference between trying to identify the wrongdoer and/or his role in the wrongdoing, and attempting to determine whether there has been <span class="font-italic">any</span> wrongdoing at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">A v </span>C, the plaintiff placed before the court affidavit evidence which constitutes prima face evidence that a fraud has been committed.

The applicant does not have to prove that the actual wrongdoing was committed at the time of the application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Applying these principles to the facts of this case, there is prima facie evidence that there may have been manipulation of the Company’s financial records.

The statement that the Founder owns SE is recorded again in the Remittance Instruction Form dated 24 March 2014.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Most significantly, in the Remittance Instruction Form dated 21 July 2014, it is recorded that the Founder states again that her relationship with SE is that “Success Elegant Trading Ltd is owned by [the Founder]”. This statement was made approximately <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">7 weeks after</span> the Founder had allegedly ceased to own and have any interest in SE after having sold the sole share in SE on 4 June 2014. In addition, the Founder transferred the significant amount of USD 2 million to a company which she claims to have no interest in. There has been no explanation as to the reason the Founder continues to claim she is the owner of SE and the reason this amount was transferred to SE by the Founder at a time when SE claims the Founder has no interest in SE.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as referred to earlier, when notified of the Singapore Injunctions, the contemporaneous correspondence show that CS treated the CS Account as being subject to the Singapore Injunctions, even though the injunction was only in respect of the Founder’s bank accounts. There was written confirmation on 12 March 2015 from Messrs Herbert Smith Freehills, solicitors for CS, that steps have been taken to comply with the Singapore Injunctions. Messrs Herbert Smith Freehills also sought the plaintiffs’ confirmation that it would be agreeable to CS dealing with the CS Bank Account to meet SE’s obligations in various transactions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The plaintiffs’ solicitor submits that CS on legal advice with full knowledge of who is the beneficial owner of the CS Account treated the CS Account as being subject to the Singapore Injunctions which were granted against the Founder. This shows that the Founder continues to have an interest in SE. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Similarly, when notified of the Singapore Injunctions, DB froze the DB Account. The plaintiffs’ solicitor submits that this shows that DB treated the DB Account as an account which is owned by the Founder. Therefore, there are two banks who have treated SE’s accounts as being subject to the Singapore Injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Further, apart from SE’s application to be joined to these proceedings to object to the discovery orders, there is no evidence of SE objecting to or filing any application challenging the freezing of their accounts in CS and DB pursuant to the Singapore injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Taking all the above into account, the plaintiffs submit that SE is beneficially owned by the Founder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I agree with the plaintiffs. If SE takes the position that its bank account should not be subject to the Singapore Injunctions, then I would have expected SE to file an application in court to challenge the freezing of its accounts. SE has not filed any such application. There is also not a single letter of protest from SE to CS and/or DB in respect of the alleged wrongful freezing of SE’s account, especially since it appears that the freezing of the CS Account has caused SE operationally difficulties with the utilisation of its funds as the plaintiffs’ consent is required for the payment of moneys from the CS Account to meet SE’s operational needs. Further, there has been no explanation as to why the Founder transferred USD 2 million dollars to a company she has no interest in. All these contemporaneous evidence taken together lead me to the conclusion that the Founder is the beneficial owner of SE and the fact that the CS Account and the DB Account are in the name of SE would not be a bar to the discovery orders sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Therefore, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have shown that they have an arguable case of fraudulent misrepresentation which entitled them to rescind the SPA and associated agreements and that the CS Account and the DB Account are beneficially owned by the Founder.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3)  Necessary, Just and convenient</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view it is necessary and just to order the disclosure of these documents from the banks. The Founder has stated her intention to transfer the funds out of reach of the plaintiffs and has taken steps to transfer the funds to other bank accounts. Without the court’s assistance, the plaintiffs would not know or would not know any information as to what happened to the funds.  It is clear that the documents sought are necessary for the plaintiffs to trace the funds. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jurisdictional issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 O24 r 6(5) provides that the Court may make the discovery orders “for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings…”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey Jones</span> held that discovery orders pursuant to O24 r 6(5) would only be granted if there is a likely prospect of subsequent proceedings being held in Singapore. The Court of Appeal said at [68-69] that the High Court's jurisdiction to order interrogatories is derived from s18(2) of the SCJA, which states that the High Court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule of the SCJA. The proceedings referred to in paragraph 12 of the First Schedule of the SCJA must refer to proceedings before the Singapore Court. The Court of Appeal was of the view that the applicant had to adduce some credible evidence of a Singapore nexus to the alleged third party wrongdoing. It went on to hold at [70] that that where (1) the specific alleged wrongdoing of leaking information to Dorsey was preceded by what appears to be a rather widespread release of that information worldwide; (2) there was no suggestion that the breach or disclosure took place and/or is actionable in Singapore; and (3) there was no likely prospect of subsequent proceedings being held in Singapore, the requested interrogatories were not allowed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 SE’s solicitors point out that, in light of <span class="font-italic">Dorsey </span><span class="font-italic">James</span>, the discovery order sought here cannot be granted in support of foreign proceedings. The plaintiffs’ solicitors counter this by arguing that <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> may be distinguished as it dealt with pre-action interrogatories. Further, the power to grant <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> orders<span class="font-italic"> </span>would be its power to grant equitable relief under paragraph 14 of the First Schedule of the SCJA which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reliefs and remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14. Power to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and equity, including damages in addition to, or in substitution for, an injunction or specific performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 My views are as follows. First, paragraph 12 of the 1st Schedule refers to discovery as well as interrogatories. Therefore, the Court of Appeal’s decision that “proceedings” referred to in paragraph 12 of the 1st Schedule must refer to proceedings before the Singapore court applies equally to this application for discovery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James </span>may be distinguished as the Court of Appeal found that in that case there was no credible evidence of a Singapore nexus to the alleged third party wrong doing. In this case, it is clear that the CS Bank Account and the DB Bank Accounts are all located in Singapore. The existence of bank accounts in Singapore coupled with the evidence that monies were transferred to the CS account and an inference that monies may have been transferred to the DB account, lead to a likely prospect that subsequent proceedings may be commenced in Singapore if the monies are still in the Singapore bank accounts or have been transferred to other bank accounts in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Without the discovery of the documents sought in the applications, the plaintiff simply does not know what happened to the money that was transferred to the Singapore bank accounts. The plaintiff would, therefore, not be able to even consider whether there is any prospect of commencing subsequent proceedings in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In light of the above, I am of the view that there is credible evidence of a Singapore nexus and paragraph 12 of the First Schedule of the SCJA is not a bar to the discovery orders sought by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 If, the court’s jurisdiction under O 24 r 6(5) does not extend to the discovery orders sought, then I am of the view that the discovery orders sought may be made under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The ambit of the court’s inherent jurisdiction was reviewed by Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Ptd Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span>”) where he held at [81]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The key criterion justifying invocation of [the court’s inherent jurisdiction] is therefore that of “need” – in order that justice be done and/or that injustice or abuse of process of the court be avoided …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 <span class="font-italic">Wellmix </span>was referred to by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine</span> where he agreed with the submission that “the touchstone for invoking the court’s inherent jurisdiction is necessity” and specifically, it is the “necessity to prevent injustice or abuse of the process of the court” (at [92]). Menon JC then reviewed cases concerning the court’s inherent power to make orders to facilitate the gathering of evidence by modern means as long as it is reasonably necessary for the cause of justice. He concluded at [96]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I consider that the court’s inherent jurisdiction may be resorted to, to make orders that are reasonable necessary in order for justice to be done in a case or to prevent any abuse of the process of the court.

The discovery orders sought are necessary to ensure justice is done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Therefore, for the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Court should grant the discovery orders sought by the plaintiffs under O24 r 6(5) and/or the Court’s inherent jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Banking Act and Part IV of the Evidence Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As CS and DB are both banks, they are subject to the duty of banking secrecy under s 47 of the Banking Act.

They referred to <span class="font-italic">Neate: Bank Confidentiality </span>(4th Ed, Tottel Publishing) which stated at p580:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems clear from [<span class="font-italic">Anthony</span> <span class="font-italic">Wee</span>] that a disclosure order under s 175 would be necessary before a bank would be exempted under this item from its duty of confidentiality, notwithstanding that an order under some other provision for disclosure had already been obtained.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This does, however, create a problem as an additional ‘exempting’ application under s 175 might be difficult to obtain in relation to disclosure orders to trace funds of fraudsters under the principle set out in <span class="font-italic">Bankers Trust v Shapira</span> – the scope of such orders are often wider than the orders for inspection of bankers’ books pursuant to s 175.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further, s 175 contemplates an existing legal proceeding and an ‘exempting’ application cannot be brought in a pre-action situation, for instance, in relation to disclosure pursuant to a <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span> order or even pre-action Mareva injunction orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In light of the above, parties were directed to provide further submissions on two issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Do the plaintiffs’ disclosure applications via OS 305 and OS 307 constitute “<span class="font-italic">legal proceedings</span>” within the meaning of s 175 read with s 170 of the Evidence Act?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On a related note, does the reference to “<span class="font-italic">arbitration</span>” in s 170 include foreign – seated arbitrations?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having reviewed the submissions of the plaintiffs and SE, I start by noting that it is not disputed that s 175 of the Evidence Act by itself does not give any independent, substantive right to the discovery of documents. The plaintiffs have submitted that the Singapore case of <span class="font-italic">Anthony</span><span class="font-italic"> Wee</span> and the Brunei case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Swee Leng</span><span class="font-italic"> v Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd </span>[1996] 5 MLJ 133 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Swee Leng</span>”) demonstrate that Part IV of the Evidence Act relates only to <span class="font-italic">how</span> evidence is to be provided by the banks after the Court decides in an independent legal proceedings that the order for discover against the bank is warranted. Part IV of the Evidence Act has no bearing on the logical prior question of <span class="font-italic">whether</span> discovery should be ordered in the first place. See<span class="font-italic"> Anthony </span><span class="font-italic">Wee </span>at [19]. I agree with the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Bearing the above in mind, the following requirements have to be satisfied before inspection may be allowed under s 175 of the Evidence Act:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There has to be separate legal proceedings commenced by the applicant; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Inspection of the bankers’ books is for the purposes of such proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legal Proceedings under s 175 of the Evidence Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In <span class="font-italic">Chan Swee Leng</span>, the High Court of Brunei considered the meaning of legal proceedings in the context of s7 of the Brunei Bankers’ Book Evidence Act (1879) (“BBEA”) which is in <span class="font-italic">pari material</span> with s 175 of our Evidence Act. It was held that before an order is made in the applicant’s favour pursuant to this section under the Evidence Act, the applicant has to first show that he is a party to separate legal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 What this means for OS 305 and OS 307 is that the plaintiffs have to show that they are a party to separate and independent legal proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 s 170 of the Evidence Act provides </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“legal proceedings” means any civil or criminal proceeding or inquiry in which evidence is or may be given, and includes an arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As the plaintiffs are parties to the CIETAC arbitration and an arbitration falls within the definition of legal proceedings, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs are parties to separate and independent legal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inspection of the bankers’ books has to be for the purpose of the CIETAC arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiffs have submitted that the documents are required for the following purposes:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) To identify third parties for the potential commencement of proceedings against them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) To ascertain the full nature of the wrongdoing perpetrated by the Founder and to enable the plaintiffs to plead their case properly; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) To trace assets in support of the plaintiffs’ proprietary claim against the Founder and third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The CIETAC arbitration is only between parties to the Acquisition as they are the only parties to the arbitration agreement. Third parties are not involved in the CIETAC arbitration and so the identification of third parties for the potential commencement of proceedings against them will not be for the purpose of the CIETAC arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The documents sought relate to what the Founder did with the funds <span class="font-underline">after</span> the Acquisition. It will contain no information on the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by the Founder which the plaintiffs say entitle them to rescind the SPA and related agreements. As such, I do not agree that the documents sought are required to ascertain the full nature of wrongdoing perpetrated by the Founder and will assist the plaintiffs in pleading their case properly at the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As for the request of the documents for the purpose of tracing, one of the remedies sought by the plaintiffs in the CIETAC arbitration is for the SPA and related agreements to be set aside and rescinded. If this remedy is granted, the plaintiffs may have a proprietary interest in the monies which have been transferred by the Founder which may entitle them to trace the said monies.  Where a plaintiff seeks to trace property which in equity belongs to him, the court not only has jurisdiction to grant an injunction restraining the disposal of that property, it may, in addition, make orders to ascertain the whereabouts of that property. Therefore, I am satisfied that the orders sought to assist with tracing the moneys which were transferred by the Founder to the respective bank accounts would be for the purpose of the CIETAC arbitrations as it would assist with the recovery of an award made in favour of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Does the International Arbitration Act prohibit the discovery sought by the plaintiffs?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 SE submitted that, under the International Arbitration Act (“IAA”), the Court’s powers to assist/intervene in international arbitrations (including foreign-seated arbitrations) by way of interim measures are found in s12A, IAA and the Court’s powers do not extend to making orders in respect of discovery of documents and interrogatories. As such, SE submitted that under the IAA and the Model Law, the Court has no power to grant discovery/ <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal</span>/<span class="font-italic">Bankers Trust</span> orders to assist international arbitrations whether seated in Singapore or abroad. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As the Court’s power to intervene in arbitrations are found solely in the IAA and Model law, it is SE’s position that the Court may not grant such orders in aid of the CIETAC arbitration, which is a foreign-seated arbitration under s 175 of the Evidence Act or the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. In <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>”), the Court of Appeal made it clear at [35-36] that the Court’s power to intervene in arbitrations are found solely in the IAA/Model Law and not elsewhere:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Article 5 of the Model Law (found in the First Schedule of the IAA) states;</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">ARTICLE 5</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">EXTENT OF COURT INTERVENTION</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">In matters governed by this Law, no court shall intervene except where so provided in this Law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The effect of Art 5 of the Model Law is to confine the power of the court to intervene in an arbitration to those instances which are provided for in the Model Law and to “exclude any general or residual powers” arising from sources other than the Model Law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Accordingly, it is the SE’s position that s 175 of the Evidence Act does not confer any power on the Court to assist an arbitration (whether a Singapore or foreign-seated arbitration) by way of a document productions/discovery process. It is only if a party to an arbitration seeks to enforce a discovery/document production order made by the tribunal against another party by leave of Court under section 12(6) IAA that s175 of the Evidence Act can be invoked. Even then, s12(6) IAA only pertains to Singapore-seated arbitrations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The plaintiffs’ counters this argument by pointing out that it overlooks the fact that the discovery orders sought are against the banks who are not parties to the CIETAC arbitration. The plaintiffs submit that since the Model Law only govern matters relating to the parties to the arbitration, it does not govern relief sought against non-parties to the arbitration. In <span class="font-italic">China Oce</span><span class="font-italic">an Shipping Co. Owners of The M/V Fu Ning Hai v Whistler International Ltd. Charterers of the M/V Fu Ning Hai</span> [1999] HKCFI 693 at pg 8, Findlay J stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">There is nothing in the Model Law that governs the matter of a party giving sufficient details about itself to enable the other party to know who it is and its whereabouts, and, therefore, the restriction in article 5 does not apply in this case.</span> Nor am I not satisfied that an order requiring a party to supply such details is an “interim measure of protection”. As far as I know, there is no express provision of any law that speaks about the situation here. So I am left with a clean slate, and must decide this matter on the basis of the inherent jurisdiction of this court. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I agree with the position taken by the plaintiffs. In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silicia Investors Ltd and other appeals </span>[2016] 1 SLR 373, the Court of Appeal stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">81 … Because the source of an arbitral tribunal’s power is contractual, its scope is necessarily limited to making orders which will be binding only upon the contracting parties…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 … An arbitrator whose powers are derived from a private agreement between A and B plainly has no jurisdiction to bind anyone else …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Therefore, as the orders sought in these applications are against non-parties to the CIETAC arbitration, the Court’s power to grant the relief sought in these applications is not affected by Article 5 of the Model Law and the IAA. It is also not material whether the CIETAC arbitration is a foreign-seated arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Accordingly, the IAA and/or the Model Law do not prohibit the Court from making the discovery orders which are sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the premises, I am satisfied that the requirements for discovery to be ordered pursuant to s 175 of the Evidence Act have been satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As I have earlier held that I am prepared to grant the discovery orders sought under O 24 r 6(5) ROC and/or its inherent jurisdiction and as the requirements of s 175 of the Evidence Act are satisfied, for the reasons stated above, I am prepared to grant the discovery orders sought by the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Scope of the discovery orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s caution in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James</span> that  the <span class="font-italic">Norwich Pharmacal/Bankers Trust </span>orders are intrusive in nature and that the application has to be confined to what is strictly necessary for disposing fairly of the cause or matter, I will confine the discovery sought to the documents which are necessary to trace the funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 As such, the documents which are to be ordered to be disclosed in each respective OS are as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The following documents within the 1st defendant’s possession, custody or power relating to any account held in the name of or beneficially owned by Zhang Lan (St Kitts and Nevis Passport No. RE0009358) and/or Success Elegant Trading Limited and or any alias known to the 1st defendant (collectively, the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Account</span><span class="font-weight-bold">(s)</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) The account opening forms and other related documents submitted for the purposes of opening the Account(s);</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) Bank statements in respect of the Account(s) setting out all transfers into and/or from the Account(s) from and including 13 December 2013 to the date of this Order (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Transfers</span>”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) Remittance slips, payment instructions and SWIFT instructions relating to the Transfers.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The documents to be disclosed herein do not apply to payments made from the Account(s) to the 1st defendant in respect of any fee or charges levied by the 1st defendant, or as payment for transactions entered into.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It is also ordered that documents disclosed by DB and CS respectively to the plaintiffs are to be used solely for the purpose of following and tracing the money, and not for any other purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Teck Ping Karen<br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mr Harpreet Singh, S.C., Mr Paul Sandosham, Ms Tan Mingfen, Mr Jerald Foo, Ms Elsa Goh (Cavenagh Law LLP) for the plaintiffs in OS 305/2015 and OS 307/2015;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ms Tan Xeauwei (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first defendant in OS 305/2015; <br/>Mr Chua Sui Tong and Mr Daniel Chan (WongPartnership LLP) for the first defendant in OS 307/2015;<br/>Mr Edmund Kronenburg and Ms Grace Loke (Braddell Brothers LLP) for the second defendant in OS 305/2015 and OS 307/2015.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
