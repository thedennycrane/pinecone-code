</div> Mr Yeo operated his business through a number of companies with the “JCS” namesake, one of which was called JCS-Echigo Pte Ltd (“JCS-Echigo”). With the hope of expanding his business into manufacturing for the aerospace industry, Mr Yeo formed a business partnership with Mr Abhilash for that purpose and set up a company called JCS-Vanilla Pte Ltd.

JCS-Vanetec later issued more shares and the proportions of its shareholding also changed as a result. At present, JCS-Vanetec has issued 550,000 shares. Mr Yeo holds 433,500 shares, which is 78.8% of JCS-Vanetec’s shareholding. One of Mr Yeo’s companies, JCS Group Co Ltd (“JCS Group”), holds 40,000 shares, which is 7.3%.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consent order and issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Prior to trial, Mr Yeo made an offer to purchase Mr Abhilash’s shares at a fair market value to be determined by the court. On the first day of trial, Mr Abhilash decided that he would accept Mr Yeo’s offer. They agreed that this would be effected by an order for Mr Yeo to buy Mr Abhilash’s shares at a price determined by the court, and so the parties recorded a consent order to this effect, as I have mentioned. Before proceeding further, it is useful at this juncture to clarify the jurisdiction upon which I have made the buy-out order in this case and its relationship with the parties’ consent order.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In the present case, the form and basis of the parties’ consent order takes direct reference from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Hoban Stevens Maurice Dixon v Scanlon Graeme John and others </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 770 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span>”). Similar to the parties in the present case, the parties in <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> indicated that they did not desire for the court to determine the defendants’ liability for minority oppression. They therefore agreed, by way a consent order, the terms of reference for an expert to determine the fair market value of the plaintiffs’ shares, which the defendants had agreed to purchase. Accordingly, the trial judge, V K Rajah J (as he then was), appointed an expert valuer to value the defendant company’s shares. In the event, the expert valuer valued the company at nil. The plaintiffs then attempted to persuade the Rajah J to adjust that valuation in favour of the plaintiffs in exercise of his power to make a buy-out order under s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act. Rajah J declined to exercise that power, on the basis that on a proper construction of s 216(2), that power was enlivened only upon a determination the defendant was liable for minority oppression under s 216(1): <span class="font-italic">Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 632 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoban</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) (No 1)</span>”) at [12] and [17].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeal, without issuing grounds, held that the issue of the defendants’ liability for minority oppression could no longer be litigated, and that the expert’s valuation was final: <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span> at [12]. The Court observed, however, that Rajah J had failed to exercise the discretion provided specifically in the parties’ consent order to adjust the valuation after hearing evidence on what the order had referred to as “non-pecuniary material circumstances”: <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span> at [12]. In the circumstances, the Court remitted the matter to Rajah J for him to consider exercising that discretionary power. Rajah J then convened a new trial for that purpose and, having examined the evidence, concluded that there still was no basis to vary the nil valuation: <span class="font-italic">Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon v Scanlon Graeme John </span>[2006] SGHC 136 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoban</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) (No 2)</span>”) at [15]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 From this decision, the plaintiffs brought the appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span>. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span> allowed the appeal and set aside the nil valuation. This was because on a proper interpretation of the consent order, the parties had contemplated an actual purchase of shares, and a nil valuation had made that impossible. This in turn rendered the consent order inoperable and the valuation liable to be set aside: <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span> at [42] and [44] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Chan Sek Keong CJ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The aspect of the <span class="font-italic">Hoban </span>decisions which is key and relevant to the present case is that the Court of Appeal when dealing with <span class="font-italic">Hoban </span><span class="font-italic">(HC) (No 1)</span> and again when considering <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) (No 2)</span> considered it entirely appropriate for the parties to argue and the trial judge to determine the value at which the plaintiffs’ shares would be bought by the defendants even though no finding of liability for minority oppression had been made. Indeed, much of the court’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span> was built on the premise that parties are entitled to compromise a s 216 action by agreeing that one party will buy out the other party’s shares, and by proceeding to trial on only the issue of the valuation of those shares. Had the court not accepted the legitimacy of this approach, it would not have held that liability for minority oppression by virtue of the parties’ consent order could no longer be litigated, and it would not have analysed the parties’ intentions behind the consent order in question to determine whether the order had become inoperable by reason of the Rajah J’s nil valuation of the shares in question: <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA) </span>at [12] and [35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 This approach is permissible for unfair prejudice claims in England as well. <span class="font-italic">In re A Company (No 003324 of 1979)</span> [1981] 1 WLR 1059 (“<span class="font-italic">In re A Company</span>”), the plaintiff sought an order to compel the defendants to purchase his minority shareholding on the ground that they had conducted the company’s affairs in an oppressive way within the meaning of s 210 of the Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK), which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia</span> with s 216 of our Act. In the event, the parties settled their differences and the petition was compromised. They then sought a determination on whether a consent order in Tomlin form setting out a scheme for purchase of the plaintiff’s shares was appropriate when a s 210 action was compromised. The English High Court held that it was appropriate. The minority oppression action in England has since become the action for unfair prejudice, but <span class="font-italic">In re A Company</span> is still cited for the proposition that such an action may be so compromised and the compromised terms will be given effect by the court: see Sir David Foskett (gen ed), <span class="font-italic">Foskett on Compromise</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2015) at para 23-12. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 It follows from this analysis that the basis of my jurisdiction, to order Mr Yeo to buy Mr Abhilash’s shares at the price I have determined, is the parties’ consent order of 19 October 2017. It is important to note that this type of jurisdiction is distinct from another (more commonly exercised) type of jurisdiction to make a buy-out order, which is predicated on the fulfilment of conditions imposed by statute. There are two instances of this latter type of jurisdiction. First, a court has the jurisdiction to make a buy-out order under s 216(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act when liability for minority oppression has been established: <span class="font-italic">Hoban (HC) (No 1)</span> at [12] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Rajah J. Second, a court has the jurisdiction to make a buy-out order under s 254(2A) of the Act, as an alternative to winding up the company, when the court is satisfied that either the directors have acted in the affairs of the company unfairly towards other members (s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)) or that it is just and equitable to wind up the company (s 254(2)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>)): <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping (administrator of the estate of Chng Koon Seng, deceased) v Scanone Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 95 (“<span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span>”) at [40] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Prakash JA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The philosophy which undergirds the ss 216(2) and 254(2A) jurisdiction is the idea that the buy-out order is not a “free-standing remedy”, in the sense that the Act does not allow an aggrieved member to “exit at will”: see <span class="font-italic">Ting Shwu Ping</span> at [46] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Prakash JA and <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827 at [31] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Chan Sek Keong CJ. As the buy-out order is essentially a forced sale, and considering that in ordinary circumstances the sale of shares is a voluntary transaction, the court will not force a sale unless there are good reasons for doing so. In this context, those good reasons are provided for in the Act, in particular, by the criteria specified in ss 216(2) and 254(2A). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 This philosophy does not apply to a consent order. By such an order, both parties agree that one will buy the other’s shares. Hence, by the very nature of such an arrangement, that other party will not be exiting the company “at will”, that is, on a unilateral whim. He will be doing so on the footing of a bilateral arrangement. There is therefore no reason why the court should not give effect to such an arrangement in so far as it is just and equitable to do so. Applying <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the court needs simply to ensure that a valuation greater than nil is returned so that the agreed buy-out scheme will not be rendered inoperable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The mandate contained in the consent order in the present case was to determine the fair market value of Mr Abhilash’s shares in JCS-Vanetec and, in line with <span class="font-italic">Hoban (CA)</span>, it was specified at para 6 that the valuation shall not be nil. By para 3, the valuation was to be on a pro-rata basis without any discount being made for a minority interest. Para 4 scoped the assessment to include issues between the parties as to whether the purchase of equipment, various payments to and from JCS-Vanetec, a contract with a Chinese original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”), and a proposal from a Chinese company should be taken into account for the purposes of the valuation. I found no reason not to give effect to these terms, and I therefore allowed the trial to proceed on only the issue of valuation and later heard the parties on that issue.

</div> Mr Abhilash argued that the income basis of valuation was appropriate because JCS-Vanetec was a going concern, and also because it had a significant amount of goodwill, which was evidenced by existing contracts, past investment offers, and certifications which qualified JCS-Vanetec to manufacture aerospace components for well known companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Mr Abhilash’s valuation expert, Mr Sridhar Rao (“Mr Rao”), produced two main estimations of JCS-Vanetec’s value.

</div> The defendants rejected Mr Rao’s valuation of JCS-Vanetec on the investment basis because that was not the basis of valuation that the parties agreed upon according to the consent order. The defendants also rejected the income basis of valuation because JCS-Vanetec was a historically loss making company. They submitted that Mr Rao’s projection of JCS-Vanetec’s future cash flows was predicated on speculation, and therefore could not be relied upon to arrive at an accurate valuation. Properly performed, a valuation on the income basis, according to the defendants’ expert, Mr Thio, showed that JCS-Vanetec had a negative equity value. Accordingly, the net assets basis was the only sensible basis for determining the company’s fair market value. That value was $109,589,

Mr Thio’s valuation was the only valuation conducted on that basis. As there was no basis for any modification, Mr Thio’s valuation was accepted. I turn now to explain my views.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Valuation methods</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The investment basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I start with the highest valuation in evidence which was made of JCS-Vanetec. As I have mentioned, Mr Rao arrived at it on the investment basis. Counsel for the defendants, Mr Divyanathan, disagreed with using an investment basis because the consent order states at para 2 that it is the “fair market value” of JCS-Vanetec which should be assessed. He argued that since my jurisdiction is derived from the parties’ consent order, I must exercise it according to the terms of that order, and that would rule out any assessment of the investment value of the shares. For ease of reference, I reproduce para 2 in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The determination of the Honourable Court at the trial of this action shall be confined to the fair market valuation of the 2nd Defendant as at 30.4.16 (“Valuation”) for the purposes of the sale and purchase of the Plaintiff’s 76,500 ordinary shares in the 2nd Defendant (“Subject Shares”) by the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant respectively. The Plaintiff shall sell and the 1st Defendant shall buy the Subject Shares at the said fair market valuation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Counsel for Mr Abhilhash, Mr Liew, responded by highlighting that under s 216(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), the court in making a buy-out order has an unfettered discretion to consider all facts and circumstances to come to a valuation that is fair, just and equitable between the parties: <span class="font-italic">Koh Keng Chew and others v Liew Kit Fah and others</span> [2017] SGHC 52 at [5] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Chua Lee Ming J, referred to with approval in <span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek and others v Lee Shung Guan and others</span> [2017] SGHC 212 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek</span>”) at [31] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Vinodh Coomaraswamy J; see also the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Hung Khiang v Dickson Investments (Singapore) and others</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 773 at [72] <span class="font-italic">per</span> M Karthigesu JA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Liew’s submission was not persuasive. As I have mentioned earlier at [13] above, the jurisdiction by which I conducted the valuation exercise was derived from the parties’ consent order, and not from the jurisdiction under s 216(2) of the Act. I was therefore guided by the terms of the consent order, which had been framed with some precision. By para 2, the consent order identified a specific accounting standard, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “fair market value”, for the valuation of JCS-Vanetec. In contrast to that standard, the investment value is an entity-specific basis of value which shows the value of an asset to a particular owner or prospective owner for individual investment or operational objectives.

I therefore did not take a strictly literal approach to the consent order because that, too, would have created problems. Para 4 sets out a specific list of matters that the court should consider in deciding whether to adjust the valuation arrived at by the experts in order to determine the true fair market value of JCS-Vanetec. If para 2 were read literally, then there would be no need for the inquiry stated at para 4.4 – “Whether the Chinese proposal [referring to a proposal to buy JCS-Vanetec’s shares put forward by a company called Shanghai Ossen] has any effect on the Valuation of the Subject Shares.” This is because the Chinese proposal was evidence of investor sentiment, which is strictly speaking irrelevant to the company’s fair market value, on a technical definition of that term. It was therefore clear to me, on a fair reading of the order as a whole, that the parties intended that the court value the company based on all the evidence proffered, which included Mr Rao’s suggestion of the investment basis and Mr Abhilash’s evidence of the offer from Shanghai Ossen. What Mr Yeo’s submissions proposed was to use Mr Thio’s valuation as a base, and make such adjustments as necessitated by the other components of the consent order.

In short, a minority shareholding may be valued (a) as a rateable proportion of the total value of the company as a going concern without any discount for the fact that the holding in question is a minority holding; (b) as before but with such a discount; or (c) as a rateable proportion of the net assets of the company at their break up or liquidation value. Option (b) was ruled out by para 3 of the consent order in the present case: the parties had agreed that no discount would be made for Mr Abhilash’s interest being a minority shareholding. Mr Rao proposed option (a), while Mr Thio’s view was that it must be option (c).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Mr Thio accepted at the hearing that generally, the income approach is preferred to the net assets approach for a company which is going concern, such as JCS-Vanetec. His rationale for using the net assets basis of valuation was that this was the most appropriate for a loss-making company. He reiterated the point made at para 2.1.1 of his expert report that the net assets approach is suited to loss-making businesses.

</div> This was because, using an income basis of valuation, specifically in the form of the discounted cash flow method of valuation, yielded a negative value for JCS-Vanetec. He attempted a valuation of JCS-Vanetec using this method, and at para 3.3.1 of his report, he explained:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… since JCS has had a negative EBITDA [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] except for FY2015 (due to a one-off order from JCS Technologies Pte Ltd) and a [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] since JCS is expected to generate a negative EBITDA until FY2020, <span class="font-italic">we do not find that it is possible to meaningfully apply the market approach as this will result in a negative value based on EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT and P/E multiples</span>.

</div> He also projected an increase in gross margin from 22.6% in FY2017 to 39% in FY 2021. Despite this, JCS-Vanetec was expected to become profitable only in FY2021 after cumulative losses of $2.7m from FY2016 May to FY2020 in December. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Mr Abhilash argued for an income approach on two grounds: first, that JCS-Vanetec is a going concern; and second, that JCS-Vanetec possesses intangible assets which not only have inherent value but also have the potential to generate future revenue. The first argument was tenuous. The common understanding of a “going concern” is a company that is operating with a turnover that enables the company to be self-sustaining: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek </span>at [37] where Coomaraswamy J discusses how an income valuation may be based either on a company’s profits or future cash flows. In the present case, it is not disputed that JCS-Vanetec is historically a loss-making company that has been kept afloat by Mr Yeo’s capital injections and various bank loans. Barring a record of sufficiently strong historical revenue upon which to project future profits, there was no basis upon which to adopt an income basis valuation. It was not disputed that, without more, the company must be attributed a negative value. Accordingly, it was the second argument that was important to the analysis: it was crucial for Mr Abhilash to establish that JCS-Vanetec’s intangible assets could generate future revenue for the company. On this hypothesis, JCS-Vanetec would cease to be loss-making, and the income expected to be generated would make the income basis plausible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I focused, therefore, on the intangible assets which were foundational to Mr Rao’s valuation. These assets comprised: (a) JCS-Vanetec’s contract with a Chinese original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) called Aviation Industry Corporation of China (“AVIC”); (b) JCS-Vanetec’s certifications with various other OEMs; and (c) JCS-Vanetec’s patent application for a specialised industrial process it applies, referred to as the “cold-roll forming process”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">JCS-Vanetec’s intangible assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is appropriate, before I set out my analysis of these assets, to explain the standard of proof to which I held Mr Abhilash. In so far as Mr Abhilash submitted that the three intangible assets I have set out above represent sources of future revenue for JCS-Vanetec, he need only have shown that it was <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> for his expert, Mr Rao, to regard them as such. That is because, as Coomaraswamy J highlights in <span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek</span> at [42], there is “no provable truth with regard to the future”, and that “where an expert makes an assumption as to a future event, the court must consider both qualitatively whether the expert’s assumption is reasonable in the light of the evidence and also quantitatively the likelihood of the assumed event actually materialising”. However, it should go without saying that insofar as Mr Abhilash relied on <span class="font-italic">present facts</span> to make good those reasonable assumptions, those facts had to be proved on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) The AVIC contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The first of the three intangible assets is a contract between JCS-Vanetec and AVIC (“the AVIC contract”). This is a contract for JCS-Vanetec to manufacture a product called the S3001 HPC Airfoil Assembly, which is essentially a ring component used for the manufacture of aeroplane engines, for AVIC.

</div> – not even that it <span class="font-italic">has become</span> AVIC’s supplier – and in any case, there was no evidence to show that JCS-Vanetec is in fact close to securing such a deal.

Mr Abhilash stated that this was how the court in <span class="font-italic">Poh Fu Tek</span> accounted for the fact that there might be no future sales relationship between the company being valued in that case and a client of that company called Roxol.

It was therefore also not clear that the technology sought to be patented was novel. Without expert evidence on how an in-progress patent application should be valued, I had no basis upon which to draw any conclusion on the value that the cold-roll forming process contributed to JCS-Vanetec without reference to the sales it may generate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on basis for valuation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Accordingly, none of the intangible assets that Mr Abhilash referred to – the AVIC contract, the certifications and the cold-roll forming process – could reasonably be said to be sources of future revenue for JCS-Vanetec, in large part because he did not produce a single piece of evidence that would assist me in the determination of the existence, likelihood and size of such revenue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In this context, I observe that, as I alluded to at [29], Mr Thio in his expert report performed an assessment of JCS-Vanetec’s value not only on a net assets basis but also on an income basis. Mr Thio’s income basis assessment does not (for good reason, as I have found) take into account future revenue from sales to AVIC, unlike Mr Rao’s valuation. Importantly, on Mr Thio’s assessment, JCS-Vanetec would remain loss-making until the financial year ending 31 December 2018, with a small profit in 2019 and 2020. The valuation of JCS-Vanetec, on the income approach, thus adjusted, still remained at zero.

</div> Mr Rao’s valuation was premised on factual assumptions which are not supported by the evidence and it would not be apposite to accept his valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I was therefore left with a company with an undisputed loss-making record. There was therefore no good accounting reason to apply the income approach. A further reason not to apply that approach was that I accepted the evidence of Mr Thio that such an approach would yield a nil valuation and the parties had agreed at para 6 of the consent order that the value of the company would not be set at nil. Accordingly, Mr Thio’s conclusion, that the applicable method in such a situation is the net assets basis of valuation, was therefore sensible and principled, and I accepted this basis of valuation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Valuation to be used</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Mr Thio’s net assets value (“NAV”) valuation was the only available NAV valuation of the company in evidence, and was therefore my starting point. Critically, Mr Rao did not offer a counter-valuation on the NAV basis, and so Mr Abhilash had no viable basis upon which to impugn Mr Thio’s valuation. I also found no basis for adjusting the valuation that Mr Thio had reached.

</div> As I had concluded that those assets did not provide good reason for adopting the income basis of valuation, the issue was how that criticism should affect the NAV analysis. On this question, Mr Rao had no view. During the trial, I asked Mr Rao what his valuation of the company would be on the net assets basis if I were to find the income basis unsuitable. He was unable to give an answer, responding: “I wouldn’t know right off the cuff”.

Mr Abhilash further submitted that Mr Thio, by his omission to include goodwill in his valuation, failed to make a proper NAV valuation.

I accepted this approach, especially having considered that despite Mr Abhilash’s assertion that these assets have inherent value, he produced no evidence to assist me in determining that value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Two more submissions made by Mr Abhilash remain to be dealt with. The first was that JCS-Vanetec cannot be worth only $109,589 because a Chinese company called Shanghai Ossen expressed interest in 2015 to purchase all of JCS-Vanetec’s shares for $50m.

</div> In the event, the investment did not proceed, but the suggestion was that the mere fact of this investment shows that JCS-Vanetec must be worth more than Mr Thio’s valuation. Mr Abhilash said that Shanghai Ossen “would not have thrown up the figure of S$50 million … if they did not reasonably carry out background checks and were reasonably satisfied that it was justified”.

I also rejected any idea that Mr Thio’s valuation should be adjusted in any way because of this offer, for three reasons. First, the contention that Shanghai Ossen would not have suggested the figure unless they had done their checks is speculation: no evidence on this was led by Mr Abhilash. Second, the offer was subject to a due diligence check which was never carried out.

</div> Second, Mr Yeo provided a positive explanation for the price of $37.50, and it is an explanation that I found sensible. His evidence was that the $1.5m transaction was an injection of capital into JCS-Vanetec, which was then in need of funds. Consideration for that transaction of $1.5m was provided in the form of JCS-Vanetec’s shares, and the number of shares issued was calibrated to ensure that the value of Mr Abhilash’s shareholding after the capital injection would  neither be inflated nor diluted excessively.

</div> I accepted this evidence.

Second, JCS-Vanetec paid for the machine only <span class="font-italic">after</span> JCS Greentech was incorporated, and this is evidenced by an invoice for that transaction – relating to the same order for which the earlier quotation was issued – dated April 2016.

</div> and this explanation was not challenged. Most importantly, Mr Thio explained candidly that the issuance of that quotation was an irregularity attributable to the fact that the defendants’ “internal controls are not that strong” and that there were “quite a few errors here”.

</div> Mr Thio testified nevertheless that he had reviewed these errors and found that no loss had been caused to the company. It accordingly should have no effect on JCS-Vanetec’s valuation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Finally, transaction (c) is related to the capital injection of $1.5m that I have mentioned at [57] above. It was not disputed that after JCS Group transferred $1.5m to JCS-Vanetec on 20 November 2015, a Friday, Mr Yeo just three days later on 23 November 2015 withdrew $780,000 to the benefit of JCS Group. Mr Abhilash’s contention, based purely on the short duration within which that substantial sum was withdrawn, was that Mr Yeo was “simply manipulating the accounts and the shareholding of [JCS-Vanetec] to his benefit instead of allowing [JCS-Vanetec] to be able to rely on the funds to continue or even to increase its production capacity”.

As the defendants observe, the loan agreement underlying the capital injection of $1.5m – which was signed by Mr Abhilash himself

</div> Mr Abhilash’s forensic accounting expert, Mr Low See Lien, accepted that if the payment of $780,000 was a repayment of a loan “vis-à-vis the terms and contracts of a loan”, then there is no impropriety in the repayment.

This timeframe was envisaged by para 7 of the consent order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 On the issue of costs, I note that in <span class="font-italic">Hoban (No 1) (HC)</span> at [20], Rajah J ordered each side to bear its own costs. In principle, this must be the usual order in cases where parties have settled on the issue of liability for minority oppression. In this case, however, there was an offer to settle dated 16 May 2017 which remained open up to the time I gave my decision. After hearing parties, I ordered Mr Abhilash to pay the costs of the trial. Upon Mr Liew’s concession that Mr Divyanathan’s requested sum of $99,000 (excluding disbursements) was reasonable, costs were fixed at that sum, with liberty to apply if disbursements could not be agreed. I also ordered Mr Abhilash to pay the costs of his application for an interlocutory injunction,
