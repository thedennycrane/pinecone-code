<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of a
                    Judicial Commissioner to allow a claim by the respondent, Crédit Industriel et
                    Commercial (“CIC”), a French bank, against the appellant,
                    Mr Teo Wai Cheong (“Teo”), its former private banking client,
                    for sums due under five financial products known as “accumulators”
                    (“the Disputed Accumulators”) (see <em>Crédit
                        Industriel et Commercial v Teo Wai Cheong</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1149
                    (“GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Ms Ng Su Ming (“Ng”) was
                    Teo’s banking relationship manager (“RM”) at CIC. Ng and Teo
                    have known each other since 2004. Ng was also Teo’s RM when she was
                    working at Citibank Singapore. Teo became a private banking customer of CIC when
                    Ng moved to CIC in 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Teo’s financial products made with or
                    through CIC were initially in foreign exchange options, equity linked notes and
                        shares<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. In June 2007, Ng introduced Teo to
                    accumulators which were, at that time, new financial products.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The features of an accumulator are not
                        disputed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> An accumulator
                    is essentially a transaction in which an investor agrees to periodically
                    purchase a quantity of shares of a specified counter from a counterparty at a
                    discount to the market price of the counter at the beginning of the transaction.
                    We will refer to the market price of the counter at the beginning of the
                    transaction as “the Spot Price” and the discounted price as
                    “the Forward Price”. The documents sometimes refer to the Spot
                    Price as “the Initial Price” and the Forward Price as “the
                    Strike Price”. The investor’s obligation to periodically purchase
                    shares may be prematurely terminated by agreement. The accumulator will also
                    terminate if the market price of the shares rises above a specified price known
                    as “the Knock-out Price”. The accumulator will, however, continue
                    for a specified period if it provides for a guaranteed purchase
                    (“Guaranteed Purchase”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The amount of shares that the investor is
                    required to purchase under the accumulator will depend on the market price of
                    the shares at the end of each period. The length of each period may be a day, a
                    week or a month. If the market price at the end of a particular period closes at
                    or above the Forward Price, the investor must purchase a specified quantity of
                    shares at the Forward Price<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. If, however, the market price on that day
                    falls below the Forward Price, the investor must purchase <em>double</em> the specified quantity of shares at the Forward Price
                    (“the Doubling Feature”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       A numerical example will help in understanding
                    how an accumulator operates. The following table summarises the key terms of a
                    typical accumulator involved in the present appeal:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>If the market price at the end of a particular period (in this
                    accumulator, the period is a day) is S$1.70, the investor will have to
                    accumulate 1,000 shares at the price of S$1.6335 per share. This is because the
                    market price at the end of the day was higher than the Forward Price but lower
                    than the Knock-out Price. However, if the market price at the end of the day is
                    S$1.60, which is a figure that is less than the Forward Price, the investor will
                    have to accumulate 2,000 shares at the same price of S$1.6335 per share. If the
                    market price at the end of the day is S$1.90, the accumulator will be
                    knocked-out. The obligations of the investor will cease. However, he is entitled
                    to retain any shares that he has accumulated before the accumulator is
                    knocked-out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Another feature of an accumulator which should
                    be noted is the maximum liability of an investor under an accumulator. Assuming
                    that the accumulator does not knock-out prematurely, the investor’s
                    maximum obligation under the accumulator in dollar terms is the cost of any
                    Guaranteed Purchase plus his cost of purchasing double the specified quantity of
                    shares at the Forward Price for each period (“the Maximum
                        Obligation”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The process for establishing accumulators</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       CIC did not structure the accumulators that are
                    the subject of this appeal entirely by itself. CIC first entered into
                    accumulators with other banks. CIC then entered into accumulators with its
                    clients. It is necessary for us to describe CIC’s process for establishing
                    accumulators for its clients because the process is relevant to Teo’s
                    defence that he had never authorised the purchase of the five accumulators which
                    is the subject matter of CIC’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       CIC’s order process, so far as relevant to
                    the issues on appeal, is as follows. If a client decides to enter into an
                    accumulator transaction, he will instruct his RM to establish an accumulator at
                    a range of prices and for an approximate range of Maximum
                        Obligation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The RM will then place the order
                    with CIC’s private bank advisory office (“PBA”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    It should be noted that the RM’s conversations with PBA’s officers
                    are recorded. Before placing the order with PBA, the RM may consolidate orders
                    placed by the client with orders placed by other clients.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Mr Jean Luc-Anglada
                    (“Anglada”), CIC’s regional manager for the Asia Pacific
                    region, deposed that it is common for RMs to consolidate orders placed by their
                    clients because some banks have a minimum order requirement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    PBA will then place the RM’s order with CIC’s
                        counterparty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> It should be noted that the
                    conversations between PBA’s officers and the officers of CIC’s
                    counterparty are also recorded. If the order is successful, the RM will provide
                    a customer services officer (“CSO”) with a breakdown of the
                    individual orders placed by each of his clients if the order was a consolidated
                        order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The CSO will enter the
                    breakdown into CIC’s database to establish accumulators between CIC and
                    each client.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> CIC will then generate
                    and send confirmation notes for the transaction to each client.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

                    2007 (“the First Disputed Conversation”). The First Disputed
                    Conversation lasted 2 minutes and 22 seconds. The First Disputed
                    Conversation was not recorded. The First Disputed Conversation occurred just

                    the Fifth Disputed CE Accumulator during a conversation between Ng and Teo at
                    10.27am on 3 October 2007 (“the Second Disputed
                    Conversation”). The Second Disputed Conversation lasted for 1 minute
                    and 15 seconds. The Second Disputed Conversation was also not
                    recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Because these two conversations were not
                    recorded, Ng and Teo gave different accounts of what was said between them.
                    Turning first to the First Disputed Conversation, Ng’s evidence in her
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) was that Teo instructed
                    her to establish the First, Second, Third and Fourth Disputed CE Accumulators
                    after she informed Teo of the maximum amount of shares that he would be obliged
                    to accumulate under <em>each</em> of those
                        accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Ng also claimed that she informed

                    In her testimony during cross-examination, Ng claimed that Teo instructed her to
                    enter into an accumulator for CE shares with a Maximum Obligation of
                    approximately S$6m and at a Spot Price between S$1.75 to S$1.82.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the Second Disputed Conversation, in
                    her AEIC, Ng claimed that Teo instructed her to enter into a CE accumulator and
                    a Sembcorp accumulator after she informed Teo of the maximum quantity of shares
                    that he would be obliged to accumulate under each accumulator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Ng also claimed that she informed Teo of the

                    cross-examination, Ng said she was instructed to enter into an accumulator for

                    between S$1.64 and S$1.70.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> This order was later
                    converted into the Fifth Disputed Accumulator. Ng was not cross-examined on her
                    account of the Second Disputed Conversation in relation to the Disputed Sembcorp
                    Accumulator.</p>

                    and Second Disputed Conversations. In his AEIC, Teo did not specifically address
                    each conversation. Teo simply deposed that Ng told him on or about 2 or
                    3 October 2007 that one of the Undisputed CE Accumulators and a Cosco
                    accumulator had knocked-out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Teo also claimed that he discussed share
                    price movements for the purpose of selling shares accumulated under accumulators
                    that had been knocked-out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> When
                    questioned on his recollection of the First Disputed Conversation, Teo
                    acknowledged that it was possible that he discussed establishing a CE
                    accumulator but he could not recall if there was actually such a
                        discussion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Teo also maintained his
                    assertion that he spoke to Ng about shares accumulated under accumulators that
                    had been knocked-out, <em>viz</em>, Cosco, NOL and CE
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> As for the Second Disputed
                    Conversation, Teo’s evidence during cross-examination was that it was not
                    possible that the conversation was about establishing a CE accumulator or a
                    Sembcorp accumulator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> He also initially testified
                    that the Second Disputed Conversation was about the share price movements of NOL

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Teo also claimed that he gave Ng two
                    instructions on limiting his exposure to accumulators: (a) on 20 July
                    2007, Teo instructed Ng that his exposure on accumulators should not exceed the
                    net asset value of his account with CIC and that the share counters to be
                    accumulated must be “blue chips”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> and (b) on 27 September
                    2007, Teo instructed Ng that his exposure on accumulators should not exceed S$1m

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judicial Commissioner gave judgment for
                    CIC on its claims. He held that Teo authorised the Disputed Accumulators during
                    the First Disputed Conversation and the Second Disputed Conversation on the
                    basis of the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ng’s testimony on the contents
                        of the First Disputed Conversation and the Second Disputed Conversation,
                        which the Judicial Commissioner found more credible than Teo’s

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Teo’s prior experience with the
                        Undisputed Accumulators, which included the Undisputed CE Accumulators, and
                        his retention of shares accumulated under those Undisputed CE

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     These were essentially findings of fact based
                    on the Judicial Commissioner’s assessment of credibility and demeanour of
                    the witnesses, and also the documentary evidence adduced by the parties. In the
                    course of reviewing the record after we reserved judgment, we noted that certain
                    transcripts of telephone conversations and other documents in the possession of
                    CIC were not disclosed and also those produced had certain portions redacted. We
                    were informed by counsel that the redactions were not objected to by Teo’s
                    counsel and were accepted by the Judicial Commissioner on the ground that the
                    redacted portions or undisclosed documents related to CIC’s other clients,
                    and that any disclosure of the said information would have contravened s 47
                    of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Banking
                    Act”) on banking secrecy. These clients were identified as “Client
                    A”, “Client B” and “Client C”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We also noted from the disclosed materials
                    that the orders that Teo was alleged to have placed during the Disputed
                    Conversations did not correspond with the orders that Ng placed with CIC’s
                    PBA office. We knew this because, unlike the Disputed Conversations, Ng’s
                    conversations with CIC’s PBA office were recorded and transcribed (see
                        [9]). Hence, there was objective
                    evidence of Ng’s execution of all orders with CIC’s PBA office.
                    CIC’s explanation for the lack of correspondence was that Ng consolidated
                    orders placed by her other clients (<em>viz</em>, Clients
                    A, B and C) with Teo’s orders. She then placed the consolidated orders
                    with CIC’s PBA office. CIC’s PBA office executed the consolidated
                    orders by entering into accumulators with other banks. After accumulators for
                    the consolidated orders were established between CIC and the other banks, Ng
                    would issue instructions to establish accumulators between CIC and each client
                    for the amount they each ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We were of the view that the evidence relating
                    to the orders placed by the other clients was relevant in the light of this
                    practice of consolidating orders. Moreover, there was also evidence that
                    one/some of these clients had also disputed that they had authorised Ng to
                    purchase CE accumulators for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In any case, we were of the view that the
                    redacted portions should not have been redacted, and that all materials relating
                    to Ng’s placing of the orders for the Disputed Accumulators should have
                    been disclosed so that the court could have all the relevant evidence to show
                    whether Ng or Teo was telling the truth as to whether he had authorised her to
                    purchase the five Disputed Accumulators. In our view, s 47(1) of the
                    Banking Act does not prohibit the disclosure of “customer
                    information” where the customer cannot be identified, for the reason that
                    that term is defined in s 40A of the Banking Act as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“customer information” , in relation to a bank, means
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    any information relating to, or any particulars
                            of, an account of a customer of the bank, whether the account is in
                            respect of a loan, investment or any other type of transaction, but
                                <b><em>does not include any information that is not
                                referable to any named customer or group of named
                                customers</em></b>; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    deposit information;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, on a plain reading of s 47, disclosure of all the
                    telephone conversations and other records where the customers are named
                    “Client A”, “Client B” and “Client C”
                    would merely be disclosure of “any information that is not referable to
                    any named customer or group of named customers” and would not, thus,
                    constitute a disclosure of “customer information”.</p>

                        discussing with you how we will move forward as the market unfolds in the
                        coming months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You may not be aware that one of China Energy’s biggest shareholders
                        is the *ASEAN China Investment Fund Limited which is actually a SINO-SWISS
                        partnership between a [<em>sic</em>] Swiss Government
                        and UOB Venture Management Limited. They have 95,000,000 shares. The biggest
                        shareholder of the ASEAN China Investment Fund Limited is China Development
                        Bank. This is a good indication of the positive direction of China’s
                        alternative energy sector as the world and China continues its search for
                        alternative fuel sources as oil prices continue to rise. And China Energy
                        Limited’s position as one of the biggest Dimethanol producers would
                        mean that it is poised to capitalize on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Currently, you have already picked up 404,000 shares of China Energy. We
                        are accumulating 13500 shares per day for 360 days at a strike price of an
                        average of S$1.60. As I have mentioned to you previously, the collateral
                        shortfall is currently at USD 4,500,000 and it is the Bank’s view that
                        you could mitigate this shortfall with the greatest urgency.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It may be recalled that the Judicial
                    Commissioner accepted Ng’s evidence that Teo had given her instructions to
                    purchase the five Disputed Accumulators, and rejected Teo’s denial of the
                    existence of such instructions. In relation to this finding, the italicised
                    words in the second paragraph of the above passage may or may not support
                    Ng’s evidence. They are ambiguous and Ng should testify and be
                    cross-examined on what she meant by those words.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Another newly disclosed document may be
                    material to the finding of the Judicial Commissioner against Teo in relation to
                    his conduct after he had allegedly disputed Ng’s authority to purchase the
                    Disputed Accumulators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Teo had meetings with Mr Paul Kwek
                    (“Kwek”), CIC’s Managing Director and Head of Private
                    Banking, and Anglada on 20 and 28 November 2007 (GD at [67]–[73]). Kwek sent an email dated 20 November 2007 to his
                    superiors in which he recorded what transpired at the 20 November 2007
                    meeting. That email recorded that Teo had said he was not denying the Disputed
                    Accumulators. The Judicial Commissioner accepted that Kwek’s email
                    correctly recorded the contents of the meeting (GD at [72]). He further held that Teo’s own
                    emails to CIC on 21 and 23 November 2007 were similar to Kwek’s
                    contemporaneous internal record of the 20 November 2007 meeting (GD at
                        [70]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, a newly disclosed internal document
                    that CIC’s Credit and Risk Department sent to its head office seems to
                    give a different account of this event. The document bears the title
                    “Watchlist and Provisions Report as at 30 November 2007”
                    (“the November Watchlist Report”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>
                    The November Watchlist Report was prepared for Teo’s account. It appears
                    to have been sent by CIC’s Credit and Risk Department via email on
                    24 December 2007 to one Marie Rose Fenet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> The following portion in
                    the November Watchlist Report, under the section entitled “reasons for
                    watchlist/provisions”, is material:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">RM booked equity accumulator transactions above approved credit limit and
                        pending adequate funding. When the equity market corrected severely,
                        unrealized losses escalated. <em>Matter is tenuous as the
                            client is arguing that he did not authorize the outstanding 5 equity
                            accumulator trades that caused that huge under margin and asset
                            shortfall position</em>. Top up requirement as at end Nov 07 was
                        USD4.920k based on internal guidelines for the full funding of the maximum
                        potential number of shares that may be picked up during the life of the
                        equity accumulator. Based on estimated unwinding cost of the equity as at
                        end Nov 07, against the market value of the customer’s asset held by
                        the bank, there is a shortfall of USD1,372.88k. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The italicised words would suggest that on 30 November 2007 CIC
                    was aware that Teo was alleging that the Disputed Accumulators were
                    unauthorised. The November Watchlist Report contradicts Kwek’s
                    20 November 2007 email and also the evidence of Kwek and Anglada during
                    cross-examination that Teo did not argue that the Disputed Accumulators were
                    unauthorised when he met with CIC’s management on 20 and 28 November
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Just two days after the
                    28 November 2007 meeting, CIC’s internal documents recorded or seemed
                    to suggest that CIC knew that Teo was alleging that the Disputed Accumulators
                    were unauthorised. Again, Kwek and Anglada may well have a valid explanation for
                    these apparent discrepancies. In this connection, CIC has in fact argued in its
                    written submissions that the November Watchlist Report was sent on
                    24 December 2007 to state CIC’s exposure as at 30 November
                        2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> CIC also argued that the reference to a
                    lack of authorisation in the Watchlist Report referred to Teo’s complaint
                    over the level of his exposure.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> We are unable
                    to determine the truth of this explanation simply by reading the November
                    Watchlist Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     If it were the case or if it could be
                    established that these two documents lent some support to Teo’s defence,
                    it might or might not have influenced the Judicial Commissioner’s other
                    findings of fact against Teo. These were findings which depended on the Judicial
                    Commissioner’s evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses. There are
                    also other matters in the newly discovered materials which counsel for Teo is
                    entitled to raise in support of Teo’s defence. The question on which we
                    have deliberated is whether in the circumstances, we should remit the case back
                    to the Judicial Commissioner to consider the new materials or to order a retrial
                    of the case. We have decided that in all the circumstances of this case a fresh
                    trial is the better solution, notwithstanding that a fresh trial may take more
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Accordingly, we set aside the judgment of the
                    Judicial Commissioner and order that a new trial be fixed for CIC’s claim
                    and Teo’s counterclaim in this case. We order that costs of the trial
                    below and this appeal be costs in the cause. There will be the usual
                    consequential orders.</p>
