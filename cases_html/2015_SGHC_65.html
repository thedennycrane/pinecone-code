<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In
the last few decades, international arbitration has emerged as an attractive
and, in certain industries, the preferred form of dispute resolution.
Parties opt for arbitration for various tactical, strategic, and commercial
reasons including the flexibility to select the tribunal who, in their
assessment, is best suited to preside over the dispute bearing in
mind the complexity of the case. Finality of the arbitral award
is also perceived as a significant advantage though it would be
fair to say that the perception is viewed less advantageously, after
the fact, by the losing party. Curial intervention is therefore
available only in limited circumstances, including instances where
there has been a breach of natural justice, where the award is tainted
by fraud or corruption, or where the award has been made <em>ultra vires</em> the jurisdiction of the tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I
have observed a clear trend, in recent times, of parties seeking
to set aside adverse arbitral awards on the basis of alleged breaches
of natural justice. Many have failed. It is perhaps opportune for
me to state that an accusation against a tribunal for committing
a breach of natural justice is a serious matter. The tribunal is
not able to defend itself and the accusation can have an adverse
impact on the arbitrator’s reputation and standing in the arbitration
community. The courts take a serious view of such challenges and
that is why those which have succeeded are few and far between and
limited only to egregious cases where the error is “clear on the face
of the record” (see <em>TMM Division Maritima SA
de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR
972 (“<em>TMM Division</em>”) at [125]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Parties
have nonetheless been creative (though ultimately unsuccessful)
in attempting to expand the defined boundaries of the doctrine of
breach of natural justice. Some notable examples include an assertion
that the tribunal’s decision to close the arbitral proceedings and subsequent
refusal to reopen them upon request was a breach of the right to a
fair hearing (<em>ADG and another v ADI and another
matter</em> [2014] 3 SLR 481) (“<em>ADG v
ADI</em>”); that dilatoriness in the release of an award was evidence
of apparent bias (<em>PT Central Investindo v Franciscus
Wongso and others and another matter</em> [2014] 4 SLR 978
(“<em>PT Central Investindo</em>”)); and that
a tribunal’s refusal to admit an expert report tendered on the last
day of the hearing was a breach of the right to a fair hearing (<em>Triulzi Cesare SRL v Xinyi Group (Glass) Co Ltd</em> [2015]
1 SLR 114) (“<em>Triulzi</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
present case represents another novel attempt to set aside an arbitral
award. In brief, the plaintiff’s argument is two-fold. First, the plaintiff
argues that the Tribunal had breached its <em>duty</em> under
Rule 27.1 (“r 27.1”) of the 2007 Singapore International Arbitration
Centre Rules (“the 2007 SIAC Rules”) because it failed to declare
the arbitral proceedings closed before releasing its award. Second,
the plaintiff argues that there was inordinate delay in the release
of the award because the award was only issued 19 months after the
parties’ final closing submissions. On the strength of the preceding,
the plaintiff submits that the award should be set aside, <em>inter alia</em>, on the basis that there had
been a breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Two
general issues arise from these facts. The first is the proper construction
of r 27.1; the second is the applicable time limit, if any, for
the release of arbitral awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
plaintiff, Coal &amp; Oil Company LLC (“C&amp;O”), is a company registered
in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It is engaged in the business of trading
coal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
defendant, GHCL Limited (“GHCL”), is a company registered in the
Republic of India. It was, at the material time, a customer of the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The
facts are not in dispute and lie within a narrow compass. On 26 April
2007, the plaintiff signed an agreement to supply between 180,000 and
190,000 Metric Tons (“MT”) of coal to the defendant (“the Agreement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It
was agreed that the coal would be delivered in three to four shipments.
Clause 16 of the Agreement provided that any disputes would be submitted
to arbitration in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff separately contracted
with Noble Resources Pte Ltd (“Noble”) to obtain some of the coal
it required to fulfil the terms of its contract with the defendant
(“the Noble Contract”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Between
April 2007 and January 2008, the price of coal rose dramatically
and Noble attempted to re-negotiate the price of coal under the
Noble Contract. The plaintiff initially resisted this increase as
it would affect the profitability of its contract with the defendant
but Noble was insistent that the price be increased. This triggered
an exchange of correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant
during which the defendant was informed that the plaintiff would
not deliver the third shipment (consisting of 70,000 MT of coal)
unless a price increase was agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> By way of an addendum dated
17 March 2008, the defendant agreed to a price increase of US$18.50
per MT for the third shipment (“the Addendum”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The
third shipment was loaded and paid for on 25 April 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> However,
on 18 May 2008, the defendant demanded that the plaintiff repay
a sum of US$1,295,888 (the additional sum paid under the Addendum),
arguing that the Addendum was illegal as it had been procured through
coercion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
plaintiff refused to repay the demanded sum and, pursuant to clause
16 of the Agreement, the defendant submitted the dispute to arbitration
in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The parties agreed, from
the outset, that the arbitration would be governed by the 2007 SIAC
Rules.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> A sole arbitrator (“the Tribunal”)
was appointed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre
(“the SIAC”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
its Final Award dated 14 March 2014 (“the Award”), the Tribunal found
in favour of the defendant and held that the Addendum was vitiated by
duress and ought to be side aside. The Tribunal awarded the defendant the
sum of $1,295,888 with interest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The parties received the
Award on 17 March 2014, one year and seven months after they made
their final reply submissions (on 17 August 2012).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On
12 June 2014, the plaintiff filed Originating Summons No 538 of 2014
(“OS 538/2014”), applying under s 24 of the International Arbitration Act
(Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) to set aside the Award on the following
grounds:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the UNCITRAL
Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the Model
Law”) as set out in the First Schedule to the IAA in that the issuance
of the Award was in breach of the parties’ agreed procedure.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
under Art 34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model
Law in that the Award was in conflict with the public policy of
Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
under s 24(b) of the IAA in that there was a breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
plaintiff also prayed, in the alternative, for a declaration under Art 14(1)
of the Model Law that the Tribunal’s mandate had been terminated
prior to 14 March 2014 (the date of the issuance of the Award) by
reason of the Tribunal’s failure to act without undue delay in declaring the
proceedings closed and that, therefore, the Award should be set
aside for want of jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> As
the application to terminate the mandate of the arbitrator was filed
out of time, the plaintiff also sought an extension of time in aid
of that specific ground of the application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At
the hearing on 20 January 2015, Mr Peter Gabriel (“Mr Gabriel”), counsel
for the plaintiff, informed me that the plaintiff would not be proceeding
with the alternative prayer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> 
I should add that if the plaintiff had pursued the alternative prayer,
I would not have been minded to grant the extension of time. Order
69A r 2(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”)
stipulates that any application to decide on the termination of
the tribunal’s mandate must be made “within 30 days from the date
of receipt by the applicant… of the arbitral tribunal’s decision
or ruling.” Given that the plaintiff had received the Award on 17
March 2014, the application ought to have been filed by 16 April
2014. The plaintiff was thus 57 days late in filing the application
on 12 June 2014. No convincing reasons for the delay were put forward
apart from the need to “study the purported Final Award”, “seek
legal advice”, and instruct new solicitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> However, I note that
the plaintiff was represented by their previous solicitors, M/s
Rajah &amp; Tann LLP, at least until 2 May 2014, which is well <em>after</em> the deadline for the filing of the
application had passed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> While they were
represented by their previous solicitors, the plaintiff had ample
time to study the Award and seek their advice. Therefore, a delay
of 57 days – nearly twice the length of the time provided for in
O 69A r 2(3) of the ROC – is inexcusable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substantive issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With
that, it remains for me to consider the remaining three grounds set
out at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>.
As noted above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>,
all three grounds rest on the same two factual premises, each of
which the plaintiff asserts is a sufficient basis for invoking any
one of the three grounds for setting aside. The first factual premise
is the Tribunal’s purported failure to comply with r 27.1. The second
is the 19-month gap of time between the final submissions tendered by
the parties and the date of the release of the Award, a lapse of
time which the plaintiff terms an “inordinate delay”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It
is undisputed that the Tribunal only released the Award 19 months after
the parties tendered their final written submissions. However, parties disagreed
on whether the Tribunal had been in breach of r 27.1 so that is
the issue to which I shall now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Has there been a breach of r 27.1?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Rule 27.1
reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.1  Before
issuing any award, the Tribunal shall submit it in draft form to the
Registrar. Unless the Registrar extends time or the parties agree otherwise,
the <b>Tribunal shall submit the draft award to
the Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal
declares the proceedings closed</b>. The Registrar may suggest
modifications as to the form of the award and, without affecting
the Tribunal’s liberty of decision, may also draw its attention
to points of substance. No award shall be issued by the Tribunal until
it has been approved by the Registrar as to its form. [emphasis
added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr
Gabriel‘s argument may be expressed syllogistically. First, he submits
that r 27.1 <em>obliges</em> the Tribunal
to first declare the proceedings closed before issuing a draft award.
Second, he notes that it is common ground that the Tribunal did
not declare the proceedings closed before issuing the draft award.
In conclusion, he submits, the Tribunal had breached its duty by
issuing the draft award without first declaring the proceedings
closed and the Award must therefore be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It
is clear that, on the face of r 27.1, the 45-day period only begins
to run from the date on which the Tribunal declares the proceedings
closed. It is also not in dispute that the Tribunal did not declare
the proceedings closed. Therefore the key question is whether the
Tribunal is <em>obliged</em> or merely <em>empowered</em> to declare the closure of proceedings.
Mr Gabriel concedes that there is nothing on the face of r 27.1
which <em>expressly requires</em> the Tribunal
to declare the proceedings closed. However, he argues that such
an obligation may be inferred because the issuance of arbitral award always
takes place in two stages: first, the tribunal declares the proceedings closed;
second, the tribunal must submit the draft award to the Registrar
of the SIAC within 45 days of its declaration. Mr Gabriel submits
that because the “second step is a <em>mandatory
step</em> and is hinged upon the declaration of close of proceedings
by the Tribunal… the Tribunal as a first step <em>is required
to declare the closure of the arbitration proceeding[s]</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr
Joseph Lopez (“Mr Lopez”), counsel for the defendant, submits that
there is no express provision in the 2007 SIAC Rules (including
r 27.1) which imposes any requirement on the Tribunal to declare
the proceedings closed. In fact, he submits, the scheme of the 2007
SIAC Rules provides otherwise. In this connection, he relies on
r 21.5 of the 2007 SIAC Rules (“r 21.5”) which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <b>Tribunal may declare
the hearings closed</b> if it is satisfied that the parties have
no further evidence to produce or submissions to make. The Tribunal may
on its own motion or upon the application of a party but before
any award is made, reopen the hearings.” [emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Lopez submits that the
expression “hearings” in r 21.5 is synonymous with the expression
“proceedings” in r 27.1. Thus, he concludes, the 2007 SIAC Rules
specifically confers a <em>power</em> (through
r 21.5, which is expressed in discretionary terms) and not a <em>duty</em> on the Tribunal to declare the proceedings
closed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr
Lopez gives two reasons in support of this construction:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
Mr Lopez relies on the changes wrought by the passage of the 2010
Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules (“2010 SIAC Rules”).
Rule 28.1 of the 2010 SIAC Rules (the successor to r 21.5 of the
2007 SIAC Rules) provides that that the Tribunal “<em>shall</em>, after
consulting with the parties, declare the <em>proceedings</em> closed <em>if</em> it is satisfied that the parties have
no further relevant and material evidence to produce or submission
to make” [emphasis added]. Rule 28.2 of the 2010 SIAC Rules (the
successor to r 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules), remains largely unchanged
and provides that “the Tribunal shall submit the draft award to
the Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal
declares proceedings closed.” Mr Lopez makes the following observations:
first, the expression “close of hearings” in r 21.5 of the 2007
SIAC rules has been amended to read “close of proceedings” in r 28.1
of the 2010 SIAC Rules; second, there is no provision in the 2010
or 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules which provides for a declaration
of the closure of the hearings – there is only provision for a declaration
of the closure of the proceedings; third, the word “may” in r 21.5
was replaced with the word “shall” in r 28.1 of the 2010 SIAC Rules.
Mr Lopez infers from the foregoing that the expression “hearings”
in r 21.5 had always been intended to be read interchangeably with
the expression “proceedings” in r 27.1 and submits that the 2010
amendments were made, <em>ex abundanti cautela</em>, to
make this clear.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
Mr Lopez drew my attention to Article 3 of Schedule 1 of the 2007
SIAC Rules, which is entitled “Special Provisions for SIAC Domestic
Arbitration Rules”. Art 3(5) of Schedule 1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules
(“Art 3(5)”) provides that “a Tribunal’s [summary] award or order
shall be made in writing <em>within 21 days after
close of hearing</em> unless extended by the Registrar” [emphasis
added]. Mr Lopez notes that Art 3(5) imposes a time limit for the
release of the summary award with reference to the <em>close
of hearings</em> and submits that this demonstrates that,
insofar as time limits for the release of awards are concerned,
the expressions “close of hearings” and “close of proceedings” are
synonymous and are used interchangeably.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Does r 27.1 impose a power or
a duty to declare proceedings closed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Rule 27.1
has been incorporated into the parties’ contract and must be interpreted
purposively (see <em>NCC International AB v Land
Transport Authority Singapore</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 985 at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> (“<em>NCC International</em>”); <em>AQZ
v ARA</em> [2015] SGHC 49 at [132]) (“<em>AQZ
v ARA</em>”). Since we are considering the institutional rules
of an arbitral institution, this entails a consideration of the
drafting history of the rules, in a manner akin to an examination
of the legislative history of an Act of Parliament (see <em>NCC International</em> at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The drafting history of r 27.1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In
total, there have been five different editions of the SIAC Rules (excluding
the Domestic Arbitration Rules released in 2001 and 2002), all of which
contain provisions which govern the time limit for the release of arbitral
awards and for the declaration of the closure of hearings/proceedings.
These provisions exist in three different permutations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
first permutation exists in the 1991 and 1997 versions of the SIAC Rules
(hereinafter, “the 1991 SIAC Rules” and “the 1997 SIAC Rules” respectively).
Rule 21.6 of the 1991 SIAC Rules and r 22.6 of the 1997 SIAC Rules
are, save for minor differences in wording, identical.  Rule 21.6
of the 1991 SIAC Rules reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <b>Tribunal may declare
the hearings closed</b> if the parties have no further proof
to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions to make. <b>The Tribunal may on its own motion or upon application
of a party but before any award is made, reopen the hearings</b>.
[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Rule 27.1 of the 1991 SIAC
Rules and r 28.1 of the 1997 SIAC Rules deal with the time limits
for the rendering of awards. Both provisions are also, save for
minor differences in wording, identical. Rule 27.1 of the 1991 SIAC Rules
reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Tribunal shall make its award in writing <b>within forty-five (45) days from the date on which
the hearings are closed</b> and, unless all the parties agree otherwise,
shall state the reasons upon which its award is based. The award shall
state its date and shall be signed by the arbitrator or arbitrators. [emphasis
added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The
second permutation is found in the 2007 SIAC Rules. Rules 21.5 and
27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules are reproduced here for convenience:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.5  The
Tribunal may declare the hearings closed if it is satisfied that
the parties have no further evidence to produce or submissions to
make. The Tribunal may on its own motion or upon the application
of a party but before any award is made, reopen the hearings. [emphasis
in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.1  Before
issuing any award, the Tribunal shall submit it in draft form to the
Registrar. Unless the Registrar extends time or the parties agree otherwise,
the <b>Tribunal shall submit the draft award to
the Registrar within 45 days from the date on which the Tribunal
declares the proceedings closed</b>. The Registrar may suggest
modifications as to the form of the award and, without affecting
the Tribunal’s liberty of decision, may also draw its attention
to points of substance. No award shall be issued by the Tribunal until
it has been approved by the Registrar as to its form. [emphasis
added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
third permutation may be found in the 2010 SIAC Rules and the 2013
version of the SIAC Rules (“the 2013 SIAC Rules”). Rules 28.1 and 28.2
of the 2010 SIAC Rules are identical to rr 28.1 and 28.2 of the
2013 SIAC Rules. Rules 28.1 and 28.2 of the 2010 SIAC Rules read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.1  The
Tribunal shall, after consulting with the parties, declare the proceedings
closed if it is satisfied that the parties have no further relevant and
material evidence to produce or submission to make. The Tribunal
may, on its own motion or upon application of a party but before
any award is made, reopen the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28.2  Before issuing any award, the Tribunal
shall submit it in draft form to the Registrar. Unless the Registrar
extends time or the parties agree otherwise, the <b>Tribunal
shall submit the draft award to the Registrar within 45 days from
the date on which the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed</b>.
The Registrar may, as soon as practicable, suggest modifications
as to the form of the award and, without affecting the Tribunal's
liberty of decision, may also draw its attention to points of substance.
No award shall be issued by the Tribunal until it has been approved
by the Registrar as to its form.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When
the history of the SIAC Rules is examined, a clear trajectory may
be discerned: there has been a gradual shift towards the imposition
of stricter timelines for the release of arbitral awards through
a decrease in tribunal autonomy and a concomitant increase in the
supervisory role of the Registrar and the parties. Under the 1991
and 1997 of the SIAC Rules, the release of the award was entirely
within the control of the tribunal. This is because the 45-day period
begins to run <em>if and only if</em> the
tribunal elects to declare the closure of hearings which it may,
on its own motion or on the application of one of the parties, reopen.
Further, the 45-day time limit may be extended by the tribunal on
its own motion (see r 24.1(e) of the 1991 SIAC Rules and r 25(e)
of the 1997 SIAC Rules, which grant the tribunal the general power
to extend or abbreviate any time limits provided in the rules of
its own motion, subject only to the caveat that it must afford the
parties an opportunity to state their views). By contrast, under
the 2010 and the 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules, the reckoning
of time begins to run when the tribunal declares a closure of proceedings,
which it is <em>obliged</em> to do <em>if</em>, after consulting with the parties,
it is of the view that the parties have no further evidence or submissions
to present. This declaration triggers the start of a 45-day window
within which the tribunal has to render its draft award. This time
limit may not be unilaterally extended by the tribunal. This is
because, since the 2007 SIAC Rules, the general power of the tribunal
to extend time limits has been expressly qualified by the proviso that
this power does not cover extensions of time limits for the release
of the award (see r 24(d) of the 2007 SIAC Rules and r 24(c) of
the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules). Under the 2010 SIAC Rules, the 45-day
time limit may only be extended by the Registrar or by the agreement
of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Any
construction of the 2007 SIAC Rules must reflect its place in the historical
development of the SIAC Rules, bearing in mind the careful balance
the drafters wanted to strike between tribunal autonomy (in the conduct
of the arbitration) and institutional oversight (through the supervisory
role of the Registrar): see generally Sabiha Shiraz, “The New SIAC
Rules 2007” [2007] 4 Sinarb 2 at p 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The
2007 SIAC Rules is unique in that it is the only iteration of the rules
which specifically <em>empowers</em> the
tribunal to declare a closure of <em>hearings</em> but
imposes a timeline for the release of the award with reference to
a closure of <em>proceedings</em>. To elaborate:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
1991 and 1997 versions of the SIAC Rules give the tribunal a <em>power but not a duty</em> to declare <em>hearings</em> closed. Following a declaration
of the closure of <em>hearing</em>s, a tribunal
has an obligation to render a draft Award within 45 days. The 1991/1997
SIAC Rules did not contemplate a declaration of the closure of <em>proceedings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
2010 and 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules impose a <em>duty</em> on the
Tribunal to declare <em>proceedings</em> closed
if, after consulting with the parties, it is satisfied that they
have no further evidence or submissions to present. Following a
declaration of the closure of <em>proceedings</em>,
a tribunal has an obligation to render a draft Award within 45 days.
The 2010/2013 SIAC Rules do not refer to the closure of <em>hearings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The
key question is therefore whether the 2007 SIAC Rules, being silent
on the issue, ought to be construed as imposing a <em>duty</em> on
the tribunal to declare proceedings closed (as Mr Gabriel has suggested)
or whether it should be construed as conferring a mere power. I
am of the view that the latter construction is preferable for four
reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     First,
the former construction would not be consonant with the drafting
history of the rules. Under the 2010 and 2013 SIAC Rules, the tribunal’s
duty to issue a declaration of the closure of proceedings only arises
once it has (a) consulted the parties; and (b) <em>personally
formed a view</em> that the parties have no further evidence
to tender or submissions to make. However, there is nothing in the
2010 or 2013 versions of the SIAC Rules which suggest that the tribunal
has a duty to consult parties on this issue to begin with. Therefore,
under the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules, it is entirely possible that the
proceedings may never be declared closed. This situation would arise
if (a) there were no consultation between the tribunal and the parties
as to whether the latter has any further evidence to tender or submissions
to make; and/or (b) if the tribunal does not form the view (following
such consultation) that the parties have no further relevant material
evidence to produce or submissions to make. The plaintiff’s construction
of r 27.1, if accepted, would mean that the 2007 SIAC Rules are
even stricter than its successor since it would impose an <em>unqualified</em> obligation to issue a declaration
of closure without the duty to first consult with the parties and
the duty to, after such consultation, be subjectively satisfied
that parties do not have further evidence or submissions to present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
plaintiff’s construction is not only impractical (since the parties are
clearly the ones who are best placed to advise the tribunal if they
have further material to present), it would also give rise to difficulties.
It would be unsafe to impose a duty on tribunals to issue a declaration
of closure of the proceedings without a predicate duty of prior
consultation with the parties (which is present in the 2010/2013
SIAC Rules). Imposing an unqualified duty to issue a declaration
of closure might encourage hasty tribunals to close proceedings
prematurely, opening awards to collateral attacks on the basis that
the rules of natural justice have been violated. An aggrieved party
might be encouraged to apply to set aside an award on the basis
that proceedings had been closed prematurely, thereby denying him an
adequate opportunity to present his case. This concern is not new. Rule 21.6
of the 1991 SIAC Rules (the predecessor of r 21.5 of the 2007 SIAC
Rules) appears to have been derived from Art 29 of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules 1976, <em>UN General Assembly Resolution 31/98</em>,
(UN Doc. A/RES/31/98, 15 December 1976) (“<em>UNCITRAL
Rules 1976</em>”). Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976 reads,
“[t]he arbitral tribunal may inquire of the parties if they have
any further proof to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions
to make and, if there are none, it may declare the hearings closed.”
At its Ninth Session, the Committee of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (“the UNCITRAL Committee”) was fully cognisant
of the danger that aggrieved parties might apply to set awards aside
on the basis that they had been denied an opportunity to present
their case because of the premature closure of the hearings. That
was why the representatives in the UNCITRAL Committee drafted Art
29 carefully to require tribunals to consult the parties in the
arbitration <em>before</em> exercising its
power to declare hearings closed: see <em>Summary
Record of the 16<sup>th</sup> Meeting of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law, Ninth Session (</em>A/CN.9/9/C.2/SR.16,
26 April 1976) at paras 83 to 85.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Second,
the plaintiff’s construction is also not consonant with the <em>raison d'être</em> of r 27.1. In my view, the
declaration of closure functions as a case-management tool. As explained
by Mark Mangan, Lucy Reed and John Choong in their book, <em>A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules</em> (Oxford University
Press, 2014) (“<em>A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration
Rules</em>”), at para 12.11:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he closure of the proceedings [as provided
for in r 28.1 of the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules] prevents an endless stream
of submissions or new documents from the parties. It also signals
to the parties (and the Secretariat) that they can expect to receive
the award in relatively short order. <em>In practice,
tribunals will usually only declare the proceedings closed when
the drafting of the award is well advanced or is expected to be
completed within 45 days, as required</em> by Rule 28.2. [emphasis
added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It follows that the declaration
of closure of proceedings is essentially a tool for case-management.
It serves two main purposes. First, it benefits the tribunal by
preventing the drafting process from being derailed by last-minute
submissions from parties. Second, it serves as a signal to parties
that the arbitral process is coming to an end and that a final disposition
of their legal rights is forthcoming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
plaintiff’s argument, if accepted, would elevate a case-management
tool into a condition precedent for the release of the award. To
my mind, imposing a <em>duty</em> on the
tribunal to declare proceedings closed is inconsistent with the
case-management function of a declaration of closure. Tribunals
have wide powers of case management (see <em>Soh
Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
3 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Soh Beng Tee</em>”) at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>; <em>TMM Division</em> at [115]). This is particularly
so for parties who elect to arbitrate in Singapore under the SIAC
Rules, which grant tribunals wide and flexible case-management powers
(see <em>ADG v ADI</em> at [111]). To impose
a duty of declaration would effectively limit a tribunal’s freedom
of action, which is the very opposite of what case-management powers
are intended for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Third,
the plaintiff’s construction is not commercially sensible. The plaintiff
is unable to provide any satisfactory explanation <em>why</em> the declaration
of closure is normatively important enough to the arbitration process
that such a duty should be imposed. The plaintiff’s submission that the
declaration of closure is “a fundamental requirement as per the agreement
of the parties”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> is question-begging.
As the plaintiff acknowledges, r 27.1 is silent as to whether the
Tribunal has a <em>duty</em> or a mere <em>power</em> to issue a declaration of closure
of proceedings so the plaintiff bears the burden of proving why
the former construction is more commercially sensible and is to
be preferred. It is difficult to understand why the drafters of
the SIAC Rules, being mindful of the need to avoid impeding the
arbitration process with pointless formalities, would require arbitral
tribunals to first declare proceedings closed before issuing an award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It
is also telling that the plaintiff is unable to provide a definitive answer
on when the Tribunal’s obligation to issue a declaration of closure arose
in this case. In its written submissions, it identified five possible
dates when the Tribunal ought to have declared hearings closed:
(a) 17 August 2012 (the date the plaintiff filed its final reply
submissions); (b) 5 July 2013 (when the SIAC informed the parties
that the Tribunal was in the process of drafting the award); (c)
15 August 2013 (45 days before 30 September 2013, the first expected
completion date of the award); (d) 10 November 2013 (45 days before
25 December 2013, the revised expected completion date for the award);
and (e) 3 December 2013 (45 days before 17 January 2014, when the Registrar
was said to have received the draft of the Award).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> During the oral
hearings, Mr Gabriel could only offer the tentative response that
the declaration ought to have been made within a reasonable time.
When pressed, he eventually submitted that the Tribunal ought to
have declared the proceedings closed either on 3 December 2013 (45
days before 17 January 2014, when the draft award was received by
the SIAC) or 45 days <em>after</em> 17 January
2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In
my view, the plaintiff’s inconclusive and unsettled position on
this issue just reinforces my point that the central difficulty
with the plaintiff’s submission is that there just does not seem
to be any compelling reason <em>why</em> the
requirement of a declaration of closure is so critical. The plaintiff
is asserting the existence of an arid procedural requirement that
does not add anything substantive to the arbitration process. I
do not think the drafters of the 2007 SIAC Rules would have intended
such a result. This is usefully contrasted with the requirement
(also found in r 27.1) that any award must first be approved by
the Registrar before it can be released. That requirement serves
an integral function by allowing the Registrar to maintain the quality
of awards released under the auspices of the SIAC (see <em>A Guide to the SIAC Arbitration Rules</em> at
paras 12.12–12.19).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Fourth,
the former construction would render r 21.5 superfluous. Even assuming
that – in the specific context of rr 21.5 and 27.1 – “hearings” and
“proceedings” refer to different events (which, as I will elaborate
later at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>–<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>, is not the
case), the point is that “proceedings” generally encompass “hearings.”
Thus, if proceedings are closed, hearings, being a subset of proceedings,
must surely be closed as well. If a tribunal already has a <em>duty</em> to close proceedings under r 27.1
(thereby closing hearings in the process), r 21.5 would be rendered
otiose since tribunals would never have need to exercise its <em>power</em> to close hearings if they are already
duty bound to declare closure of proceedings. Mr Gabriel has not
provided any explanation as to why there would be a need for tribunals
to separately have the <em>power</em> to
close hearings in juxtaposition with a <em>duty</em> to
close proceedings. Hypothetically, one might suggest that “hearings”
refers only to an event for the making of oral submissions and the
taking of oral evidence. On this theory, a tribunal might wish,
in declaring hearings closed, to signal that it does not wish to
hear further oral arguments but is still open to receiving written
submissions. However, there is nothing in the 2007 SIAC Rules which
explicitly states that the expression “hearings” bears this restricted
meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Are hearings and proceedings
synonymous?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Having
decided that r 27.1 does not impose any duty on the Tribunal to
declare the closure of the proceedings, it is strictly not necessary
to consider Mr Lopez’s additional argument (which is premised on
r 21.5) as alluded to at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above.
However, given the parties’ submissions on this issue, I will go
on to make some observations on this subject though I should add
that acceptance of the argument would merely provide an additional
reason to conclude that r 27.1 confers a power and not a duty on tribunals
to declare the closure of proceedings. However, the converse is not
true in that should the argument not find favour with me, it does
not in itself establish that r 27.1 imposes a duty, and not a power,
on tribunals to declare the closure of the proceedings. It would
still not address the absence of any express provision in the 2007
SIAC Rules which imposes a duty on tribunal to declare the closure
of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For
the purposes of examining Mr Lopez’s argument, it is not essential
to find that the expressions “hearings” and “proceedings” are used synonymously <em>throughout</em> the 2007 SIAC Rules. Semantically
speaking, these two expressions can bear different meanings, particularly
where the context demands it. For example, r 21.3 of the 2007 SIAC
Rules reads, “[i]f any party to the <em>proceedings</em> fails
to appear at a <em>hearing</em> without showing sufficient
cause for such failure, the Tribunal may proceed with the arbitration
and may make the award based on the submissions and evidence before
it” [emphasis added]. In this context, the expression “proceedings”
seems to refer to the arbitration as a whole whereas “hearings”
refers only to a physical meeting in which oral evidence is taken and
oral submissions are made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Therefore,
context is key. The relevant inquiry is whether “hearings” <em>in r 21.5</em> is intended to have a different
meaning to “proceedings” <em>in r 27.1</em>. Such
an inquiry is best aided by examining the evolution of the relevant rules
through the different iterations of the SIAC Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It
is clear from the drafting history of rr 21.5 and 27.1 and their equivalents
(see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>–<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) that
the only version which does not use the same expression consistently
in both rules is the 2007 SIAC Rules. The 1991/1997 versions use
the same expression “hearings” in both rules while the 2010/2013
versions use the expression “proceedings”. In other words, the equivalent
of rr 21.5 and 27.1 in the 1991/1997 SIAC Rules refer to the same
event – the close of hearings; similarly, the equivalent of rr 21.5
and 27.1 in the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules refer to the same event – the
close of proceedings. The question is whether a distinction was
intended to be made between the expression “hearings” and “proceedings”
in rr 21.5 and 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules. No logical reasons have
been offered for any distinction and I think none exist (see also <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above). In
my view, purposively construed, the expressions “hearings” and “proceedings”
are, in the context of rr 21.5 and 27.1, synonymous. I also note
that, in the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules, the provision granting the Tribunal
the power to close proceedings (r 28.1, the successor to r 21.5
of the 2007 SIAC Rules) can now be found immediately before the
provision providing for the 45-day time limit for the release of
the award (r 28.2, the successor to r 27.1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules).
The consolidation of these two provisions in the same rule gives
me further reason to believe that it was always intended that both
provisions would refer to the same event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However,
with that being said, I do not think that Mr Lopez’s argument based
on Art 3(5) (see [22(b)] above) is convincing. Art 3(5) provides
that a summary award issued under Schedule 1 of the 2007 SIAC Rules
has to be submitted within 21 days of the “close of hearing”. Mr
Lopez submits that the fact that Art 3(5) provides that a tribunal
is to issue its award within 21 days of the close of hearing is
further evidence that the time limit for the issuance of an arbitral
awards is measured by reference to the close of hearings and not
proceedings. I do not agree. As Mr Gabriel pointed out, Art 3(5)
must be read in context. Article 3 governs the issuance of a summary
award in <em>domestic arbitrations</em> conducted
under the 2007 SIAC Rules, and not international arbitrations, which
is the case on our facts. It specifically provides for a special
hearing before the summary award is made. In this context, the reference
to “hearing” in Art 3(5) is a reference to the <em>oral
hearing in respect of an application for summary judgment</em>.
The purpose of the rule is to ensure that all such applications
for summary awards are swiftly disposed of (within 21 days of the
end of the special oral hearing). Article 3(5) cannot be used to
support a general point about time limits for the release of awards
in arbitrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Furthermore,
it is also clear from a review of all the editions of the SIAC Rules
– be it the 1991, 1997, 2007, 2010, or the 2013 versions – that none
of them impose an unqualified duty to declare the closure of hearings or
proceedings. The 2010/2013 SIAC Rules come the closest. But even
then, the obligation to declare a closure of the proceedings is
subject to two conditions precedent as explained at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above. If this
interpretation is right (and no other satisfactory reason has been
offered to persuade me otherwise), then it must support the defendant’s
construction that the Tribunal indeed has the <em>power</em> and
not a <em>duty</em> to declare the closure
of the <em>proceedings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In
conclusion, I hold that, on a true construction of r 27.1, the Tribunal
had the <em>power</em> and not a <em>duty</em> to declare the proceedings closed before
releasing the Award. Thus, the Tribunal was not in breach of r 27.1 in
this case when it elected – as it was entitled to under the wide
case-management powers it is afforded under the 2007 SIAC Rules
– not to issue to issue a declaration of closure of the proceedings
before releasing the Award</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The grounds for setting aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Given
my finding that there was no breach of r 27.1, I need only consider
whether the remaining factual premise – <em>viz</em>,
the interval of 19 months from the date of the parties’ final submissions
and the release of the Award – justifies the setting aside of the
Award on the three grounds invoked. However, for completeness, I
shall consider each of the three grounds with reference to both
the r 27.1 issue as well as the delay issue to demonstrate that
a breach of r 27.1 would not, in any event, have justified the setting
aside of the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Breach of agreed procedure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Article
34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law provides
that “an arbitral award <em>may</em> be set
aside” [emphasis added] if proof is furnished that the arbitral procedure
leading up to the issuance of the award was not in accordance with
the agreement of the parties. As a preliminary point, I observe
that the court retains a discretion <em>not</em> to
set an award aside even if one of the prescribed grounds for setting
aside has been made out (see <em>CRW Joint Operation
v PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR
305 (“<em>CRW (CA)</em>”) at [100]). This
reflects the plain language of Art 34(2) of the Model Law, which
states that a court “may” set an award aside if one of the stated
grounds is present, not that it has to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As
stated by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> of <em>Triulzi</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It cannot be the case that any breach
of an agreed arbitral procedure, even that of a technical provision
or minor formality, will invariably result in an award being set
aside. Most supervising courts inquire into the <em>materiality</em> of the
procedural requirements that were not complied with and the nature
of the departures from the parties’ agreed arbitral procedure …
[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I
note that different jurisdictions have taken different approaches
to this inquiry. Some have elected to cast this inquiry in terms
of the “seriousness of the breach” (see the observations of the
Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>Grand Pacific
Holdings Ltd v Pacific China Holdings Ltd (in liq) (No 1)</em> [2012]
4 HKLRD 1 at [105]). Other jurisdictions require proof of “substantial
prejudice”: see <em>Karaha Bodas Company, LLC v
Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara</em> 190
F Supp 2d 936 (SD Tex, 2001) where (in considering an application
to set aside an arbitral award under the New York Convention on
the basis that there had been a departure from the agreed arbitral
procedure) the court held, at 945, that the applicant “must show
that… the violation actually caused [that party] substantial prejudice”.
In the United Kingdom, s 68 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK)
(“UK Arbitration Act”) permits challenges to an award on the basis
that the tribunal had failed to conduct the proceedings in accordance
with the procedure agreed by the parties, provided this failure “has
caused or will cause <em>substantial injustice</em> to
the applicant” (s 68(2) UK Arbitration Act) [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     At
the end of the day, I agree with Belinda Ang J (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> of <em>Triulzi</em>) that this inquiry is necessarily
fact-specific. The key is that the procedural breach complained
cannot be of an arid, technical, or trifling nature; rather, it
must be a material breach of procedure serious enough that it justifies
the exercise of the court’s discretion to set aside the award. This
will often, though not invariably, require proof of actual prejudice
(<em>ie</em>, where the procedural breach
complained of could reasonably have said to have altered the final
outcome of the arbitral proceedings in some meaningful way): see <em>Triulzi</em> at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>; <em>AQZ v
ARA</em> at [136].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In
my view, a failure to issue a declaration of the closure of proceedings
would not satisfy the test. The plaintiff’s complaint is precisely the
sort of arid procedural objection that would not occasion the setting aside
of an award. It is important to note that the plaintiff is <em>not</em> arguing that proceedings ought to
have been declared closed at any particular point in time. Rather,
its submission is simply that the tribunal ought to have declared
proceedings closed before releasing a draft award (whenever that might
have been) and that a failure to do so “cannot be remedied” by the court.
In short, the plaintiff asserts that it is an incurable defect.
As I have noted above at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>, my difficulty
with this submission is that the plaintiff has not shown <em>why</em> the event of a declaration of closure
is of such critical importance such that non-compliance justifies
the setting aside of the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In
its submissions, the plaintiff relies on the decision of this court
in <em>Ting Kang Chung John v Teo Hee Lai Building
Constructions Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 625 (“<em>John
Ting</em>”). <em>John Ting</em> concerned
an arbitration carried out under the Singapore Institute of Architects
Arbitration Rules 1999 (“SIA Arbitration Rules”). Under Art 14.1
of the SIA Arbitration Rules, an award has to be released within
60 days of the “close of hearing”. However, the award was only released
on 15 April 2005 – one year and four months after the hearings had
closed. The defendant in <em>John Ting</em> applied
to set the award aside on the basis that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction
to issue the award while the arbitrator applied for a <em>post hoc</em> extension of time to render the
award under s 15 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). Quentin Loh JC
(as he then was) held, at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>,
that the arbitrator’s failure to adhere to the agreed time limit
meant that the award was issued without jurisdiction and was therefore
void and of no effect. The plaintiff in the instant case argues,
by analogy with <em>John Ting</em>, that
the failure of the Tribunal to first declare the proceedings closed
meant that the subsequent issuance of the Award was made without
jurisdiction and should therefore be declared void and set aside.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     However,
I do not think that <em>John Ting</em> assists
the plaintiff. The true <em>ratio</em> of <em>John Ting</em> is that the mandate of an arbitrator
expires after the time limit for the release of an award has expired.
Thus, any award issued after that is issued without jurisdiction.
This is made clear by the following extract from <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> of <em>John Ting</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <b>Arbitrator’s error
in overlooking a time limit within which to issue his award was
a very serious error</b>… Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter
with Nigel Blackaby and Constantine Partasides <em>Law
and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2004) warns at para 8-66:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A limit may be imposed as to the time within
which the arbitral tribunal must make its award. <b><em>When
this limit is reached, the authority or mandate of the arbitral
tribunal is at an end </em></b><b>and it no
longer has jurisdiction to make a valid award…</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I am of the view that the statement in <em>Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration</em>,
quoted above, is the correct analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold italics;
emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The
holding in <em>John Ting</em> is confined
only to breaches of agreed time limits for the issuance of the award
because such breaches have critical implications on the <em>mandate</em> of the tribunal. <em>John
Ting</em> does not stand for the general proposition that
the failure to comply with <em>any</em> procedural requirement <em>ipso facto</em> means that an award is issued
without jurisdiction and, without more, should be set aside. I should
also point out that the defendant in <em>John Ting</em> actually
wrote to the tribunal on 7 April 2004 (long before the award was
released) expressing the view that the time limit for the making
of the award had already expired. Notwithstanding this letter, the
arbitrator in <em>John Ting</em> did not
reply and only wrote to the parties one year later, on 15 April
2005, stating that the award was ready for collection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As
regards the delay issue, the 2007 SIAC Rules do not provide for any
time limits for the release of arbitral awards apart from that contained in
r 27.1 and Art 3(5) of Schedule 1 (which only applies to domestic arbitrations).
As noted at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above,
the 45-day time limit provided under r 27.1 does not begin to run
until the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed, which it did
not do in this case. Given this, the assertion that the Award was
rendered out of time (and therefore in breach of the parties’ agreed
procedure) simply cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     If
one looks at the institutional rules of other arbitral institutions,
it is clear that time limits, where they exist, are expressed in
very clear terms. To take two examples, Art 24(1) of the International
Chamber of Commerce Arbitration Rules 1998 (“1998 ICC Rules”) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <b>time limit within
which the Arbitral Tribunal must render its final Award is six months.
Such time limit shall start to run from the date of the last signature
by the Arbitral Tribunal or by the parties of the Terms of Reference</b> or,
in the case of application of Article 18(3), the date of the notification
to the Arbitral Tribunal by the Secretariat of the approval of the Terms
of Reference by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Rule 46 of the International
Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules 2006 (“2006
ICSID Rules”) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The award (including
any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed
within 120 days after closure of the proceeding.</b> The
Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if
it would otherwise be unable to draw up the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It
also bears mention that, when the 2007 SIAC Rules were issued, only
the rules of three major arbitral institutions provided for mandatory time
limits for the release of awards: the 1998 ICC Rules, the 2006 ICSID Rules,
and the London Maritime Arbitrators Association Terms 2006 (“2006
LMAA Rules”). This was in keeping with the prevailing wisdom at that
time that it was preferable not to prescribe a time limit for the
release of an award for it merely gives intransigent parties an
opportunity to frustrate the arbitration through the use of delaying
tactics until compliance with the time limit becomes impossible
(see Alan Redfern, Martin Hunter, Nigel Blackaby and Constantine
Partasides, <em>Law and Practice of International Commercial
Arbitration</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2004) at para
8-68)). In fact, as recently as in 2012, Professor Gary B. Born
was able to comment that most institutional rules do not contain
time limits for the release of arbitral awards and that those which
do, such as the 1998 ICC Rules and the 2006 LMAA Rules, formed the
exception rather than the rule (see Gary B. Born, <em>International
Arbitration: Law and Practice</em> (Kluwer Law International,
2012) at p 292).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Since
2012, however, many arbitral institutions have updated their rules
and, in the latest round of updates, more institutions have introduced time
limits for the release of awards where none existed previously.
Some notable examples include the American Arbitration Association
– International Commercial Dispute Resolution Arbitration Rules
2014, which provides that an award is to be released no later than
60 days from the closing of the hearing and the Japan Commercial
Arbitration Association Rules 2014, which provides that an award
shall be made within three months of the appointment of the arbitrator.
This is a relatively recent phenomenon. However, what is clear is
that in each of the arbitral institutions where time limit is imposed,
such time limits are expressly prescribed by its arbitral rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In
summary, the issuance of the Award is not tainted by the breach
of any procedure agreed upon by the parties under the 2007 SIAC
Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Public policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Article
34(2)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the Model Law provides
that an award may be set aside if it is in conflict with public
policy. In <em>PT Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero)
v Dexia Bank SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<em>PT
Asuransi</em>”) at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>,
the Court of Appeal made it clear that it is only in exceptional
cases where the “upholding of an arbitral award would <em>‘shock the conscience</em>’ …, or is ‘<em>clearly injurious to the public good’</em> or
… ‘<em>wholly offensive</em> to the ordinary reasonable
and fully informed member of the public’ …, or where it <em>violates the forum’s most basic notion of morality
and justice</em>” [emphasis added] that it would be set aside
on the grounds of public policy. However, despite the very high
threshold that has been set, public policy, together with the rules of
natural justice, still appear to be the last refuge of the desperate,
as far as applications to set aside arbitral awards are concerned.
This case is no exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The
plaintiff argues that “an act of the arbitral Tribunal which is contrary
to the agreement of the parties [<em>ie</em>,
r 27.1] is against the public policy of Singapore… [and] must ‘shock
the conscience’ or is ‘clearly injurious to the public good’ or
[is] ‘wholly offensive to the ordinary reasonable and fully informed
member of the public’ or ‘violates the forum’s most basic notion
of morality and justice.’”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> To put it
mildly, there is more than a bit of hyperbole in that statement.
In essence, the plaintiff’s submission is that all breaches of agreed
procedure are, <em>ipso facto</em>, contrary
to public policy. This argument is deeply flawed because it completely
ignores what <em>public policy</em> is intended
to capture: matters of <em>general</em> –
rather than particular – interest. The procedural breach complained
of is one that governs only the conduct of the arbitration <em>inter se</em> and does not have wider public
ramifications. I do not see how this is an issue which engages the
interests of the wider community or one which rises to the level
of gravity that the notion of “public policy” contemplates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
plaintiff also argues that “Singapore’s public policy demands that any
arbitration and its award are presented in a fair and expeditious manner”
and that the delay of 19 months in this case constitutes a violation of
public policy. With respect, the plaintiff’s argument is misconceived.
It trades on a conflation of the concept of <em>public
interest</em> with that of <em>public policy</em>.
The public interest is the wider concept. It embraces everything
that is conducive to the public good ranging from the comparatively
minor (clean streets) to the vital (a robust criminal justice system).
An innumerable number of things could be described as not being
in the public interest. However, the concept of “public policy”
in the context of the setting aside of an arbitral award, as noted
at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above,
is much narrower. Violations of “public policy” only encompass those
acts which are so egregious that elementary notions of morality
have been transgressed. While delay in the release of an arbitral
award might not necessarily be in the public interest, it cannot,
in itself without more, constitute a violation of public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong &amp;
Co Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 510 (“<em>Hong
Huat</em>”), the court had to consider whether an arbitral
award that was released more than ten years after the hearings had concluded
should be set aside. The Court of Appeal held that the delay, while
“grossly inordinate” and apt to “undermine faith in arbitration”,
was not, <em>per se</em>, a sufficient basis
for setting aside an award which had already been rendered (see <em>Hong Huat</em> at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>). The Court of Appeal observed
that the aggrieved party ought to have taken action – prior to the
issuance of the award – to remove the arbitrator pursuant to s 18
of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed). Having elected not
to do anything, it had to live by its decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     If
a ten year gap between the end of the hearings and the release of
the award was not a sufficient basis for setting aside an award
then, <em>a fortiori</em>, a 19-month delay
cannot be a sufficient basis for setting aside the award. If the
delay were truly intolerable, the plaintiff ought to have applied
under Art 14 of the Model Law for the mandate of the arbitrator
to be terminated <em>before</em> the Award
was released. However, it did not do so. It is only making the argument
now because the Award that was issued was adverse to the plaintiff
and not because of any delay. As bluntly observed by the court in <em>Hong Huat</em> at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>, an application at this late
stage “smacks of the [plaintiffs]… saying, set it aside because
it is not in our favour.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In <em>Soh Beng Tee</em>, the Court of Appeal held
at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> that
a party seeking to set aside an arbitral award as having contravened
the rules of natural justice has to show the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">which
rule of natural justice was breached;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">how it was breached;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in what way the breach was connected
to the making of the award; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">how the breach prejudiced its rights.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As
noted in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>, the rules
of natural justice are encapsulated in the two Latin maxims <em>audi alteram partem</em> and <em>nemo
judex in causa sua</em>. The former guarantees the right to
be heard while the latter provides that adjudicators must be unbiased
and disinterested. The plaintiff argues that “[t]he failure to declare
the closure of the arbitral proceeding [sic] coupled with the inordinate
delay in submitting the draft Final Award to the SIAC are obvious
procedural irregularities. As a result, the arbitration proceeding
was unnecessarily delayed and prolonged.” During the oral hearing
before me, Mr Gabriel cited the decision of the Court of Appeal
in <em>LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San
Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 125
(“<em>LW Infrastructure</em>”) and argued
that the Tribunal ought to have invited parties to submit on its
failure to comply with r 27.1 before issuing the award. Mr Gabriel
submitted that the Tribunal’s failure to invite submissions to address
the r 27.1 issue was tantamount to a denial of the plaintiff’s right
to be heard.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I
have difficulty following Mr Gabriel’s argument. The gist of his submission
is that the plaintiff had not been given the chance – <em>before</em> the award was issued – to submit
that the award should not be issued. However, the problem with this
submission is that before the Award was released, there could not,
by definition, have been any breach of r 27.1. Furthermore, the
Tribunal had no reason to believe, at the time it issued the Award,
that there was anything procedurally improper over which it ought
to have invited submissions. The plaintiff seems to be suggesting
that every tribunal should always, prior to releasing an award,
invite submissions on why the award should not be released. This
suggested practice – of inviting prophylactic submissions to forestall
criticisms of a breach of natural justice – is seriously misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The
case of <em>LW Infrastructure</em> does not
assist the plaintiff. <em>LW Infrastructure</em> concerned
a domestic arbitration over a dispute arising from a construction
contract. The Arbitrator, having found for the defendant, awarded
post-award interest on the judgment sum. The defendant then wrote
to the tribunal to seek a supplemental award for pre-award interest
as well. This request was made pursuant to s 43(4) of the Arbitration
Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“s 43(4)”) which states that “a party may,
within 30 days of receipt of the award and <em>upon
notice to the other party</em>, request the arbitral tribunal
to make an additional award as to claims presented during the arbitration
proceedings but omitted from the award” [emphasis added]. The tribunal
did so three days later by issuing a supplemental award ordering
that a further sum of S$274,114.61 (representing pre-award interest)
be paid. The plaintiff protested immediately and applied to set
aside the award on the basis that there had been a breach of natural
justice since it had not been given an opportunity to be heard on
the applicability of s 43(4). The Court of Appeal, in accepting
this argument and setting aside the award, held that the phrase “upon
notice to the other party” in s 43(4) encompassed within it the requirement
that the opposing party be afforded an opportunity to tender submissions
on whether a supplemental award should be rendered under s 43(4).
The tribunal’s failure to invite submissions on this issue constituted a
breach of the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As
is clear, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>LW
Infrastructure</em> turned on the particular wording of s 43(4).
In that case, it was clear that the plaintiff had a right to be
heard before a supplemental award (which increased the appellant’s
liability) could be issued. However, the plaintiff does not – under
the 2007 SIAC Rules – have a corresponding right to be heard before
the Tribunal makes a decision on whether it ought to declare the
proceedings closed before releasing the Award. As I have pointed
out at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above,
no version of the SIAC Rules imposes a duty on the tribunal to consult
the parties on whether proceedings should be closed. The closest
– the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules – only provides that <em>if</em> a
tribunal wants to declare the proceedings closed it must first consult
the parties on whether they have any evidence to tender or submissions
to make. However, the 2010/2013 SIAC Rules do not impose a duty
of consultation if the tribunal does not intend to declare the proceedings
closed. In the circumstances, I hold that the plaintiff has not
succeeded in showing a breach of natural justice so its application
under s 24(b) fails <em>in limine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Furthermore,
I am not convinced that the plaintiff has successfully shown that
he has been prejudiced. In <em>LW Infrastructure</em> at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>, the Court of
Appeal held that, where a court wants to consider whether prejudice
has arisen from a denial of the right to a fair hearing,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he real inquiry is whether
the breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential
or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied
the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed
to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations.
Put another way, the issue is whether the material <em>could
reasonably</em> have made a difference to the arbitrator;
rather than whether it <em>would necessarily</em> have done
so. [emphasis in original] </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The key here is that the
prejudice shown must relate to the <em>outcome
of the present arbitration</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In
the instant case, the plaintiff asserts three heads of prejudice:
first, that its intended arbitration against Noble (which it had
yet to initiate, pending the release of the Award) might be met
with the defence of prescription/laches; second, that, due to the
delay, it would have difficulty locating witnesses for the arbitration
against Noble; and third, that it was made liable to pay a large
sum in interest as a result of the delay in the release of the Award.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The first two
reasons have nothing to do with the outcome of the <em>present</em> arbitration.
In any case, there is no reason why the plaintiff need have waited
until the conclusion of this arbitration before taking action against
Noble since any contemplated action Noble would involve different
parties and different contracts. Any prejudice suffered by the plaintiff
as a result of its own decision (which has not been proved) is not
causally connected with this arbitration. The final reason – the
payment of the additional interest – is a <em>consequence</em> of
the outcome of the arbitration rather than a factor which would
have affected its outcome. Furthermore, as pointed out by the court
in <em>Hong Huat</em> at <a href="#p1_59">[59]</a>, for as long as
the Award had not been rendered, the plaintiffs would have had use
of the money and could have invested it profitably. Thus, the plaintiff
cannot assert that it had been prejudiced by the imposition of interest
for the period of time during which the Award was outstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The
plaintiff’s remaining argument is grounded on the assertion that the
19-month delay in the issuance of the Award is a procedural irregularity that
amounts to a breach of natural justice. The plaintiff has not identified which
particular rule of natural justice has been infringed in this case
and I do not see how the rules of natural justice have been breached
here. First, I do not see how the delay could have impaired the
plaintiff’s right to a fair hearing. The plaintiff calculates the
delay in terms of the lapse of time between the date the parties’
filed their final submissions (in August 2012) and the date of the
release of the Award (in March 2014). Given that the Award was prepared
on the basis of the submissions of the parties – all of which had
already been tendered by August 2012 – there is no possibility that
the plaintiff had been prejudiced in the preparation of its case.
It is not the case that the plaintiff had applied for, but had been
refused leave, to adduce additional evidence after August 2012.
Second, I do not see how dilatoriness on the part of the Tribunal
can be evidence of bias. As noted by this court in <em>PT
Central Investindo</em> at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>, delay in the release of an
award affects both parties equally. Thus, it is difficult to envision
how an inference of bias can be drawn against a tribunal on the
basis of dilatoriness in the release of an award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In
short, I find that there was no rule of natural justice was breached. Further,
I am not convinced that the plaintiff has successfully shown the requisite
prejudice required to justify the setting aside of the Award on
the basis of a breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I
find that the issuance of the Award was in accordance with the parties’
agreement and that there is no basis under either public policy
or the rules of natural justice for the Award to be set aside. In
the premises, I dismiss the plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Taking
into account the novelty of the issues before me and the arguments
and authorities submitted by both counsel, I award the defendant
costs fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements. This award of costs
is also consistent with the parties’ submissions on costs. It leaves
me to thank both counsel for their able assistance in the presentation
of their respective cases.</p>
