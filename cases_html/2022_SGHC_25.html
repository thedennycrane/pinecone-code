By these contracts, the parties also agreed that the Defendants would lease the Units back from the Plaintiff for an initial period of three years. Although, as I will set out, the same documents evidence both the sale and leaseback together, I will refer to them separately as the “Sales” and “Leaseback Agreements”, and where necessary, collectively as the “Contracts”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Plaintiff did not enter into the Contracts for residential purposes, but as an investor. For context, the Defendants operate a business in the Philippines which provides condominium units to travellers for short-term accommodation; they describe this business using the portmanteau, “condotel”. Around 2016, it appears that they were looking to expand. They thus sought out investors – such as the Plaintiff eventually came to be – to purchase such condominium units, and lease them back at a rate which amounted, approximately, to a 6–7% annual return on the principal purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff found this rate of interest attractive and, as already stated, she became an investor, putting in almost S$1.5m to purchase the five Units. Beyond the hook of the interest rate, however, the Plaintiff avers that the Defendants also agreed to repurchase the Units at the end of the three-year leaseback period, for a sum no less than the principal purchase price she paid (the “Alleged Buyback Term”). Put simply, the Plaintiff is saying that the Defendants promised capital protection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, all investments, even those that purport to protect one’s principal investment, come with risks. Here, the risk was failure of performance on the part of her counterparties. On the Plaintiff’s account, after she completed payment for the Units in August 2018 pursuant to the Sales, the Defendants failed to transfer title to her. Further, from September 2019, they also fell behind on the rental payments. These failings culminated in October 2019, when the Plaintiff discovered that the Defendants’ condotel business was in bad financial shape, and more jarringly, that they had taken out multiple loans secured by mortgages over the Units for which she had paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 An attempt at resolution was made in November 2019, but that was not successful. Therefore, the Plaintiff terminated the Contracts in December 2019, and by March 2020, her cause papers had been served on the Defendants. She advances two alternative causes of action. The first is for the Defendants’ breach of the Contracts. That is, their failure to transfer title to the Units in accordance with the Sales;

</div> That in respect of the claim for breach of contract, however, is more particular. The Defendants advance two positive defences. First, that the Plaintiff did not make full payment of the purchase price for the Units, and therefore, she was not entitled to receive  title.

</div> Second, even if the Plaintiff is found to have had made full payment, she dragged her feet and ultimately never gave them instructions as to whom title should be transferred. It therefore was not the case that the Defendants failed to transfer title in breach of contract, but rather, that her own inaction prevented them from executing a transfer.

During one of these meetings, Mr Lim avers, the First Defendant informed him about the bullish demand for short-term accommodation in the Philippines. Specifically, that he had been operating the Business, and was looking for investors to buy and lease back condominium units so that the Business could expand. Mr Lim shared this opportunity with the Plaintiff, though they were both sceptical.

Essentially, she said that investors would purchase properties in the Philippines, and thus incur the upfront principal purchase price. Thereafter, they would lease the units back to the Defendants for a sum which would amount, approximately, to a 6–7% annual return on that price.

As can be seen from [18] above, the “Receipts” for the Venice Luxury Residences units acknowledge the receipt of 10% of the “all-in purchase price”, and state that the balance 90% is to be paid in two tranches in <span class="font-italic">Singapore dollars</span>.

For now, I return to the last (alleged) term of the Contracts, the buyback.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 By the Alleged Buyback Term, the Plaintiff is effectively saying that the Defendants agreed not only to provide her a comfortable 6–7% annual return, but also to protect her principal investment. This alleged aspect of the Contracts was not recorded in writing, and it is rigorously disputed by the Defendants. Specifically, they submit that such a significant term would have been included in the written evidence of the Contracts (see [18] above),

</div> and that the Plaintiff lacks evidence to prove that the term was agreed upon orally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The starting point for this issue is, naturally, the Plaintiff’s burden of proof. In this regard, I begin by pointing to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon </span>[2012] 4 SLR 1206, where the importance of documentary evidence in proving an oral agreement was firmly emphasised:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41 … [T]he first port of call for any court in determining the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of an <span class="font-italic">alleged contract</span> <span class="font-italic">and/or its terms</span> would be the relevant<span class="font-italic"> documentary </span>evidence. Where (as in the present case) the issue is whether or not a binding contract <span class="font-italic">exists</span> between the parties, a contemporaneous written record of the evidence is obviously more reliable than a witness’s oral testimony given well after the fact, recollecting what has transpired. Such evidence may be coloured by the onset of subsequent events and the very factual dispute between the parties. … Much would depend on the precise factual matrix before the court. However, it bears reiterating that the court would always look first to the most reliable and objective evidence as to whether or not a binding contract was entered into between the parties and such evidence would tend to be <span class="font-italic">documentary</span> in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With this in mind, I turn to the pieces of evidence on which the Plaintiff relies to establish that the Alleged Buyback Term formed part of the Contracts.

</div> Although I appreciate the utility of this type of negative proof in some cases, it does not assist me here. The Plaintiff is asking that I find an oral contract <span class="font-italic">which includes the Alleged Buyback </span><span class="font-italic">Term</span>. This requires that I identify a statement by which the Defendants can be said to have been offering to enter, not only to the Sale and the Leaseback Agreement, <span class="font-italic">but also</span>, the Alleged Buyback Term.

The question is whether they had raised it as a possibility to be discussed, or whether they had <span class="font-italic">guaranteed</span> such repurchase.

The WeChat exchange between Mr Lim and the First Defendant is equivocal, and I do not think it <span class="font-italic">only</span> has one explanation. The actual text of the First Defendant’s message is significant in this regard. Mr Lim first queried whether there had been any appreciation in the value of the Units. The First Defendant then responded: “the property prices remain stable and some are even weakening. The company plans to go public before the end of next year. By then, it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> buy back the previously sold properties. If you plan to divest, you can consider selling them back to us then” [emphasis added].

</div> The link the First Defendant draws between “the company” (presumably MaxStays) going public, and the buyback, suggests that he did not understand it to be an obligation. This is consistent with the position the Defendants take in this suit,

</div>
</div> and could reasonably account for the mention of a “buyback” during the parties’ meeting on 29 November 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Next, the inference which the Plaintiff seeks to draw in respect of the First Defendant’s response set out at [26(d)] does not account for another real plausibility. Apart from the Alleged Buyback Term, the Leaseback Agreements were also potential sources of financial stress if the Business was performing poorly. A 6–7% annual return on a principal sum of around S$1.5m is not a trifling sum. It amounts to around S$90,000 annually, which in turn means that the Defendants needed at least to make this amount of <span class="font-italic">profit</span> using the Units in their condotel Business, just to stay in the black. Offering to sell the Units to buyers who would not be party to leaseback agreements would, in my view, also have been an alleviation of the Defendants’ financial difficulties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Lastly, I am not convinced that the Plaintiff’s assertion set out at [26(e)] carries much weight. I accept that, without a buyback agreement, the Contracts entailed greater risk, which was likely exacerbated by the fact that the Plaintiff had no familiarity with the Philippine real property market. However, without any evidence relating to how she <span class="font-italic">actually</span> invests, there is little I can make of her claim that she would not have undertaken such risk. Investors’ appetite for risk varies with their experience, and her <span class="font-italic">present</span> statement may not reflect how she viewed the opportunity at the material time. Indeed, as stated at [14] above, when the Second Defendant first described to the Plaintiff how the Business operated, and the returns she could expect to receive should she choose to invest, it does not appear that anything was said about a buyback or capital protection. Yet, this was sufficient to attract the Plaintiff’s interest in the opportunity, such that she attended the meeting on 29 November 2016. This suggests that capital protection might not have been the “hook”, so to speak. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In any event, beyond the foregoing evidential issues, the Plaintiff – on her pleaded case – faces another, greater difficulty in proving that the Contracts included the Alleged Buyback Term. Even if I accept her characterisation of the evidence in its entirety, the most that this would show is that the Defendants, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on 29 November 2016</span>, made the Buyback Representation and thus guaranteed that the Plaintiff’s capital would be protected. The Plaintiff does not aver that the Defendants repeated this representation before she orally agreed to enter the Contracts on 30 May 2017. She simply asserts, without particularity, that she relied on the representations made on 29 November 2016, in deciding to enter the Contracts. The substantial time gap already calls into question how far she could have been relying on those representations. However, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> we put this aside, her assertion is still difficult to accept for one key reason.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It is the Plaintiff’s case that, after she orally accepted the Contracts, the Defendants immediately pulled out written documents for her to sign (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, five versions of that set out at [18] above). As I have shown, these documents did not contain the Alleged Buyback Term. If this term was so crucial to her entry into the Contracts, one expects that – after seeing that the written documents did <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> contain</span> such a term – the Plaintiff would at least have queried whether it remained on the table. She did not do so, and this leads me to the conclusion that the Buyback Representation was not operating on her mind <span class="font-italic">because</span> it had not been guaranteed in such terms. It could have been raised as a possibility (see [30] above), but the Plaintiff’s inaction in the face of the documents she was being asked to sign makes it difficult to conclude that anything more certain had been promised. Indeed, the Plaintiff had only known the Defendants for a few <span class="font-italic">months</span> at this point in time, and they would have been dealing at relative arms-length. Given the amount of money involved, it is curious that she – a seasoned businesswoman – required so little documentation of them (also cross-reference [180] below in respect of the Plaintiff’s misrepresentation claim). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I therefore find that the Plaintiff has not proven the Alleged Buyback Term. I address the performance of her payment obligations next.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Performance of the Sales</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff’s payment of the purchase price</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It will be recalled from [16] above, that the parties entered into the Contracts on 30 May 2017. It will also be seen from [18] and [20] that, in respect of the Venice Luxury Residences units, the Plaintiff was to make payment to the Defendant in two tranches, on 8 and 20 June 2017.

</div> Before I go on to examine the evidence, however, it is important to note that the figures in the parties’ pleadings and submissions are not entirely consistent and have minor deviations within a few dollars. There are four notable inconsistencies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, the parties pleaded that the total purchase price of the Units was S$1,520,719.97. However, the figure derived from the writing which evidences the Contracts shows that the sum should have been S$1,520,717 (being the sum of S$290,850, S$300,241 (for the two Venice Luxury Residences units), S$316,588, S$296,748, and S$316,290 (for the three Fort Victoria units)).

</div> and on the Plaintiff’s case, Mr Renz was to be paid for his services in this regard. The First Defendant was thus acting as an intermediary between the Plaintiff and Mr Renz.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is in this context that the Plaintiff says the First Defendant sent the message on 20 September 2017 that mentions the S$1 to ₱35 exchange rate. Having considered the evidence, I accept her explanation. There are two points that support this. The first is the timing of the message. As far as payment of the purchase price for the Units are concerned, September and October 2017 are on no man’s land. Full payment for the Venice Luxury Residences units and the first tranche of payment for the Fort Victoria units had been made in June 2017. The second tranche of the payment for the latter was not due until either July or August 2018 (see [38]–[39]). The Defendants offer no explanation as to why the parties might have been discussing this next tranche of payment some ten months in advance, and this substantially weakens their claim that the message is evidence of an oral agreement on exchange rate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The second point in support of my finding are the subsequent messages exchanged between the Plaintiff and the First Defendant. Five days after the 20 September 2017 message, the First Defendant sent the Plaintiff his Philippine bank account details.

</div> These responses suggest to me that the earlier messages pertaining to payment were in fact connected to sums due to Mr Renz; and the fact that the parties’ exchanges coincide closely with the incorporation of LK (Philippines) on 5 October 2017 further solidifies this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I therefore find that the parties did not have an oral agreement to apply a fixed S$1 is to ₱35 exchange rate on the ₱16,093,035.80 payment due for the three Fort Victoria units.

</div> Indeed, as stated, on the face of the documents, the Plaintiff seems obliged to pay S$1,520,717 (see [42] above); yet, the Plaintiff accepts that she only paid S$1,468,895.69. Thus, there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> shortfall. That said, I do not think that this detracts from my finding above that she completed full payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As can be seen from [21], although the total purchase price for each Fort Victoria unit is expressed in Singapore dollars, the last tranche of the payment obligation is reflected as a sum in Pesos owing <span class="font-italic">directly to the developer</span>. From this, we can glean that, what ultimately matters – insofar as completing the sale of the Units is concerned – is that the developer received the ₱16,093,035.80 it was owed. The <span class="font-italic">Philippine</span> developer would have had no concern or use for Singapore dollars, and the Plaintiff, conversely, would have had no reason to pay the Defendants a larger sum in Singapore dollars when it could have paid the developers directly in Pesos. Indeed, when cross-examined on whether the Plaintiff could simply have paid the developers directly using the prevailing exchange rate to get around the alleged fixed exchange rate agreement, the First Defendant agreed that she could.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Therefore, the fact that the Plaintiff made the final tranche of payment in Singapore dollars, not Pesos, does not suggest that she failed to make full payment of the purchase price. Contrariwise, her act was in compliance with the First Defendant’s instructions on 9 July 2018 (see [38] above), where he took on the role of intermediating payment. Accordingly, upon his receipt of the S$407,979.55, one can expect that he would have converted this sum to Pesos to make immediate payment to the developer. This expectation is particularly fair given that, on the First Defendant’s own evidence, there was already a delay in the payment (see [39]). If the S$407,979.55 was insufficient, at that point, to satisfy the ₱16,093,035.80 owing, one expects that he would have informed the Plaintiff as such. However, there are <span class="font-italic">no</span> messages informing the Plaintiff that her payment was short. In fact, I reiterate [40]. If the Defendants were ready, willing and <span class="font-italic">able</span> to transfer title, I do not see how there could have been an issue regarding the Plaintiff’s failure to make full payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 With the above findings in mind, I now turn to whether the Plaintiff gave the Defendants adequate instructions to transfer title.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defendants’ failure to transfer title to the Units</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Title to the Units was never transferred to the Plaintiff. In their Defence, the Defendants accept that they were obliged to transfer title once the Plaintiff “confirmed and informed” them of the nominee(s) to whom she wished for title to be transferred.

</div> Having considered the evidence, I find that the Plaintiff had indeed confirmed her desired nominee and provided the Defendants with the information needed for transfer to be effected.

From this, it seems that she initially intended for the transfer of title to the Units to be made to this company. Indeed, she incurred not insubstantial costs to incorporate and maintain LK (Philippines).

She then asked that he “liaise w[ith] Mr Renz direct[ly]”, and stated her hope that the transfers will be completed within three months.

</div> The First Defendant seems to accept in his affidavit evidence-in-chief that the Plaintiff’s election on 25 August 2018 was final, but he avers that she asked for the transfer to be made to “LK EduHub Singapore”, and that he was unable to do so because the particulars of this company were not provided.

</div> He seems to have erroneously merged the two companies, and there is little that needs to be made of this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Indeed, the foregoing shows quite clearly that the Plaintiff had, on 25 August 2018, instructed the transfer of title to <span class="font-italic">LK (Philippines)</span>. Further, given that Mr Renz was the corporate secretary for this company, it was in my view, sufficient for her to have asked the First Defendant to take up the technical requirements for the transfer with him. Thus, although the “<span class="font-italic">what</span>” question (see [59] above) was not addressed with much specificity, I do not think that this was necessary. If the Defendants had lacked the necessary documents or information to effect a transfer to LK (Philippines), and such documents or information could not be provided by Mr Renz, I expect that they would have sought the Plaintiff’s input, but there is no evidence that they did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This then takes me to the Defendants’ contentions. They make two key factual points. First, that the First Defendant informed the Plaintiff on 14 August 2018 that a board resolution from the Plaintiff’s nominee was required to initiate the transfer, but no resolution was ever provided. Second, that when asked to sign a “Buyer Information Sheet” in July 2021, the Plaintiff refused to do so.

In fact, an aspect of their exchange actively cuts against the Defendants’ position. When the Plaintiff queried whether the Defendants had gotten in touch with her company secretary – seemingly of SEPL – the First Defendant said, “Please provide your company secretary email for us to contact directly”. This supports my finding (at [68] above) that it was sufficient for the Defendants to be in contact with Mr Renz in respect of the transfer to LK (Philippines).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This brings me then to the Defendants’ second point, that the Plaintiff wrongfully refused to sign a “Buyer Information Sheet” in July 2021.

From the First Defendant’s statements, it appears to me that he was agreeing to two alternative ways to move forward with their Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, he said the following: “after the black and white, then in 12 months after your submission, you will get the title deed … [until then] I’ll continue to rent from you, [but] if title is transferred, there will be no buyback”. By this, the First Defendant seems to be saying that, if the Plaintiff wished to have the title to the Units, she would need to indicate this to him, and within 12 months, he would effect a transfer. Whilst the transfer was being effected in these 12 months, he would continue to lease the Units from her, although, if she preferred this, the Units would not be bought back from her.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, he then said: “if no transfer, another 3 years is required … you have had 2 years … [after] 5 years … I can buy them back from you”. In my view, the reference to the need for a “transfer” is important because, in the first part of the conversation quoted, the First Defendant accepts that the Units belonged to the Plaintiff, which was why rent was being paid at all. On that basis, if she did not require title to be <span class="font-italic">formally</span> transferred, he was agreeable to extending the Leaseback Agreement by two years, and further, that he was also agreeable to buying the Units back from her at the end of the total five-year period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Plaintiff’s pleaded case is that the parties agreed to extend the period of the leaseback period by two years, and that the Defendants would repurchase the Units at the end of the total five-year period.

</div>
</div> There is no suggestion that they had agreed to extend the leaseback period for the purported 12 months it would take for the Defendants to effect a transfer of title. Her position therefore is that the parties agreed to the <span class="font-italic">second alternative</span>; and as such, I do not consider whether the parties varied the terms of the Contracts on the first alternative. As regards the second, however, I find that the alleged variation fails for want of valid consideration on the part of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Before turning to the issue of consideration, however, I first note that the Defendants’ case is that the variations proposed were not genuine offers; they were false compromises made to placate the Plaintiff who had put on a “drama” for the purposes of her secret recording.

</div> I do not accept this. The validity of offers is determined objectively. Here, the words plainly convey an objective intention to be bound, and the claim that he was trying to pacify the Plaintiff is not convincing. If he was in the wrong, and needed to propose a compromise, then that intention takes centre stage. Any ancillary intention to pacify would be just that, <span class="font-italic">ancillary</span>. If, however, he was not in the wrong, then it begs the question why he would need to pacify the Plaintiff at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I therefore find that the First Defendant’s promises were real. On this basis, he proposed to: (a) extend the leaseback period by two years; and (b) buy back the Units at the end of the five-year lease period. Both of these promises are plainly valuable. I need not say anything about (a). As to (b), given my view that the Alleged Buyback Term did not exist, this would also be a new benefit to the Plaintiff. The question then, is what consideration she gave in exchange.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In the circumstances, as no additional money was paid by the Plaintiff, there seems only to be two forms of consideration that she could have given: (a) forbearance to sue on a valid claim; or (b) foregoing her right to receive legal title to the Units. It is trite that the former would be good consideration, and it is clear that the latter could also be valid. This is because, if the Plaintiff forgoes her right to receive <span class="font-italic">legal</span> title, she suffers the detriment of having her interest reduced to an equitable one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In any event, notwithstanding the <span class="font-italic">legal</span> acceptability of these two forms of consideration, I find that the Plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">factually</span>, did not actually provide them in exchange. As regards (a), if no time for forbearance is specified, the court will infer that the undertaking was to do so for a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> time (David Foskett, <span class="font-italic">Foskett on Compromise</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019) at para 3-03, citing <span class="font-italic">Fullerton v Provincial Bank of Ireland</span> [1903] AC 309; also see <span class="font-italic">Projection Pte Ltd v The Tai Ping Insurance Company </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd</span> [2000] SGHC 146 at [40], which cites an older edition of <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span> for the same purpose).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Reasonableness, of course, is open-ended.

The parties’ conversation (see [79] above) does not show that the Plaintiff agreed to forgo the right to ask for legal title to be transferred to her.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Before turning to the issues proper, however, there are two preliminary matters I should clarify and reiterate. First, although the Plaintiff pleads that the Defendants were obliged to repurchase the Units at S$1,520,719.97, the more relevant figure is S$1,468,895.69, this being the price she actually paid (see [54]–[56] above). Second, given my finding that the parties did not validly agree to extend the Leaseback Agreement (see [77] and [88]), the extent to which the Defendants can be held liable for rental arrears is only S$71,364.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 With these points in mind, I now consider the two issues which must be answered in determining the Defendants’ liability for damages. First, whether the Defendants’ committed repudiatory breaches of the Contracts, such that the Plaintiff was justified in terminating the Contracts on 27 December 2019 to sue for damages. Second, the extent to which the Plaintiff has proven the losses she claims in respect of this cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defendants’ breach of the Contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The first question is relatively straightforward, though it requires some analysis of the character of the Contracts. Specifically, whether they should be understood as five composite contracts for the purpose of the Plaintiff’s capital investment, just with sale and lease elements; or, whether they should be seen as five sales and, separately, five agreements to lease the Units.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 This distinction is salient because, if the Contracts are seen as separate sales and leases, not only will the validity of the Plaintiff’s termination of each need to be considered separately, such analysis will need to be undertaken with regard to the particular rules relating to these types of contracts. For example, the requirement that parties to the sale give notice demanding completion; or the requirement that the right to forfeit for non-payment of rent is expressly reserved (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Alwee Alkaff v Syed Jafaralsadeg and others and another action</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 419 at [23]–[24]). Even more complicatedly, if the Contracts are understood as comprising distinct sales and leases, this begs the question as to which law governs each of these components, the <span class="font-italic">lex situs</span> of the Units (Philippine law), or Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Thus, it is more appropriate to characterise the two components of the Contracts as parts of a broader commercial investment. This is supported by the fact that: (a) the components of the Contracts are evidenced within single documents (see [18] above); and more pertinently, (b) these documents do not contain <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the terms or details ordinarily seen in contracts for the sale of real property, or leases. This stark lack of detail suggests strongly that the parties did not intend for the Contracts to operate within the usual, more rigid realm of these types of contracts. Instead, they appear to have understood the Contracts as loose collections of obligations which facilitated the Plaintiff’s investment in the Business. I will therefore analyse them as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 On this basis, I find that the Defendants’ obligation to transfer <span class="font-italic">legal</span> title in the Units to the Plaintiff were conditions of the Contracts, the breach of which entitled her to terminate and sue for damages. I arrive at this view because the Plaintiff’s obtainment of a proprietary interest in the Units forms an essential part of the Contracts’ character. Without obtaining such interest, the Plaintiff’s payment to the Defendants would be akin to an outright, unsecured loan, which is certainly not what the parties intended.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Measure of the Plaintiff’s damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 This brings me then to the second, considerably more difficult question: the extent to which the Plaintiff has proven the damages she seeks to recover for the Defendants’ breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The standard expectation measure: Difficulties in this case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I alluded to such difficulty at [8] above, and it arises because the Plaintiff seeks to recover her principal investment of around S$1.5m on the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> basis that the Alleged Buyback Term existed, either upon the formation of the Contracts or arising out of the November 2019 Meeting. Relying on this factual premise, the Plaintiff submits that, applying the standard expectation measure of damages, she is entitled to recover the purchase price of the Units because this is the price the Defendants “would have [had to pay her] to buy back the Units”.

</div> In other words, if the Defendants had performed the Contracts, she would have obtained this sum. This is entirely orthodox.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Absent a buyback agreement, however – as I have found at [35] and [88] above – it is not clear whether the Plaintiff can directly recover the sum she paid on the basis of a breach of contract. Indeed, without the buyback agreement, we are simply dealing with the Defendants’ failure to deliver title to real property. The normal measure of damages in respect of such a breach is to take the market value of the property at the time for completion (or some other suitable date), less the contract price if it has not already been paid (see <span class="font-italic">Engell v Fitch</span> (1869) LR 4 QB 659 at 665; <span class="font-italic">Min Hong Auto Supply Pte Ltd v Loh Chun Seng </span>[1993] 1 SLR(R) 642 at [82]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The use of this measure in these cases is well-settled and orthodox in its protection of the innocent contracting party’s interest in the <span class="font-italic">performance</span> of the contract (see James Edelman, <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">McGregor</span>”) at paras 27-005–27-006; Adam Kramer, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract Damages</span> (Hart Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Kramer</span>”) at paras 4-02–4-03; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Damages</span> (Andrew Tettenborn gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Tettenborn</span>”) at paras 23.02–23.03). It is difficult, however, to apply to the present case. It <span class="font-italic">could</span> technically be applied; but it requires the Plaintiff to prove the market value of the Units. However, as stated, her case hinges entirely on the existence of the Alleged Buyback Term, and so no valuation of the Units was prepared or tendered as evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 This puts the court in a difficult position. If the Contracts had been fully performed, it is clear the Plaintiff would have received: (a) unencumbered title to the Units (which she would have been free to sell); and (b) rent payments for the balance of the leaseback period. Liability in respect of (b) is conceded (see [77] above). As regards (a), however, counsel for the Plaintiff did not think it necessary as a contingency to demonstrate the value of the Units; nor have they alternatively pleaded restitution for unjust enrichment. On one hand, without evidence of the Units’ value, I cannot state with any certainty the position the Plaintiff would be in had the Contracts been performed. Therefore, an award of expectation damages cannot be properly quantified. On the other, without a claim in unjust enrichment, it is questionable whether there is basis for me to order the direct reversal of the Plaintiff’s payment of S$1,468,895.69. Her alternative claim for fraudulent misrepresentation <span class="font-italic">could have</span> been a basis to grant her such a quantum of damages, but as I will discuss from [175] below, this claim fails on the available evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I could, in the face of this, nevertheless assume that the value of the Units is that which the Plaintiff paid, but that would be to coat a conceptual question with evidential veneer. In his chapter on damages in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”), Professor Beale observes that, though an innocent party has multiple interests which an award of damages for breach of contract <span class="font-italic">can</span> serve to protect – expectation, reliance, and restitution interests, or in some instances, even an interest in disgorgement (which is also raised here) – the expectation of performance is the primary interest to be guarded. In his own words, “it must be emphasised that contract damages are normally assessed on the ‘expectation’ measure and do not protect the restitution interest or the reliance interest as such” (para 29-023). The issue of which of these interests can or should be protected in a given case is primarily a conceptual question which entails at least some thoughtful characterisation. If I were to assume without proof that the market value of the Units is that which the Plaintiff paid, I would be protecting her restitution interest under the guise of her expectation of performance. There are at least two issues with this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 One, a central principle of contract damages is that the innocent party should not be put in a better position than if the contract had been performed (<span class="font-italic">Robinson v Harman</span> (1848) 1 Exch 850 at 855). If I assume that the market value of the Units is that which the Plaintiff actually paid and award damages on that basis, when added to her earned rental as well as claim for rental arrears, she would be turning a profit. Therefore, such an assumption would not only unjustifiably relieve her of the burden of proving her expected profits, but do so at the risk that she might be overcompensated. This is because, given the lack of proof, it cannot be said with any certainty that the value of the Units has gone above, or at least maintained at the sum paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Two, the Plaintiff could have mounted an alternative claim for unjust enrichment. Indeed, in the circumstances, a claim grounded on failure of basis seems feasible. As such, if I were to assume the value of the Units, I would also effectively be granting the Plaintiff a restitutive remedy without holding her to demonstrate that there was indeed a total failure of basis (as well as the other elements for a claim in unjust enrichment).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As Professor Edwin Peel observes in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Trietel</span>”), a plaintiff’s “right to claim restitution is limited, in particular by the rule that he can (in general) recover money paid under the contract only if there has been a total failure of [basis]” (para 20-035). Where a plaintiff has a claim for breach of contract, “to allow him to claim restitution in respect of any breach would cut across this principle, particularly where he had made a bad bargain by paying [the defendant (“D”)] more than [D’s] performance was worth” (para 22-008; also see <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 29-029). Further, given the UK Supreme Court’s (“UKSC”) firm decision in <span class="font-italic">One Step (Support) Ltd v Morris-Garnder </span>[2019] AC 649 (“<span class="font-italic">One Step</span>”) re-characterising <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages as compensatory, not restitutionary (the position in Singapore is the same in this regard: see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd v Yeo Boong Hua</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span>”) at [267] and [271]), any justification supporting the grant of a restitutionary remedy for breach of contract – even if indirectly – is arguably weaker than ever.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 This thus leaves the Plaintiff in a bind. All she can prove, insofar as her expectation of performance is concerned, is that the Defendants would have had to pay her the rental arrears of S$71,364. She cannot prove that she would have been able to recoup the purchase price from selling the Units. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alternative reliance measure: A conceptual overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Having said the foregoing, I am aware that there are cases which have allowed innocent parties to recover the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">purchase price</span> they paid as a form of “wasted expenditure” within the ambit of reliance damages. The oft-cited case is <span class="font-italic">McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission</span> (1951) 84 CLR 377, where the High Court of Australia allowed the plaintiff to recover the price he had paid to purchase the wreck of a non-existent oil tanker, in addition to the other expenditure he incurred in preparing for the salvage. Other examples include <span class="font-italic">Harling v Eddy</span> [1951] 2 KB 739 and <span class="font-italic">CCC Films (London) v Impact v Quadrant Films</span> [1985] QB 16 (“<span class="font-italic">CCC Films</span>”), amongst numerous others (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 29-029; <span class="font-italic">Trietel</span> at para 20-031).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Though Professor Beale observes that contract damages do not protect one’s reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">interest</span> <span class="font-italic">per se</span> (see statement quoted at [104] above), since the well-known decision of <span class="font-italic">Anglia Television Ltd v Reed</span> [1972] 1 QB 60 (“<span class="font-italic">Anglia Television</span>”), the availability of damages assessed using the reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">measure</span> has been accepted to be available upon the “election” of the plaintiff (at 64, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Denning MR). It is, in fact, generally understood as settled law that such a measure of damages may be applied (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">TCL Industries (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v ICC Chemical Corp</span> [2007] SGHC 211 at [11]; <span class="font-italic">PT Panosonic Gobel Indonesia v Stratech Systems Ltd</span> [2010] 3 SLR 1017 at [6]). That said, I will return to a distinction between the protection of one’s reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">interest</span> and the reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">measure</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of damages at [124] below. First, it is important to appreciate the precise juridical basis on which the court awards “reliance damages”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Generally, the common law courts have rationalised the availability of “reliance damages” by aligning both the expectation and reliance measures with the core principle of contract damages set out in <span class="font-italic">Robinson v Harman</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to place the plaintiff in the position he would have been had the contract been performed (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Van Der Horst Engineering Pte Ltd v Rotol Singapore Ltd</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 586 at [54]–[55]). The object of such rationalisation has been to secure consistency and coherence within the area of contract damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The force of this rationale is especially evident from the penetrating and comprehensive analysis of Teare J in <span class="font-italic">Omak Maritime Ltd v Mamola Challenger Shipping Co</span> [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 47 (“<span class="font-italic">Omak</span>”) at [11]–[63]. After considering numerous authorities and arguments, Teare J concludes:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I consider that the weight of authority strongly suggests that reliance losses are a species of expectation losses and that they are neither, to use Mr Brenton’s phrase, “fundamentally different” nor awarded on a different “juridical basis of claim”</span>. That they are a species of expectation losses is supported by the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">C &amp; P Haulage v Middleton</span> [[1983] 1 WLR 1461] and by very persuasive authorities in the United States, Canada and Australia.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 The tribunal’s error was to regard a claim for wasted expenses and a claim for loss of profits as two separate and independent claims which could not be “mixed”. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">But the weight of authority clearly shows that both claims are illustrations of, and governed by, the fundamental principle stated by Baron Parke in Robinson v Harman. That principle requires the court to make a comparison between the claimant’s position and what it would have been had the contract been performed</span>. Where steps have been taken to mitigate the loss which would otherwise have been caused by a breach of contract that principle requires the benefits obtained by mitigation to be set against the loss which would otherwise have been sustained. To fail to do so would put the claimant in a better position than he would have been in had the contract been performed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Similarly strong authority exists elsewhere in the Commonwealth. In <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty</span> (1991) 104 ALR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Amann Aviation</span>”), Mason CJ and Dawson observed (at 9–10):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The award of damages for breach of contract protects a plaintiff’s expectation of receiving the defendant’s performance. That expectation arises out of or is created by the contract. Hence, damages for breach of contract are often described as “expectation damages”. The onus of proving damages sustained lies on a plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded will be commensurate with the plaintiff’s expectation, objectively determined, rather than subjectively ascertained. That is to say, a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the ordinary course of commercial dealings, a party supplying goods or rendering services will enter into a contract with a view to securing a profit, that is to say, that party will expect a certain margin of gain to be achieved in addition to the recouping of any expenses reasonably incurred by it in the discharge of its contractual obligations. It is for this reason that expectation damages are often described as damages for loss of profits. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damages recoverable as lost profits are constituted by the combination of expenses justifiably incurred by a plaintiff in the discharge of contractual obligations and any amount by which gross receipts would have exceeded those expenses</span>. This second amount is the net profit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The expression “damages for loss of profits” should not be understood as carrying with it the implication that no damages are recoverable either in the case of a contract in which no net profit would have been generated or in the case of a contract in which the amount of profit cannot be demonstrated. It would be an invitation to the repudiation of contractual obligations if the law were to deny to an innocent plaintiff the right to recoupment by an award of damages of expenditure justifiably incurred for the purpose of discharging contractual obligations simply on the ground that the contract breached would not have been or could not be shown to have been profitable. If the performance of a contract would have resulted in a plaintiff, while not making a profit, nevertheless recovering costs incurred in the course of performing contractual obligations, then that plaintiff is entitled to recover damages in an amount equal to those costs in accordance with <span class="font-italic">Robinson v Harman</span>, as those costs would have been recovered had the contract been fully performed. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 When distilled, the way in which these authorities have sought to align the expectation and reliance measures of damages can be understood in four relatively simple steps. First, the fundamental objective of contract damages is to put the plaintiff in the monetary position he would have been had the contract been performed. This requires the plaintiff to hypothesise and prove an alternate future. It does not involve him looking into the past to determine where he would be had he not contracted at all. The latter inquiry is more appropriately undertaken in an action for misrepresentation, and pursuing it in the field of contract would, in the words of Learned Hand CJ in <span class="font-italic">Albert &amp; Son v Armstrong Rubber Co</span> 178 F (2d) 182 (1949) (“<span class="font-italic">Albert &amp; Son</span>”), unjustifiably make the defendant “an insurer of the [plaintiff’s] venture” (at 189).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Second, though contracts are typically entered for the purpose of making profits, it cannot be taken that all contracts will be profitable. This is why Mason CJ and Dawson J say in <span class="font-italic">Amann Aviation</span>, “a plaintiff must prove, on the balance of probabilities, that his or her expectation of a certain outcome, as a result of performance of the contract, had a likelihood of attainment rather than being mere expectation” (see [113] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Third, in setting out to make profits from the contract, the plaintiff will almost certainly have incurred costs. This could include the sums it was obliged to pay the defendant to secure counter-performance, or preparatory works it had to undertake so as to be able to apply the defendant’s expected performance to a profitable use. If the plaintiff manages to prove that the contract would have been profitable, and thus succeeds in recovering damages on this basis, inherent in these damages is the recoupment of his capital outlay or expenditure (this is what constitutes his “reliance damages”). After all, one must break even before one can turn a profit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Lastly, there will invariably be cases where the plaintiff will not be able to prove the profitability of the contract; for example, the subject of the contract may simply be too speculative. In these cases, the plaintiff may still have put down capital or incurred expense in reliance of the contract. However, if he is unable to prove that he would have turned a profit, it is likely that he would also struggle to prove that he would have made enough revenue to cover his capital outlay and expenses (see also <span class="font-italic">CCC Films</span> at 40B–D). Should this then mean that the plaintiff ought to be left without a means to recover payments made to the defendant, as well as reasonably incurred expenses?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In respect of the former, there is of course, the law of unjust enrichment. However, even within the field of contract, the law’s answer to this question is a rebuttable ‘no’, and it has reached this position by relieving the plaintiff of the burden of proving that, had the contract be performed, sufficient revenue would have been earned <span class="font-italic">at least</span> to cover his reasonable capital outlay and expenses. The burden is then shifted to the defendant to prove that the contract would not only have been unprofitable, but that the plaintiff would not <span class="font-italic">even</span> have been able to recover what he put down in expectation of performance. Put simply, though the plaintiff may have entered a bad bargain, this is a matter <span class="font-italic">for the defendant</span> to prove. If the defendant is unable to discharge this burden, the plaintiff would be entitled to damages assessed on the reliance measure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 This shift of the burden of proof where reliance damages are claimed, is well-established by the authorities (see the line of cases starting with <span class="font-italic">Albert &amp; Son</span> at 189, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Learned Hand CJ;<span class="font-italic"> Albert &amp; Son </span>was considered and applied in <span class="font-italic">CCC Films </span>at 39H–41A, <span class="font-italic">Bowlay Logging Ltd v Domtar Ltd</span> (1978) 87 DLR (3d) 325 at [35]–[37], <span class="font-italic">Amann Aviation</span> at 14–16, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Mason CJ and Dawson J, and <span class="font-italic">Yam Seng Pte Ltd v International Trade Corporation Ltd</span> [2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1321 at [186]–[190]; in Singapore, see O<span class="font-italic">ut of the Box Pte Ltd v Wanin </span><span class="font-italic">Industries Pte Ltd</span> [2012] 3 SLR 428 (“O<span class="font-italic">ut of the Box</span>”) at [8] as well as<span class="font-italic"> </span>cases cited by <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 1st Ed, 2012) at paras 21.051–21.053).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The basis on which the burden of proof is reversed is a presumption that a plaintiff would not enter a loss-making contract. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Amann Aviation</span>, “the placing of the onus of proof on a defendant in the manner described amounts to the erection of a presumption that a party would not enter into a contract in which its costs were not recoverable” (at 15, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Mason CJ and Dawson J). At the very least, therefore, it can be taken that he would have been able to recover expenses reasonably incurred so as to put himself back in a nett zero position. As regards whether such a presumption is justified, Learned Hand CJ in <span class="font-italic">Albert &amp; Son</span> suggests that it is because “it is often very hard to learn what the value of the performance would have been”, and that it is “just … to put the peril of the answer upon that party who by his wrong has made the issue relevant to the rights of the other” (at 189). Elsewhere in <span class="font-italic">Amann Aviation</span>, Mason CJ and Dawson J suggest that the absence of such presumption “would be an invitation to the repudiation of contractual obligations” (at 10). I regard these comments as sound and an accurate representation of the law in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 When the character of “reliance damages” is spelt out in this way, it is clear why Teare J in <span class="font-italic">Omak</span> came to the firm conclusion that “reliance losses are a species of expectation losses” (see [112] above). Both measures of damages ask and answer the same basic question: Where would the plaintiff be had the contract been performed? The distinction between them is that they ask this question to slightly different ends, and of different sides of the dispute. The expectation measure asks the plaintiff, “if the contract had been performed, would you have profited, and if so, by how much”, whilst the reliance measure asks the defendant, “if you had performed your part, on what basis do you say that the plaintiff would not even have been able to recoup his expenses”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Reliance damages are, as such,<span class="font-italic"> not awarded on any basis distinct from ordinary expectation damages</span>. I emphasise this because it is easy to assume, erroneously, that the purpose of reliance damages is to restore the plaintiff to the position he would have been, had he not entered into or relied on the contract at all. In fact, in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2013] 4 SLR 409 (“<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>”), Vinodh Coomaraswamy J remarked:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[Reliance] damages protect the innocent party’s reliance interest or, to put it another way, compensate it for its reliance loss</span>. By whatever name, this is the measure of damages which addresses the loss suffered by the innocent party due to his reliance on the counterparty’s unfulfilled promise to perform his contractual obligations. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It aims to restore the innocent party to the position he occupied before he entered the contract</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 7 (LexisNexis, 2012 Reissue) at para 80.545, and see also the decision of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in<span class="font-italic"> Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 302 at [27].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Based on my analysis above, I must respectfully apply a gloss to the learned judge’s observation. Although the practical outcome of an award of reliance damages achieves what Coomaraswamy J suggests, the doctrinal basis by which it does so is the shifting of the burden of proof, not an underlying difference in the objective of the remedy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng</span>, though Belinda Ang J (as she was) suggested that “[t]he aim of damages in protecting the reliance interest is to put an innocent party in as good a position as he was in if no promise had been made”, she immediately went on to say that “it is the breach of the contractual promise of a premier club that renders the defendant’s conduct wrongful and not when the defendant induces the plaintiffs to enter into the contract” (at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Having set out the proper characterisation of “reliance damages” from the authorities, I now return to the point alluded to at [110] above, that there is a slight distinction between the protection of one’s reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">interest</span> and the application of the reliance <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">measure</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of damages. I address this not as a separate matter, but as a conclusion to the foregoing discussion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Given the substantial number of cases in which the courts have awarded reliance damages for breach of contract, Professor Beale’s remark that “contract damages … do not protect the restitution interest or the reliance interest as such” (see [104] above), seems odd. However, in my view, what the learned Professor seems to have meant is that, even where damages are determined and awarded using the reliance measure, the plaintiff is still being compensated in connection with his <span class="font-italic">interest in (or expectation of) the defendant’s performance</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 29-024). This is consistent with the cases discussed above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 As such, a plaintiff’s “reliance interest”, confusingly, is not the juridical basis on which he is awarded “reliance damages”. As explained, the true basis is his orthodox “expectation interest”. Instead, the notion of “reliance” – or more specifically, “<span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> reliance” – is simply the filter through which the court determines which of the plaintiff’s pleaded expenses were <span class="font-italic">properly</span> incurred in connection with the contract. Given the shift in the burden of proof, these are the expenses for which the defendant will be held liable unless he can prove the plaintiff’s bad bargain; and if the plaintiff, like John Hammond, has a penchant for sparing no expense, it is of course not for the defendant to bear that which is unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 This may appear a fine distinction, but it is an important one. When one speaks of “reliance” as the underlying <span class="font-italic">interest</span> on which this type of damages is awarded, it risks confusion that object of the remedy is to put the plaintiff into the position he would have been <span class="font-italic">had he not relied</span>. As mentioned at [114] above, this inquiry is more accurately undertaken where the plaintiff’s action is for misrepresentation, not breach of contract. The blending of contract and tortious measures of damages may be unavoidable in certain areas, but in the already-challenging area of private law remedies, where precision is possible, I would suggest that it should be preferred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The alternative reliance measure: Problems and application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Having set out the conceptual basis of reliance damages, two questions arise in the present case. First, whether instead of granting the Plaintiff an award on the basis of her expectation of performance (which has not been proven), I can award her damages calculated on the basis of the expenditure she reasonably incurred in reliance of the Contracts. Second, if so, whether this award would be subject to the same objections set out at [105]–[107] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The first question is limited, though not straightforward. In the present case, the Plaintiff “elects” in her written closing submissions to pursue damages on the expectation measure.

</div>
</div>
</div> In the face of this election, the question is whether I may nevertheless award her damages on the reliance measure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Strong authority suggests that I may. The UKSC in <span class="font-italic">One Step</span> took the view that it is ultimately for the court to select the method of assessing damages most suitable for the facts before it (at [36]–[37] and [96], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Reed), citing <span class="font-italic">Watson, Laidlaw &amp; Co Ltd v Pott, Cassels &amp; Williamson</span> 1914 SC (HL) 18, wherein Lord Shaw remarked, “[t]he restoration by way of compensation is … accomplished to a large extent by the exercise of a sound imagination and the practice of the broad axe” (at 29–30).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 This is eminently sensible. Counsel will naturally submit that the court should accept the measure most advantageous to their client; but this may not be the most suitable, or, in this case, even workable on the available evidence. As Professor Beale suggests, “where it is clear that the claimant has suffered substantial loss, but the evidence does not enable it to be precisely quantified, the court will assess damages as best it can on the available evidence. The fact that the amount of that loss cannot be precisely ascertained does not deprive the claimant of a remedy” (<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> at para 29-019; affirmed by Lord Reed in <span class="font-italic">One Step</span> at [38]). I would agree with this. Indeed, it seems to abhor common sense to suggest that the court’s ability to do justice to a plaintiff is hamstrung by an “election” made by or on the advice of counsel. This is especially so, when it is readily evident that the plaintiff has reasonably incurred expenditure in reliance of the breached contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 However, that said, I would add that the court should not be too ready to re-characterise a claim for damages on the expectation measure, to one on the reliance measure. As discussed, assessing damages using this measure shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. The bases on which this shift is justified are sound (see [120] above). However, even so, where the reliance measure is invoked late in the day, the shift creates an undesirable situation where the defendant is put in the position of having to prove something which he likely, at the beginning of trial, had put the plaintiff to proof of. Indeed, the Defendants in this case simply pleaded that the Plaintiff’s losses are denied, and that she “is put to strict proof thereof”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 A similar issue arose in <span class="font-italic">Filobake Ltd v Rondo Ltd and another</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 563 (“<span class="font-italic">Filobake</span>”). The English Court of Appeal had to deal with an application made by the plaintiff to amend the particulars of its claim <span class="font-italic">during the appeal</span>. One proposed amendment was the insertion of a claim for “wasted expenditure” as an alternative to its original claim for lost profits. The plaintiff argued that this amendment would shift the burden of proof to the defendants to show that it would have been unable to recoup its expenditure. Such proof had not been furnished and so the plaintiff submitted that it was, <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span>, entitled to reliance damages. Chadwick LJ, who delivered the judgment of the court, accepted that the burden of proof <span class="font-italic">would</span> shift. However, he went on:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 … Filobake’s attempt to deploy it here, by saying that the defendant had not essayed such proof, is forensically very unpromising. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant did not set about proving that issue at the trial because no-one told them that it had to. It is very unfair to try to place that burden on Rondo now, by amendment after the trial</span>. And, as we shall demonstrate when we address the substance of this application in paragraphs 66 and 67 below, on the facts as found by the judge that burden, even though not known of at the time, has in fact almost certainly been discharged by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 At best, therefore, this amended claim would have to go back for further hearing. When it did so, a series of problems would immediately present themselves.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I agree with the sentiment underlying Chadwick LJ’s remarks. It is not satisfactory, procedurally, for a defendant not to know exactly what is expected of his defence. Yet, as Chadwick LJ goes on to observe, “there are formidable objections to running the two claims in the alternative, not the least being that, as we have seen, on the issue of the outturn of the contract the burden under a lost expenses claim rests with the defendant; whereas under a lost profits claim the claimant bears the burden of establishing his loss. That conjunction is at least potentially embarrassing for the defendant” (at [64]). This remark is <span class="font-italic">also</span> sound. It would be rather confusing – in a single trial – to hold the defendant to proof that the plaintiff “would not even have generated (<span class="font-italic">x</span>) in revenue” so as to recoup the expenses reasonably undertaken in reliance of the contract, whilst simultaneously holding the plaintiff to proof that it “would not only have generated (<span class="font-italic">x</span>) in revenue, it would have made (<span class="font-italic">x</span> + <span class="font-italic">y</span>)”, with (<span class="font-italic">y</span>) representing the plaintiff’s nett profits. Such a situation would make the fact-finding role of the court quite difficult.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Where then, does this leave us? On one hand, there are objections to allowing a plaintiff to hedge his bets at the outset of a suit. Yet, on the other, it is also undesirable, at the end of a trial, to allow that plaintiff to recover damages on a different basis which shifts the burden of proof. A possible solution might be to require plaintiffs to commit to a measure, and either succeed or fail by that measure. This would, however, effectively create a new rule requiring plaintiffs to specifically plead the measure of damages they intend to pursue. At present, there is no such rule (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>vol 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 18/8), and without full arguments, I am not prepared to lay one down. Indeed, it would run counter to the observations I made at [130]–[131] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Accordingly, while I am cognisant of the tension raised by Chadwick LJ in <span class="font-italic">Filobake</span>, there is no general solution which I can appropriately offer, and I leave the matter to be resolved in another case. I would highlight, however, that there may not even be a need for a “general solution”. After all, if the Plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">this</span> case had pleaded unjust enrichment and established her claim for the price paid on the ground that there was a total failure of basis, the foregoing and forthcoming discussions would probably have been unnecessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 That said, I cannot go so far as to say that the difficulty raised in <span class="font-italic">Filobake</span> is of no general interest, and only arises in cases where a gap in the pleadings exists. This is because the prevailing – albeit open – position in Singapore is that, in order to establish a claim for unjust enrichment, the failure of basis must be <span class="font-italic">total</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 239 at [53]–[54]). It is thus possible, in cases where the defendant has rendered partial performance (though, see Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell and Stephen Watterson, <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) at paras 12-16–12-32, where the authors discuss the ways in which the requirement of <span class="font-italic">total</span> failure may be worked around), that the plaintiff may not have a claim in unjust enrichment, and is limited to his claim for breach of contract. In such cases, the plaintiff may well have to confront the tension in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Filobake</span> directly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In any event, what I can suggest for the purposes of disposing of <span class="font-italic">this</span> case, however, is that it is not entirely novel for the court to determine the most suitable measure without much, if any, substantive assistance from counsel. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>, Coomaraswamy J awarded reliance damages in respect of a pleaded claim which merely “assert[ed] that the sum of US$252,000 was recoverable ‘being the deposit paid’ <span class="font-italic">without more</span>” [emphasis added] (at [62]). This harks back to Professor Beale’s statement (see [131] above) and, in my view, so long as the defendant is not prejudiced by the shift in the burden of proof, it is permissible to consider awarding reliance damages even where the plaintiff’s claim is couched in the expectation measure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the present facts, I find that the Defendants would not be prejudiced. Even if the Defendants had been put on notice that they bear the burden of proof, it is highly unlikely they would have been able to discharge this burden. There are two key reasons which support of this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 First, had the Contracts been fully performed, the Plaintiff would have generated rental revenue from the Leaseback Agreements, totalling S$273,636. The main capital expense she needed to incur to earn such revenue is, of course, the purchase price of the Units. She also pleads and supports with evidence that, in order to receive title to the Units, she incurred ₱340,504.50 in connection with the incorporation of LK (Philippines).

</div>
</div> Given the First Defendant’s rather firm insistence that the Plaintiff use a Philippine company to receive title (see [63]–[67]), I find this was reasonably incurred. The Plaintiff also avers that she “incurred costs” of ₱12,000,000 in paid-up capital put into LK (Philippines).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I do not accept this. This company was set up as a nominee under the Plaintiff’s control. Any capital placed into the company is still hers and realisable; it is not “wasted” expense in any sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Therefore, the total expenditure the Plaintiff incurred in reliance of the Contracts was the sum of S$1,468,895.69 and ₱340,504.50 (which I will denote “(<span class="font-italic">E</span>)” for “Expenditure”), and her <span class="font-italic">guaranteed</span> revenue of S$273,636 constitutes around 18.5% (using a rough conversion rate) of (<span class="font-italic">E</span>). This is significant because, if the Contracts had been performed, all the Plaintiff would have needed to do to get back to nett zero, would have been to sell the Units at 81.5% of (<span class="font-italic">E</span>). I am mindful that market value can vary, however, as we are concerned with property in the capital city of the Philippines (the Units are situated in Manila), it is not likely that their value would have dropped by a rather substantial 18.5%. I am also cognisant the Plaintiff would need to deal with fluctuations in the exchange rate, but even layered together, 18.5% is ample tolerance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Second, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in any event</span>, even if the Defendants could have shown a drop in market value, that does not alone show that the Plaintiff would not have been able to recoup her expenses. This is because, in the face of a weak market, the Plaintiff could have waited for an upswing, and in the meantime, continued leasing out the Units to generate revenue. It would have been difficult for the Defendants to prove that such an avenue of recoupment would not have been available had the Plaintiff been transferred unencumbered title to the Units. In fact, such a position would be contrary to the very premise of the Defendants’ Business, and if they were to adopt such a stance, they would be giving grounds for the Plaintiff’s misrepresentation claim to succeed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For these reasons, I find it appropriate to assess the Plaintiff’s claim for contract damages using the reliance measure, notwithstanding: (a) that she invoked the expectation measure; and (b) the difficulties identified by Chadwick LJ in <span class="font-italic">Filobake</span>. As regards (b), in particular, I reiterate that my finding on <span class="font-italic">these facts</span> is that the Defendants would not be prejudiced by my consideration of the Plaintiff’s claim on the reliance measure. In another case, it may not have been appropriate to recast the assessment of damages in this way without calling for further evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Therefore, although I find the Defendants liable to pay reliance damages <span class="font-italic">in this case</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(the quantum of which is set out at [184] below), I do so whilst strongly urging counsel to take time, before the close of pleadings, to carefully parse through the components of their client’s overall case. Alternative causes of action should be pleaded as fallbacks to weak, or at least uncertain aspects of the primary claim, and they should stand where the primary claim may fall. In this case, for example, the Plaintiff’s action for misrepresentation not only turns on much of the same evidence on which she relies to prove the existence of the Alleged Buyback Term, such evidence is applied to fairly similar ends. Thus, in the event she fails to prove the latter, the former faces a high risk of failure on similar grounds. By contrast, an alternative claim in unjust enrichment would not run the same risk because its elements are analytically distinct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 This then brings me back to the second question I posed at [128] above. That is, whether my decision to award reliance damages can be objected to on the same two grounds that I declined to assume – to the benefit of the Plaintiff’s claim for expectation damages – that the market value of the Units is the sum she paid the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Restated for present purposes, the two objections are as follows. First, reliance damages could equally result in the overcompensation of the Plaintiff because we still do not know the position in which the Plaintiff would have been had the Contracts been performed (see [107] above). Second, reliance damages also seem indirectly to protect the Plaintiff’s restitution interest – rather than her expectation interest – and it also does so without requiring the establishment of a claim in unjust enrichment (see [108]). Indeed, by shifting the burden of proof, it may still appear that the underlying conceptual question as to which of the Plaintiff’s interests are being protected is still coated by an evidential veneer, just of a different complexion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Neither objection continues to hold because the law has developed in such a way as to justifiably shift the burden of proof to the defendants. As to the first objection, as stated at [118] above, once a claim is premised on the reliance measure, it is for the Defendants to prove overcompensation. Until proven, the uncertainty works to the favour of the Plaintiff and there is, as a finding of fact, no overcompensation. On the second objection, it will be seen from my detailed explanation of the juridical basis of reliance damages (see [111]–[127]), that reliance damages seek to protect the Plaintiff’s interest in performance. The fact that it has a restitutive effect is not, in and of itself, an objection. Indeed, the only reason why I thought it objectionable in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim for damages on the <span class="font-italic">expectation</span> measure, is that it entailed me making an evidential assumption without any legal basis. Once the claim is properly characterised as using the <span class="font-italic">reliance</span> measure, this concern falls away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The more salient objection is the post-trial re-characterisation of a claim for expectation damages, to one for reliance damages. I have dealt with this on the facts of this case (at [132]–[143] above), and it was unfortunately required of me here because of gaps in the Plaintiff’s pleaded case. I therefore reiterate my admonition at [144]. The role of counsel is to assist the court in delivering <span class="font-italic">justice</span> to the parties – justice, of course, is that <span class="font-italic">by law</span>. The law can be, and quite often is, a technical field. It is thus incumbent on counsel to ensure that the legal bases on which they advance their client’s position are capable of bearing out their client’s factual claim for justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I turn then, to the other remedy the Plaintiff seeks in respect of her claim for breach of contract, an account of profits.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiff’s prayer for an account of profits</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Authorities on which the Plaintiff relies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In connection with her claim for breach of <span class="font-italic">contract</span>, the Plaintiff prays for an account of profits (if any) made by the Defendants as a consequence of their misuse of the Purchase Price she paid to them.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> merely considered the Lords’ decision <span class="font-italic">tentatively</span>, and ultimately did not rule on it given its finding that the facts of the case before it, in any event, would not attract the remedy upon application of the rather stringent guidelines and considerations proposed by the House of Lords.

</div> No time or space is dedicated to demonstrating <span class="font-italic">why</span> <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> should form part of the law in Singapore, particularly to remedy the wrong in <span class="font-italic">this</span> case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Further, counsel should also not have read <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> as making the suggestion that persons “akin to fiduciaries” are liable to account for profits (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> at [255]). In this portion of its judgment, the Court of Appeal was musing the possible ways in which the award of an account of profits can be rationalised despite being an unorthodox remedy for breach of contract. This is quite evident when the passage is read fully:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">255 Parenthetically, we observe that the remedy that the plaintiff obtained in <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> was, in fact, labelled “an account of profits” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Nicholls at 284). However, an account of profits is quintessentially an equitable remedy that would typically follow from a breach of fiduciary duty. Therefore, while the plaintiff’s claim in <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake </span>was for breach of contract, it may be possible to rationalise the remedy on the basis that the undertaking by the defendant, though not a fiduciary obligation as such, “was closely akin to a fiduciary obligation” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Nicholls at 287). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Again, this is only another possible rationalisation for the decision in AG v Blake</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 By taking this passage as a basis on which an account of profits might be awarded, counsel for the Plaintiff got their analysis backwards. If one reads <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span>, it will be seen that Lord Nicholls first stated the considerations which should be taken into account in determining whether an account of profits ought to be awarded for a breach of contract (at 285–286):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An account of profits will only be appropriate in exceptional circumstances</span>. … No fixed rules can be prescribed. The court will have regard to all the circumstances, including the subject matter of the contract, the purpose of the contractual provision which has been breached, the circumstances in which the breach occurred, the consequences of the breach and the circumstances in which relief is being sought. A useful general guide, although not exhaustive, is whether the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant’s profit-making activity and, hence, in depriving him of his profit. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lord Woolf MR [1998] Ch 439, 457, 458, also suggested three facts which should not be a sufficient ground for departing from the normal basis on which damages are awarded: the fact that the breach was cynical and deliberate; the fact that the breach enabled the defendant to enter into a more profitable contract elsewhere; and the fact that by entering into a new and more profitable contract the defendant put it out of his power to perform his contract with the plaintiff. I agree that none of these facts would be, by itself, a good reason for ordering an account of profits.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 He then went on to assess how these considerations applied to the facts before him. After stating in no uncertain terms that the facts were “exceptional” (at 286), he then queried “what would be a just response to a breach of Blake’s undertaking”. It is in this context that Lord Nicholls suggested that Blake’s undertaking, “[though] not a fiduciary obligation, was closely akin to a fiduciary obligation, where an account of profits is a standard remedy in the event of breach” (at 287). From the structure of this analysis, it can be seen that the core and operating premise which led Lord Nicholls to conclude that an account of profits was supportable, was the exceptional <span class="font-italic">factual</span> character of the case. Whether or not the facts also suggested that Blake was “akin to a fiduciary” was somewhat beside the point. Lord Nicholls was not suggesting that persons “akin to fiduciaries” <span class="font-italic">as a class of individuals</span> are accounting parties which may be rendered liable to account for profits. Put another way, his Lordship was not purporting to create a new head of persons liable to account, whether in equity or at law. Instead, he was saying that the exceptional facts of the case justified the award of an account of profits, and in any event, such an award is not entirely out of left field because Blake stood in a position quite close to that of an actual fiduciary, against whom the court would suffer no discomfort from ordering an account of profits for a breach of his fiduciary duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 This coheres with the Court of Appeal’s view in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span>. After considering some ways in which departure from the compensatory principle in <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> may be rationalised, the court remarked: “For now, it suffices for us to tentatively suggest that if <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> damages are to be recognised, their availability should be confined to truly exceptional cases” (at [255]). This focus on the <span class="font-italic">factual</span> – as opposed to the taxonomical – justification for the remedy, if any, is indeed central to how almost all subsequent cases invited to apply <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> have approached the issue: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Niad Ltd </span>[2001] EWHC 6 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Esso v </span><span class="font-italic">Niad</span>”) at [56]–[64]; <span class="font-italic">Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc and another </span>[2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 830 at [36]–[44] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Mance LJ) and [53]–[55] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Peter Gibson LJ); <span class="font-italic">Vercoe v Rutland Fund Management Ltd</span> [2010] EWHC 424 (Ch) at [341]; <span class="font-italic">Atlantic Lottery Corp Inc v Babstock</span> [2020] SCJ No 19 at [50]–[62], in particular [53] (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Brown J).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Seen in this light, whether or not we think that Blake was in a position akin to that of an actual fiduciary, is for the most part, <span class="font-italic">post hoc</span> rationalisation, and not in and of itself, sufficient anterior justification. It is the exceptional facts which justifies the remedy <span class="font-italic">at common law</span>, and without such facts the innocent party would need to point to a basis on which the court can assert its <span class="font-italic">equitable</span> jurisdiction to hold the defaulting party liable to account: <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, that the defaulting party was an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary (the <span class="font-italic">indicia</span> of which are discussed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 at [190]–[194]); or where there has been a breach of equitable confidence (see <span class="font-italic">Attorney General v</span><span class="font-italic"> Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2)</span> [1990] 1 AC 109 (“<span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Spycatcher Case</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 That being said, I do not mean that the <span class="font-italic">post hoc</span> rationalisation we choose to apply to <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> is not meaningful. Far from it. The manner in which we rationalise the Lords’ decision affects how narrowly or broadly the underlying search for “exceptional facts” is framed. As observed in <span class="font-italic">MFM Restaurants Pte </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Fish &amp; Co Restaurants Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 150 (at [55]), Lord Nicholls does not really furnish concrete guidance as to when an account of profits for breach of contract should be awarded (also see [156] above). Given this lack of concrete guidance, the “primary difficulty” the court in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> saw with recognising <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> as part of Singapore law, was the “uncertainty of legal criteria” to be applied (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> at [252]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I agree with their observation. Such uncertainty is not only practically difficult to overcome in resolving individual cases, but also undesirable because it enables different judges and counsel to apply different lenses to the problem to different ends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 For example, the court in <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> observed that an account of profits is “quintessentially an equitable remedy that would follow from a <span class="font-italic">breach of fiduciary duty</span>” [emphasis added] (at [255]). It bears noting that the remedy may also be awarded in cases involving passing off or other infringements of intellectual property rights, or as stated, where there is a breach of equitable confidence. Admittedly, the remedy is <span class="font-italic">most typically</span> seen in cases where a fiduciary relationship exists, and fiduciary duties are breached. This is because equity has, traditionally, left the least room for such individuals – reposed with trust, confidence and loyalty; and possessing the power to unilaterally alter their principals’ legal positions – to benefit from their appointments, without the informed consent of their principals. This has been held to be the case even when the fiduciary acts in furtherance of his principal’s interests, and where his own gain is merely by the by (see <span class="font-italic">Boardman v Phipps</span> [1967] 2 AC 46). Indeed, the connection between an account of profits and fiduciary status is so strong that some cases intuitively draw a connection between the two, even when it may not have been strictly necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In <span class="font-italic">Forsyth-Grant v Allen and another</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Forsyth-Grant</span>”), whilst discussing whether an account of profits should be granted for the tort of nuisance, Toulson LJ begins by explaining why an account of profits is justifiably granted for a breach of fiduciary duty. He then goes on to say that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 <span class="font-italic">An account of profits may also be given where the parties are in a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">quasi-fiduciary relationship, such as a relationship of confidence</span>. <span class="font-italic">The Spycatcher Case</span> and [<span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span>] are both cases where the wrongdoer abused his position of trust as a member of the security services by acting as a traitor, and thereby obtained a profit for which he was judged accountable to the state. In [<span class="font-italic">The Spycatcher Case</span>] there was no direct claim to account against the former agent, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">b</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ut his legal position formed a necessary part of the reasoning of the court in considering the liability of the newspapers against whom an account of profits was claimed</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Though I agree that the position of the former agent was important, the Lords in <span class="font-italic">The Spycatcher Case</span> were not concerned with his status as a “quasi-fiduciary” <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. The question they sought to answer was whether he acquired information in confidence, and consequently, whether the publishers did as well. This question can be answered without reference to one’s status as a fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary. In fact, once it was determined that the information had the character of confidence, the Lords were clear that an account of profits was a remedy available to redress a breach of confidence, quite apart from any breach of fiduciary duty (see <span class="font-italic">The Spycatcher Case</span> at 262 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Keith; 266 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Brightman; and 286 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Goff, especially Lord Goff’s speech).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Toulson LJ’s characterisation of a relationship of confidence as “quasi-fiduciary” is therefore, strictly speaking, unnecessary insofar as the availability of an account of profits is concerned. This then brings me back to the difficulty alluded to at [161], that different judges and counsel can apply different lenses in analysing when circumstances are “exceptional”. If we rationalise <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> as being justifiable on the basis that Blake was “akin to a fiduciary” – as Toulson LJ does, and counsel for the Plaintiff in this case seeks to do – the “exceptional” circumstances we look for, will naturally be filtered through the notions of trust, loyalty, honesty, good faith, and regard for the interests of the “principal”. There will also be an element of deterrence, but predominantly directed at preserving the values of the fiduciary relationship rather than punishment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 By contrast, if we prefer a different rationalisation for <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span>, the considerations which would be relevant, and thus our analysis, would follow. In this regard, I note another potential rationalisation – one which is more broadly policy-focused – suggests that the remedy arises “where the law has a legitimate basis for punishing the defendant and/or deterring non-performance” (see <span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span> at [254]). This more open-textured rationalisation can be expected to give rise to less structured analyses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Take for example, <span class="font-italic">Esso v Niad</span>, which <span class="font-italic">Chitty </span>cites as the only case to grant an account of profits in a commercial case (see para 29-072). Here, the parties entered into a contract by which the plaintiff, Esso, agreed to provide financial support to Niad, the defendant, in consideration for it keeping its petrol prices at a certain level. This agreement was entered pursuant to a larger scheme by Esso called “Pricewatch”. By this scheme, Esso sought to maintain its prices at a competitive level. It did so by advertising its prices as “amongst the lowest”, and entering into contracts with retailers such as Niad, who were obliged to provide daily reports of the prices being charged by competitors. Esso would then instruct them on the prices which they should charge. In exchange, the retailer would receive margin payments which depended on the prices in force. Esso provided the relevant financial support, but Niad repeatedly failed to abide by the prices set (see [2] and [29]–[30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Giving judgment for Esso for an account of profits, the Vice-Chancellor, Sir Andrew Morritt, reasoned as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 In my judgment the remedy of an account of profits should be available for breaches of contract such as these. First, damages is an inadequate remedy. It is almost impossible to attribute lost sales to a breach by one out of several hundred dealers who operated Pricewatch. Second, the obligation to implement and maintain the recommended pump prices was fundamental to Pricewatch. Failure to observe it gives the lie to the advertising campaign by which it was publicised and therefore undermines the effectiveness of Pricewatch in achieving the benefits intended for both Esso and all its dealers within Pricewatch. Third, complaint was made of Niad on four occasions. On all of them Niad appeared to comply without demur. It now appears that the breaches of its obligation were much more extensive than Esso at first thought. Fourth, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Esso undoubtedly has a legitimate interest in preventing Niad from profiting from its breach of obligation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 This passage and the facts summarised above support my point that, if a more open-textured rationale is adopted for <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span>, different analyses set at different thresholds are bound to appear. Nothing about Niad’s role <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Esso’s scheme suggests that it stood in a quasi-fiduciary position. Yet, the Vice-Chancellor found it appropriate to order an account of profits on the basis of other considerations such as the impossibility for Esso to prove damages; the fundamental nature of Niad’s obligation to the functioning of the Pricewatch scheme; and Niad’s repeated conduct, which could suggest that its breaches were “cynical and deliberate” (<span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> at 286).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Academic reception of this decision is tepid, though not particularly critical. <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span> does not seem to take issue with the outcome (see para 29-072), and merely remarks that “it is hard to gain much guidance from a class of cases that by definition are exceptional” (para 29-236). <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> also does not seem to have an express objection to the decision (see paras 15-021–15-022), though the learned author does seem, impliedly, to think that the decision is likely to be overruled if reconsidered (see paras 15-027–15-028). <span class="font-italic">Trietel</span> suggests, though without arguing the point, that Morritt VC could and possibly should have made an award for <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> (or “negotiating”) damages instead (see para 20-013). <span class="font-italic">Kramer</span> highlights the difficulty in quantifying damages on the facts of the case (see para 23-22) and emphasises that <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> and <span class="font-italic">Esso v Niad</span> “have not been followed by a flurry of awards of accounts of profits in contract cases” and that an account of profits remains a “very exceptional remedy” (para 23-26). Finally, <span class="font-italic">Tettenborn</span>, like <span class="font-italic">Kramer</span>, picks up on the unique difficulty of proving damages on the facts despite Esso’s clear interest in Niad’s performance (see paras 19.45–19-46), though it is more generally remarked that the decision is “troublesome” (para 19.41).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 On the whole, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> a more open-textured rationalisation of <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> is adopted in favour of the Plaintiff’s position (which I am not saying should be, assuming that the remedy is eventually accepted into Singapore law), the tenor of these observations nevertheless shows that <span class="font-italic">Esso v Niad</span> is not strong authority on which an account of profits should be awarded in a commercial case. Indeed, as the views expressed in <span class="font-italic">Trietel</span>, <span class="font-italic">Kramer</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Tettenborn</span> seem to suggest, the ordinary compensatory remedies should at least be unavailable before a gain-based remedy is even considered. As the damages the Plaintiff has suffered can plainly be quantified, this certainly cannot be said of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I therefore <span class="font-italic">firmly</span> dismiss the Plaintiff’s prayer for an account of profits. In fact, I take this opportunity to state, for the purposes of Singapore law, that it took the fascinating and exceptional circumstances of <span class="font-italic">AG v Blake</span> for the House of Lords to accept that an account of profits could be granted for the breach of an undertaking. Alternative arguments by which the same outcome could have been reached were, by pure circumstance, unavailable on the facts. Indeed, had there been another, more usual way for the House of Lords to reach their ultimate decision, I venture to suggest that it is unlikely that they would have taken it upon themselves to depart from orthodoxy. Put simply, if ever we are to accept this remedy in Singapore, it must be for – as the House of Lords had – the <span class="font-italic">right and necessary</span> case. The present one before me is <span class="font-italic">not</span> such a case, and it behoves counsel to consider with slightly greater circumspection whether the case they intend to advance <span class="font-italic">might</span> be one.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second Defendant’s contractual liability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 At trial, the Second Defendant took issue with the fact that the Plaintiff had sued both her and the First Defendant <span class="font-italic">in the High Court</span>.

Indeed, had I found that a buyback agreement arose out of the November 2019 Meeting between the Plaintiff and the <span class="font-italic">First</span> Defendant and awarded the Plaintiff a remedy on that basis, her submission may have had some weight. However, I have found that the Defendants are liable under the Contracts as originally entered (to which both Defendants are signatories).

As a starting point, I refer to the elements which she needs to establish. These have recently been restated in <span class="font-italic">Broadley Construction Pte Ltd v Alacran Design Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Broadley</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 The elements of fraudulent misrepresentation are: (a) there must be a representation of fact by words or conduct; (b) the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted on by the plaintiff; (c) the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement; (d) the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing; and (e) the representation must be made with the knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true: see <span class="font-italic">Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Having considered the Plaintiff’s allegations and the evidence before me, I find that elements (c) and (e) have not been satisfied.

</div> However, even if these representations are proven, they were made after the Contracts were entered on 30 May 2017, and are thus plainly irrelevant. I will therefore only consider her claim on the basis of the ten alleged representations set out in the paragraph above, and on these, I make three findings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 First, it does not appear to me that the Plaintiff acted upon each and every one of these representations. On her case, it seems that the key and operative representation was the <span class="font-italic">Buyback Representation</span> (encompassed in representations (e), (i) and (j) above). However, as explained at [24]–[35], the Plaintiff did not satisfactorily prove that such representation was actually made. Absent the Buyback Representation, I am not convinced that the others alone would have caused the Plaintiff to enter into the Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Second, even if the Buyback Representation had been made at the meeting on 29 November 2016, as explained at [32]–[35], I am not convinced that it induced the Plaintiff to enter the Contracts on 30 May 2017. In this regard, it is worth quoting observations made by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 … It is still the law that representees are not obliged to test the accuracy of the representations made to them, and it does not matter if they had the opportunity to discover the truth as long as they did not actually discover it (<span class="font-italic">Peekay</span> at [40]). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">But where the true position appears clearly from the terms of the very contract which the plaintiff says it was induced to enter into by the misrepresentation (Peekay at [43]), the position is quite different.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">After all, it is a corollary of the basic principle of contract law that a person is bound by the terms of the contract he signs, notwithstanding that he may be unaware of its precise legal effect. Such a claimant should be taken to have actually read the contract and known the falsity of the earlier representation</span>. To hold otherwise would undercut the basis of the conduct of commercial life – that businessmen with equal bargaining power would read their contracts and defend their own interests before entering into contractual obligations, and that they would rely on their counterparties to do the same.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Lastly, the Plaintiff has not, in any case, adduced adequate evidence of falsity of the other seven representations, much less to prove that the Defendants made these statements fraudulently. First, as regards representation (a), there is no evidence which might allow me to conclude that the Philippines is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a good destination for real estate investment. Second, there is also a paucity of evidence in respect of the falsity of representations (b), (c) and (d). Third, although the Defendants did not transfer title to the Units or complete rental payments for the full three years of the Leaseback Agreements, contrary to representations (g) and (h), there is also no evidence that these representations were false. In this regard, I emphasise that there is a distinction between a misrepresentation made to induce a plaintiff to enter into a contract, and a representation which becomes a term of the parties’ contract that is later breached. The fact of the latter does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> suggest misrepresentation. More specific evidence demonstrating each of the elements quoted at [175] above, is required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I therefore find, for want of proof, that the Plaintiff’s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 For the foregoing reasons, I allow in part, the Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract and dismiss her claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. My orders are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 First, the Defendants are to pay the Plaintiff the sum representing the total of S$1,468,895.69 and ₱340,504.50 (denoted (<span class="font-italic">E</span>) at [141] above), <span class="font-italic">less</span> sums which the Plaintiff has already received in leaseback rental payments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$202,727: cross-reference [77]). Put simply, the Defendants owe a total of S$1,468,895.69 + ₱340,504.50 – S$202,727, but given the different currencies, I will denote this sum “(<span class="font-italic">P</span>)”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Second, the sum of ₱340,504.50 shall be converted to Singapore dollars on the date which execution is authorised (<span class="font-italic">Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles)</span> [1976] AC 443; applied in <span class="font-italic">Indo Commercial Society (Pte) Ltd v Ebrahim</span> [1992] SLR(R) 667). After the conversion, the Plaintiff may enforce payment for the full sum,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (<span class="font-italic">P</span>), in Singapore dollars. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Third, the Defendants shall pay interest at the rate of 5.33% as provided for by para 77(9) of the Practice Directions on (<span class="font-italic">P</span>), and interest shall run from 1 October 2019 to the date of full payment. I have two reasons for selecting this date. One, I found that the repudiatory breach which the Defendants committed, was their failure to transfer legal title to the Units to the Plaintiff despite having received full payment of the purchase price as well as her instructions for title to be transferred by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">25 August 2018</span> (see [95]–[98] above). By 1 October 2019, the Plaintiff’s cause of action arose would have arisen, and thus interest can be awarded from this point: see s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). Two, the last leaseback rental payment which the Plaintiff received was in September 2019. Therefore, since October 2019, the Plaintiff has been deprived of the time-value of her money. As such, an order of interest from this date is necessary to ensure she is adequately compensated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Winston Kwek and Li Kun Hang <br/>(Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Defendants in-person.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
