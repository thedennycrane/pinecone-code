                    Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The charge

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Arrests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused Persons were arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau
                    (“the CNB”) who were conducting an operation with respect
                    to a suspected drug transaction. The officers observed a car bearing
                    registration number SGQ 9129 K (“the car”) in the carpark
                    between Blocks 316 and 317 Woodlands Street 31 (“the
                    carpark”) with the 1st Accused in the driver’s seat. A
                    motorcycle bearing registration number JNP 3997 (“the
                    motorcycle”) subsequently arrived at the carpark and stopped near the
                    car. The 2nd Accused dismounted from the motorcycle and entered the car. The 1st
                    Accused then drove the car out of the carpark. A few minutes later, the 1st
                    Accused drove the car back to the carpark. The 2nd Accused came out of the car
                    and returned to the motorcycle, while the 1st Accused drove the car out of the
                    carpark again. The 2nd Accused was arrested by the CNB officers before he could
                    leave the carpark. A stack of cash amounting to S$9,800 was seized from
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Other officers in the operation gave chase to the car, but lost sight of it.
                    Subsequently, the car was found abandoned at the junction of Woodlands Avenue 4
                    and Avenue 7 where it had collided with a taxi. Although he ran off from the
                    car, the 1st Accused did not evade arrest for long. He was spotted by CNB
                    officers at the third floor common corridor of Block 707 Woodlands Avenue 4. The
                    officers saw him throw a white plastic bag over the parapet wall of the corridor
                    when they moved in to arrest him. The 1st Accused was arrested and a white
                    plastic bag was recovered from the ground floor of the block as well as a red
                    and black sling bag which was in a drain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

                    packets were unwrapped, each packet was found to contain granular/powdery
                    substance wrapped in clear plastic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The four packets were sent to the Health Sciences Authority
                    (“HSA”) where the granular/powdery substance contained in
                    each packet was weighed and underwent qualitative and quantitative analysis. The
                    results of the analysis were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The red and black sling bag<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> (which was also referred to as a pouch) was found to contain,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, a red foil packet which in turn
                    held three small packets of granular/powdery substance which were also sent to
                    HSA where they were weighed and analysed. The weight of the granular/powdery
                    substance was 22.91 grams, and the diamorphine content weighed 0.70

                    Accused Persons. The 1st Accused admitted that the sling bag and its contents
                    belonged to him, and that he had thrown it down the block together with the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 28 May 2012, four days after his arrest, a cautioned statement was recorded
                    from the 1st Accused in answer to a charge of trafficking in 914.78 grams of
                    diamorphine (the gross weight before analysis). His statement was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I admit to all the drugs that were found at that Blk 707 and I admit to
                        all charges. I plead for leniency for the mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The cautioned statement was followed up by a series of investigation
                    statements which began on 29 May 2012, the day after the recording of the
                    cautioned statement. I shall set out the parts of the statements which presented
                    the background to the 1st Accused’s involvement in drug trafficking
                    and consumption, and the circumstances in which he was arrested. In his
                    statement recorded on 29 May 2012 at 2.45pm, he revealed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    I started as a middleman, meaning that when my drug customers look for
                            me to buy drugs, I would act as the middleman and go and get the drug
                            supply from my supplier. I would then in turn sell the drugs to my
                            customers. This was because I did not have capital of my own. I only
                            sell Heroin. I would sell in sets. One set is 10 packets of Heroin of
                            about 8 grams each. My cost price for one set of Heroin is about $1100
                            and I would sell them at $1400. As time goes by, I accumulated my own
                            capital. About one month ago, I then contacted my Malaysian friends to
                            get Heroin directly from them. I started with one pound of Heroin. The
                            drugs would be brought in by a Malaysian. One pound of Heroin would cost
                            me $4900. I would usually break half a pound into smaller portions for
                            sales in sets and sell the other half pound directly to one of my
                            customers. I have been doing this about once every two or three days for
                            the past month. I would only order two pounds of Heroin at most each
                            time. From the two pounds of Heroin, I can earn a profit of about one
                            thousand plus.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    My wife is aware that I am on the run and she has always been
                            encouraging me to go surrender myself. However, I would always tell her
                            that I would do so when I think the time is ripe. I do not smoke Heroin
                            in front of my wife and my family. I usually smoke Heroin outside at
                            places such as hotels, friends’ houses or secluded areas. My
                            wife is not aware of my drug activities except that I have a pending
                            case and that I am also on the run. Last Thursday which was the
                            24.05.2012, I was at my Tampines home the whole day. The address is Blk
                            299B Tampines St 22 on the 10th floor but I cannot remember the unit
                            number now. I left house at around 4 plus in the afternoon. I also told
                            my wife to follow me along. My actual intention was to collect some
                            money back from my runners and also to wait for my order of two pounds
                            of Heroin to come in. I did not tell my wife anything about all these. I
                            did not manage to collect any money from my runners yet as the Malaysian
                            “horse” arrived earlier than expected.
                            “Horse” is the term used for the person who
                            delivers the drugs. My wife told me that she wanted to go somewhere on
                            that day but I cannot remember now where she wanted to go. I intended to
                            send her to wherever she wanted to go after I am done with the
                            drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    I made order for these two pounds of Heroin one day before the day I
                            was arrested. I called a Malaysian Indian called
                            “Makel” to place order for two pounds of Heroin.
                            He then told me that I can collect the two pounds of Heroin in the
                            following day. On Thursday (24.05.2012), the
                            “horse” called me at around 4 plus 5 in the
                            evening. The “horse” that I am referring to is
                            “Ah Meng” “Makel” told me
                            that the name of this person is “Ah Meng”.
                            “Ah Meng” was also arrested together with me.
                            “Ah Meng” told me over the phone that he has
                            finished work already and told me to go down to Woodlands Blk 300
                            something near the polyclinic where he will pass me the Heroin. If I
                            remember correctly, I have met up with “Ah Meng”
                            about three times previously to collect Heroin. On previous occasions,
                            “Ah Meng” delivered to me only one pound of
                            Heroin. I remember so because it was only recently that I started to
                            order two pounds of Heroin. Other than “Ah Meng”,
                            there were other horses of “Makel” whom I have met
                            before to collect drugs from them. They are mostly of the Indian race
                            who came in motorbikes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    On the day that I was arrested, I remember that I reached the arranged
                            transaction place at about 5 pm plus. I just told my wife that I need to
                            go somewhere and follow me along for a while. When I reached there
                            “Ah Meng” was already there. Usually I would get
                            out of the car to collect Heroin from him, but this time round, I asked
                            him to come into my car instead, reason being that I saw one car which
                            had two people seated in it nearby my car and I sensed that they could
                            be CNB officers. I preferred not to get out of my car so I signalled
                            “Ah Meng” to come into my car. I felt safer this
                            way. “Ah Meng” came in and sat at the back
                            passenger seat. After “Ah Meng” was in my car, I
                            drove one round out of the carpark and back into the carpark again.
                            Along the way, I took over the drugs from “Ah
                            Meng” and I also passed him $9800 for these two pounds of
                            Heroin. Usually, the money for the drugs would not be handed over to the
                            horse directly except for this time round. I would think that it is
                            because “Makel” trust “Ah
                            Meng” enough for him to collect the money on his behalf. The
                            usual practice is to hand over the money for payment for the drugs to
                            somebody else. I heard from “Makel” that there
                            were past cases whereby the horses ran away with the money. When I
                            reached back at the carpark after one round I saw the car which I
                            suspected to be CNB officers right behind me. I immediately confirmed
                            that they are CNB officers. I quickly told “Ah
                            Meng” to leave but I did not tell him that I suspected there
                            are CNB officers around.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    I drove out of the carpark immediately and speed up. My wife asked me
                            why I was driving so fast and I told her to keep quiet. She did not ask
                            further. I tried to drive as fast as possible to brush off the car
                            following me. At Woodlands Ave 7, I checked again and realized that
                            there seemed to be no one following me anymore. I could not stop in time
                            for a red light ahead and I collided into a taxi. I then left the car
                            and told my wife to run somewhere else. I told her to go to my
                            uncle’s house at Blk 986 Buangkok Crescent somewhere on the
                                4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
                            floor which I cannot remember exactly now. My wife has been there with
                            me a few times before. The reason why I ask her to go there is because
                            my uncle is my closest relative to me and she would be able to get help
                            from him as I know that this time round if I am arrested, I may go into
                            Prison for a very long time. My uncle’s name is
                            “Saiful” but I do not know his full name. As I was
                            running away, I called my wife and I told her to take care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    I brought along with me the two pounds of Heroin together with a black
                            colour pouch and my sling bag. I ran towards Blk 707 Woodlands and went
                            up to the third floor. I changed into a shirt that I took from outside a
                            house which was left to dry and I threw away the original shirt which I
                            was wearing also on the same floor. I then saw the CNB officers coming
                            towards me and I threw down the plastic bag containing the two pounds of
                            Heroin and the black pouch from the third floor. I was then placed under
                            arrest by the CNB officers shortly after.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On 30 May he added that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    After I was arrested, I was brought down to the first floor of the
                            block. The officers asked me whether I threw down the plastic bag and I
                            admitted that I had thrown the plastic down from the third floor. An
                            officer then recorded a statement from me in a notebook and I told that
                            the plastic bag and the stuff inside belong to me and I also admitted
                            that the contents are Heroin. I told him that there are four packets
                            inside the plastic bag. I was escorted to a carpark where my car was
                            parked. The officers conducted a search on the car but nothing else was
                            found. Next I was escorted to Woodlands Checkpoint where my car was
                            checked by the Police dog and was also subjected to x-ray scan as
                            informed by the officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    I am shown a photograph showing a white plastic bag with marking A1
                            and a purple plastic bag with marking A1A. The white plastic bag belongs
                            to me and I had placed it on the floorboard in front of me when I drove
                            the car. The purple plastic bag with marking A1A was the one that
                            “Ah Meng” passed to me. This white plastic bag
                            contained a black pouch in it as well. I am shown a black and red colour
                            pouch with marking A2 and I can recognise it as the pouch that I had put
                            inside the white plastic bag with marking A1. After I took over the
                            purple plastic bag from “Ah Meng”, I put it inside
                            the white plastic bag together with the black and red colour
                            pouch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    After taking over the purple plastic bag from “Ah
                            Meng”, I did not open up the bag to take a look at the
                            contents inside. I felt the contents physically and could tell that
                            there were four packets inside and I put it straight into the white
                            plastic bag. I am shown a photograph showing four newspaper bundles with
                            markings A1A1A, A1A1B, A1A1C and A1A1D. I can identify them as the four
                            packets that were taken out from the purple plastic bag during the
                            photography. These four packets are Heroin which I had ordered from
                            “Makel” I had ordered from
                            “Makel” two “stones” of
                            Heroin, which stands for two pounds of Heroin. I am shown a photograph
                            with four packets of brown granular substances with markings A1A1A1,
                            A1A1B1, A1A1C1 and A1A1D1. The newspapers were unwrapped in my presence
                            and these are the four packets of Heroin and were wrapped beneath the
                            newspapers. I did not write the alphabet “C” on
                            them. I do not know what does it stands for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    I am shown a photo of a red packet with marking A2A and three packets

                            the black and red colour pouch with marking A2. The three packets of
                            brown granular substances are Heroin which I had repacked into packets
                            of 7.8 grams each. They are meant for my own consumption but if close
                            friends ask from me I would sell at about $100 per packet. If nobody ask
                            from me, I will smoke them on my own.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The 1st Accused’s use of the terms ‘packets’ and
                    ‘pounds’ needs to be clarified. He referred to the four
                    half-pound packets wrapped in newspaper recovered from the white plastic bag as
                    ‘packets’. These four half-pound packets made up the two
                    pounds of heroin that he had ordered. He would divide a half-pound packet into
                    smaller packets for the purpose of consumption and sale. His use of the the
                    terms “packets” and “pounds” were
                    not references to measurements of weight, but were the units by which the heroin
                    was ordered and sold. The 1st Accused confirmed that a small packet weighed
                    about 7.5 grams<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and his counsel and the prosecution put the weight of a small packet

                    grams packets will be referred to as ‘small packets’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 1st Accused’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The 1st Accused admitted that he had been buying heroin from a Malaysian
                    Indian known to him as ‘Makel’ who resided in Johore, and
                    that the heroin would be delivered to him in Singapore by the 2nd Accused. He
                    agreed with the prosecution that between 9 May 2012 and 24 May 2012, the 2nd
                    Accused had made four deliveries of heroin to him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and that the deliveries were for two, three, four and four packets
                        successively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     He admitted that he had trafficked diamorphine, but not in the amount stated
                    in the charge. This was because one of the four packets he received was meant
                    for his personal consumption. On that basis, his defence was that the 5.73 grams
                    weight of the heaviest packet (<em>ie</em>, packet 4)
                    should be deducted from the total weight of 19.84 grams of the four packets,
                    leaving 14.11 grams. The effect of the reduction was that he would not face the
                    death penalty on conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Unfortunately, the 1st Accused was inconsistent about the amount of heroin he
                    consumed. In his investigation statement of 31 May 2012, he said “I
                    smoke about one packet of Heroin each day”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and when he was interviewed by psychiatrist Dr Winslow Rasaiah
                    Munidasa on 3 February 2014, he told Dr Winslow the same thing. However, when he
                    was interviewed by psychiatrist Dr Ung Eng Khean on 20 January 2015 and 5 March
                    2015 in the presence of his counsel, he stated that he consumed
                    “between three quarters to two packet [<em>sic</em>] of heroin daily (average of one packet a
                        day)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> During the trial, he said 30 small packets would last him for
                    “1 week plus to 2 weeks”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> That worked out to 4.3 packets a day for a one-week period and 2.1
                    packets a day for a two-week period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Similarly, the 1st Accused’s account as to the amount of heroin that
                    he would keep for his own consumption was inconsistent. In his investigation
                    statement of 31 May 2012, he stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    … Normally, I will keep ten packets of Heroin with me and I
                            will not sell them. The reason is because there may be times whereby
                            Heroin supply does not come into Singapore from my supplier. I would
                            need these ten packets for my own consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    For those two pounds of Heroin that I am arrested with, I already have
                            orders placed with me for one and a half pound of heroin. The remaining
                            half pound is for my own consumption which I will pack into smaller
                            packs and keep with me. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The 1st Accused confirmed during the trial that half a pound of heroin
                        could be divided into 30 small packets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The 1st Accused also clarified that that was the first time he
                        had intended to keep 30 small packets for his own consumption, although he
                        had kept 20 small packets previously.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, in the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Winslow, it was recorded
                    that 1st Accused had “always kept about ~5 packets as a reserve for
                    his own consumption which he carried with him all the
                        time”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This was not denied by the 1st Accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The prosecution did not dispute that the 1st Accused consumed heroin, and
                    accepted that he would have kept some of it for his own consumption, but it
                    disputed his claim that he would have kept one of the four packets for his own
                    consumption. It argued that he had not proved that he had the financial means to
                    keep 30 small packets for himself, that he had the physical means to store 30
                    small packets, that it was his practice to keep 30 small packets for himself, or
                    that there was a need for him to keep 30 small packets.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> It took the position that he would have kept no more than ten small
                    packets, or one-third of a packet, for his own consumption. By its calculation,
                    ten small packets would contain 1.91 grams of diamorphine (on the basis that a
                    packet contained 5.73 grams of diamorphine), and deducting that from the total
                    of 19.84 grams, he was trafficking 17.93 grams of diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In those circumstances, the prosecution ought to amend the charge to
                    reflect that, but that was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the 1st Accused’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The essential question before the court was how much of the
                    19.84 grams of diamorphine which the 1st Accused collected from the
                    2nd Accused was intended to be kept for his own consumption?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is evident that the 1st Accused was unable to maintain a consistent
                    position (see above at [14]–[16]). He told Dr Winslow that he had
                    always kept about five small packets for his own consumption. He stated in his
                    investigation statement that he normally kept ten small packets for his
                    consumption, but with the four packets he was arrested for, he would have
                    re-packed and kept 30 small packets for himself, something he had not done
                    before. It should be borne in mind that he was referring to heroin to be kept
                        <em>for his personal consumption</em>. There was no
                    suggestion that his heroin appetite was given to sharp fluctuations. If his
                    practice was to always keep five packets for that purpose (as he told Dr
                    Winslow) or that he normally kept 10 packets (based on his investigation
                    statement of 31 May), there would be no cause for him to keep 30 small packets
                    out of the four packets he was arrested for unless he intended to go on an
                    unbridled binge. By his own admission, his sole source of income was from the
                    re-sale of the heroin. Why would he disappoint his customers and deprive himself
                    of the profits by holding on to so much stock? It is also pertinent that the 2nd
                    Accused had given evidence that in the third delivery, about one week before 24
                    May 2012, he had delivered four packets to the 1st Accused. This was not
                    disputed by the 1st Accused. However, on 24 May 2012, the 1st Accused only had
                    three small packets left in his sling bag where he stored his heroin
                        reserve.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> There was no reason for him to keep so much more from the fourth
                    delivery as compared to the third delivery. His professed anxiety over getting
                    supplies was unfounded – the evidence was that he had regular and
                    liberal supplies from Makel from whom he received four deliveries of a total of
                    13 packets between 9 or 10 May 2012 and 24 May 2012. I found his claim that he
                    intended to keep 30 small packets unworthy of belief, and that he was more
                    likely to keep five or ten small packets. I was prepared to give him the benefit
                    and accept the higher figure of ten small packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I found that the prosecution and the 1st Accused were incorrect in the way
                    they worked out the amount of diamorphine that was intended for trafficking
                        (<em>ie</em>, after deducting the diamorphine reserved
                    for his own use). Both of them used a packet as a unit for the calculation, and
                    they took the weight of a packet to be 5.73 grams – the weight of the
                    heaviest packet. However, there was no basis for that as the 1st Accused had not
                    seen the four packets when he was arrested, and was never in a position to
                    choose the one to keep. Since no selection had been made, there was no reason to
                    use the weight of the heaviest packet in the computation. There was another
                    basis to work out the figure without resorting to arbitrariness. There was
                    agreement on the weight of one small packet, and the total weight of the four
                    packets was known. The question was simply whether ten or 30 small packets were
                    intended to be kept for personal use. Since that had been determined to be ten
                    small packets, the amount of diamorphine he was trafficking could be derived by
                    deducting the diamorphine content of ten small packets (which can be worked out)
                    from the diamorphine content of the four packages (which is known).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I amended the charge to take out the ten small packets intended for
                    self-consumption. The quantity of diamorphine which he trafficked was calculated
                    as follows –</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Total weight of drugs in the 4 packets received – 915.6

                        of Block 707 Woodlands Drive 40, Singapore, did traffic in a Class A
                        controlled drug listed in the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                        (“MDA”), to wit, by having in your possession for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The 1st Accused claimed trial to the amended charged. The 1st Accused, the

                    examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After calling for written submissions and giving them careful consideration, I
                    found the 1st Accused guilty on the amended charge and convicted him. The
                    prosecutor submitted that he was not a courier whose involvement was restricted
                    to the activities set out in s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    MDA, and when his counsel accepted that, I imposed the death penalty on the 1st
                    Accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 2nd Accused’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The 2nd Accused made a cautioned statement on 28 May 2012 in response to a
                    charge of trafficking in 914.78 grams of diamorphine on 24 May 2012. The
                    statement read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I did not know that there were so much things. I knew that they were drugs
                        but I did not know that it was death penalty. If I knew it was death
                        penalty, I would not have done it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     He also made investigation statements, the first of which was recorded on 29
                    May 2012. In that statement he revealed that he resided in Johor Bahru and
                    commuted to Singapore daily on his motorcycle for work in installing aluminium
                    window grills, and that he consumed heroin. I set out the relevant extracts from
                    his statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    I have been getting my Heroin supply from one “Ah
                            Zhor” in Johor Bahru for the past four years plus. He is my
                            main Heroin supplier. I would only get from other suppliers if
                            “Ah Zhor” runs out of stock. “Ah
                            Zhor” also sells Heroin at a cheaper price. For example,
                            “Ah Zhor” sells a packet of about 6.5 grams of
                            Heroin at RM$240 while other suppliers would charge about RM$260 or
                            RM$270 for the same amount of Heroin. “Ah Zhor” is
                            an Indian man who is around my age. I do not know where he stays.
                            Usually “Ah Zhor” does not come personally to sell
                            drugs to me. His runners would come to sell the drugs to me. I only seen
                            “Ah Zhor” face-to-face more often in the past and
                            I rarely see him face to face these days. I also know his runners well
                            as I am their regular customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    About two weeks ago, I asked one of Ah Zhor’s runners
                            whether there is any drug-related job that I can do in Singapore. With
                            this, I am referring to whether I can do the job of delivering drugs for
                            them to people in Singapore. I think that it is risky for me to smuggle
                            drugs into Singapore due to the immigration checks. I know that
                            “Ah Zhor” does send drugs Singapore and I am
                            thinking whether I can earn extra money if I can help them to deliver
                            drugs inland in Singapore, which I think is less risky. I needed extra
                            money because I am heavily addicted to Heroin and I needed money for my
                            Heroin supply. I was also thinking that I can save up a sum of money
                            which would allow me to take a long leave and go back Malaysia to quit
                            the drug habit. The S$2000 income I earn every month is not enough to
                            cover my drug expenses. Ah Zhor’s runner then told me that he
                            will ask Ah Zhor and get back to me. A few days later, this runner gave
                            me a call and asked me the typical timings that I arrive in Singapore. I
                            then told him that I would usually report to my Boss at Blk 429
                            Woodlands at about 6.30am every morning. The runner then told me that if
                            there is a drug delivery job to do, “Ah Zhor” will
                            call me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    A few days later at night, “Ah Zhor” called me
                            when I was back in Johor Bahru to tell me that there is drug delivery
                            job for me to do. He asked me where would be convenient for me to meet
                            the person who would pass me the drugs. I told him at the car park
                            around Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands St 41 as I need to report to my Boss
                            there for work. He told me ok and that on the following day, someone
                            would meet me at the car park near Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands St 41 to
                            pass drugs to me. I told him to arrange the meet up at 6.00am.
                            “Ah Zhor” knows my motorbike number as he has seen
                            it before. The following day when I reach the car park, there was a male
                            Indian there and I took over a plastic bag containing two bundles of
                            Heroin wrapped in newspaper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In a further statement recorded on 30 May 2012 he added:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    After I took over the two bundles of Heroin inside the plastic bag
                            from the Indian man, I kept the plastic bag in the basket
                            (Recorder’s note: The accused refers to a storage compartment
                            at the front of his bike) at the front of my motorbike which was parked
                            at the carpark at Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands. I knew that the bundles
                            contain Heroin because “Ah Zhor” had told me so. I
                            then left for work with my Boss. Around evening time after I knock off
                            from work, I made arrangement with the person whom I am supposed to hand
                            over the Heroin to. “Ah Zhor” has already informed
                            me previously the number of this person so I just called him directly. I
                            arranged to meet him at the 4<sup>th</sup> storey of the
                            muti-storey car park and to pass the Heroin to him. The person who came
                            is a male Malay. I do not know his name, but he address me as
                            “Ah Meng” as he had asked for my name earlier in
                            the phone conversation. That was the first time I pass drugs to him.
                            This male Malay is the same person who was arrested together with me. I
                            am shown a photo of a male Malay (Recorder’s note: The accused
                            is shown a photo of one Muhammad Bin Abdullah, NRIC: [xxx]) and I can
                            positively identify him as the person whom I have handed over Heroin
                            to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    Other than the first time, I also passed Heroin to this male Malay on
                            two other occasions. I remember for the first time I passed heroin to
                            this male Malay, it was two bundles of Heroin. For the second time, it
                            was three bundles of Heroin and for the third time, it was four bundles
                            of Heroin. For the fourth time, which is also the time when I am
                            arrested, there were also four bundles of Heroin. I remember that for
                            the second, third and fourth time that I met this male Malay, I had
                            arranged it at the Blk 315 Woodlands carpark. “Ah
                            Zhor” and I agreed on a payment of RM$500 per bundle of
                            Heroin. “Ah Zhor” did not tell me the weight of
                            each bundle of Heroin. “Ah Zhor” also told me that
                            he would not let me do something that would let me face the death
                            penalty. “Ah Zhor” mentioned that at most I would
                            go into prison for about 6 or 7 years if I am caught. After I handed
                            over the Heroin to the male Malay, I would also collect money from him
                            for the payment of the Heroin which I would go back to Johor Bahru to
                            give to “Ah Zhor”. If I could not get
                            “Ah Zhor” I would contact his runners and hand
                            over the money to them instead. It is also during the time when I meet
                            up with “Ah Zhor” or his runners that I would be
                            paid for the job done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    On last Wednesday (23.05.2012) around 8pm plus, I was at my room in
                            Johor Bahru when “Ah Zhor” called. “Ah
                            Zhor” told me that there is a job for me to do the following
                            day. “Ah Zhor” told me that there will be four
                            bundles of Heroin and I would be paid RM$2000. The person to hand it
                            over to is also the same male Malay. “Ah Zhor”
                            also told me to collect S$9800 from the male Malay as payment for the
                            Heroin. The time and place to collect the Heroin is the same, which is
                            at the carpark of Blk 428 and 429 Woodlands at about 6am. On that
                            morning, I left Johor Bahru at around 4 plus in the morning and after
                            clearing the immigration, I went to the coffeeshop at Blk 305 Woodlands
                            to smoke Heroin in the toilet first. After I was done with smoking
                            Heroin, I headed to the multi-storey car park near Blk 428 Woodlands and
                            reached there at about 6am. A male Indian handed over to me a plastic
                            bag which contained the 4 bundles of Heroin. I did not open up the
                            plastic bag to check the contents but I knew that there are four bundles
                            inside based on physically feeling the contents in the plastic bag. I
                            then kept the plastic bag containing the four bundles of Heroin at the
                            basket in front of my motorbike. I then reported to my Boss and left for
                            work as usual. I knocked off on that day at about 4pm. I then made a
                            call to the male Malay and told him that I had knocked off from work and
                            I could pass him the Heroin. The place to meet is the same at Blk 315
                            Woodlands. The male Malay told me that he may be late and he would call
                            me when he arrived. Since I have some time left before meeting with the
                            male Malay, I went to Kranji to look for a fellow Malaysian friend who
                            works at a factory but he had already left and I just hanged around to
                            wait for the call from the male Malay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    At around 6pm, the male Malay called and told me that he has already
                            reached the car park at Blk 315 Woodlands. I told him to wait for me as
                            I needed some time to get to there from Kranji. The male Malay drives a
                            car but I cannot remember the exact model of the car now. I looked
                            around the carpark and managed to identify the male Malay who was inside
                            the car. I went into his car and sat at the back passenger seat and
                            handed over the plastic bag containing the four bundles of Heroin to
                            him. I remembered that the male Malay drove one round around the car
                            park. He also handed me S$9800 as payment for the four bundles of
                            Heroin. While in the car, I counted the money to ensure that the total
                            amount is correct. I remember that there was also a female Malay who was
                            seated at the front passenger seat at that time. She was playing with a
                            laptop. She did not talk at all and I do not know who she is. She could
                            be the wife or girlfriend of the male Malay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    After ensuring that the sum of $9800 is correct. I got out of the car
                            and walked back towards my motorbike which was parked nearby. The male
                            Malay also left in his car. Shortly after, a few men came towards me and
                            handcuffed me. At that moment I realized that I had been arrested by law
                            enforcement officers. They conducted a search on me and found the $9800
                            in my jean pocket and I also told them I have one straw of Heroin in my
                            wallet. I told them that the straw of Heroin is meant for me to smoke on
                            my own. One of the officers then recorded a statement from me. I was
                            then escorted to Woodlands Checkpoint where the Police brought a dog to
                            check my motorbike. A vehicle also came in to check my motorbike and I
                            was told that it was scanning of my motorbike.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In his statement of 31 May 2012, he explained how the drugs were kept and
                        transported:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    After I took over the purple plastic bag which contained the four
                            bundles of Heroin from the Indian man, I placed it in the basket that is
                            attached to the front of my motorbike. I then used a rain coat to cover
                            the purple plastic bag to conceal it. I then put my motorbike helmet on
                            top of the rain coat. The basket has no cover and as such it cannot be
                            locked. I am not afraid that the Heroin would be stolen or go missing
                            because nobody knows about it and I do not think anyone would take the
                            items away. On previous occasions, I have forgotten to take out the
                            motorbike key and left it on the bike after parking it and left for
                            work. I had not met with any issues of theft of my motorbike or missing
                            items from the motorbike while I am in Singapore. On previous three
                            occasions, I also put the Heroin in the basket in front of my motorbike
                            as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    To ensure that the contents in the plastic bag are still intact, I
                            would check by opening up the plastic bag to see before I hand it over
                            to the recipient. For this time round, I opened up the purple plastic
                            bag to check the contents inside it once I reached back at my motorbike
                            which was parked at deck 4A of the multi-storey carpark at Blk 428 and
                            429 Woodlands. I opened up the plastic bag and saw that there were still
                            four newspaper bundles inside and I knew that all the four bundles of
                            Heroin were still there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 2nd Accused’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The 2nd Accused did not deny that he was trafficking diamorphine. His defence
                    to the charge against him was that he did not know that the quantity of
                    diamorphine he trafficked would attract the death penalty, and he did not intend
                    to traffic that quantity of diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     When he made his defence during the trial, he admitted that he had not been
                    truthful about the manner in which he delivered heroin to the 1st Accused. He
                    admitted that the practice was that he would receive the packets of heroin in
                    Johore and conceal them in his motorcycle. He would then bring the heroin
                    packets into Singapore and deliver them to the 1st Accused. He had lied that the
                    packets were delivered to him in Woodlands because after he was arrested, he was
                    told that he could face the death penalty. He added that sometime in late April
                    2012, two weeks before his arrest, he had asked ‘Ah Zhor’
                    about bringing drugs into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Subsequently they met, and Ah Zhor handed to him two bundles and
                    told him that he would be paid RM$500 for delivering each packet. Ah Zhor also
                    told him that the penalty for delivering them would not be the death penalty,
                    but eight to ten years imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> He trusted Ah Zhor and made the first delivery of two packets on 9
                    or 10 May 2012. He did not know at that time whether trafficking was punishable
                    by death in Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> (he only came to know about it on 28 May 2012 when his cautioned
                    statement was recorded).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second delivery involved three packets which were handed to him by Ah
                    Zhor’s runner. The second delivery took place four to five days after
                    the first delivery. Four packets were delivered on the third delivery about a
                    week before the fourth delivery on 24 May 2012 when he was arrested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> All the deliveries were made to the 1st Accused. The packets
                    delivered in the first three deliveries were similar to the packets seized from
                    the fourth delivery. He did not examine or weigh any of the packets he
                    delivered. Under cross-examination he agreed with the prosecutor that there was
                    no real agreement between him and Ah Zhor that he would only be required to
                    deliver amounts of heroin which did not attract the death penalty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> With respect to the fourth delivery, Ah Zhor called him on 23 May
                    2012 and told him that the delivery was to be made to the recipient of the third
                    delivery. The four packets were handed to him in the purple plastic bag and he
                    provided the white plastic bag that was seized.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     During his examination-in-chief, his counsel referred him to para 10 of his
                    investigation statement of 30 May 2012 where it stated that Ah Zhor told him
                    that at most he would go to prison for six or seven years if he was caught,
                    rather than the eight to ten years he had mentioned in court. He explained that
                    there was this discrepancy because he had given the wrong information during the
                    recording of the statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> However, when it was pointed out that it had been put to the
                    recording officer ASP Eugene Tan that the 2nd Accused had actually said eight to
                    ten years imprisonment,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> the 2nd Accused admitted that he could not recall whether he had
                    given the wrong information or he was misunderstood.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the 2nd Accused’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The 2nd Accused’s twofold defence was detailed in his closing
                    submissions at para 10:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.1  He did not know that the quantity of the diamorphine which he had in

                            known, he would not have done so and therefore could not have intended

                            attract capital punishment). Hence, he did not know, or could not have
                            reasonably suspected, any excess diamorphine which he was in fact
                            carrying at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The 2nd Accused had made it very clear that he did not know about the death
                    penalty when he delivered the heroin to the 1st Accused. His counsel had asked
                        him:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">…You were aware at that time there is a punishment of death
                            penalty in Singapore for drug trafficking and trafficking in heroin
                            without authorisation. Correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did not know.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Counsel appeared to be taken by surprise and asked again:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, Mr Yu, listen to my question carefully. Did know [<em>sic</em>] there was a punishment of death penalty in
                            Singapore in 2012? That do you know of this in 2012?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did not know.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Counsel then asked a third time:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You did not know in Singapore that if you are caught for drug
                            trafficking, you can actually in some situation be in s---be liable to
                            suffer a death penalty?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I did not know.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The prosecutor also went through this with him in
                            cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay, so up to the 24th of May 2012, Mr Yu, you confirm that you did
                            not know importing or trafficking in heroin could carry the death
                            penalty?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     He made his position clear beyond doubt that he did not know about the death
                    penalty until he was informed about it on 28 May 2012 when his cautioned
                    statement was recorded. Ah Zhor’s assurance, that if he was caught he
                    would not face the death penalty but would be imprisoned, must be taken in the
                    context that it was made in relation to the first delivery of two packets on 9
                    or 10 May 2012. The 2nd Accused did not ask Ah Zhor if the assurance applied to
                    deliveries of greater numbers of packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The conclusion to be drawn was that when he delivered the four packets on 24
                    May 2012, he simply did not know that drug trafficking is punishable with death.
                    He was not mistaken or misled into thinking that the death penalty did not apply
                    – he simply did not know about the death penalty. Since he did not
                    know about the death penalty, the quantity of diamorphine would be of no
                    significance to him because he believed that he would not be punished with death
                    regardless of the amount of diamorphine he delivered. That disposed of the first
                    limb of his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The alternate line of defence was raised against the contingency that the
                    court found that the 2nd Accused knew about the death penalty. On the evidence
                    referred to at [31] above, there was no basis for finding that he only intended
                    to traffic a non-capital amount of diamorphine. The simple truth was that he did
                    not say that he knew about the death penalty and thought that it would not
                    apply. In all his evidence, he had not said that he was told by Ah Zhor that
                    delivering four packets would not set off the death penalty. He had not done
                    anything to ensure that he was ‘safe’ with four packets.
                    This militated against his argument that his intention was to only traffic an
                    amount of drugs which fell below the critical threshold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the circumstances, I found the 2nd Accused guilty on the charge he faced
                    and convicted him thereon. On the issue of sentencing, the prosecution accepted
                    that he was a courier, but the Public Prosecutor was not issuing a certificate
                    under s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA because he had not
                    rendered substantive assistance to the CNB. His counsel accepted that decision.
                    In the circumstances, I imposed the death penalty on the 2nd Accused.</p>
