She acknowledged that she had received fees as a director. Her position was that these were monies which the Husband, as the controller of the company, gave to her for the expenses of the household of about $1,500 per month.

</div> I noted that these sums, which were attributable to her fees as a director of CFPL, indicated that she was receiving more than the $1,500 per month that she claimed were given to her for household expense.

His further claim that the Wife was a businesswomen as she was involved in two other companies was disproved by his own evidence, which showed that the Wife’s involvement in these two companies had ceased a number of years before marriage.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that this was a traditional marriage where the Wife was the keeper of the hearth and main child-carer rather than a dual-income marriage where both spouses were working and able to make financial contributions to the household. As the Wife had been working during the earlier part of the marriage but not the later and larger part of the marriage, I had regard to the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) as well as the case precedents prior to these two cases in deciding the division of the assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ascertainment of assets forming the matrimonial pool </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Next, I had to ascertain the assets which formed the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the course of the proceedings, I found that there were serious issues of credibility arising from the Husband’s position on his assets and means. I deal with each disputed asset in turn. I believe that the main issue in this appeal by the Husband is my decision to include the net equity of the matrimonial home at D Road at a value of $2,341,391.48 (see [27]–[36] below) within the matrimonial asset pool. I declined to deduct an outstanding mortgage loan amount of $1,091,625.14 when determining the net equity of the property to be included in the matrimonial asset pool. This was a further loan for “personal use” secured on the matrimonial home, for which no information was given by the Husband on how he had used the monies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 One of the Husband’s main arguments was that properties acquired by him and in his sole name during marriage should not be included in the matrimonial pool for division because the Wife had made no contributions toward the purchase of these properties nor visited or stayed in any of them. This argument was premised on a mistaken notion of matrimonial property, which in the light of section 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed), includes “property acquired by <span class="font-italic">either </span>or both spouses’ personal efforts during the course of their marriage” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 11 (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue) at para 130.806). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">BL property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Husband purchased a property in the [BL] cluster house development in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (“the BL Property”) in 2012, which he claimed to have then sub-sold to one [GS] pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated 13 April 2013 (“the BL SPA”).

This explanation does not square with the fact that under the BL SPA, GS was to bear all instalment payments, which were to be paid to the developer through the Husband. In addition, the BL SPA provided that all profit and loss in the property were to be borne by GS. In other words, GS purportedly took on all the benefits and burdens of ownership without making any payment at all to the Husband for over three years.

As I had already decided to include the value of Husband’s one-third share in the Joint SCB account ($477,716.80 as at 4 November 2013) in the matrimonial asset pool (see [42] below) and as the inclusion of the whole of the $244,353.17 could lead to double-counting, I reduced the latter amount by one-third to arrive at the approximate figure of $162,902 to be included separately as part of the Husband’s assets. I did this as the Husband would, in all probability, have drawn on part of the $244,353.17 (which I estimated at two-thirds) from the time of deposit of these monies in July 2013 and November 2013 for his business purposes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">D Road property and concealment of Mortgage One loan account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I now turn to the parties’ matrimonial home at D Road.

This was a further loan for “personal use” secured on the matrimonial home, for which no information was given by the Husband on how he had used the monies.

</div> The bank statements revealed that the consolidated mortgage loan statements showing all three loan accounts were addressed solely to the Husband and sent to his business address and not the matrimonial home at D Road. The Husband thus could not claim to have forgotten about this third loan under the Mortgage One loan account when he filed his first affidavit of assets and means of 28 March 2014. Being a businessman and well aware of the need for cash flow to meet recurring monthly obligations, he could not possibly have forgotten this third loan account for which he was paying and would have to continue to pay around $6,650 per month on top of the $7,300 per month for the housing loans under the SCB loan accounts ending 095 and 109 (see [28(c)] above). The irresistible inference was that the Husband had deliberately failed to disclose the Mortgage One loan account to avoid having to account for his use of the mortgage monies, and to give the misleading impression that the total outstanding loan of about $2.61m as at 21 January 2014 was purely a housing related loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The next question was the value of the net equity of the D Road property to be included into the matrimonial pool.

</div> (comprising all three SCB loans, including the Mortgage One loan). This position was untenable as the Mortgage One loan had been borrowed for the Husband’s personal use and he had not accounted for the use of these monies. After the existence of the account was belatedly disclosed at the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Husband, although given an opportunity to clarify the use of the monies obtained through this third loan, failed to provide any explanation or account of the use of the loan monies or the assets acquired therewith. The failure by the Husband to disclose the Mortgage One loan was clearly not inadvertent. Together with the lack of information or clarification on the use of the loan monies, this meant that there was no basis for me to deduct the outstanding Mortgage One loan monies in calculating the net equity of the Boundary Road matrimonial home. I thus declined to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In reaching this conclusion, I acknowledged that the Wife, as the co-owner of the D Road property, had signed the facility letter dated 2 May 2012 for the Mortgage One loan.

</div> The fact remains that the facility letter expressly stated that the loan was for personal use rather than for the property. I accepted the Wife’s assertion that although she would have signed the facility letter, she did not realise that there was a third loan under the Mortgage One loan account of about $1.33m and did not know what the monies had been used for. Her lack of awareness of the Mortgage One loan account was evidenced by her acceptance throughout the proceedings of the Husband’s position that there were only two mortgages secured on the D Road property. In her first affidavit of assets and means, for instance, she said that the amount which the Husband paid towards the mortgage loans of the D Road property was “unknown” to her.

</div> The figures plainly did not add up. Based on his declared income, the Husband could not have been able to service the monthly mortgage payments for the three Standard Chartered Bank loans secured on the D Road property, which totalled $13,950 ($7,300 for the two earlier SCB loans plus $6,650 for the Mortgage One loan). On top of that, he was paying monthly maintenance of about $2,650 for the Wife and the son, his personal expenses, the household expenses for the D Road home (where his mother and sister lived), and the mortgage payments for his other properties.

The Husband, instead of addressing these concerns directly, merely referred me to a letter dated 3 May 2017 from his accountant, which baldly stated: “Directors have an amount of $650,952. This item relates to the amount due to Directors.”

</div> No clarification was provided on the amounts due to each of the two directors, why these payments were to be made and why they were due. In the light of the Husband’s silence and non-answer on this issue, I drew the inference that, at the very least, the majority of the payables due to the directors of CFPL were due to him, as he was the sole shareholder and executive director of the company. However, I did not regard the $650,952 as an asset due to the Husband to be added to the pool. This was because CFPL had been making losses, based on its financial statements for the financial years 2011 to 2013,

Accordingly, I assessed that it was preferable to take this amount of $650,952 in the round when deciding on the division of assets.

In addition, and as noted above at [49], the Husband also redeemed the mortgage of the F Road flat in October 2012. Although this point was not raised by him, I took into account, in the round, the possibility that these redemption monies may have come from the Mortgage One loan taken in May 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Wife did contribute to the purchase price of the F Road flat through her CPF monies of $135,788.14, which was about 35% of the total contributions towards the property by both parties of $387,904.57.

</div> This meant that her share of the $650,000 value of the flat was $227,500. Added together with her other contributions to the matrimonial pool of $70,934 (comprising her CPF monies and the monies in her POSB account), her direct contribution to the matrimonial pool was $298,434, or 6.55% of the overall matrimonial pool of $4,556,337. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I was aware of the need to discount the Wife’s direct financial contributions because she had stopped working sometime during the marriage to look after the son, and the contributions that she made towards the F Road flat through the use of her CPF monies came from the director’s fees which she received in her nominal role as a director of CFPL. These monies were household expenses rather than salary. Hence, it would not be entirely accurate to characterise all of the payments made from the Wife’s CPF monies as the Wife’s own direct financial contributions to the marriage. In substance, this was a single income marriage since at least 1999, some 18 years ago. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It was clear that insofar as indirect contributions were concerned, when the Wife was working, she would have contributed to the household financial expenses. More significantly, after the son was adopted, she was the main care-giver for the son, who was 16 years old when I heard the matter, and the primary spouse managing and taking care of the household needs. It follows that I rejected the Husband’s position that he did the housework, cleaning and washing, prepared meals for the family and child, and was the parent who was taking care of the son’s needs and performance in school, including giving him tuition.

</div> These assertions were implausible as the Husband was an active businessman who had many business interests to handle. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the parties had a maid to assist them with the household chores. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Persistent non-disclosure by the Husband and risk of double counting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I also had regard to the persistent non-disclosure by the Husband of his assets and means. I will just highlight the SCB E-Saver account and the Mortgage One loan account which were deliberately not disclosed by him until well into the hearing of the ancillary matters in November 2016, and only at the court’s direction. At the same time, I was mindful not to double-count the Husband’s assets and considered the possibility that the assets acquired after the Mortgage One loan was taken in May 2012 may have been purchased using the monies disbursed under this loan. In this regard, I noted that all of the Husband’s interests in real properties (leaving aside those which he purchased with the Wife) were acquired before 2012, save for the BL property. All the properties, apart from the initial deposit, were acquired with bank loans secured on each of those properties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the division of matrimonial pool</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Boey v Sia Hee Soon</span> [2012] 3 SLR 402. Steven Chong J (as he then was) observed at [34] that, from his review of the cases, the proportion awarded to homemaker wives who had made modest financial contribution to marriages lasting 17 to 35 years with children ranged between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets. At [35] Chong J observed that the exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife was less than 35%, typically involved cases where the total pool of matrimonial assets had been very substantial in excess of $100m. In those exceptional circumstances, the apportionment to the wife had nevertheless been substantial in absolute terms. Taking into account all factors in the round, and bearing in mind the value of the assets in the matrimonial pool, the fact that the Wife had made some direct financial contributions to the pool (albeit qualified by comments at [56] above), the Husband’s demonstrated proclivity to be less than open about his income and assets, and the concern not to double count, I held that it was just and equitable to award to the Wife 45% of the assets in the matrimonial pool, giving a ratio of 45:55 in favour of the Husband.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Orders made on division of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 To execute the division of the matrimonial assets, I made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband and Wife were to retain the assets in their sole names, which were worth $1,494,012 and $70,934, respectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Husband was, within three months of the date of my order, to transfer his estate and title in the F Road flat valued at $650,000 to the Wife without consideration and without refund of the Husband’s CPF monies to his CPF account. The Wife was to bear the costs and expenses of the transfer. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The value of the Wife’s share in the D Road property was therefore $1,329,417 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, her proportion of the matrimonial pool of $2,050,351.65 less the value of the assets in her sole name and the value of the F Road flat). I therefore ordered that this was the amount which the Husband was to pay the Wife if he wished to take over her estate and title in the D Road property (less the Wife’s half-share of the valuation costs for the F Road flat and the D Road property). The Husband was to inform the Wife within six weeks of the date of my order whether he wished to take over the D Road property. The costs and expenses of the transfer to the Husband were to be borne by him. The order provided for the payment logistics. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the Husband wished to sell the D Road property, he was to do so within six months of the date of my order under a sale and purchase agreement (albeit that completion may take place three months after the date of that agreement). The Wife was to transfer her estate and title in the property to the purchaser(s) nominated by the Husband upon payment to her of $1,329,314 (less the Wife’s half-share of the valuation costs for the F Road flat and the D Road property). The costs and expenses of sale were to be borne by the Husband, who was to have sole conduct of the sale. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Given my orders on the division of the matrimonial pool, particularly the fact that the Wife would be receiving monies of about $1.3m and have shelter in the form of the D Road flat, I made no order for her maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Wife was represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. After hearing counsel for the Wife, I ordered the Husband to pay the Director, Legal Aid costs of $12,000 (inclusive of disbursements). This order was justified, in my assessment, because most of the hearings were spent on extracting information from Husband that he failed to properly disclose. The proceedings were unnecessarily prolonged and complicated by Husband’s non-compliance with his duty of full and frank disclosure, his deliberate concealment of facts, and his unwillingness to provide information, even when directed by the court. There was much work that the Wife’s counsel had to do, and did do, to sort out the issues and to assist the court in ascertaining the assets in the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Foo Tuat Yien <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh &amp; Co) for the plaintiff;<br/>Sarbrinder Singh s/o Naranjan Singh (<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Sanders Law LLC</span>) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
