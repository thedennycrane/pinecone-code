</strong>
</p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1 The Accused pleaded guilty to 22 charges,

comprising 20 charges of criminal breach of trust as an agent under section 409 Penal

Code, one charge under section 47(1)(b) Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious

Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act ("Confiscation of Benefits Act") involving

the transfer of property which directly represented the benefits of his criminal conduct

and one charge of agreeing to give gratification to another person to screen himself from

legal punishment, an offence under section 214 Penal Code.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2 He also admitted the offences in 1,187 other charges

under section 409 Penal Code, one charge under section 47(1)(b) Confiscation of Benefits

Act, one charge under section 214 Penal Code and one charge under section 25(2) Money

Changing and Remittance Businesses Act and consented that these offences be taken into

consideration for the purpose of sentence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3 Section 409 Penal Code provides for imprisonment for

life or for up to 10 years and a discretionary fine. Section 47(6) Confiscation of

Benefits Act provides for a fine not exceeding $200,000 or for imprisonment for a term not

exceeding seven years or both. The relevant limb in Section 214 Penal Code provides for

imprisonment of up to three years and a discretionary fine.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">THE STATEMENT OF FACTS</font></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4 The Accused and his 75 year old grandmother were

partners in Wen Long Money Changer operating in City Plaza, Geylang Road. The business was

managed solely by the Accused. The business was originally involved in money changing

only. On 8 April 2000, it expanded its scope to include money remittance services for

Malaysian Ringgit, Indonesian Ruppiah and Chinese Renminbi when it was issued a remittance

licence by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5 A customer who wished to remit money overseas would

enquire about the relevant exchange rate and, if it was acceptable to him, would hand over

the money to the Accused who would record the details of the transaction and issue him a

remittance receipt. Such receipts would acknowledge the amount of Singapore dollars

received from the customer and the exchange rate used. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6 However, the Accused did no remittance himself but

conducted all remittance transactions through other licensed remittance agents. He would

fax Wen Long’s remittance application forms to such agents and deposit the cash

collections directly into the agents’ bank accounts. The agents would then remit the

money on behalf of Wen Long via telegraphic transfers and other means to the overseas

beneficiaries.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">7 The Accused was a compulsive gambler who betted

heavily on horses, soccer results, 4-Digits and Toto. His losses kept mounting and, by May

2001, his gambling debts were more than half a million dollars. In desperation, the

Accused decided to use the cash collected by Wen Long to settle his gambling debts. To do

this, he had to generate a higher volume of business so that there would be more cash

collections. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8 In June 2001, the Accused devised the following scheme

to attract business to Wen Long. He offered exchange rates which were better than those

offered in the market. At the material times, the market exchange rates for Renminbi were

between RMB 4.46 and 4.5 to S$1 but the Accused’s rates were between RMB 4.8 and 4.95

to S$1. He also waived the S$20 commission for each transaction. Customers of Wen Long

therefore got more RMB for their S$ for remittance than if they were to use other agents.

Naturally, a large number of Chinese workers from the People’s Republic of China

(‘PRC’) flocked to Wen Long to remit their money to their homeland. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9 Between June 2001 and January 2002, money was pouring

into Wen Long at the daily rate of between S$300,000 and S$500,000. The Accused had to

engage three persons to help him receive this daily stream of cash. However, he decided

the exchange rate to offer the customers and he issued the receipts to them. The receipts

would state the market exchange rate instead of the higher one offered by him. They would

therefore state that the cash in S$ received was more than that actually handed over to

Wen Long. He was afraid that if the actual exchange rate offered by him was reflected in

the receipts, his auditors or the Monetary Authority of Singapore might ask him to explain

how he was able to sustain the high exchange rate. He also dealt personally with the

remittance agents that Wen Long used.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10 The Accused knew that the above scheme would result

in exchange rate losses for Wen Long. He therefore imposed the condition that remittances

would only be effected one month from the date of collection from the customers instead of

the usual three to four working days from the date of collection. This meant that the

beneficiaries would receive the cash later. This would enable the Accused to roll-over the

funds. He would use the current collections for himself and then use subsequent

collections to pay for the earlier collections when the remittance date was due. By this

‘Rob Peter to pay Paul’ method, he appeared to be fulfilling his obligations to

his customers and could therefore avoid detection. He would also use a black marker to

obliterate the date on the remitters’ application forms before faxing them to his

agents. This was done so that the agents would not become suspicious about the delay in

the transactions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11 The Accused was thus using part of the current cash

collections to fulfil his earlier obligations and spending the rest on his gambling

addiction and a lavish lifestyle. By September 2001, he had used about S$3 million

belonging to his customers to settle his gambling debts. Between June 2001 and January

2002, he was spending an average of some S$250,000 each weekend on bets placed here as

well as in Malaysia and in Batam. He also began to frequent nightspots where he would

spend lavishly on himself and his friends and give large tips to those serving and

entertaining him. In January 2002, he asked a friend to rent an apartment in a condominium

in Geylang. He paid the rental and furnished the apartment. He brought nightclub hostesses

there.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12 The Accused had no other source of income. His

extravagant lifestyle and his gambling addiction were funded solely by the money

misappropriated from Wen Long’s cash collections. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13 On 23 January 2002, the Accused was told by one Ivan

Teo that a few PRC nationals who were customers of Wen Long had lodged police reports

against him as their money was not received in the PRC after the one-month contractual

period. Ivan Teo suggested that the Accused leave Singapore for Malaysia, assuring him

that he would be able to arrange transport and obtain a Malaysian identity card for him. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14 Later that day, the Accused met up with Ivan Teo and

one Jimmy Ang. He agreed to pay S$100,000 to Ivan Teo and S$3,000 to Ivan Teo’s

informer. He also agreed to pay Jimmy Ang S$25,000 to bring him to the hiding place in

Malaysia.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">15 In the morning of 26 January 2002, the Accused

returned to Wen Long to take the cash collections amounting to S$582,000. He handed the

said sum to one Tai Choon Yew and instructed him to pay Ivan Teo and Jimmy Ang as agreed,

to pay S$100,000 to settle his gambling debts and to hand over S$300,000 to his wife. The

remaining amount was entrusted to Tai Choon Yew for safekeeping. The Accused also took

RM12,000 from Wen Long with him. He left two notes written in Chinese addressed to his

family stating his shame and remorse. That night, he fled to Malaysia as arranged. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">16 His family persuaded him to return and he did so on

28 January 2002. That same day, a Chinese foreign worker lodged a report at the Bedok

Police Station stating that money she had entrusted to Wen Long on 21 December 2001 to

remit to her family in the PRC was not received by her family. The Accused surrendered

himself at the Bedok Police Station on 29 January 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">17 The transfer of the S$582,000 to Tai Choon Yew formed

the subject matter of the charge under the Confiscation of Benefits Act while the

agreement to pay Ivan Teo the total of S$103,000 in consideration of the arrangement for

the Accused to leave the country and thus be screened from legal punishment gave rise to

the charge under section 214 Penal Code.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">18 A total of S$905,398.93 was recovered by the

Commercial Affairs Department. Out of this sum, S$26,032.80 came from the surrender of

four insurance policies by the Accused.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">ANTECEDENTS</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">19 The Accused had no previous criminal record.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3">THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE</font></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">20 The Prosecution submitted that this case called for

"a severe sentence to show the Court’s abhorrence of the nefarious deeds of the

Accused". The 30 year old Accused had defrauded over a thousand persons, most of whom

were foreign workers, of some S$8.7 million of their hard-earned money. The money was

taken by him "purely to sustain his hedonistic lifestyle and gambling habit".

The amount recovered by the investigators meant that the victims would receive only about

ten cents for every dollar lost. The crimes were committed with premeditation and over

some seven months. The Accused had also taken steps to avoid detection of his fraudulent

conduct. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">21 Five victim impact statements were tendered. In these

statements, the foreign workers involved spoke about families in need waiting for the

money that should have been remitted to take care of medical, housing, educational and

other family expenses. Some of the workers received their salaries once a year according

to their contracts and had therefore lost a whole year’s wages.</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">22 Various cases decided here and elsewhere were

cited for my guidance. The Gemini Chit Fund case in 1973, described by Choor Singh J as

the "swindle of the century", was one of them. There Abdul Gaffar Mohamed

Ibrahim, the Managing Director of Gemini Chit Fund Corporation Ltd, pleaded guilty to

three charges of criminal breach of trust of S$3.2 million under section 409 Penal Code

and was sentenced to life imprisonment. There were 40 to 50 thousand members of the public

participating in the chit fund and the loss was estimated at S$50 million. </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">23 The Prosecution in the present case argued that the

Accused should receive in total more than the maximum that the District Court may impose

in any one case, that is, 14 years imprisonment. That was the reason for invoking section

186(2) Criminal Procedure Code to have this case transferred to the High Court. I was

urged to order more than two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively as there is no

rule precluding the Court from making such an order (see <i><b>Maideen Pillai v PP</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9784&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 161</a>). The Prosecution left it to the Court to decide what the aggregate term

of imprisonment ought to be.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE MITIGATION</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">24 The two notes that the Accused left for his family

before he fled the country showed the pain, shame and remorse that he felt. Having made

good his escape, he returned soon thereafter on his own volition after speaking to his

family and surrendered himself. He was forthright and complete in his disclosure of all

his transactions and gave the investigators the relevant documents and the identities of

the persons involved. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">25 The Accused pleaded guilty at the first available

opportunity and admitted all the other charges taken into consideration. He was also a

first offender.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">26 He did not set out to misappropriate the

workers’ money from the beginning. When his gambling became a "desperate

compulsion" and he sunk deeper in debts and ran out of people to borrow money from,

he decided to "borrow" money from Wen Long’s customers by the roll-over

scheme described earlier.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">27 The Accused also surrendered four insurance polices

before their maturity dates for S$26,032.80 to help pay back the victims. He "had not

squirreled away any money for later use or concealed any part of it".</font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">28 I was urged not to pass a crushing sentence

thereby depriving him of all hope.</font>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">THE SENTENCES</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">29 Before I sentenced the Accused, I said the following

:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">"1. I begin by repeating what Chan Sek Keong J said

  in <i>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4791&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 1 MLJ 321</a> at 323, that "in an offence

  like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being

  equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of

  the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court." The Accused here

  embezzled some $8.768 million within three months. The total amount involved in all the

  charges (ie those proceeded with and those taken into consideration for the purpose of

  sentence) is not the largest in the history of financial crime but it is nonetheless a

  very substantial sum. So far, approximately $905,000 have been recovered, constituting

  only slightly more than 10% of the total loss. </font></p>
<p align="justify">2. This is not even a case of an offender coming across a huge sum of

  money by chance or in the course of his work and, being in dire need, not being able to

  resist the temptation to help himself to some of it. The Accused here unleashed an

  unscrupulous scheme on the unsuspecting foreign workers by offering unrealistically high

  exchange rates to create an unceasing stream of cash to feed his unmanageable gambling

  addiction and his uncontrollable avarice while taking pains to ensure that his misdeeds

  remain undetected. He was the writer, director and lead actor in this unmitigated tragedy.

  How do we sympathize with him? Let us not count the ways because there is none.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Accused’s criminal conduct has claimed more than a thousand

  victims. These are people who have come to our country to work and to earn an honest

  living for themselves and for those they care for in their homeland. While they laboured,

  the Accused plundered, what they painstakingly gathered, he wantonly scattered, what they

  saved, he squandered. These workers’ anguish is all the more severe as the money they

  lost represents, for some of them, a whole year’s wages and is badly needed by their

  dependants. The consequences of his crimes are far-reaching and adversely affect a great

  number of people.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The Accused has also done a great disservice to our country. A

  country’s reputation may be soiled when its locals take dishonestly the spoils of the

  foreigners’ toils.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The Accused has pleaded guilty and has saved time and expense but as

  I have said in <i>PP v Teo Cheng Kiat</i> [Criminal Case 42 of 2000], such a plea in the

  face of overwhelming documentary evidence does not carry the same weight it would have in

  cases which may be more difficult for the Prosecution to prove. The Accused is also a

  first offender only in the sense that he was not caught and convicted earlier for the many

  incidents of misappropriation of the workers’ funds and, like Teo Cheng Kiat,

  "he has set a dubious record in the criminal annals upon his dramatic first

  entry". He did flee the country when he realized that his arrest was imminent but, to

  his and his family’s credit, he returned voluntarily soon thereafter, surrendered

  himself and admitted his wrongdoings to the police. He also assisted the authorities in

  their investigations.</p>
<p align="justify">6. When Choor Singh J sentenced Abdul Gaffar Mohamed Ibrahim in the

  Gemini Chit Fund case in 1973 to life imprisonment for criminal breach of trust, that

  effectively meant a maximum sentence of 20 years. Since <i>Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v

  PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11177&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 643</a>, life imprisonment means incarceration for the remaining natural

  life of the prisoner. The $3.2 million involved in the Gemini Chit Fund case 30 years ago

  would obviously be equivalent to a much higher amount today. The loss was estimated to be

  around $50 million then in any event. The number of victims there was also considerably

  higher. Until this spate of offences, the Accused had no criminal record. Whether his case

  will be regarded as the "swindle of the (new) century" remains to be seen but I

  do not think any arguments for the maximum sentence here would be too compelling and,

  indeed, the Prosecution has not suggested that life imprisonment would be appropriate

  here.</p>
<p align="justify">7. A good analogy to this case is <i>Teo Cheng Kiat’s</i> case

  which concerns criminal breach of trust under section 408 Penal Code, a provision which

  carries a maximum imprisonment term of seven years to which a fine may be added. There, I

  sentenced Teo to six years imprisonment in respect of each of the ten charges proceeded

  with and ordered four of the sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 24 years

  imprisonment. I note of course that the total amount involved in that case was about $35

  million (of which some $21 million were recovered) and that the defalcation there covered

  a 13 year span. There was however only one corporate victim involved and its financial

  soundness was not adversely affected.</p>
<p align="justify">8. What really matters in cases of multiple charges such as this is the

  aggregate term of imprisonment derived from the number of consecutive sentences. In view

  of the many victims here, it is appropriate to order more than two imprisonment terms to

  run consecutively. In the circumstances, I sentence Mr Lam Chen Fong to seven years

  imprisonment in respect of each of the section 409 Penal Code charges, three years
