</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 This is an appeal against the decision of the Deputy Registrar

in SIC 602020/2001 in which the Defendants applied under O 18, r 19 or the inherent

jurisdiction of the Court to strike out the Plaintiffs’ claim. On 17 October 2001 the

Deputy Registrar had allowed the application and ordered the claim struck out. He also

ordered costs of the action, fixed at $18,000, to be paid by the Plaintiffs to the

Defendants.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The appeal was heard on 28 January 2002 at the end of which I allowed

the appeal against the claim being struck out, but instead ordered certain parts of the

statement of claim to be struck out. I also set aside the order for costs below and

awarded the Plaintiffs costs of the appeal and the hearing below. In their notice of

appeal filed on 25 February, the Defendants stated that they were appealing against part

of my decision, as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The reinstatement of the action in Admiralty in Personam No. 600151

  of 2001 which was struck out by the Learned Deputy Registrar below, insofar as it relates

  to the causes of action based no breaches of 2 contracts of carriage contained in and/or

  evidenced by Bills of Lading Nos. SIN(BEL)/KNL-15 and SIN(BEL)/KNL-16 both dated 13 April

  2000, as pleaded in the Statement of Claim filed in the said action; and</p>
<p align="justify">2. Setting aside the order for costs below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I now give my grounds of decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Order 18, r 19 provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">19. —(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be

  struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or

  anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case

    may be;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action;

    or</p>
<p align="justify">(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be

  entered accordingly, as the case may be. </p>
<p align="justify">(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph

  (1)(a).</p>
<p align="justify">(3) This Rule shall, so far as applicable, apply to an originating

  summons and a petition as if the summons or petition, as the case may be, were a pleading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 The Defendants’ SIC recited that the claim (a) discloses no

reasonable cause of action; and/or (b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; and/or

(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; and/or (d) it is an

abuse of the process of the Court. It is supported by the affidavit, filed on 31 August

2001, of one Yong Por Kwong ("Yong"), the Insurance/Claims Manager of Samta

Shipmanagement Ptd Ltd who are the managers of the Defendants. In reply, the Plaintiffs

have filed two affidavits, the first by Teo Weng Kee ("Teo") on 8 October and

the second by S. Pattabiraman on 23 November 2001.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Ground (a) – no reasonable cause of action disclosed</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 (2) of O 18, r 19 expressly provides that no evidence shall be

admissible on an application under (1)(a). The Defendant must show that no cause of

action is disclosed on the face of the pleadings. I had earlier explained that I had

allowed the Defendants’ application in part and struck out some parts of the

Statement of Claim. After removing the parts struck out, the Statement of Claim (apart

from the prayers) would read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1. The Plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore and

  carry on business as bankers.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Defendants are and were at all material times the owners of the

  "Victoria Cob" of the port of Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">3. By a contract of carriage contained in and or evidenced by the

  undermentioned Bills of Lading (the "Bills of Lading"), the Defendants agreed to

  ship and carry a total of 508.312 metric tons of Crude Palm Oil (the "Cargo") on

  board the vessel "Victoria Cob" from Belawan, Indonesia, for carriage to and

  delivery at Kandla, India.</p>

  instead delivered the Cargo to person(s) who did not hold and or present and or have

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The Plaintiffs also filed Further and Better Particulars of the

Statement of Claim on 29 May 2001. The relevant particulars could be summarised as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) The party from which the Plaintiffs derived title so as to become

  owners of the Cargo was Ranchhoddas Purshottam Holdings Pte Ltd ("RPH").</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The contract pursuant to which the Plaintiffs derived title to the

  Cargo was in writing and contained in the following documents: (i) Joint-Credit Facilities

  letter from the Plaintiffs to RPH dated 18 August 1999; (ii) the acceptance by RPH dated

  24 August 1999; and (iii) the application by RPH to the Plaintiffs for

  collection/purchase/negotiation on 25 May 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The full circumstances under which the Plaintiffs became lawful

  holders of the Bills of Lading are as follows: RPH submitted the application for

  collection/purchase/negotiation together with the documents (i.e. bills of lading,

  commercial invoices, etc.) and the Plaintiffs subsequently purchased the said documents

  and made payment of US$185,533.88 to RPH by crediting the said sum to their account with

  the Plaintiffs on 25 May 2000, at which date the Plaintiffs would be entitled to immediate

  possession of the Cargo from the Defendants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 The Plaintiffs did not provide particulars to, <i>inter alia</i>, the

following two questions in respect of 5 of the Statement of Claim:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"(d) Identify the party who allegedly endorsed the Bills of Lading

  to the Plaintiffs and the date of such alleged endorsement.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) State the full circumstances including date and time under which

  the Bills of Lading were allegedly endorsed to the Plaintiffs"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Defendants obtained an order of court to compel the Plaintiffs to

provide replies to those particulars requested. In compliance with that order, the

Plaintiffs filed the following answers on 11 July 2001:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"(d) The Plaintiffs are not relying on endorsement to prove their

  title to sue.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) See answer to (d)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 That was the status of the Plaintiffs’ pleadings on 31 August

2001 when the Defendants filed the application to strike out the claim. The three

affidavits filed by the parties in relation to this matter have no relevance under ground

(a) and the Defendants can look only to the pleadings to show that there is no reasonable

cause of action disclosed therein. Although the Defendants appear to be relying on their

affidavit in respect of this ground, they cannot do so as it is expressly stated in O 18 r

19(2) that no evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(a). This

position has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <i>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee

Chong Jin &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 374</nobr>, at 19:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">19 In their application for striking out, the respondents relied on

  O.18, r.19(1)(a) as the ground in support of their application – that the writ of

  summons and statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action. According to O.18,

  r.19(2), no evidence shall be admissible on an application under O.18, r.19(1)(a). The

  only exception to this prohibition against adducing evidence is where there is an

  affidavit filed in support of the originating summons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The exception referred to in the last sentence relates to matters begun

by originating summons for which provision is made in O 18, r 19(3) and has no application

in a matter begun by writ, as is the present case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 Accordingly, the determination of the application under this ground

must rest solely on the pleadings. The cause of action is fully pleaded in the Statement

of Claim as clarified by the Further and Better Particulars filed on 29 May and 11 July

2001. The Plaintiffs have pleaded the contract, as evidenced by the two Bills of Lading

which the Plaintiffs had purchased from RPH. They had pleaded the Defendants’

breaches by their failure to deliver the cargoes against presentation of the bills. The

Plaintiffs have also pleaded that they had suffered damages as a consequence of those

breaches. In the circumstances, the Defendants’ application under ground (a) must

fail.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Grounds (b), (c) and (d)</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 In the affidavit filed by Yong on behalf of the Defendants, he said

that he had no personal knowledge of the material facts. His evidence in that respect was

based on his interpretation of the Bills of Lading and other documents obtained in

discovery. Yong pointed out that the shippers had endorsed the bills in blank and

delivered them to RPH. RPH then on-sold the cargos to Lanyard Foods Ltd. Subsequently RPH

delivered the bills to the Plaintiffs for collection/purchase/negotiation, without filling

in any name to the endorsement and it was still in blank. The Plaintiffs later filled in

the name of the State Bank of Saurashtra in India ("State Bank") and delivered

the bills to them, for collection by Lanyard Foods Ltd. However the bills were

subsequently returned to the Plaintiffs with the word "CANCELLED" stamped over

the endorsements to the State Bank. There were no endorsements on both bills by the State

Bank to the Plaintiffs. Yong concluded that the Plaintiffs were not the endorsees of the

Bills of Lading, which he said was consistent with the assertion in the Plaintiffs’

further particulars that they were not relying on the endorsements to prove their title to

sue. Yong said that in view of this, he was advised and believed that the Plaintiffs were

not the lawful holders of the Bills of Lading within the meaning of the Bills of Lading

Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 Counsel for the Defendants submitted that the Plaintiffs was not the

holder of the bills because they had been endorsed to the State Bank but the latter had

not endorsed them to the Plaintiffs when they were sent back to Singapore. Accordingly,

the Plaintiffs did not fall within the definition of "Holder of a Bill of

Lading" under s 5(2)(b) of the Bills of Lading Act ("the Act"). Therefore

the Plaintiffs had no rights under the bills and their action must fail.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 In the reply affidavit filed by Teo on behalf of the Plaintiffs, he

clarified that the Plaintiffs purchased the bills in May 2000 pursuant to a Joint Credit

Facility granted to RPH and their sister company Intermetallco Pte Ltd. The Plaintiffs had

credited into the account of RPH the sum of US$185,274.39 as payment. When the Plaintiffs

obtained the bills, they were already endorsed in blank by the shipper. Thus those bills

came into the Plaintiffs’ possession as bearer documents. Subsequently the Plaintiffs

tendered the shipping documents to the State Bank, the bankers of Lanyard Foods Ltd to

whom RPH had sold the cargo, to collect payment. To protect the Plaintiffs in the event

that the bills were lost in transit, the bills were endorsed to the State Bank. Teo said

that in the normal course of events, payment would have been received within 30 days.

However no payment was received from the State Bank on behalf of Lanyard Foods Ltd and on

10 October 2000 the Plaintiffs requested the State Bank to return the bills. This was done

on November 2000. After receipt the Plaintiffs stamped "CANCELLED" over the

endorsements in the bills to the State Bank.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 Counsel for the Plaintiffs firstly submitted that the

Plaintiffs’ cause of action had been made out on the pleadings and the Defendants

could not rely on the affidavits as a basis for striking out the action. Notwithstanding

this, he submitted that the Plaintiffs had an argument to the Defendants’ case that

the Plaintiffs were not the holder of the bills. He submitted that this was a bill

endorsed in blank by the shipper and the endorsee’s name (the State Bank) had been

filled in by the Plaintiffs for collection by the State Bank. When the purchaser did not

make payment the State Bank returned the bills to the Plaintiffs who promptly cancelled

the specific endorsement they had made. He submitted that the cancellation had the effect

of nullifying the original endorsement. He also submitted that s 5(2)(b) of the Act was

not to be interpreted in the manner that the Defendants' counsel had suggested.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 I can only conclude that there is a question of law that is not

altogether clear that has to be decided in order to determine whether the Plaintiffs

should succeed in their claim. That appears to be the only ground for this application.

Otherwise there is nothing in the affidavits setting out any reason for characterising the

Plaintiffs’ claim as scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or for believing that it

would prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action, or that it is otherwise

an abuse of the process of court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 In a determination under ground (a), the court will only look at the

pleadings and decide whether there is a cause of action. The court will not embark on a

detailed inquiry into the documents and facts of the case. In <i>Gabriel Peter &amp;

Partners v Wee Chong Jin &amp; Ors</i>, the Court of Appeal said at 18: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">18 In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of

  striking out should be invoked. This was the view taken by Lindley MR in <i>Hubbuck &amp;

  Sons v Wilkinson, Heywood and Clark</i> [1899] 1 QB 86 at p 91. It should not be exercised

  by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to

  see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been

  that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the

  court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as

  to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will

  obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 Having failed under ground (a), what the Defendants appear to be

doing is to show by the very same minute and protracted examination of the documents and

facts that the Court of Appeal had referred to in <i>Gabriel Peter's</i> case, that the

Plaintiffs’ case is hopeless and therefore it falls within grounds (b), (c) and (d).

In my view the Defendants are not entitled to do that for two reasons. Firstly, this would

permit them to get around the prohibition against evidence in ground (a). Secondly, I

cannot see how where there is a bona fide dispute as to the law, the claim can be

considered scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, or would prejudice, embarrass or delay the

fair trial or would be an abuse of court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 In view of this, the Defendants’ application to strike out the

claim must fail. It appears to me that if what they seek is a preliminary determination on

a point of law, the appropriate application would be one under O 14, r 12.</p>
