<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11.       At the end of the trial I convicted the three of them on all the charges they faced except the charge against Yong Ah Lai for bringing T into Singapore.  Hilan and Yong Ah Lai have not appealed against the convictions and sentences, but Velu has appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed on him.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12.       Against this backdrop, these grounds will deal only with Velu’s case.  The evidence adduced at the trial which relate to the charge he faced will be referred to.</span></p>

<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14.       The offence referred to is rape as defined in s 375(e), that a man commits rape against a woman if he has sexual intercourse with her, with or without her consent, when she is under 14 years of age.</span></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">The background facts</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15.       T stayed with her parents in Muar.  Marni was their neighbour.  Marni and Vijay approached T’s mother and proposed that T come to Singapore with them to work as a house maid.  After thinking over the matter, T’s mother agreed.  On 3 May T left home with Marni and Vijay.  They spent a few days in Johore Baru, and entered Singapore on 9 May.  Yong Ah Lai, who is Marni’s husband, joined the group after they arrived in Singapore on 9 May.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16.       All of them checked into the Lai Ming Hotel at 424 Geylang Road.  From the next day on, T was made to offer her services as a prostitute in the backlanes of Geylang Road.  They were arrested by officers of the Anti-Vice Branch on 23 May.  Hilan was arrested separately on the same day, and the appellant was arrested on 25 May.</span></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">T’s evidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17.       On the day following her arrival in Singapore she started work as a prostitute.  She was with Vijay and Yong Ah Lai when Hilan came and became her first customer.  They had sex in a room, after which he gave her a tip of $4 and his telephone number.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18.       A few days later, she met Velu through Yong Ah Lai.  Her evidence was that “(o)nce Velu came into the picture, Velu started bringing me” to ply her trade.</span> <a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[1]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19.       Subsequently she met Hilan again.  On this occasion, she was at a backlane and Velu and Yong Ah Lai were standing nearby.  When Hilan approached her Velu went to speak with him.  After they spoke, Velu brought her and Hilan to a room and had sex while Velu waited outside.  Hilan paid $30 including $5 for the room, and Velu let her keep the balance $25.</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" title=""><font color="#0000ff">[2]</font></a></span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20.       On other occasions Velu would collect money from the customers and hand it over to her, and at other times he would collect the payment, pay for the room, and gave her the balance.</span> <a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[3]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">21.       T also remembered that Velu had visited the room at Lai Ming Hotel where she stayed with Vijay, Yong Ah Lai and Marni.  On that occasion Velu asked for her passport which he examined and returned.  After it was returned, she discovered that her identity card which was kept inside the passport had been removed.  Subsequently Velu brought the identity card back.  On another occasion, Velu bought a chain for her, and put it around her neck.</span> <a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[4]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Hilan’s evidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">22.       He admitted that he had sex with T on two occasions.  On the first occasion, Yong Ah Lai was involved.  He told him of the price for T’s services, arranged for the room, and received the payment.</span> <a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[5]</span></span></font></a></p>

<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Yong Ah Lai’s evidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">25.       He had known Velu since February/March 2002.  He knew that Velu frequented the places where the prostitutes were, and was friendly with them.  He introduced T to Velu while she was prostituting herself.  A few days later Velu went to his room at the Lai Ming Hotel. Velu looked at T’s passport and after he left, it was discovered that T’s identity card was missing from her passport.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26.       On the purchase of T’s chain, he suggested to T that she gave money to Velu to buy the chain for her and T told him that Velu had bought it for her.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">27.       Yong Ah Lai made statements to the police after his arrest.  One of those statements recorded on 6 June 2002</span> <a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[8]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">was admitted in evidence without objections from him.  In this statement, Yong Ah Lai was questioned about the appellant</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">Q1:       Can you tell me when did you actually get to know ‘Velu’?</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">A1:       It was sometime towards the end of February 2002 that I got to know ‘Velu’ at Geylang.  He was talking and joking to the prostitutes there.  I decided to talk to him.  I have seen him before on several occasions during my visits to Geylang.  On that day, when I spoke to him, I was asking him as to whether he could recommend any new girls that I could engage.  I would like to say that ‘Velu’ is always around the prostitutes there, he is quite well known among the Indian men there and they would call him ‘9’.  The prostitutes that he always hangs out with are Indians.  I do not know why he was called ‘9’ but whenever I was there, the people there would asked me if I was looking for ‘9’.</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">Q3:       Can you explain to me as to how did ‘Velu’ help you to take care of the Indian girl when you were not around?</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">A3:       I told ‘Velu’ to help me to take care of the Indian girl whenever I have to leave the place.  He agreed to do so.  I did not specifically tell ‘Velu’ what to do, I told him to be there and to keep an eye on the Indian girl.  When I returned back to the place, he would not tell me anything but asked me as to where I have gone.</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">Q8:       Can you tell me how many times did ‘Velu’ help you to take care of the Indian girl when she was prostituting herself?</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">A8:       Only 2 times.</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28.       When Velu cross-examined him on the statement, he explained that “Velu came to see me in the hotel.  So when I took the girl out, he accompanied me as well”</span> <a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[9]</span></span></font></a><span lang="EN-GB">, that “he came to visit me and then subsequently I brought the girl out and he followed me but I cannot remember the case.  On that occasion I was the one who brought the girl out and not him”,</span> <a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[10]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">that “(h)e did not help me in the work”,</span> <a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[11]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and that “I only asked him to help me for a short while when I go and buy things at the shops nearby and he helped me out of friendship.”</span> <a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[12]</span></span></font></a><span lang="EN-GB">  He clarified that he wanted Velu to be around and see that T did not talk or quarrel with the other prostitutes, but “I did not engage his service to procure customers.  I just want him to be there so that nothing will happen.”</span> <a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[13]</span></span></font></a><span lang="EN-GB">  The clarification is significant as it shows that Velu was not with Yong Ah Lai and T by chance, but that he was there to help ensure that there would be no interference with her activities.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">29.       That was not the first time Velu had helped him.  He said</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">While I was at Lorong 18, many Indians there bullied me.  They told me that since I was new there and I wanted to solicit customers for the prostitute, then I have to pay them $30 a day and I indeed gave them $30 a day.  These Indians were Indian nationals and they were also taking care of those prostitutes there.  If I did not give them money, they would bully me.  After I got to know Velu, Velu asked me why did I have to give these Indian nationals money because they were just the same as you, they were also procuring customers for their prostitutes.  As such, from then onwards, I stopped giving money to these Indian nationals and also because of that, I have faith in Velu.  That was why I asked him to take care of the Indian girl when I wasn’t around.</span> <a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[14]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">30.       Yong Ah Lai had made reference to Velu when he was questioned by SI Poh Boon Choon on the day he was arrested.  When the prosecution made reference to it in the opening address, he said that he did not make any oral statement to anyone</span> <a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[15]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and then he said that he only told the officer that he procured customers for T.</span> <a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[16]</span></span></font></a><span lang="EN-GB">  When SI Poh gave evidence on the taking of the statement, Yong Ah Lai contended that he did not say the things that were attributed to him.</span> <a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[17]</span></span></font></a><span lang="EN-GB">  He accepted that no inducement, threat, promise or oppression was employed,</span> <a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[18]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">but he alleged that “they have added the name Velu there and also said that I was the one who made arrangements, all these.  I never said all these.  They were just trying to frame me up by adding these words there.”</span> <a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[19]</span></span></font></a></p>

<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">38.       He confirmed that he bought the chain for T</span><a href="#_ftn26" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[26]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and that he helped Yong Ah Lai by speaking to the Indian nationals</span><a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[27]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">who were demanding payments from him.</span></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Padmanathan’s evidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">39.       Padmanathan’s full name is Padmanathan s/o Paramansivan.  He is a foreman of a lift company and was the only witness called by Velu.  He recalled Velu showing him T’s identity card that “He said that someone had brought the girl and left her at the place.  He said the girl was left at Geylang.  He said the girl appeared young”</span> <a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[28]</span></span></font></a> <span lang="EN-GB">and “I said that the girl is young and she should not be doing this.  I said that it’s not good for the girl to do this and I told him to do something good for the girl.</span> <a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29" title=""><font color="#0000ff"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[29]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">40.       The following came out during the brief cross-examination</span></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">Q         Did he tell you anything else?</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">A         He only said this, he did not say anything else.</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">Q         Did you say anything else to him apart from what you’ve told us?</span></font></p>
<p class="judg-quote-list" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">A:         No, I did not say anything else.</font></span> <a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30" title=""><font color="#0000ff" size="3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-GB">[30]</span></span></font></a></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Evaluation of the evidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">41.       I was aware that the prosecution’s case relied substantially on T, a young girl, and that some aspects of her account of her experience in Singapore lacked particulars, for example to dates of events, and to the circumstances in which Velu bought the chain for her.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">42.       I was nevertheless satisfied that she was an honest witness, trying her best to remember what happened during that traumatic fortnight when she was separated from family and home brought to Singapore and was made to prostitute herself.  Velu was not involved in deceiving her into coming to Singapore.  There was no animosity or misunderstanding between them for her to make false accusations against him.  I accepted her evidence that Yong Ah Lai and Velu were with her as her pimps when she did that.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">43.       I did not accept the evidence of Hilan that on the second occasion he had sex with her, T had come up to him, asked him if he remembered her, then led him to a room to have sex with no mention of price or payment.  This description of the events was at odds to the evidence of Yong Ah Lai and T that some one would always be at hand to oversee her activities.  I did not accept Hilan’s evidence that he did not see Velu on that occasion.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">44.       I found that Yong Ah Lai’s evidence in fact supported T’s evidence.  It can be seen from his evidence that Velu was not an innocent observer of the goings-on.  He was frequently in the area, he was known to the prostitutes and he helped Yong Ah Lai stop making payment to the Indian nationals.  He also admitted that he wanted Velu to ensure that T did not talk or quarrel with the other prostitutes.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">45.       I was mindful that Velu did not have the benefit of counsel to represent him, and I gave allowance for that.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">46.       His own evidence showed that he was not a casual acquaintance of Yong Ah Lai or T.  As I have pointed out, he helped the former stop paying protection money, and he was entrusted to buy a chain for the latter.  He was sufficiently interested in T’s age to take her identity card without asking.  His explanation that he wanted to seek the help of his foreman Padmanathan to check with her family in Johore whether she had came to Singapore voluntarily was inconsistent with Padmanathan’s evidence.  Padmanathan said nothing about being asked to check with T’s family, or telling Velu not to interfere in T’s affairs.  To the contrary Padmanathan told him that it was not good for T to be involved in prostitution, and that he should do something for her.  Velu’s own witness contradicted him.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">47.       After reviewing the evidence, I had no doubt that Velu had participated in her prostitution, particularly on the second occasion when Hilan had sex with T by bringing them to the room for the purpose, and waiting outside for them.  I therefore convicted him and Yong Ah Lai for abetting Hilan to rape T.</span></p>
<p class="judg-headg-1" xmlns=""><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Sentences</span></strong></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">48.       I sentenced Hilan to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the rape charges, with the custodial sentences to run concurrently.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">49.       Yong Ah Lai was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on each of the rape abetment charge, with the custodial sentences to run concurrently.  He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and fined $5000 or six months imprisonment in default on the procurement charge, and a similar sentence for living on the earnings of prostitution, which sentences were to run concurrently between themselves and consecutively with the sentences for the abetment of rape.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">50.       I will deal more specifically with the sentence on Velu.  Like the other accused persons, he had no antecedents.  He pleaded in mitigation that he has been working in Singapore for six years and had not committed any offences.  His father has passed away and his mother, sisters, wife and children in India depend on his financial support.</span></p>
<p class="judg-1" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">51.       Taking these matters into account, and bearing in mind that he had claimed trial to the charge, as well as the sentencing guidelines set down in <i>Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP</i> [1992] 1 SLR 361, as well as the sentences passed on his co-accused, I sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.</span></p>
