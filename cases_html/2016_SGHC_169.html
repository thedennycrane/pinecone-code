</div> It was after this that the accused engaged the victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The facts relating to C2 (the aggravated outrage of modesty charge) as set out in the Statement of Facts read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. After walking in front of the victim for a short distance, the accused suddenly turned around and spoke to the victim in English. The victim replied that she did not understand English. The accused then asked the victim in Mandarin if she was a Chinese National and whether she liked American men. The victim did not reply and quickened her pace. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. As she was walking away, the victim suddenly felt the accused grab her buttocks. In response, she pushed him away and asked what he was doing. At this point, the accused grabbed her hand and shouted at the victim. The victim flung off his hand and continued walking at a faster pace.   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11. The accused lifted the victim’s skirt and the victim turned around. The victim became frightened and shouted again. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12. Shortly after this, the accused grabbed her shoulders and pushed her backward. As a result, the victim fell backwards. This was at a grass patch near some plants in front of the ‘Watermark’ condominium located at No. 1 Rodyk Street at around 3.15 a.m.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13. The accused quickly sat on her lower body and pulled at the collar of her dress. The victim struggled to break free, at the same time shouting for help. As the accused continued pulling at her dress, the zipper at the back of the dress gave way. The collar of her dress fell and her bra became exposed to the accused.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14. As the victim was still struggling, the accused fiercely told her not to force him to hit her. The accused then pulled down her bra and grabbed her left breast. He kissed her left breast as he restrained her by sitting on top of her. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15. As the victim begged the accused to let her go and shouted for help, the accused covered the victim’s mouth. He then pulled up the victim’s dress, revealing her panties. The accused pulled the victim’s panties downwards whilst the victim resisted by pulling it upwards, tearing the panties. The victim told the accused that she was having her menses and begged him to let her off. The accused paid no heed and pulled off her panties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Facts pertaining to C3</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The facts relating to C3 (the first rape charge proceeded with) read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17. The accused only got off the victim when he saw some cars passing by. The victim tried to retrieve her panties which the accused had removed, in order to put them back on. However, the accused snatched her panties and flung them even further away, towards a patch of vegetation in front of “Watermark” condominium. He then stood up, pulled the victim by her arm and asked her to follow him home.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18. The accused then pulled the victim across Rodyk Street, to the raised platform area in front of ‘Robertson 100’ condominium located at No. 100 Robertson Quay. This was at about 3.25 a.m. The accused then grabbed the victim’s neck with one hand and hit her head against the wall. Following this, the accused then pinned the victim onto the ground. As a result of this, the victim felt dizzy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. The victim begged the accused to let her go. However, the accused threatened her by warning her not to shout and not to do things which would force him to beat her. The victim was frightened. The accused removed his pants and tried to penetrate her vagina with his penis. The victim touched her vagina with her finger and showed her bloodied finger to the accused, telling him that she was having her menses and to let her go. However, the accused replied that “this was how he liked it”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20. The accused penetrated the victim’s vagina with his penis. The victim shouted for help and continued to beg him to let her go. The accused thrust his penis in and out of the victim’s vagina and she felt pain.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21. After some time, the accused withdrew his penis, stood up and put on his trousers. The victim quickly sat up and removed both her high heels in order to allow her to run away with ease. Having removed her heels, she jumped from the platform over a plot of plants onto Martin Road. She was prepared to run, however the accused appeared behind her, pulled her hand and said he wanted to bring her home.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22. The victim felt afraid that the accused would bring her to a dark location. The victim then grabbed the accused’s wrist and lied to him that they could go to her home instead. The victim’s intention was to lead the accused to her apartment where she could seek help from her security guard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Facts pertaining to C6 and C7</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The facts relating to C6 (the second rape charge) and C7 (the penile-oral penetration charge) read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25. After the accused and victim left No. 100 Robertson Quay, they walked along Martin Road. When they reached a grass patch along River Valley Close, near lamp post 16 at around 3.35 a.m., the accused suddenly pinned the victim to the ground and asked her to perform oral sex on him. He then proceeded to forcefully insert his penis into her mouth. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26. The victim felt the accused’s penis become erect as he thrust his penis a few times in her mouth. After some time, the accused inserted his penis into her vagina. The victim continued crying loudly, in the hope that someone would come and rescue her. She begged him to let her go to no avail. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27. As the accused continued the forced intercourse with her, a taxi stopped near them, and the accused quickly stopped what he was doing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The aftermath</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 As the accused stood up to wear his pants, the victim escaped. After running some distance, she stopped a car and asked the female driver to send her to the police. As the driver could not locate the police station, the victim phoned a friend and informed that friend that she had been raped. Her friend called the police and advised the victim to return to the area of River Valley Close.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 I took the view that the starting point for the rape in each charge was closer to the benchmark for Category 1 rapes than Category 2 rapes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 First, the four categories of rape were judicially created and their boundaries were therefore porous rather than rigid. The exercise in categorising each rape offence was simply an attempt to characterise the rape in order to arrive at a starting point which should then be adjusted to reflect the individual circumstances of a case. As Rajah J observed in <span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span> at [43], benchmark sentences were meant to provide stability and predictability in sentencing, but “should never be applied mechanically, without a proper and assiduous examination and understanding of the factual matrix of the case”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, the factual matrix here was delicate in the sense that this was a case having the flavour of both a single transaction and multiple distinct transactions. On one hand, the entire ordeal lasted about 20 minutes and at all times the victim not only never left the accused’s physical proximity but was also physically at the accused’s mercy when moving from the first location to the second.

</div>
</div>  On the other hand, based on the charges proceeded with, there were two rapes in two different locations at two different times (or speaking more generally, four distinct sexual offences in three different locations at four different times), and the accused forced himself on the victim again despite having had a clear opportunity to desist when he moved from one location to the next. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, the Prosecution proceeded with two rape charges in respect of this incident. In the case of multiple rapes, the Prosecution could <span class="font-italic">either</span> bring a single charge for the entire transaction and say that it was aggravated by virtue of multiple rapes, <span class="font-italic">or</span> bring multiple charges with one charge for each rape.  This was their prerogative.  However, when multiple charges were brought, it did not automatically follow that each charge (for which sentence was to be passed) was elevated to Category 2 rape.  My conclusion that the benchmark sentence for Category 2 rapes was more applicable to “single charge” situations embraced the following underlying observations:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In dealing with Category 3 rapes which addressed situations of “repeated rape of the same victim or of multiple victims” (<span class="font-italic">PP v NF</span> at [37]), Rajah J did not lay down a numerical sentencing benchmark but stated that the Prosecution would in most instances “proceed with multiple charges against the accused” and the Judge could discretionarily order at least two sentences to run consecutively to reflect the offender’s culpability. This suggested that the reference to “repeated rape” in Category 2 rapes was to multiple rapes which formed <span class="font-italic">the subject of a single charge</span> for which the sentence had to be enhanced.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The present case may be contrasted with <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Shamsul bin Sa’at</span> [2010] 3 SLR 900, where Chan Seng Onn J held that the accused had “clearly” committed a Category 2 rape on the basis of “the repeated sexual assaults”. The accused had been charged for only <span class="font-italic">one</span> count of aggravated rape under s 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the PC, but this was “not for want of trying”; crucially, the evidence showed that the accused “had repeatedly tried to rape the Victim, but had failed only because he was unable to sustain an erection” (at [19]). In contrast, the Prosecution here proceeded with two distinct charges of rape against the present accused, arising out of the entire incident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Ultimately, I thought that the fact of repeated rapes (and other sexual assaults) here did not compel the conclusion that each rape offence in C3 and C6 should be treated as Category 2 rape.  In any event, I did not consider the categorisation to be the final word as to the sentence to be imposed.  Instead, it was necessary to have regard to the nuances in the factual matrix in deciding the individual sentence for the rape charges while also being mindful of the total sentence for the entire transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Offences committed in public</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Prosecution, relying on <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”), submitted that it was an aggravating factor that the rapes occurred in a public place, and that the “audacity of the Accused in the present case outweighs that of” the accused in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chang Kar Meng</span> [2015] SGHC 165 (“<span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng</span>”) considering that the rapes (and sexual assaults) occurred across different locations.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There were two commonly cited jurisprudential bases which justified a reduction in sentence for a timely plea of guilt; they were often referred to as the remorse-based approach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a guilty plea evidenced remorse) and the utilitarian approach (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a guilty plea saved resources).  Rajah J in <span class="font-italic">Angliss</span><span class="font-italic"> Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 (“<span class="font-italic">Angliss</span>”) stated at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As noted, our courts have said that there are two jurisprudential bases upon which a reduction in sentence for timeously-effected guilty pleas may be justified. The first is pragmatic: it saves the criminal justice system resources that would have been expended with a full trial. In certain cases, it even spares vulnerable victims and witnesses from having to testify: see <span class="font-italic">Fu Foo Tong v PP</span> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Fu Foo Tong</span>”). This can be termed the <span class="font-italic">utilitarian</span> approach. The second is moral: it is not the <span class="font-italic">fact</span> that an offender pleads guilty but rather the essence of a guilty plea constituting genuine remorse that attracts the reduction in sentence. This can be termed as the <span class="font-italic">remorse-based</span> approach. In respect of the remorse-based approach, two reasons have generally been proffered for placing a premium on and encouraging contrition. The first is that an offender who demonstrates by his plea that he is ready and willing to admit his crime enters the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period of time than might otherwise be necessary: see <span class="font-italic">United States v Henry</span> 883 F 2d 1010 (11th Cir, 1989) at 1012, citing <span class="font-italic">Brady v United States</span> 397 US 742 (1970) at 753. The second and broader rationale is that there are significant, meaningful and profound effects that a genuine, remorseful apology can engender. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Rajah J, after examining in detail the principles regarding the reduction of sentences for a guilty plea (<span class="font-italic">Angliss</span> at [54]–[77]), concluded that a guilty plea could be considered in mitigation when motivated by “genuine remorse, contriteness or regret and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of justice” but generally preferred the remorse-based approach to the utilitarian approach. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Remorse-based approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I begin with the accused’s argument that his plea of guilt saved the victim from being subject to the trauma of cross-examination, and was therefore evidence of genuine remorse.

These propositions derived from the consideration of the remorse expressed by the accused as evidenced by his later conduct, but their effect would depend on the particular facts, including how the plea played out in the actual proceedings.  On our facts, the victim was forced to relive the trauma caused by the offences by having to recount the events during examination-in-chief, during which she broke down.

</div> In my judgment, it would be an <span class="font-italic">aggravating</span> factor if evidence was fabricated (<span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Hwee v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1) or if an offender attempted to escape from the crime scene (<span class="font-italic">Lewis C</span><span class="font-italic">hristine v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 131).  Moreover, the accused was apparently “dazed and confused” when he was found near the crime scene; he was therefore in less of a position to escape in the first place than someone who was alert.  This was also not a case where the accused had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police after leaving the crime scene.  The lack of fabricated evidence or any attempt to escape must therefore be merely neutral and not mitigating.  However, it was true that the accused did not proffer an alternative version of the facts for the victim to contend with (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, that there was consent).  This factor was largely subsumed in his plea of guilt which was the subject of consideration here.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Utilitarian approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Defence submitted that the accused had saved resources in that the other witnesses need not be called to the stand and both the Prosecution’s and Court’s resources were saved.

</div> I found that the accused’s plea led to a speedy resolution of the matter, the saving of trial days as well as an appeal on conviction.  The victim was not cross-examined, which would have caused even more harm to her.  A fair number of witnesses were not required to attend Court or put to further expense or effort and the Prosecution did not need to contend with an alternative version of events. On the other side of the scale, resources had already been expended in preparation for the trial, including working and liaising with the witnesses.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Finally, the shocking and heinous nature of the offences here trumped much of the mitigating value of the guilty plea.

The High Court upheld the sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.  The accused tried to exculpate himself by casting baseless aspersions on the victim’s character (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, alleging that he had had an affair with the married victim).  However, I noted that the molest and restraint were brief in that the accused let the victim go almost immediately after she shouted.

The present accused literally pulled the victim along from the first location to the second location and hit her head against the wall.  As discussed above, our present case had its own aggravating factors which made it comparable to <span class="font-italic">Chang Kar Meng</span>, including the variety of sexual offences in three locations, the repeated rapes and the appreciable harm caused to the victim.  In determining the individual sentence for each rape offence, I also took into consideration the charges in C1 (rape), C4 (digital-vaginal penetration), C5 (penile-oral penetration) and C8 (possession of obscene films).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Accordingly, the sentence here should be higher than in <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span> and <span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Selvarajah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1142 (“<span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span>”), both of which involved a single rape in a vehicle.

On an overall analysis, I was of the view that the present accused was more culpable on his rape offences.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Sivakumar</span>, the accused had – under the guise of being a police officer – raped and outraged the modesty of the victim, and forced her to fellate him. He was convicted after a full trial and received 11 years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for the rape charge.

</div> He received seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the fellatio charge. This was part of a total sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.  The sentence was enhanced, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, due to the fact that the victim was vulnerable (she was the accused’s mildly retarded half-sister and was about 19 years old at the material time, and the accused stood <span class="font-italic">in loco parentis</span> to her), and “the lack of remorse and the conduct of the [accused] during the trial” (see <span class="font-italic">BMD</span> at [70]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 If the present penile-oral penetration charge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, C7) had been a stand-alone charge, I would have imposed a considerably higher sentence.  In the premises, I was minded to impose an imprisonment term of four years with four strokes of the cane for C7, having regard to the totality principle. However, due to a situation which I explain below at [77], I sentenced the accused to three years, 10 months and two weeks’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Prosecution submitted that the aggregate sentence should be at least 17 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, and that the imprisonment terms for C3 (the rape charge) and C7 (the penile-oral penetration charge) should run consecutively.

In particular, the totality principle was a rule of limitation and a manifestation of proportionality which required the Court to take a last look at the facts and circumstances to assess whether the sentence appeared wrong and, if so, to adjust the sentence by either reassessing which sentences ought to run consecutively, or by recalibrating the individual sentences to arrive at the appropriate aggregate sentence (<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [47], [53], [58]–[59] and [66]–[67] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Menon CJ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Although the proceeded charges could be viewed as a single transaction, the totality principle could still apply.

In particular, those were the more serious charges and they involved the violation of different orifices of the body; and I agreed with the Prosecution that the imprisonment terms for these two charges should run consecutively, to “reflect the enhanced culpability” of the accused and to “sufficiently capture the gravity of” his conduct.

</div>
</div>  It was pertinent to consider that the imprisonment term for the other rape charge (C6) was ordered to run concurrently.  On an overall assessment, with an eye on the global sentence, it would be appropriate for the imprisonment term in the relatively less serious charge in C2, which was the prelude to the graver offences, to run concurrently.  As regards caning, I did not think that I should subject the accused to the maximum of 24 strokes of the cane; a total of 22 strokes of the cane was more considered and appropriate.  In my view, a global sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane accorded with the totality principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The accused was remanded since 9 February 2013 for the present offences. On 25 March 2013 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, while on remand), he was convicted and sentenced on offences under the MA.  I did not order the imprisonment terms for the present offences to take effect from 9 February 2013 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of his remand), since that would allow the accused to serve the sentences for the moneylending offences and the present offences at the same time. I therefore ordered the imprisonment terms for the present offences to commence on 14 September 2013, the date on which the accused was deemed to have completed those sentences for the moneylending offences on the basis that the one-third remission was awarded.
