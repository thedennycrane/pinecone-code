</div> The family stayed in Kuwait from January 2008 to April 2010. The background to the family’s decision to move was, however, contested by the parties. According to the Wife, the move was to support the Husband’s career as there were better job prospects for him in Kuwait. The Husband’s account was that this was a collective decision for the benefit of the family, who could live independently in Kuwait without the involvement of the Wife’s immediate family. Another reason was that the Wife could spend time with the children during their formative years as she would not have to work in Kuwait.

</div> as she could spend time in Singapore or elsewhere with the children and her extended family. Moreover, the Wife had had domestic help in both Kuwait and Singapore.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is clear that the Wife was the main caregiver of the children as the  Husband’s job required him to spend time away for work and travel, and more so particularly after the Husband left the matrimonial home from September 2012 to July 2013 and again from November 2014 onwards. The Husband, whilst he was living in the matrimonial home and even after he left, continued to involve himself actively in the in the children’s well-being, care and studies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the circumstances, and after considering all the facts laid out by the parties in their submissions, I found it just and equitable to attribute the indirect contributions to the marriage in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Step 3: Final ratio for division</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A simple average of the two ratios above yielded an overall ratio of 68.65:31.35 in favour of the Husband. In <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> v ANK</span>, the Court of Appeal set out three relevant and non-exhaustive factors in determining if the relative weightage of the ratios should be adjusted further: (a) the size of the matrimonial pool, (b) the duration of the marriage, and (c) the nature and extent of the parties’ indirect contributions (at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Wife’s position was that equal weightage be given to both direct and indirect contributions whilst the Husband proposed that direct contributions should weigh at 70% and indirect contributions at 30% in determining the overall division. The Husband submitted that the size of the matrimonial pool, which was accumulated largely by his individual efforts, must be taken into account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I was not convinced that there was a need to adjust the overall ratio.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In arriving at my decision, I was mindful of the Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">TNL </span><span class="font-italic">v TNK and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>which considered that single-income families and dual-income families attracted different approaches to the division of matrimonial assets. The instant case was one where the Wife had worked full-time, part-time and had also taken no-pay leave during the marriage for the benefit of the family and the children, and therefore did not fall squarely within the principles in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span> or the principles in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I thus turned to the case of <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Boey v Sia Hee Soon</span> [2012] SGHC 92 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Boey</span>”), which I found to be helpful. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Boey</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Steven Chong J (as he then was) observed from a review of the cases, that the proportion awarded to homemaker wives, who had made modest financial contributions to marriages with children lasting 17 to 35 years, ranged between 35% to 50% of the total matrimonial assets (at [34]). He also observed (at [35]) that the exceptions, where the apportionment in favour of the wife was less than 35%, typically concerned cases where the total pool of matrimonial assets had been very substantial and in excess of $100m. In those situations, the apportionment to the wife had been substantial in its absolute terms.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Measured against this broad observation, I was satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, my decision to divide the matrimonial assets for the Wife to receive 31.35% of the assets (amounting to $2,201,867) was just and equitable. I note that this was not too far from what the Wife herself had asked for at the 4 May 2017 hearing, when it was submitted that she was entitled to receive an overall lump sum of $2.21m, which was to include her share of the assets as well as any lump sum maintenance to be awarded to her. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implementing the division order </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On the distribution of the matrimonial assets, I ordered that each party retain the assets in their own names. As the Wife’s 31.35% share of the total matrimonial assets amounted to $2,201,867 and she held $546,000 of the matrimonial assets in her own name, the Husband was to pay the Wife the balance of $1,655,867.

</div> She urged the court to consider that the Husband had a higher earning capacity and was earning a much higher income. Furthermore, she had had to take a pay cut to care for the children and was not able to make an easy transition into the work force in her present situation. In this regard, she reiterated that, due to her commitment to the family and to the marriage over the years, she had missed out on job opportunities that could have allowed her to attain a higher income than what she was presently earning. I also noted that her monthly expenditure was about $4,000,

She was a qualified professional, who could earn up to about $7,300 per month, albeit presently employed part-time. In my view, the Wife, at 44 years old, was well-placed to regain self-sufficiency as she progressively moves towards a full-time job, especially as the Husband was to bear the children’s maintenance costs. She works in an area where her skills are in demand. Given the share of the matrimonial assets awarded to her, which would provide an adequate buffer for her to make the transition, there was no need for a maintenance order for the Wife. That the Husband earned an average monthly income of about $50,000 (inclusive of a car allowance at $4,833) was one but not a determining consideration.
