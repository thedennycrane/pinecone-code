This message does not mention anything about repayment on Teo’s behalf pursuant to the Alleged Indemnity.

While TCH is not named in the message, this message was sent shortly after TCH sent the First Letter of Demand, and the “annoying person” referred to there, in context, is TCH. The letters sent by Teo and TTC in response to TCH’s First Letter of Demand also indicate that both were surprised by TCH’s claims. Their correspondence in January and October 2020, before the trial of Suit 743, is consistent with that position. This court finds it hard to believe that they would have persistently fabricated all of such correspondence just to refute TCH’s claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Even so, the documentary evidence does not conclusively disprove the existence of the Alleged Indemnity.

He repeatedly prevaricated and was unable to give a consistent account of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In this regard, it would be useful to first set out some of the inconsistencies in TCH’s evidence. One example concerned the circumstances of the Alleged Indemnity. In his Statement of Claim, TCH said that the Alleged Indemnity and Alleged Representations had been orally given to him by Teo in the September 2013 Meetings, at which TTC was also present. In his Further and Better Particulars in Suit 743 (“the S 743 F&amp;BP”) dated 13 March 2020, he stated that he could not recall the exact dates and times of the September 2013 Meetings, but said that only himself, TTC and Teo were present at the meetings.

</div> Next, in his Further and Better Particulars of his defence dated 30 November 2020 for Suit 1089 (“the Suit 1089 F&amp;BP”), TCH claimed that Teo had told him in the September 2013 Meetings that “you need to try your best to help me support” to which TCH  replied “I can help you support, but if there are losses, you need to be responsible”, to which Teo said, “You are helping me, I definitely will be responsible.” It is noteworthy that the S 743 F&amp;BP preceded the S 1089 F&amp;BP by eight months. Yet, TCH could recall in November 2020 what he could not recall in March 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 TCH was also unable to recall further specific details of those meetings in the documents filed before the trial. He then testified for the first time during the trial that Teo had called him around 8am on 30 September 2013 and told him that “[i]f the share price falls further, the funds from IDI will not be able to go into his company, which would result in the Myanmar project failing”. Teo thereafter made further subsequent representations to him at the Hotel.

I need your help to support the share price”. I asked him why. He said, “Because if the share price continues to fall, IDI may not come in and it may cause the Myanmar project to fail. So I need your help to support the shares and not to let the share price fall so rapidly”. So I thought about it and I told him I will try my best to prop up the price. So that was the first call. Subsequently, many times at the Riverview Hotel, he said this many times, but not the exact same thing. He just said he needed my help then to help prop up the price, and he said, “After this is over, you will not lose money, but if you do, I will compensate you”.

</div> Mr Low’s key arguments are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Giving “commercially unsustainable” answers: Mr Low submits that Teo changed his evidence when he said doing a placement might take a month, but then said the Second Placement was conceived shortly after 30 March 2013 and announced by 3 April 2013, although ISDN’s directors were briefed one or two days before the ISDN trading halt on 31 March 2013. When being tested on his evidence, Teo then said he cannot remember and made excuses that he could not speak for ISDN. Mr Low’s point is that the March 2013 Married Deals were completed between the First Placement and Second Placement, and it made no sense for Teo to enter those deals at S$0.32 when Teo would have known that the Second Placement (at S$0.45) was around the corner.

It is this court’s view that the oral testimony does not affect its interpretation of the Payment Vouchers one way or the other, since, on their face, the documents do not indicate the purpose of the payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, the oral testimony on the Shareholder List Emails supports TTC’s explanation (see [18] above) that the lists were meant for him and TCH to monitor ISDN share movements to ensure there would not be unauthorised disposal of the ISDN shares under the EFH loans. TCH testified that the lists were sent to him to “convince” him to “support” ISDN shares pursuant to the Alleged Indemnity.

</div> Apart from the fact that this evidence is not in his AEIC for Suit 743 (which only says that the lists were for him to monitor changes to the list of shareholders and warrant holders), the court notes that the first list was forwarded to him by TTC on 3 December 2013. However, if he had been given the Alleged Indemnity around 30 September 2013 and was already buying ISDN shares since, it does not make sense for the shareholder lists to be sent to him two months after that. Second, TCH claimed to have stopped buying ISDN shares pursuant to the Alleged Indemnity around December 2013. This does not explain why the last email was sent in May 2014, more than five months later.

</div> This would have supported his case on the Alleged Indemnity, or, at the least, was certainly relevant.

</div>
</div> There was therefore no reason for Teo to give an unlimited or open-ended indemnity out of his desperation to maintain the share price at a certain level. Nor did any of the public announcements made by ISDN in 2013 refer to ISDN share prices being maintained at a certain level as a condition for the Myanmar Energy Project – in fact, as observed earlier, ISDN even advised its shareholders in some of these announcements to exercise caution when trading or dealing in their ISDN shares as there was no assurance of the projects proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The fact that some of the announcements specifically included the cautions also explains why Teo did not seem particularly concerned about raising capital for the projects and he repeatedly said during the trial that were many ways to “skin a cat”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>many ways to raise capital.

</div> The court is unable to follow this logic. If TCH did not want to continue propping up the ISDN share price and was confident that he had the Alleged Indemnity under which he could claim back all his investment losses, he could have just sold his ISDN shares and stopped trading entirely rather than incur further losses through buying shares. It was not clear why TCH would be so charitable to Teo at this time, when he himself had already lost money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 TCH denied having a further agreement with Teo to continue trading, and claimed to be doing this as a favour to Teo.

</div> Taking his case at its highest, he was gradually reducing his ISDN shareholding rather than selling all his shares at once so that the ISDN share price would not drop or drop drastically  as a favour to Teo, and he was banking on the Alleged Indemnity to cover any losses he incurred. However, a more straightforward and plausible explanation for TCH’s continued buying and selling of ISDN shares from September to December 2013 was to “create market activity” for his own benefit at a time when the ISDN counter was thinly traded, and to “slowly reduce [his] shareholding without incurring too much loss”.

</div> His trading behaviour at the time reflected his attempt to cut his own losses from the penny stock crash, rather than as a purported favour to Teo. Moreover, if TCH was really banking on the Alleged Indemnity, there is no explanation for why he did not demand compensation from Teo shortly after he incurred losses at the end of 2013 and only waited until 24 November 2015 to send the First Letter of Demand. In fact, on Teo’s evidence, TCH continued to communicate with Teo up until September 2014 and even introduced Teo to an investment opportunity with Tritech at the start of 2014.

TCH understood Representation 1 to mean that the Myanmar Energy Project would be finalised very quickly, and not in the time frame of 24 months as stated in the ISDN announcement. TCH therefore believed he had to support the ISDN share price to prevent the project being affected until IDI was ready to come on board.

Apart from the fact that this aspect of TCH’s case was not seriously explored at the trial, it is not likely that Teo, a seasoned businessman running a public company, would make such representations concerning the Myanmar Energy Project when ISDN’s announcements stated there was “no assurance” and “no guarantee” that the projects would materialise and had even advised shareholders to exercise caution when trading or dealing in ISDN shares.

Similarly, the statement that the project was “near the verge of being finalised” was not a statement of fact. In the context of ISDN’s announcements (with the cautions), and Teo’s understanding that the project could have taken at least five years, with one to two years for due diligence, this statement was merely Teo’s prediction on the project progressing to its next stage.

Therefore, he did not subjectively believe that this statement was false (<span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Representation 2 was that if the share price of ISDN continued to drop, then this might jeopardise the Myanmar Energy Project and the other expansion plans of the Company. This was Teo’s then opinion as to how a drop in ISDN’s share price might negatively affect the Myanmar Energy Project. It is not a statement of fact. Nor is it false – if a company’s share price drops, it is true that this could affect investor confidence and the company’s ability to raise funds for future projects.

Saying that something is a “good” investment is a statement of opinion or a mere puff, which is not actionable (<span class="font-italic">Tradewaves</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82]). As for the statement about the share price rising on conclusion of the Myanmar Energy Project, this is Teo’s reasonable prediction of what would happen in the future, which was borne out by TCH’s own evidence on the increase in ISDN share price when the news of the project was leaked.

Besides the fact that both deals were executed by the relevant parties on 21 March 2013, there was no resemblance in the nature of or the identity of the parties to the transactions which gave probative value to the Goh brothers’ evidence insofar as whether TTC held 11.5 million ISDN shares on trust for Teo.

</div> Therefore, the S$63,919.95 cheque was presented for payment and cash was withdrawn; however, as the cheque was neither crossed nor were the words “or Bearer” deleted, anyone could have presented the cheque to UOB for payment. It is therefore not clear whether TTC in fact received this payment. TTC’s position is that, even though the S$63,919.95 cheque was issued in his name, he did not receive this cheque nor any cash from the payment. In GYT’s UOB chequebook, there is a handwritten note in Mandarin besides the entry for S$63,919.95 indicating “ISDN boss”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) 7 January 2014: 940,000 ISDN shares were sold for S$590,758.43.

Teo gave the Goh brothers instructions on selling the shares and on how to distribute the sale proceeds. The sums owed for each sale and purchase of ISDN shares and Wee Hur shares were regularly set off against each other, which shows that Teo and the Goh brothers had to account to each other for the shares that they held on the other’s behalf. The Goh brothers’ detailed records, particularly their handwritten notes that refer to ISDN and Teo, are also consistent with GYH’s testimony that he and his brother never thought of selling Teo’s shares for profit, as they were helping Teo with the parking of his shares and would need to account to Teo.

Such public announcements would not have been made if the shares were still beneficially owned by Teo, since Teo would still have a deemed interest in such shares. Thus, TCH’s case that Teo hatched a scheme to enter this share swap arrangement to allow him to sell ISDN shares without making public announcements is a figment of Tan’s imagination.

</div> This submission is rejected. The public announcements were made by Teo in 2013 because GYT indeed became the owner of the ISDN shares. However, there was an understanding between Teo and the Goh brothers that the Goh brothers would only sell those shares and distribute the sale proceeds accordingly on Teo’s instructions. These subsequent sales did not require Teo to make public announcements since he was not the one selling the shares. Granted, as Mr Gill submits, it might have been more straightforward for Teo to transfer the shares to GYT without going through an elaborate share swap,

</div> but that does not change the court’s assessment of the objective evidence adduced in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The Goh Yeu Toh Deal was carried out to enable Teo to “park” his ISDN shares with the Goh brothers, and pursuant to this arrangement, Teo instructed them to sell the ISDN shares and distribute the proceeds to various recipients.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Tan Thiam Chye Deal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 However, the court accepts Mr Gill’s submission that the Goh Yeu Toh Deal does not have probative value in relation to the Tan Thiam Chye Deal. Even if Teo parked shares with the Goh brothers, this does not mean he did the same thing with TTC. The mere fact that both deals were agreed on 21 March 2013 does not mean that the transactions were for the same purpose. Unlike the Goh Yeu Toh Deal, there was no evidence in respect of the Tan Thiam Chye Deal that there had been a share swap between ISDN and TTC, nor was there evidence that TTC had ever sold his ISDN shares at Teo’s request and disbursed the sale proceeds to various recipients, like the Goh brothers did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Low’s case hinges on attacking the legal documentation used in the Tan Thiam Chye Deal, as well as TTC’s credibility. It should first be noted that the legal documentation of the Tan Thiam Chye Deal and Goh Yeu Toh Deal already indicates the differences in the transactions. Unlike the Goh Yeu Toh Deal, there was only one SPA in the Tan Thiam Chye Deal, and there was no corresponding SPA for TTC to swap shares with Teo, nor was there any similar payment set-off agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Second, there was documentary evidence for most of the payments received by Teo from TTC, and Teo confirmed in his AEIC that he received the S$900,500 cash payment. TCH has not provided a better explanation for these payments, other than his bald assertions that the payments were fake and part of a “parking exercise”. That is not a persuasive argument. For one, TCH asserted that Teo had asked TCH’s broker to assist him in the parking exercise. However, he admitted that he was not present when Teo was instructing the broker to park shares with TTC and only heard it subsequently from TTC and Teo.

</div> Since he had no knowledge about the documents, he had no basis to assert that the transactions were fake. When pressed on this at the trial of Suit 1089, he claimed that he knew from the start that the transactions were not genuine because Teo personally asked him and TTC to find reliable people to “park [Teo’s] shares in”, shifting from his earlier evidence in Suit 743 that Teo had instructed the broker to do it.

</div> This weighs against the Tan Thiam Chye Deal being a “parking exercise” for Teo’s benefit, as it is unlikely Teo would allow TTC to run this risk with Teo’s shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Third, Mr Low submits that it made no sense for the lawyers to draft the Additional Letter instead of amending the SPA payment terms. The Additional Letter also had typographical errors, was not signed by Teo and was not issued on an official letterhead. However, this in itself does not prove that the SPA was therefore “fake” or designed to conceal Teo’s true intentions of parking shares with TTC. Parties may choose how to record the terms of their agreement. Similarly, just because there are errors in the Additional Letter does not conclusively prove that it was fake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Fourth, Mr Low submits (see [53(a)] above) that it was not possible for Teo to arrange the Second Placement in three days, and it would most likely have been in the works, at the very earliest, two weeks before the trip to Myanmar on 30 March 2013. It therefore did not make sense for Teo to arrange this deal for S$0.32 per share when he knew that the Second Placement was already in the works for a price of S$0.45. It also did not make sense for TTC to buy ISDN shares from Teo just days after the First Placement had been announced on 14 March 2013, as he could have got a better price if he had bought shares from the open market instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The court finds Teo’s evidence on the Second Placement not plausible because, as he testified, a placement will typically take one month.

</div>
</div> Therefore  I accept Mr Low’s submission that the Second Placement must have been in the works, or at least was being discussed, soon after the First Placement on 14 March and before the Myanmar trip on 30 March 2013. However, that does not mean that it was illogical for Teo to enter the Tan Thiam Chye Deal on 21 March, as ISDN may not have finalised the exact price of S$0.45 for the Second Placement at that date. Second, as Mr Gill submits, TTC had good reason not to buy 11.5 million ISDN shares from the open market as such a quantity was near the daily average of shares being traded at that time, and this would have easily caused the price to “shoot up”.

</div> Further, TTC may not have been able to negotiate with a seller from the open market for him to pay in instalments, as he was able to with Teo. Third, even if it was not the best deal for both Teo and TTC, it does not follow that the transaction must have been “fake” or designed for Teo to “park” shares with TTC. There is no evidence of Teo having control over TTC’s sale of ISDN shares in the same way as with the Goh brothers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Lastly, Mr Low submits that TTC did not own a single ISDN share in his own name from February 2012 to March 2013, and only owned an average of S$1,099,021.16 worth of shares in the months leading up to the Tan Thiam Chye Deal. It is therefore inconceivable that TTC would, on a whim, decide to pay S$3.68 million for 11.5 million ISDN shares from Teo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 However, even if TTC never owned ISDN shares before March 2013, that does not mean it is “inconceivable” that he wished to own ISDN shares after March 2013. Around this time, he already knew of the Myanmar Energy Project and was regretting missing out on the First Placement. Nor was this done on a whim – as he said during the trial, he was prepared to walk away from the deal on 21 March 2013 if he was not able to negotiate better terms for himself.

TCH has not offered a satisfactory alternative explanation for the documentary evidence of the Tan Thiam Chye Deal, nor has he adduced any evidence to show how it is similar to the Goh Yeu Toh Deal, apart from the fact that the SPAs were signed on the same day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 If Teo did not “park” ISDN shares with TTC as this court finds, there are two possible explanations. The first explanation is that Teo did make Representation 5 to TCH and lied that he had parked his ISDN shares with TTC. TCH, relying on Teo’s and TTC’s assurances, and his own inferences about the Tan Thiam Chye Deal, went along with buying ISDN shares. The second explanation is that Teo never made Representation 5 to TCH and the latter is simply bringing up the Tan Thiam Chye Deal to cast aspersions on Teo and complicate matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 If the first explanation is right, this requires the court to accept that Teo: (a) took the trouble to engage lawyers and sign legal documents in March 2013; (b) conspired with TTC to fake various payments throughout 2013, with no conceivable benefit to either of them; and (c) conspired with TTC to lie to TCH in September 2013 to induce him to invest in ISDN. These scenarios are hard to accept. There was no reason for Teo to go to all that trouble. The second explanation is simpler and more plausible. Representation 5 was never made to TCH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In conclusion, the court finds that TCH has not proved that the Alleged Indemnity and Alleged Representations were made to him by Teo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Were the payments made by TTC to TCH pursuant to the Alleged Loan Agreement or for some other purpose?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Since I find that there was no Alleged Indemnity, the payments by TTC to TCH and other persons could not have been a repayment pursuant to the Alleged Indemnity.

Finally, TTC contemplated taking legal action against TCH between 2015 and 2019 to recover the unpaid loan but was hesitant to pursue such an expensive course of action as he believed TCH was impecunious.

The Payment Vouchers did not state that it was a loan agreement, and the only mention of a loan was in the 20 December 2015 Letter, which TCH did not receive at the time. TTC also could not provide a cogent explanation on the exact circumstances leading up to and after the Alleged Loan Agreement, and it took TTC 13 months to recall and depose on affidavit the express terms of the Alleged Loan Agreement.

The contemporaneous documents and parties’ conduct show that Teo had given TCH the Alleged Indemnity in consideration for investing in ISDN, and the sale of ISDN shares and payments by TTC to TCH were on Teo’s instructions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In considering whether the evidence supports the existence of the Alleged Loan Agreement, the same test set out at [37] above was applied here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applying the law to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 First, the court agrees with Mr Low’s submission that Yap and Foo’s testimony have no probative value to the suits, given that neither has personal knowledge of the Alleged Loan Agreement.

As stated earlier, the Payment Vouchers do not, on their own, support the existence of the Alleged Indemnity or the Alleged Loan Agreement. However, the fact that the payments were recorded in Payment Vouchers shows that there was a degree of formality in this arrangement (see [67] above). Had the payments been, for example, a gift to TCH, it is unlikely that TTC would have recorded them in such detail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Second, the correspondence between Teo and TTC supports the existence of the Alleged Loan Agreement. As stated at [41], the WhatsApp message dated 17 November 2014 from TTC to Teo supports Teo’s version of events. The WeChat conversation between them on 26 November 2015 also supports TTC’s position as it refers to the loan agreement. Mr Low submits that, through the latter message, Teo was giving TTC instructions to draft the 20 December 2015 Letter to fabricate the Alleged Loan Agreement and compromise TCH’s claim against Teo.

</div> In my view, one month is not a particularly long delay. In any event, Mr Low’s submission also does not explain why TTC used his own money to make the first payment to TCH on 13 November 2014, a fact that TCH accepts (see [23] above). Had the payment really been a repayment on Teo’s instructions pursuant to the Alleged Indemnity rather than a loan, TTC would have waited for the sale proceeds rather than paying TCH out of his own pocket. There was no reason for TTC to be so charitable on Teo’s behalf even if they are friends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 TCH said in his AEIC that TTC’s claim was made in a desperate attempt to bolster Teo’s case. Mr Low also said at the trial that TTC had no urgency or desire to make a case against TCH until he realised he had to come forward as a witness in Suit 743, which resulted in a flurry of activities before the trial in Suit 743.

</div> As this court said at the trial, this argument is hard to accept. It is difficult to believe that someone would commence a suit and incur thousands of dollars in costs thereon, simply because he had to come forward as a witness in another suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Alleged Loan Agreement is a better explanation for the parties’ conduct and the documents before the court than the Alleged Indemnity. This court therefore accepts TTC’s evidence that he sold his 8 million ISDN shares and paid the sale proceeds to TCH pursuant to the Alleged Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Amount owed to Tan Thiam Chye</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The next issue to consider is how much TCH owes to TTC under the Alleged Loan Agreement. TTC claims for the loss of profit on the 10,061,049 ISDN shares which he could have purchased from the open market at S$0.23 per share had the loan amount of S$2,314,041.39 been repaid to him, which amounts to S$4,829,303.52. He calculates this based on the difference in the price of ISDN shares on 13 August 2015 (S$0.23) and on 4 February 2021 (S$0.71).

</div> In the alternative, he claims for loss of the bank interest he would have earned on this sum since 13 August 2015 to the date of payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The court should first consider whether the Agreement Terms were part of the Alleged Loan Agreement. There is no documentary evidence of the Agreement Terms, apart from a reference to the “contemplated IPO” in the 20 December 2015 Letter, which is consistent with TTC’s explanation. The Payment Vouchers also do not record the Agreement Terms or the fact it was a loan, although they record the ISDN shares sale proceeds and the sums transferred to TCH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 First, Mr Low submits that it took TTC 13 months to recall and depose the Agreed Terms on affidavit. He points to the first affidavit of TTC filed in Suit 743 dated 8 January 2020 (although it was affirmed on 17 October 2019), where the Agreed Terms were not mentioned (the “TTC Striking Out Affidavit”), and his AEIC for Suit 1089 dated 17 February 2021 where the Agreed Terms were mentioned.

His Statement of Claim dated 11 November 2020 for Suit 1089 already refers to the Agreed Terms. Second, the TTC Striking Out Affidavit is an affidavit filed in support of Teo’s application for striking out in Summons 5724/2019 for Suit 743. TTC was not the defendant in that suit. It cannot be expected that he would disclose every detail relevant to his own suit which he had yet to commence.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The court rejects that argument. Although TLV was incorporated on 22 June 2015, TTC had explained at the trial there are considerable preparations and negotiations before an IPO is launched, including how the company is to be structured.  It is therefore not implausible that an IPO was being discussed even before the incorporation of TLV. Second, TCH was not assuring TTC that TLV was going to list in 9 months. The Agreed Terms merely contemplate that the loan is to be repaid to TTC either when TLV was publicly listed, or within 9 months from the date of the Alleged Loan Agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 13 August 2015), whichever is the earlier. Even if TLV failed to list publicly, TTC would still be entitled to the return of his money on 13 August 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Third, TTC’s testimony better explains the 20 December 2015 Letter and the Payment Vouchers than TCH’s testimony. First, the 20 December 2015 Letter shows that TCH was to repay the loan once his “contemplated IPO is launched”. Granted that TTC would not have included the date of the IPO as the only due date for the loan repayment given that at the trial, he testified that an IPO could take years.

</div>
</div>
</div> Moreover, there is no guarantee that an IPO will be successful. If it failed, he might not get back his money. Therefore, the court accepts that he would have provided a separate, definite timeline to protect himself in case the intended IPO did not materialise. This court also accepts that he did not refer to shares in the 20 December 2015 Letter because there was no reason to ask for a return of the shares when the ISDN price was below S$0.29 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the price at which he sold the shares in November 2014).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The court is also of the view that TTC’s testimony better explains the Payment Vouchers. If the loan was only “with reference to money”, he would not have needed to include the number of shares sold in the Payment Vouchers. As TTC explained at the trial, he recorded the payments as the sale proceeds from ISDN shares so the parties could determine on the due date whether TCH was to pay in shares or in cash.

</div> The court accepts that it is reasonable for TTC to have included this term in order to protect himself from losing money should the share price drop at the time for repayment, and to benefit therefrom should the share price rise. In contrast, TCH was unable to produce his own copies of the Payment Vouchers and changed his evidence on how the Payment Vouchers were signed.
