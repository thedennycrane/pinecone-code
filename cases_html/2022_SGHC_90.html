It contends that the terms of Mr Gan’s contract of employment were reduced to the form of a document (the LOA), and accordingly no extrinsic evidence can be admitted to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from the terms in the LOA. Specifically, Kelington contends that since the commencement date stated in the LOA (at clause 1.3) is 1 December 2020, that cannot be contradicted (or even qualified) by any evidence outside of the LOA.

The court must therefore first determine whether in fact the LOA was intended to contain all the terms of the parties’ agreement. In doing so, the court may look at extrinsic evidence and apply the normal objective test, subject to a rebuttable presumption that a contract which is complete on its face was intended to contain all the terms of the parties’ agreement: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [40] and [110]; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore</span>”) at paras 06.027–06.028. Having done so, the court may well conclude that the LOA was not intended by the parties to contain all the terms of their contract – the contract might instead be partly written and partly oral. If so, the court can consider extrinsic evidence to establish what the terms of the contract are, even, as a logical extension, where the oral evidence contradicts the written document: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 06.040.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 There are thus two questions to be dealt with: the anterior question of whether the LOA was intended by Kelington and Mr Gan to contain all the terms of their agreement; and, if it was not so intended, the subsequent question of what the terms of the agreement between the parties were (having regard to extrinsic evidence). However, as the facts pertaining to both questions overlap substantially, I will deal with them in the round. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The nature of the LOA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The LOA appeared to be complete on its face.

</div> Mr Gan then proceeded to tender his resignation. With his three-month notice period, he thus could not commence employment with Kelington on 1 December 2020 as stated in the draft LOA, unless his existing employer agreed to waive his notice and release him early.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On 1 October 2020 Mr Gan sent Mr Lim a WhatsApp message to say that he would send the LOA back that day. Shortly after, though, he sent further messages to say, “The boss have not accepted my resignation” and, “I will continue to speak with him.”

</div> It would not be consistent with that for Mr Gan to purport to only accept the LOA on 1 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I find that an objective, reasonable person in Mr Lim’s position would have known that “1st Jan”, as mentioned by Mr Gan in his WhatsApp message on 2 October 2020, was a reference to the commencement date of his employment with Kelington:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Mr Gan did not simply say “1st Jan”; he said: “<span class="font-italic">Have to be</span> 1st Jan” [emphasis added]. There is no reason why Mr Gan <span class="font-italic">had to</span> date the execution page “1st Jan”, and indeed, that did not make sense to Mr Lim. Rather, the date in question <span class="font-italic">had to be</span> 1 January 2021 because of Mr Gan’s notice period, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was a reference to his commencement date.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  Second, Mr Gan did not merely say “Have to be 1st Jan”; he went on to say, “But you may send me works to analyse”. That only makes sense if “1st Jan” were a reference to his commencement date – Mr Gan was saying that although he could only commence employment with Kelington on 1 January 2021, Kelington could nevertheless “send [him] works to analyse” prior to that date, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he could take preparatory steps in advance of his prospective employment with Kelington. If “1st Jan” were a reference to the date to be filled in on the execution page, Mr Gan’s subsequent statement, “But you may send me works to analyse”, would not make sense.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Mr Gan had to serve notice with his existing employer, and he had just told Mr Lim that his existing employer had not accepted his resignation. It follows that Mr Gan had not obtained an early release, and would have to serve out his notice. That takes one back to Mr Gan’s remark to Mr Lim on 14 September 2020 that the commencement date of 1 December 2020 initially proposed by Mr Lim was merely “tentative” (see [21] above). In that context, when Mr Gan said, “Have to be 1st Jan”, that was a reference to the commencement date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The above conclusion is reinforced by Mr Lim’s response (or lack thereof) when Mr Gan sent over a complete copy of the LOA on 9 October 2020, with the date <span class="font-italic">1</span><span class="font-italic"> October 2020</span> inserted on the execution page.

However, absent any confirmation that Mr Gan could obtain an early release, Kelington Group Berhad was operating under the assumption that he “cannot make it” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he would not be able to commence his employment with Kelington earlier than 1 January 2021). On the evidence, as of 6 October 2020, Mr Lim was the only person with whom Mr Gan had discussed his commencement date. The inference to be drawn is therefore that Mr Lim understood Mr Gan’s message, “Have to be 1st Jan”, as a reference to his commencement date (and not the date to be inserted on the execution page), and had communicated the same to Mr Ong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Kelington seeks to draw a distinction between when Mr Gan could physically travel to Shanghai (1 January 2021), and when he could commence employment (1 December 2020). There is, however, nothing in the evidence that indicates that if Mr Gan could commence employment on 1 December 2020, he would nevertheless be unable to travel to Shanghai until 1 January 2020. In particular, Mr Lim did not say that Mr Gan’s reference to “1st Jan” in his message of 2 October 2021, meant that that was the earliest date Mr Gan could travel to Shanghai – Mr Lim said he thought that was just about dating the execution page of the LOA.

</div> I do not accept that – it is not borne out by the messages, and it is also not what Mr Gan understood. Mr Gan’s response to whether he could “come earlier” was that his release date was “end Dec”, and it seemed difficult to come earlier than that. In response, Mr Lim did not clarify that he was asking about Mr Gan commencing his employment with Kelington even earlier than 1 December 2020, rather than earlier than January 2021 as Mr Gan was referring to (see Mr Gan’s messages of 19 October 2020, 11.11am and 21 October 2020, 9.34am). Instead, Mr Lim simply said it would be better for Mr Gan “to go [to China] earlier by early Dec” (his message of 19 October 2020, 11.15am).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The evidence does not bear out that Mr Gan could only go to China by early December 2020 if he commenced his employment with Kelington earlier than 1 December 2020.

If Mr Lim truly believed that Mr Gan had contractually agreed to commence employment with Kelington on 1 December 2020, it would only have been natural for him to mention this, upon seeing Mr Gan’s messages that he could not “come earlier” than January 2021. Mr Lim says he did not wish to raise that as an issue as that might create tension with Mr Gan right from the start.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Main Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the above reasons, I find that Mr Gan has rebutted the presumption that the LOA was intended to contain all the terms of the parties’ agreement. Specifically, the commencement date of Mr Gan’s employment term was the subject of an agreement/understanding between Mr Lim and Mr Gan, outside the LOA. The terms of the contract were not reduced to the form of a document (the LOA). As such, the parol evidence rule does not apply to prevent Mr Gan from relying on extrinsic evidence to prove the parties' agreement/understanding as to the commencement date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I find that the agreement/understanding between the parties was that the commencement date of Mr Gan’s employment with Kelington was 1 January 2021, not 1 December 2020. When Mr Gan repudiated the contract on 19 December 2020, and Kelington treated the contract as terminated on 22 December 2020, Mr Gan was not an employee of Kelington. Accordingly, it is clause 9.4 of the LOA that applies, not clause 1.5. It follows that Mr Gan’s liability to Kelington was only in the sum of RM24,000, for which consent judgment was entered, and which he has already paid to Kelington.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Further, even if the parol evidence rule applied, s 94(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act provides that “the existence of any separate oral agreement constituting a condition precedent to the attaching of any obligation under any such contract, grant or disposition of property, may be proved”. Thus, it was always open to Mr Gan to prove (as he has) that it was a condition precedent to the commencement of his employment with Kelington, that he be freed of his existing employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 If at all Mr Gan agreed to 1 December 2020 being the commencement date, that was just “tentative” (as he put it) – it was always subject to him being freed of his existing employment by then. However, his employer had not agreed to an early release; and while he was still serving notice, Mr Gan decided to stay on with his employer and not join Kelington after all. A conditional agreement to 1 December 2020 as the commencement date does not work for Kelington’s claim under clause 1.5. If Mr Gan did not obtain an early release by 1 December 2020, he was not obliged to commence his employment with Kelington on that date. Thereafter, he terminated the contract prior to the commencement of his employment with Kelington, and as such, clause 1.5 does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Subsidiary Issue (1): was clause 1.5 of the LOA an unenforceable penalty clause?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As stated at [67] above, I find that it is clause 9.4 of the LOA, not clause 1.5, that applies. I go on to consider whether, if clause 1.5 had applied, Kelington’s claims would nevertheless have failed on account of clause 1.5 being an unenforceable penalty clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In determining whether clause 1.5 of the LOA is an unenforceable penalty clause, the focus is whether it provides a genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss <span class="font-italic">at the time of contracting</span>: <span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v Seraya Energy </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2021] 1 SLR 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Denka</span>”) at [152] and [185].

However, if he commenced employment and then decided to quit on his first day of work, he would have to pay Kelington some three years’ worth of his salary – an amount exceeding RM1.4m (pursuant to clause 1.5 of the LOA). In terms of impact to Kelington, there is little difference between the two scenarios, but in terms of the financial consequences to Mr Gan under clause 9.4 as compared to clause 1.5, there is a huge difference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Mr Lim says that from 28 December 2020 to June 2021, Kelington tried but could not find a replacement for the position of Country Manager (China) of KESH.

I accept Mr Gan’s evidence that if he only joined KESH for a short while, the disruption caused to KESH by his departure would be less than if he had joined for quite a while; yet he would have to pay more despite having caused less disruption. For instance, it would generally be more disruptive if Mr Gan left after one and a half years (midway through the three-year term), than if he left after his first day of work; yet he would have to pay double in the latter scenario, as compared to the former.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 A sliding scale of compensation proportionate to the balance of Mr Gan’s term of employment does not bear any relation to the disruption which Mr Gan’s departure would cause, and as a necessary consequence, does not provide a genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss (in terms of disruption to KESH) which may flow from Mr Gan’s breach.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Impact of KESH not having a Country Manager (China)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I prefer the evidence of Mr Gan and Mr Wan, to that of Mr Lim, as to the impact of KESH not having a Country Manager (China) on its target profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 There was no real evidence that the target of 30% increase in profits each year for 2021, 2022 and 2023 was likely to be achieved with Mr Gan as Country Manager (China) of KESH. Nor was there any evidence that it was likely not to be achieved if Mr Gan terminated his employment. Indeed, there was no real evidence of what Kelington thought about this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Mr Lim took a target, applied an assumption to it, added assertions, and arrived at a huge “total estimated loss”.

Kelington has not shown that Mr Gan’s departure in those circumstances, or indeed at any point during the three-year term, would likely cause it loss of such magnitude. I find that the sum of over RM1.4m is extravagant or unconscionable in amount compared with the greatest possible loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach, and that attracts the application of the penalty rule (<span class="font-italic">Denka</span> at [254]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Significance of clause 1.5 being a negotiated clause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Kelington says that its entitlement to compensation under clause 1.5 was part of the bargain between the parties,

</div> but the same may be said of any contractual stipulation which is attacked as a penalty clause. I do accept it is relevant that clause 1.5 was a negotiated clause, and that it was meant to apply mutually to Kelington and Mr Gan (who wanted three years’ worth of salary to be guaranteed). However, this does not mean that clause 1.5 is immune from challenge as a penalty clause. Rather, if clause 1.5 were found to be a penalty clause insofar as it operates in favour of Kelington, the consequence may well be that Mr Gan too cannot enforce clause 1.5 to obtain three years’ worth of salary in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On a related note, Kelington contends that clause 1.5 should be upheld because the parties were of equal bargaining power.

</div> While the comparable bargaining positions of the parties is a relevant consideration, there need not be any disparity of power between the contracting parties for the penalty rule to operate (<span class="font-italic">Denka</span> at [174]). In considering factors such as the relative bargaining power of the parties, the focus remains on whether the clause concerned is a genuine pre-estimate of the likely loss (<span class="font-italic">Denka</span> at [153]).

As such, even if the commencement date were 1 December 2020, and that was not subject to the condition precedent of Mr Gan being freed of his existing employment, Kelington’s claims based on clause 1.5 would fail for clause 1.5 being an unenforceable penalty clause.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Subsidiary Issue (2): does the consent judgment for RM 24,000 preclude Kelington from claiming a higher sum?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Counsel for Mr Gan argued that because Kelington agreed to a consent judgment for RM24,000 (which has since been paid), it cannot claim anything more from Mr Gan.

</div> Paragraph 1 of the Court Order recorded the consent judgment in favour of Kelington for RM24,000. However, paragraph 2 of the Court Order stated that Mr Gan was granted unconditional leave to defend <span class="font-italic">the rest of</span> Kelington’s claims, and paragraph 3 of the Court Order stated that costs shall be in the cause, fixed at $4,000 (all in). It is implicit in paragraphs 2 and 3 that Kelington still had claims to pursue at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Kelington, though, only had one cause of action, rather than several causes of action out of which judgment had only been entered for one. If Kelington’s sole cause of action had merged with the consent judgment for RM24,000, it could no longer continue with that cause of action to recover the balance of the RM1,453,565.22 that it had claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 At the summary judgment hearing, it was not contended that the consent judgment would have that effect. Instead, it appears to have been common ground that Kelington could treat the RM24,000 as merely satisfying its claims in part, and continue to trial for the rest of what it was claiming.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Compounding the matter, one possible outcome of the trial was a finding that the commencement date of Mr Gan’s employment term was 1 December 2020 but that clause 1.5 of the LOA was an unenforceable penalty clause. In that scenario, Kelington’s claim for RM1,453,565.22 pursuant to clause 1.5 would fail. In principle, Kelington would still be entitled to damages for breach of contract (nominal or otherwise), but those damages would not necessarily be as much as the sum of RM24,000 in the consent judgment. If the court found that Kelington was only entitled to a sum less than RM24,000, that would then contradict the consent judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In its statement of claim, Kelington had sought the sum of RM1,453,565.22 “or such other sum as this Honourable Court deems fit”.

</div> However, Kelington adduced no evidence to prove what loss Mr Gan’s breach of contract had actually caused it; instead, Kelington simply claimed on the basis that Mr Gan was liable to pay the balance of three years’ worth of his salary (after offsetting the salary due to Mr Gan for his employment from 1 to 22 December 2020), pursuant to clause 1.5. If that claim failed because clause 1.5 was an unenforceable penalty clause, then Kelington would only have received nominal damages, for which I would not have awarded as much as RM24,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As such, when the consent judgment was entered, the parties could not be sure that Mr Gan would be liable to Kelington for RM24,000 in any event. It would have been better to order the sum of RM24,000 as an interim payment, rather than to enter a consent judgment – in the case of an interim payment, there can be an adjustment, if necessary, at the time of final judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In the awkward situation which has arisen, I would interpret the consent judgment in the context of the whole Court Order, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the consent judgment for RM24,000 was awarded on the premise that Kelington could continue with its claims at trial for the balance of the RM1,453,565.22 which it had originally claimed, as well as for interest and costs. Kelington’s cause of action merges with that consent judgment, but its right to continue pursuing the balance of its claim is preserved by the same order of court. I regard the consent judgment as being in the nature of an interlocutory judgment on liability, with the trial being to determine what, if anything, Kelington was still entitled to recover, besides the sum of RM24,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The consent judgment would still have conflicted with a potential finding that Kelington was only entitled to a sum less than RM24,000, but that is not the finding I have made. In any event, it appears that Mr Gan was content to pay Kelington RM24,000 regardless of the outcome of the trial – he did not indicate that he would seek any adjustment to that sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 On Subsidiary Issue (2), I thus find that the consent judgment does not preclude Kelington from seeking a higher sum at trial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 For the above reasons, save for the consent judgment for RM24,000 which has already been satisfied by Mr Gan (and which I do not disturb), I dismiss all of Kelington’s claims against Mr Gan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Unless the parties are able to agree on costs, they are to file costs submissions, limited to 8 pages (excluding any schedule of disbursements), within 14 days. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andre Maniam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Ee Yang, Wong En Hui Charis (Covenant Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran, Lawrence Tan (Prestige Legal LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
