Qingjian International (South Pacific) Group Development Co Pte Ltd (“CNQC”) is the main contractor in the Forett Condominium Project (“the Project”). The Plaintiff was CNQC’s subcontractor for the design, supply and installation of electrical works (“Electrical Works”) at the Project (“Electrical Project”). The Plaintiff’s contract with CNQC shall be referred to as the “Main Contract”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this action, the Plaintiff claims against the Defendant for (a) damages arising out of alleged breaches of a sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant; (b) interest; and (c) costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff contends that it had sub-contracted the Electrical Works to the Defendant on terms which had been agreed. As such, there is a binding agreement between the parties. The Plaintiff says that the Defendant wrongfully repudiated the agreement by unjustifiably stopping work in May 2021. The Plaintiff further argues that the Defendant also breached the agreement by failing to perform several key obligations under the Main Contract. The Plaintiff consequently terminated the agreement on 3 June 2021. It claims for an indemnity against all claims from CNQC due to the termination of the Main Contract and damages for the breach of the sub-contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Defendant’s position is that there were no such breaches of contract because no such sub-contract was formed. Alternatively, the Defendant argues that even if there is a sub-contract, it was entitled to terminate the contract because the Plaintiff repudiated the contract by its failure to (a) allocate 20 man-year entitlement (“MYE”); (b) provide an on-site dormitory for the Defendant’s workers; and (c) issue a 10% performance bond to CNQC. The Defendant counterclaims for <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span> for works carried out at the Plaintiff’s request, pending the parties’ negotiation and agreement on a proposed sub-contract which was never agreed upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Mr Gary Lee Chee Seng (“Gary”), the Managing Director of the Plaintiff, Mr Lawrence Li Detong (“Lawrence”), the Project Manager for the Plaintiff from 2018 to 2020, and Mr Edward Yeo Xi Yue (“Edward”), the Executive Director of the Defendant, testified at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Undisputed facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The undisputed facts are set out below:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Date</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Event</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">24 August 2020</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Edward approached Lawrence to find out more about the Project.

The relevant provision of the Revised Quotation read: “as per breakdown amount of $6,430,800 (8% from CNQC’s contract sum)”. The Defendant submits that this could either mean that the contract price is 8% of CNQC contract sum or that it is 8% less of CNQC contract sum. The Defendant argues that both figures are wrong. The former would mean that the CNQC contract sum is around $18.375m, which it is not. If it is the latter, then the Revised Quotation should have stated $6,348,000, not $6,430,800. The Defendant submits that the contract price indicated in the Revised Quotation is indeterminate and any purported contract must be void for uncertainty.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) DSL qualified the Revised Quotation with the words “approved in principle and pending official main contractor’s contract”. This was followed by reiterating that DSL “would like to confirmed [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] [Triumph Electrical’s] service in principal [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]…”. DSL indicated that the Revised Quotation “shall be an back to back contract with commerical [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] having certain acceptation [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”, without specifying what are the exceptions. At the time the Revised Quotation was sent, the Main Contract had yet to be signed. The Defendant argues that it would not be possible for a contract to come into existence in the circumstances when it was not even aware of the terms of the Main Contract — there can be no meeting of minds when the terms of the agreement are yet unknown.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Second, the Defendant submits that on the evidence, there was no agreement between the parties:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff unilaterally revised several terms in the Revised Quotation and omitted to include terms relating to (i) MYE support, (ii) provision of an on-site dormitory, and (iii) payment, that were agreed on during a meeting on 21 September 2020. The Defendant did not approve the terms of the Revised Quotation. Edward’s email dated 24 September 2020 in response to the Revised Quotation represents a rejection of the Revised Quotation and the terms set out therein.

</div> The Defendant complains that this was in the Reply and not in the Statement of Claim. However, it is undisputed that the Defendant had sight of what was in the Reply and responded to this point in Edward’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”). The Defendant clearly knew what case it had to meet at trial. It is trite law that the court may permit an unpleaded point to be raised, provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced: <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 231 at [18]; <span class="font-italic">Lu Bang Song v Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2009] SGHC 49 at [17]. In the present case, there was clearly no irreparable prejudice to the Defendant. Counsel for the Defendant acknowledged that the Defendant was not surprised by the material facts being pleaded in the Reply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I will deal next with the Defendant’s submission that the counter-offer in the Revised Quotation was incapable in law of being accepted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Defendant first submitted that the price was indeterminate. This is because the Revised Quotation either meant 8% of the CNQC contract sum or 8% less than the CNQC contract sum, both of which were inaccurate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I do not find that the first of the Defendant’s interpretations was a possible intended meaning. The Revised Quotation stated “8% <span class="font-italic">from</span> CNQC’s contract sum” and not 8% “of” the CNQC contract sum. A plain reading of this phrase is that the parties intended for the contract price to have an 8% difference <span class="font-italic">from</span> the CNQC contract sum. This is supported by the Confirmation Email, which stated “we would like to confirmed [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] your service in principal [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] with eight (8%) different [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] from our awarded CNQC’s Contract”. In other words, the parties intended for the Plaintiff to retain 8% of the contract price in the Main Contract and the Defendant to retain the remaining 92%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Defendant also argues that the final contract price in the Main Contract is $6,900,000 and that 92% of this sum would be $6,348,000, not $6,430,800 which was stated in the Revised Quotation. However, I do not find that this slight difference results in any indeterminacy of contract term on pricing. As mentioned, the Confirmation Email made clear that the contract price between the parties is an 8% difference from the awarded CNQC contract. The Defendant themselves in preparing their progress claims, took $6,348,000, which is 8% from the contract sum in the Main Contract, as the basis for their milestone claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Second, the Defendant submitted that the Revised Quotation was an inchoate counter-offer since it was pending the Main Contract.

The Defendant would not have had sight of any of the terms of the Main Contract prior to then.

It is essentially a pragmatic term of incorporation which incorporates into a subcontract the terms of the head contract. What is key is that “despite these words of incorporation appearing in a subcontract, the subcontract and the head contract remain distinct contracts”: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd and another</span> [2020] SGHC 165 at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Hi-Amp Engineering Pte Ltd v Technicdelta Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2003] SGHC 316 at [98], the court held that there was no “back-to-back” contract because the defendants did not furnish the main contract documents to the plaintiff when the parties signed the sub-contract, and the plaintiff was unaware of the terms of the main contract. Here, not only was the Defendant unaware of the terms of the main contract, it is undisputed that the Main Contract had not even been signed as of the date of the Confirmation Email on 22 September 2020 or when the Defendant replied to it via email on 24 September 2020.

</div> and conveyed to the Defendant around 23 December 2020. Since both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were unaware of the terms of the Main Contract, it cannot be said that all the terms of the Main Contract were imported into the parties’ agreement as of 24 September 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>, it was held at [48] and [50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 The weight to be attached to the fact that a party has not seen the main contract must be considered in the light of the factual matrix as a whole. It may not be decisive if the circumstances are such that the terms said to be affected by the back-to-back provision are matters that would fall within the general appreciation and knowledge of the parties to the subcontract. On the other hand, if the terms are highly technical and particular, it may be more important. Further, consideration should be given to the sub-contractor’s ability to ask for a copy of the main contract. It may also be overcome with sufficiently explicit language making it clear that the head contract was being incorporated and that the sub-contractor was deemed to have acquainted itself with its terms.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Just what is incorporated will depend in each case upon such things (among others) as what was objectively known to the parties at the time they entered into the contract, what specific references were made to the main contract document, and whether the terms of the main contract relevant to the back-to-back provision were of such a nature that they should have been and were specifically brought home to the sub-contractor or whether they were sufficiently general that they would fall within the general appreciation and knowledge of the parties. By way of example, it may be generally known to a sub-contractor that the main contractor would in due course make an application for payment to the employer in respect of works done by the sub-contractor. On the other hand, it may not be generally known to the sub-contractor that requests have to be in a very particular format.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Applying the analysis in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>, it would only be the terms of the Main Contract that were within the general appreciation and knowledge of the parties, that could be incorporated by the back-to-back clause. On the facts, I find that this includes the contract price, the work scope of the Main Contract and that the Defendant would be paid 92% of the contract price as set out in the Main Contract. I will deal with the other clauses in the Main Contract that the Plaintiff relies on later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The next issue I turn to consider is whether, notwithstanding the fact that the terms of the Main Contract had not been incorporated as of 24 September 2020, there could nonetheless be a binding agreement between the parties on 24 September 2020 based on the Revised Quotation and the Confirmation Email. In <span class="font-italic">Toptip Holding</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Mercuria Energy Trading</span> <span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2018] 1 SLR 50 at [40], the Court of Appeal held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... It is established law that a contract may be formed despite the fact that some terms have not yet been finalised. This occurs when an objective appraisal of the conduct and language of the negotiating parties leads to the conclusion that, having agreed on the essential terms, though not all the terms, they nevertheless intended to be bound immediately…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The determination of the essential terms in a contract is a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of the parties’ dealings with each other, including the nature of the transaction envisaged by the parties: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 03.235; <span class="font-italic">Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(in liquidation) v Newport Mining Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 956 (“<span class="font-italic">Norwest Holdings</span>”) at [28].

Notwithstanding the fact that the parties did not agree on the plaintiffs’ daywork rates, the Official Referee found that there was a binding contract, reasoning that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am satisfied that by 11 May all the terms save one necessary for a binding sub-contract to come into being were ‘agreed’.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Defendant submits that Edward’s version of the event, that he told Lawrence he could not accept the Revised Quotation in their telephone call, is supported by Lawrence’s WA message on 24 September 2020, in which he stated “[p]lease help me to state 20 mye per year purely for this forett project”. I am unable to agree. Lawrence’s WA message of 24 September 2020 does not say in any way that Edward informed Lawrence of his disagreement with the Revised Quotation. Lawrence’s WA message only asks Edward to state his MYE request, which is consistent with Lawrence’s evidence that he told Edward to state down his MYE request in black and white.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Defendant further submits that there was no agreement on the Revised Quotation because it did not record material terms sought by the Defendant, such as (a) the allocation of 20 MYE to the Defendant, (b) the provision of an on-site dormitory for the Defendant’s workers, and (c) the issuance of the performance bond to CNQC. However, there is no documentary evidence that these terms were regarded as so material that they would prevent the parties’ agreement on the Revised Quotation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Notably, Edward did not say in his 24 September 2020 email that he disagreed with the Revised Quotation. Neither did Edward say that the Defendant’s agreement to the Revised Quotation was conditional on the Plaintiff’s provision of 20 MYE per year and an on-site dormitory for 20 men. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Given the above, Edward’s email could possibly be read as him saying that he had no objections to the Revised Quotation, but that he also needed the support of 20 MYE and an on-site dormitory. I find that this reading of Edward’s 24 September 2020 email is reinforced by Edward’s subsequent conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Defendant started work on the Electrical Project in late September, at around the time of Edward’s email reply of 24 September 2020. Edward evidence is that the Defendant only commenced work because Lawrence requested that the Defendant start work first due to the urgency in completing the works, and had assured Edward that he would get the Plaintiff’s team to sort out the disputed terms.

</div> On the face of this email, Edward recognised the Defendant as “DSL’s sub-contractor” for the Electrical Project and is representing that to the main contractor, CNQC. This must mean that he accepted that there is a valid agreement between the parties. The only basis for the Defendant being the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor is the correspondence between them that led to an acceptance by the Defendant of the Revised Quotation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 There is certainly no documentation that states the Defendant was prepared to carry out the Electrical Works on the basis of the Plaintiff paying it 92% of the works certified by CNQC, without any other terms. There is certainly also no documentation stating that the Plaintiff accepted such an offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Edward seeks to explain the Defendant’s representation to CNQC by saying that CNQC was aware that the Defendant was carrying out works and submitting documents to CNQC on behalf of the Plaintiff, which was why in correspondence with CNQC, the Defendant was sometimes referred to as “DSL sub-con” for ease of reference.

</div> This supports the view that Edward was, in that email, representing to CNQC as the main contractor, that the Defendant was the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor for the Project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Indeed, CNQC would have no reason to otherwise deal with the Defendant, if it were not the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor. The Defendant would also be eligible for the MYE allotment secured by CNQC for the Electrical Project from MOM, only if it was a sub-contractor of the Plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was one of the parties involved in the Electrical Project. By its representation to CNQC, the Defendant was indicating that it accepted being the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor and would be proceeding with the works in that capacity. The only manner in which the Defendant could be the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor for the Project was to accept the terms of the Revised Quotation, which was the Plaintiff’s offer on the table.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendant cited the case of <span class="font-italic">L</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; M Equipment Pte Ltd (formerly known as L &amp; M Engineering Logistic Pte Ltd) v Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd and Others</span> [1999] SGHC 182 (“<span class="font-italic">L&amp;M</span>”) in which the court found that there was no contract between the sub-contractor and the sub-sub-contractor, notwithstanding the fact that latter had already commenced work at the former’s request. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, the circumstance of that case is different from the present case. In <span class="font-italic">L&amp;M</span>, the court reasoned that (a) the sub-sub-contractor negotiated directly with the main contractor without involving the sub-contractor; (b) the written agreement between the sub-sub-contractor and the sub-contractor was never signed; and (c) the parties had not agreed on the valuation of work for interim payments (at [40]–[41]). In the present case, the evidence shows that the Defendant liaised directly with the Plaintiff in relation to the Electrical Works. The Revised Quotation bore the signatures and company stamps of the parties. Tender Addendum No 4 to the Revised Quotation also provided the breakdown prices of the Defendant’s work.

</div>
</div> However, an examination of this WA correspondence indicates that what Gary was looking into were operational issues arising from the Electric Project, rather than issues regarding an agreement. A key concern raised by Edward in his 13 January 2021 WA message, was that the Defendant’s claims “easily reach $100k” based on work done to date but they had not “received any payment till date to cater for the above high running cost”. Gary’s response “will look into it”, thus appears to be him looking into the payment issue, rather than the terms of the agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In summary on this issue, on an examination of the evidence, including the Defendant’s subsequent conduct, I find that by Edward’s email dated 24 September 2020 to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had accepted the Plaintiff’s counter-offer as set out in the Plaintiff’s email dated 22 September 2020 and the Revised Quotation. These contained the essential terms such as the name of the parties, scope of work, contract period and price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For completeness, the Defendant also argued that there could not have been a binding agreement as of 24 September 2020 because the Revised Quotation contained the following words inserted by the Plaintiff: “This quotation approved in principle and pending official main contractor’s contract”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Gary testified that what the Plaintiff intended by saying “pending main contractor’s contract” was to state that the agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant would be called off if CNQC subsequently did not appoint the Plaintiff as a sub-contractor. This had to be so as there would then be no job for the Plaintiff, and consequently for the Defendant to do. The plain text supports such an interpretation. It also accords with the commercial realities for the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I am accordingly of the view that the reference to “pending main contractor’s contract” did not negate the parties’ intention to be legally bound by the essential terms set out in the Revised Quotation and Confirmation Email on 24 September 2020. Rather, the legal effect of this clause is to allow parties to terminate their agreement if the Main Contract is not awarded to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In any event, the Main Contract was eventually concluded between CNQC and the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff subsequently emailed the Defendant the Main Contract by email on 23 December 2020 and arranged a meeting with the Defendant. Gary, the Plaintiff’s Mr Dan Ling, and Edward met at the Plaintiff’s office on 29 December 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Notwithstanding the fact that there remained some unresolved issues between the parties after the 29 December meeting, the Defendant did not raise any objections to the existence or validity of its contract with the Plaintiff. The Defendant continued to carry out works on the Electrical Project and did so until end April 2021 when it stopped work. The Defendant even prepared and sent to CNQC the first progress payment claim in January 2021, which was based on the contract sum stated in the Main Contract and in reliance on the payment milestones provided for different work items as set out in the Main Contract. These circumstances suggest that there must have been a binding contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Therefore, even if I accept the Defendant’s case that there was no binding contract between the parties as of 24 September 2020 pending the conclusion of the Main Contract, I am of the view that there must have been a binding agreement between the parties as of 23 December 2020 when the Main Contract was concluded and sent to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What were the terms of the agreement?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Following from the above analysis, the terms of the agreement would include the terms set out in the Confirmation Email and the Revised Quotation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There was, however, no clear indication that the Defendant accepted all the terms contained in the Main Contract. As explained above, the “back-to-back” clause in the Revised Quotation did not have the effect of incorporating the Main Contract terms as of 24 September 2020, since the Defendants had not even seen the Main Contract then. When Angelia emailed the Main Contract to Edward on 23 December 2020, there is no written confirmation from Edward that he accepted the terms of the Main Contract. The Plaintiffs had in the same email forwarding the Main Contract to the Defendant, asked to meet with the Defendant. This took place on 29 December 2020. There is no evidence that Edward agreed to all the terms in the Main Contract at the 29 December 2020 meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On 8 January 2021, Edwards asks Gary by WA: “Bond settle already a not”, to which Gary replied “Processing”, which suggests the Plaintiff was sorting out the issues with the performance bond with CNQC. Under clause 27.2 of the Main Contract, the sub-contractor must furnish an unconditional performance bond to the main contractor, CNQC. If this was truly a “back-to-back” contract in the manner argued by the Plaintiff, the Defendant should be liable for all of the Plaintiff’s obligations under the Main Contract and should be expected to issue the performance bond to CNQC under clause 27.2. However, Gary’s reply suggests that the Plaintiff was responsible for issuing the performance bond. This undermines the Plaintiff’s case that every term in the Main Contract was automatically incorporated into the sub-contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendant pursuant to the “back-to-back” clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Furthermore, in Edward’s 13 January 2021 WA messages to Gary as set out at [54] above, Edward informed Gary that he would need certain issues resolved before he could move forward, which included the MYE and site dormitory issues. This further indicates that the parties have not come to an agreement on all the terms of the Main Contract. In addition, Gary sent a WA message to Edward on 8 March 2021, saying: “U free either tmr or Wednesday. Can we meet up and wrap up the forette contract.”

</div> As the Plaintiff has accepted that the Defendant had done work and that even if there is no agreement, the Defendant is entitled to bring forth claims for <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the issue of the Defendant’s cessation of work does not affect the Defendant’s claims for work done. Instead, it goes towards the Plaintiff’s claim for a declaration that the Defendant indemnifies the Plaintiff for all the losses and damages that CNQC as the main contractor claims against the Plaintiff due to the termination of the Main Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Both parties cite <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo</span> <span class="font-italic">(S) Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”). There, it was held that where a contract does not clearly and unambiguously provide for the event or events pursuant to which an innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract, the innocent party may be entitled to terminate under four possible situations (at [91]–[101]). The two relevant situations in the present case are Situation 3(a) and Situation 3(b), as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “Situation 3(a)”: where the term breached was a condition, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, that it is one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [97]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “Situation 3(b)”: where the breach in question will give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff’s refusal to provide the 20 MYE and the on-site dormitory would fall under Situation 3(a) or Situation 3(b) of <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>, given the importance and necessity to the Defendant of having the MYE and on-site dormitory as cost-saving measures. As I have found that the MYE Term and Dormitory Term were not part of the agreement, there is no foundation for this legal submission of the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Defendant also submits that it is entitled to terminate the contract because the Plaintiff failed to furnish the performance bond to CNQC, which effectively caused CNQC to withhold the equivalent amount in their certification of progress claims, with the material consequence that the Defendant would not be paid for the works carried out. As of 7 May 2021, about eight months after the Defendant had commenced work on the Project, it had not received a single progress payment for the work done on the Project despite CNQC having certified the sum of $161,349 in the value of works carried out (without taking into account the sums withheld for the performance bond). The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff’s repeated and prolonged failure to pay amounted to a repudiatory breach which entitled it to treat the Plaintiff as having repudiated the sub-contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 On the evidence, I am of the view that the issuance of the performance bond was the Plaintiff’s responsibility. The parties’ subsequent conduct and correspondence were consistent with Edward’s testimony that the parties agreed for the Plaintiff to issue the performance bond to CNQC. Notably, under the Defendant’s quotation, there was no mention of any issuance of performance bond on the part of the Defendant. Even in the Revised Quotation, the Plaintiff did not include any terms requiring the Defendant to issue a performance bond, despite adding two new clauses at the bottom of the page. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The parties’ WA correspondence further supports the view that the Plaintiff bears the responsibility to issue the performance bond:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 8 January 2021, Edward asked Gary: “Bond settle already [or] not boss [?]”, to which Gary responded “[p]rocessing”.

This was made clear in <span class="font-italic">Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 288 (“Jia Min”) at [55], where the court stated, citing <span class="font-italic">Lubenham Fidelities and Investments Co Ltd v South Pembrokeshire District Council</span> (1986) 33 BLR 46: ‘[i]t appears settled law that a contractor/subcontractor has no general right at common law to suspend work unless this is expressly agreed upon. This is so even if payment is wrongly withheld’. The court also cited <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Law of Singapore</span>, vol 2 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2003 Reissue) at para 30.321, <span class="font-italic">Keating on Building Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed, 2001) at para 6-96 and <span class="font-italic">Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th ed, 1995) at para 4-223 for the same principle. The rationale for this, the court explained, was that ‘the existence of such a right [to suspend work upon the other party’s failure to make payment] could create chaos within the building industry if contractors were to muscle their way through disputes with threats or actual threats or suspension instead of having their disputes adjudicated’ (at [57])…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In determining whether the failure to make payments amounted to a repudiatory breach, the court will examine the circumstances surrounding the non-payment in determining whether the non-paying party’s conduct demonstrates an intention not to be bound by payment obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In <span class="font-italic">AL Stainless Industries Pte Ltd v Wei Sin Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2001] SGHC 243, the court found that the defendant’s non-payment of $90,000 for the plaintiff’s progress claim amounted to a repudiatory breach because the defendant withheld the entire sum of $90,000 for the third progress claim even after it was recommended for payment by the Quantity Surveyor, due for payment and after the defendant had agreed to pay the same. In addition, the entire $90,000 was withheld without any attempts to assess the impact of the plaintiff’s delay on the main contract or the cost of rectifying defects: at [196]–[197]. In these circumstances, the court found that the defendant had acted in an arbitrary and oppressive manner and was “quite content not to abide by such obligations as and when they fell due if this suited its purpose”: at [198]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In <span class="font-italic">Brani Readymixed Pte Ltd v Yee Hong Pte Ltd</span> and another appeal [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1004 (“<span class="font-italic">Brani Readymixed</span>”), the defendants were late by 22 days in the payment of the bulk of the outstanding invoices. The court found that the defendants were not merely stalling for time to make payment to the plaintiffs and that they did not intend to pay the plaintiffs at all and held that these amounted to a repudiation of the contract: at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The court will also examine the extent of non-payment – whether there is a complete failure to pay throughout the contract or whether the complaining party has already been paid substantially for its progress claims. In <span class="font-italic">Zhong Kai Construction Co Pte Ltd v Diamond Glass Enterprise Pte Ltd</span> [2021] SGHC 277, it was held that there was no persistent course of payments delays which justified the defendant’s repudiation of the contract because prior progress claims were not fully rejected but certified for lower sums, and the plaintiff had substantially paid the amounts that were certified: at [70]–[77]. In contrast, the present case is not one of underpayment. The Defendant did not receive any progress payments for its eight months of work, because the Plaintiff failed to issue the performance bond to CNQC, which resulted in CNQC setting-off the progress payments from the outstanding performance bond sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Plaintiff makes three submissions on this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, the Plaintiff submits that there were further certifications that had to be carried out by the Plaintiff before payment was due to the Defendant.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, I note that the Plaintiff is not able to point to anywhere in the documentation or correspondence that makes reference to such a requirement. The Plaintiff mentions item 9 of the Revised Quotation which states “as per progress claim”. However, this does not state that there has to be certification by the Plaintiff before payment could be made. The Plaintiff also refers to item 12 of the Revised Quotation which states “[t]o receive payment certificate within 14 days” and submits that this must mean certification by the Plaintiff and not CNQC. However, the clause itself does not indicate that it must be the Plaintiff that certifies, rather than CNQC. The context of their arrangement was such that even though the Plaintiff was the sub-contractor of CNQC, the Defendant as the Plaintiff’s sub-contractor would be executing the works for CNQC. Moreover, there is nothing in the correspondence or documentation prior to the Notice to Stop Work on 22 May 2022, that indicates that the Plaintiff required the Defendant to be first certified by the Plaintiff before it could be entitled to payment, even after CNQC certifies payment. On the contrary, the correspondence between Gary and Edward shows that the issue blocking payment was the performance bond and not the lack of certification by the Plaintiff. This can be seen below from the examination of the WA correspondence between them. I hence find no evidential basis for this submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, the Plaintiff submits that the payments were not yet due to the Defendant. The Plaintiff submits that the Defendant did not plead the date on which payment was due from the Plaintiff, nor was it mentioned in Edward’s AEIC. The Plaintiff cites s 8(2) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004 (2020 Rev Ed) which provides that where parties have not agreed on the due date for payment in a construction contract, payment is due to a GST-registered claimant within 14 days after the submission of a tax invoice.

</div> This is not directly relevant since clause 12 of Revised Quotation itself states that the Defendant is to “receive payment within 21 days from tax invoice”. The Plaintiff argues that no tax invoices have been submitted by the Defendant to the Plaintiff. As such, no payment was due to the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The Defendant submits that Edward did seek to issue a tax invoice, but it was Gary who asked Edward not to issue the tax invoice until the Plaintiff had resolved the bond issues with CNQC. At [57] of Gary’s AEIC, he extracts a WA message that Edward sent him on 23 March 2021 saying “Please help me with the 2 payments. Let me know when I can collect and issue Tax Invoice.”

</div> However, Gary only tells Edward to issue the Tax Invoice for another project that the parties are engaged in, namely “TC16”. In respect of the Electrical Project, he informs Edward instead that “[he] will be meeting CNQC [tomorrow] to discuss the payments also”. By this time, CNQC had already certified two progress claims prepared by the Defendant and submitted by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The parties’ WA correspondence on 23 March 2021 suggests that the parties’ working relationship was one where Edward will seek Gary’s instructions before issuing any tax invoices. Edward was clearly seeking the Plaintiff’s instructions as to whether he should issue tax invoices for the two projects. Gary permitted Edward to issue Tax Invoice for TC16 but not for the Electrical Project, saying that he would meet with CNQC to discuss payments on the next day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Notably, when Edward chased Gary for payment again on 26 March 2021, Gary informed Edward on the same day “Bro.

</div> Gary responded that he was waiting for the revised contract clause for the performance bond. Once again, Gary did not indicate that payment was not made to Edward because Edward did not issue any tax invoices – his sole concern appeared to be the performance bond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 More importantly, on 13 April 2021, after Gary asked Edward to take over for fully, Gary said “No matter what will still settle your payment.

</div> This clearly suggests that Gary was not prepared to make the payment to Edward until the bond issue was resolved. There was no discussion, or even contemplation, between the parties about Edward issuing a tax invoice for the progress payments, because DSL was not prepared to make payment until the bond issue was resolved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Following from this evidence, and the finding above that parties agreed that the Plaintiff will issue the performance bond to CNQC, I find that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the parties’ working relationship and common understanding was for the Defendant to confirm with the Plaintiff that payment would be made first, before issuing any tax invoices; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Defendant did not issue the tax invoice in the present case because the Plaintiff was not prepared to proceed with payment until it could renegotiate the bond issue with CNQC; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) as the Plaintiff was the one that told the Defendant not to issue the tax invoice until it resolved the bond issues, the Plaintiff cannot now rely on that to deny the Defendant payment for work done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Third, the Plaintiff submits that its alleged failure to make payment is not prolonged or substantial. Based on the undisputed facts, CNQC’s first payment certificate was issued only on 15 February 2021. The second and third payment certificates were issued on 6 and 19 April 2021. When the Defendant ceased work at the end of April 2021, the first payment was 53 days late and the second payment was only 3 days late. The total amount payable, as of 30 April 2020 was $140,713.08, which is about 2.2% of the $6,348,000. The Plaintiff argues that this is not a substantial delay given that the Electrical Works were to be carried out over thirty-four months, and that the unpaid sum was also not substantial compared to the contract sum.

Hence the duration of non-payment is not determinative in itself. It must be viewed in light of whether there is an intention on the part of the non-paying party to pay the other party in the first place. Neither is the percentage of the total contract sum determinative. It has often been said that cash flow is the life blood of those in the building and construction industry: <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18]. It would hence be a relevant consideration in construction contracts whether the non-payment of progress payments would result in the sub-contractor’s cashflow running dry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 On the evidence, the Defendant had carried out work since September 2020 and was not paid a single cent even as of May 2021. This is despite CNQC having certified the sum of $161,349 in the value of works carried out over three progress claims. The Plaintiff asserts that the amounts which CNQC has certified were payable had been deducted as part of CNQC’s performance bond requirement. It would appear that CNQC was entitled to do so, on the basis of clause 27.2 of the Main Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 First, I note that it is not clear on the evidence that the Plaintiff had not been paid at all by CNQC.

There is no evidence as to why this was sum withheld from the Defendant.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I note that throughout their WA correspondence, there was no indication from Gary to Edward on when payments could be made to the Defendant. As the Plaintiff had not paid for the performance bond, CNQC had been making deductions from the payments that were certified, as payments towards the bond. As set out above, the resolution of the performance bond under the Main Contract was a matter for the Plaintiff to resolve, not the Defendant. There was no agreement that the Defendant would provide the performance bond directly to CNQC. Thus, it was not the Defendant’s fault that CNQC was making deductions from the certified payments towards the performance bond. Rather, it was due to the Plaintiff’s failure to resolve the performance bond issue with CNQC, that payments to Triumph Electrical were being held back. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Throughout this, there was no dispute that work had been done by the Defendant from September 2020 to April 2021. In fact, CNQC itself had certified payments on three occasions, for a total of $161,349. Moreover, there was a payment that CNQC had agreed to, in the amount of $82,800, which was not applied to the deduction for the performance bond, but which inexplicably, was not paid out to the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the midst of this, the Defendant had consistently informed the Plaintiff that it was running out of money. The Plaintiff in turn agreed that the Defendant should be paid. But it never did so, nor did it give any indication of when such payment would be forthcoming or for what amount. Indeed, the Plaintiff would have added to the concerns and uncertainty of the Defendant on 13 April 2021 by asking the Defendant to take over the bond fully, stating that it makes no sense for the Plaintiff to pay so much on the bond and profit so little. This would have reasonably suggested that DSL could not resolve the performance bond issues. This would have meant a further indeterminate period of complete non-payment to the Defendant, as CNQC would continue offsetting the amounts certified to be payable towards the meeting of the performance bond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Gary did not give any indication to Edward that he would be paying the Defendant, even after the bond was revised downwards by CNQC to 5%. As of CNQC’s 3rd Payment Response, CNQC had deducted $62,414.10 as payments towards the performance bond. Even with the bond reduced to 5%, that is from $960,000 to $480,000, there would still be approximately $414,585.90 of deductions to be made by CNQC towards the performance bond. There was no clarity from the Plaintiff of how long this would take to be resolved, before the Defendant would finally get paid, or if the Defendant would eventually be able to recover the sums that CNQC had deducted as payment towards the performance bond. In these circumstances, it would be unfair to expect the Defendant to continue working, after having received no payment at all for eight months from DSL, and without any indication of when the next payment would be or for how much if it carried on working. I thus find that the Defendant was justified in terminating the agreement with the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Consequently, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for a declaration that the Defendant shall indemnify the Plaintiff for CNQC’s losses and damages, and dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim for the loss of profit of $552,000 arising from the termination of the Main Contractor by CNQC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Plaintiff’s claims of the Defendant’s breach of Main Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant has failed to adequately perform various obligation under the parties’ agreement and the Main Contract:

</div> The Plaintiff did not cross-examine the Defendant on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Most of the Plaintiff’s aforementioned claims, are based on clauses in the Main Contract. As I have found above, the inclusion of the term “back-to-back” in the Revised Quotation did not have the effect of importing all the terms of the Main Contract into the parties’ agreement on 24 September 2020, because the Main Contract had not concluded at that point in time. The question is following the analysis in <span class="font-italic">GIB Automation</span>, whether such clauses would be regarded as technical and particular clauses or within the general appreciation and knowledge of parties, with only the latter incorporated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Plaintiff argued that Appendix 2 of the Main Contract should be incorporated into the parties’ contract because the clauses are framed in a general nature and set out the scope of the Electrical Works in broad terms. The plaintiff cited clauses 6, 15 and 40 to show that these clauses seemed to be within the “general appreciation and knowledge” of the defendant, since it had done work pursuant to those clauses.

I therefore proceed to determine whether the individual clauses in Appendix 2 that the Plaintiff seeks to rely on are incorporated into the parties’ agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In relation to the requirement for submissions of drawings in BIM format, which is set out in clause 59 of Appendix 2 of the Main Contract, the Plaintiff argued that this was within the Defendant’s general knowledge, since Edward testified on it. I note that the Plaintiff’s case did not proceed on the basis that drawings in BIM format are the usual or default for such construction contracts. There was no evidence to this effect. Rather, the Plaintiff relied on Edward’s evidence that this was discussed during the 21 September Meeting.  However, Edward’s testimony was that the parties agreed at the 21 September Meeting that there was no need for Triumph Electrical to provide BIM modelling. The BIM modelling would have been priced at approximately $120,000 if it were included in the scope of works of the proposed sub-contract between DSL and Triumph Electrical, and it was not feasible to provide this at the price of $6.99m which was discussed.

However, what the Plaintiff is seeking to rely on, is the opposite of what Edward testified in his AEIC, which is that there was no agreement to include the requirement of BIM modelling. As it stands, the unchallenged evidence of Edward is that the Defendant was told that there was no need to provide BIM modelling. Given that the contract price was reduced significantly from the initial $9m to $6.9m, such evidence is not incredible. I find that the Plaintiff has not proven that there is a breach of the drawings in BIM format obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The Plaintiff submits that the obligation in clause 40 of Appendix 2 of the Main Contract, should also be within the “general appreciation and knowledge” of the parties and incorporated into their agreement.

In response to the court’s queries on whether the amount certified by CNQC was $197,264.56 or the $214,418 claimed by the Defendant, the Defendant took the position that the amount taken as certified by CNQC should be $214,418
