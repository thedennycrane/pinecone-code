TCW has now filed Civil Appeal Originating Summons No 17 of 2019 against my refusal to grant leave to appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In addition to the injunction application, TCW filed on 12 April 2019 a second application in Summons No 1946 of 2019 (“the second injunction application”) which prayers included one to restrain Wang, Pan and Trina from accessing or attempting to gain access to any computer or laptop that belongs to ACPAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 16 April 2019, TCW filed a third application in Summons No 1990 of 2019 (“the third injunction application”) in which he applied to restrain the defendants from holding any EGM or other meetings to remove him and Lin as directors of ACPAM pending the determination of the Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The second and third injunction applications were not dealt with by this court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The injunction application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Besides TCW’s first affidavit, the following affidavits were filed by the parties for the injunction application:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) affidavit of Wee filed on 15 April 2019 (“Wee’s first affidavit”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) affidavit of Wang filed on 15 April 2019 (“Wang’s first affidavit”); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) TCW’s affidavit filed on 22 April 2019 (“TCW’s third affidavit”).

Despite the raising of such concerns by PCGL to ACPAM, there was no response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 To elaborate on [18(f)], in Wee’s OS affidavit, he deposed to the following facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In May 2018, ACPAM issued a capital call to PCGL for $100,000 ostensibly to prevent ACPAM from breaching the base capital requirements applicable to ACPAM as well as for the settlement of ACPAM’s expenses. PCGL complied with the capital call, contributed $100,000 and subscribed for a further 207 shares in ACPAM;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In December 2018, ACPAM sought a further top-up from its shareholders amounting to $41,914.54 which fortunately was avoided at the eleventh hour due to incoming revenue;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On 24 January 2019, ACPAM made a capital call for $102,000 and an interest-free shareholder’s loan for $200,000.

</div>;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) PCGL forwarded a cheque to ACPAM for $66,654 and requested information (and supporting documents) on ACPAM’s need for a further capital call. PCGL’s letter emphasised that its capital contribution was meant to meet ACPAM’s base capital requirements and should not be used for other purposes without PCGL’s prior consent. PCGL received neither the information nor the documentation it requested;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) PCGL consistently appeared to be the only or the primary cash contributor as TCW would purportedly “capitalise” his contributions via offsets of his alleged claims against ACPAM so much so that for the capital call on 24 January 2019 in (c), he contributed only $74 for the 378 shares issued to him claiming to offset the balance contribution against his unpaid and “waived” salaries (both of which had already been waived by him);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) TCW’s practice in (f) to “capitalise” his contribution was repeated for the capital call on 29 March 2019 as PCGL discovered subsequently from ACPAM’s employee that TCW offset his capital contribution against his March 2019 salary and other claims allegedly due to him;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) From the complaint letters it received in [18(a)], PCGL discovered that TCW had proposed that ACPAM invest $20m in Global Invacom Group Limited (“GI”) by way of redeemable convertible notes (“the proposed RCN”). The $20m sum was to come from funds managed by ACPAM in particular AOF1 and Advance Credit Fund (“ACF”). TCW is one of the two directors in AOF1:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) GI intended to raise funds for acquisition purposes and was in discussions with Tactilis Private Limited (“Tactilis”) to acquire Tactilis Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tactilis. At the time, TCW was a non-executive director as well as shareholder of Tactilis holding 8.2% shares. Despite being in a position of conflict, TCW failed to disclose his interest in Tactilis to ACPAM’s and AOF1’s board of directors. Neither did he recuse himself from decisions pertaining to the proposed RCN;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) It was only in February 2019 that TCW’s interest in Tactilis came to light. Following objections from ACF’s directors, TCW represented to them that he would procure ACF’s withdrawal from participation in the proposed RCN. To-date however, PCGL was not aware if ACF had indeed withdrawn from such participation;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) It also came to PCGL’s attention that TCW had in May 2018 attempted to pressurise the directors of AOF1 and ACF into effecting a bridging loan to Tactilis of US$600,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 After the resignations of TCW and PCGL’s other two directors in [18(c)], PCGL made a public announcement on 21 March 2019 concerning the complaints in [18(a)]. It made a separate announcement on the same day that on 19 March 2019, PCGL had received a notice of termination (“the notice of termination”) signed by TCW and Lin, of the management agreement between ACPAM and AOF1 which is ACPAM’s flagship fund and main revenue source. Wee pointed out that the notice of termination was clearly against ACPAM’S interest as it deprived ACPAM of significant management revenue. Subsequently, PCGL learnt that AOF1 signed an agreement to be managed by another fund manager.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Concomitant with the notice of termination, PCGL learnt from ACPAM’s employees that TCW had made preparations to leave ACPAM, and take some employees with him to another company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Wang’s first affidavit accused TCW of deliberately making untruthful and unsubstantiated statements in his affidavits that were designed to cast aspersions on the defendants’ characters and taint the court’s impression of the defendants. Wang deposed to the following facts/events:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ACPAM’s solicitors do not (as TCW alleged) act for him in his dispute with ACPAM over his employment – another law firm does;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was no basis for TCW’s fears over his personal mail that was sent to ACPAM’s office as such mail was/would be forwarded to his solicitors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In regard to TCW’s assertion in [16(i)] that he was denied access to ACPAM’s office, TCW failed to disclose that on 6 April 2019, he was suspended from work and that on the day he alluded to (namely 8 April 2019), the employees of ACPAM were told to report for work at 2.00pm and not 9.00am. Hence, the premises was locked when TCW came to the office that morning. What TCW failed to disclose was that he and Bernard Ong Kheng Chye (a director of ACPAM until 29 October 2018) had attended at ACPAM’s office at 1.15am to remove the existing front door lock of ACPAM and replace it with a new lock;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Wang is on the MAS Register of Representatives and was employed as Portfolio Manager and Fund Director of ACPAM until he was summarily dismissed on 18 March 2019 (by TCW) on alleged grounds which he disputed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 5 April 2019, he was appointed a director of ACPAM together with Pan and Trina pursuant to a resolution passed at an EGM of ACPAM which resolution also removed TCW and Lin as directors of ACPAM; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Pan has extensive experience in asset/fund management and banking. He had been the CEO of Pine Asia Asset Management, an indirect subsidiary of PCGL (by being owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of PCGL) from April 2015 to April 2017;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Trina is the head of Investor Relations and of Marketing for PCGL and has significant marketing and branding experience;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) TCW had deliberately exaggerated and overstated the Regulatory Risk issue by giving the impression that ACPAM’s position as a RFMC had been jeopardised by his removal as a director;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) TCW had alleged that the appointment of Wang, Pan and Trina as directors had to be approved by MAS. That is incorrect. Even if all or any of them did not meet the fit and proper criteria to be appointed directors, that did not mean that ACPAM’s status as a RFMC would be automatically revoked. Under the MAS Guidelines on Licensing, Registration and Conduct of Business for Fund Management Companies (“RFMC Registration Guidelines”), ACPAM as a RFMC only needs to notify MAS of any changes in the company’s particulars within 14 days of such change by way of a notification in Form 23A via the Corporate e-Lodgment (“Cel”) method;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) Owing to Michelle’s wrongful withholding of ACPAM’S MASNET login details

Moreover, he was overseas in the interval between PCGL’s request and the EGM on 5 April 2019.  PCGL’s conduct showed the company was not interested in hearing his explanation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 TCW put the entire blame for his reprimands from MAS on SWY.  He deposed that ACPAM had applied for a CMS licence from MAS on 9 June 2017.  MAS rejected the application on 8 August 2017 because SWY did not make a declaration that he was a fit and proper person to be appointed as executive director and CEO of ACPAM. As SWY was reluctant to provide the declaration, ACPAM made a fresh application for a CMS licence on 22 September 2017 in which it was stated that he (TCW) would be the executive director and CEO of ACPAM.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On 28 September 2017, MAS asked TCW for an assessment of SWY for purposes of the application as well as that all substantial direct and indirect shareholders of ACPAM provide declarations that they were fit and proper persons to participate in a company which operates under a CMS licence. While TCW provided MAS with his declaration, SWY refused to do so. This resulted in MAS rejecting again ACPAM’s application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 TCW deposed that he made various attempts between October 2017 and January 2018 to persuade SWY to provide the declaration to no avail. On 15 January 2018, TCW wrote to inform MAS that SWY would not provide the declaration requested. By its email reply dated 16 January 2018, MAS expressed its dissatisfaction with SWY’s position and ACPAM’s position. TCW deposed he continued to appease MAS without success. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On 9 April 2018, MAS wrote to ACPAM requiring the latter to take steps to ensure that SWY would not be appointed as a representative or a director of ACPAM and that SWY would not have any direct or indirect role in ACPAM’s affairs nor should its shares be sold to SWY. TCW informed MAS on 7 May 2018 that there were limitations to ACPAM’s ability to ensure that its indirect shareholders were fit and proper given that PCGL is a listed company. He emailed MAS on 10 May 2018 to comply with the directives given on 9 April 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 After a further email from MAS dated 28 June 2018 reiterating what it stated on 9 April 2018, MAS issued a reprimand on 30 July 2018 to ACPAM (and not to TCW personally) for omitting to state that SWY is its shareholder in its application for a CMS licence on 22 September 2017. MAS was also not informed that SWY was involved in several civil lawsuits in 2017. TCW was then approached by MAS representatives who insisted that if SWY was unwilling to provide the declaration requested, he should be persuaded to relinquish his direct and indirect interests in ACPAM.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As a result, on 17 October 2018, Pine Partners transferred its 9% direct shareholdings in ACPAM to TCW resulting in him holding 49% shares. However, SWY was unwilling to relinquish his shares in PCGL.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On 8 February 2019 MAS gave TCW notice that he would be reprimanded as a director and CEO of ACPAM, based on ACPAM’s application for a CMS licence on 22 September 2017. Notwithstanding his explanation to MAS on 22 February 2019 that <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> stated that SWY was not a direct shareholder of ACPAM and ACPAM did not appreciate that the declaration requirement applied to indirect shareholders, MAS reprimanded him by its letter dated 12 April 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Seen in its proper context, TCW asserted that the MAS reprimand in [41] was not an indication that he is not a fit and proper person to be a director of ACPAM. Rather, it evidences that MAS is concerned over SWY being an indirect shareholder of ACPAM and SWY’s persistent refusal to provide the necessary information for ACPAM’s CMS licence application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Accordingly, TCW deposed that it made no sense for PCGL to proceed with the EGM on 5 April 2019 on the basis of urgency since the reprimand from MAS was in July 2018 for ACPAM’s CMS licence application submitted in September 2017. He alleged that it was the actions of SWY through PCGL that caused ACPAM’s ability to continue as a RFMC to be at risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 TCW elaborated on his allegation by pointing out that SWY had increased his effective interest in ACPAM by acquiring the majority shareholding in PCGL. Secondly, all the current board members of PCGL are appointed by SWY and/or his associates including Pan and Wee. PCGL then purported to replace the entire board of ACPAM with persons associated with SWY.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In regard to Wang’s allegation in [25] that he wrongfully withdrew RM3m from AOF1’s bank account, TCW explained that it was done to fulfil AOF1’s existing commitments and was done in the interest of AOF1 and ACPAM. TCW claimed he made active trades and transactions in the ordinary course of business for and on behalf of AOF1 which funds came from various investors. He deposed that his team (comprising of himself, Michelle, Lynn and Charlene) are the key employees in charge of managing the funds under ACPAM’s management. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 TCW claimed that AOF1 had committed itself to three transactions with Tanco Holdings Berhad, Eden Inc Berhad and Tiger Synergy Berhad for which AOF1 must make payment by 12 April 2019. To meet the payment deadline, instructions had to be given to AOF1’s bank (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CIMB Bank) by 10 April 2019 in order for the funds to reach the three payees in time. He had instructed his solicitors to seek the consent of Wang, Pan and Trina on the morning of 10 April 2019 through the trio’s solicitors and to use the computers and bank tokens on ACPAM’s premises for the limited purpose of carrying out the banking transaction on behalf of AOF1. The three defendants’ response was to raise various spurious queries and subsequently requested that AOF1 undertake that it will indemnify ACPAM for any losses that ACPAM may incur as a result of consenting to the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 TCW took the view that the defendants were being obstructive and did not appreciate the urgency and gravity of the situation. He claimed that any discussion with them would only cause further delays in effecting payment and would result in AOF1 defaulting on its obligations and ACPAM to be liable to AOF1 for causing the default. Consequently, TCW took it upon himself on 10 April 2019 to visit the main branch of CIMB and arrange for payment to be made by AOF1 when he “happened to be in Kuala Lumpur on that day for a business trip”.

</div>
</div> Had it not been for the defendants’ obstructiveness, the payment could have been carried out ACPAM’s premises using its bank tokens. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the alleged irregularities raised by Wee at [18(a)], TCW asserted that Wang had mischaracterised the concerns raised by AA and Sarkis in their emails dated 10 April 2019 addressed to ACPAM. The two had sought to redeem their investments in AOF1. He had informed them that their investment would be “gated” <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they would be paid in stages in accordance with the terms of their investment. This was to prevent a run on the fund and to avoid the fund having to liquidate its investment at fire sale prices to the detriment of the entire value of the fund. The two merely expressed their unhappiness in their aforementioned emails even though as fund managers themselves, they were aware of the practice of gating redemptions. The Placing Memorandum of AOF1 clearly spelt out the redemption restrictions to not more than 20% of a relevant class of funds being redeemed. AA’s and Sarkis’ investment comprised of 100% of a particular class of funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 TCW alleged that the first affidavits of Wee and Wang only made ambiguous suppositions as to whether the second to fourth defendants are fit and proper persons to be directors. He contended that it is untrue that MAS did not take an adverse position to their appointments and did not state that they cannot hold office. In support of his position, TCW referred to the response dated 9 April 2019 from MAS to Wang’s email to the former dated 8 April 2019.  I will return to this email exchange later

</div> to explain why it did not help TCW’s case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 TCW accused Wang of downplaying the gravity of appointing Wang, Pan and Trina as directors of ACPAM in violation of MAS’ directives as they effectively gave SWY full control of ACPAM. This caused ACPAM to be at risk of losing its RFMC status with the potential consequence of PCGL being delisted to the detriment of its shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As for Wang’s insinuation that he was not fit and proper to be a director due to his suspension and fine in 2000 and 2004 respectively by SGX for breaching SGX’s rules, TCW pointed out that the fact he was a director of PCGL after that clearly showed that was not the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54  As for Wang’s request that he and the three ladies named in [6(c)] above should return the bank tokens and MASNET details of ACPAM, TCW pointed out that the 9 April Order in [5] put a “stand-still” in place. As Wang was prohibited by that order of court from exercising the functions of CEO of ACPAM, there was no reason for him to have either the bank tokens or MASNET details. TCW denied Wang’s allegation that he attempted to or did, disable, ACPAM’s email and web domain host and server, and its Microsoft 365 account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 TCW did not deny that he had changed the locks on the main door of ACPAM on 6 April 2019. He justified his action on the basis it was done to protect and secure ACPAM’s offices as, by that date, it was clear to him that “the [first] to [fourth] defendants were going to attempt to access ACPAM’s offices”.

Just because he had an automatic right of appeal in the OS did not mean he should be granted leave to appeal in the Suit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 TCW’s fourth affidavit was a rehash of the allegations he levelled against SWY in TCW’s OS and third affidavits referred to earlier at [29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 TCW and/or his counsel identified the following matters as the basis for the court to exercise its discretion to grant him leave to appeal pursuant to s 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 323, 2006 Rev Ed):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There had been a <span class="font-italic">prima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie </span>error of law committed by this court in granting leave to PCGL to convene a fresh EGM as that must be premised on the fact that the EGM of 5 April 2019 and the resolutions passed thereat were not valid and/or effectual. That meant that as a matter of law, the directors of ACPAM would have been TCW and Lin and further meant that they ought to be reinstated as directors of ACPAM;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was a question of importance upon which further argument and the decision of the Court of Appeal would be in the public interest as to whether he was entitled to restrain the second to fourth defendants from acting as directors of ACPAM pending the resolution of his minority oppression claim in the Suit;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) As the court made no order on prayer (a) of the OS which was to regularise the EGM on 5 April 2019, does it mean that the previous EGM remains invalid?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Section 182 of the Cos Act was being used by the defendants in an unusual manner – to order a meeting in order to ratify a meeting that had already been held. This was a question that calls for a clear answer that is capable of being precisely formulated – making an order under s 182 of the Cos Act for a new EGM to be called to ratify a prior irregular means that the latter is invalid or, making such an order means that the prior irregular EGM remains “valid”. This question had not been examined in Singapore previously;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) All three issues raised in (b) to (d) above gave rise to questions which called for clear answers from the Court of Appeal (citing the second and third tests in <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew </span><span class="font-italic">v Tang Liang Hong</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR (R) 862 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew</span><span class="font-italic">’s case”</span>);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Another error of this court was its reliance on TCW’s apparent breach of the “standstill” orders made under the 9 April Order as a ground for dismissing the injunction application in the first 24 April Order. It was submitted that the reliefs TCW sought would not in any event have had a necessary and immediate relation to the reliefs he sought – TCW was relying on the facts surrounding the EGM on 5 April 2019 for his injunction application and this stands quite apart from his conduct relating to his apparent breach of the 9 April Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Even if TCW’s alleged wrongdoing bore the necessary relation to the relief he was seeking, the relief he sought should have been granted because the conduct of the second to fourth defendants was also worthy of censure. PCGL had taken steps between 4 and 5 April 2019, amounting to a corporate ambush to oust TCW from ACPAM by requisitioning, and then holding, an EGM. This was done when TCW was out of the country. The defendants’ wrongful actions were designed to render futile the fruit of TCW’s minority litigation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The fact that the injunction application was dismissed on the basis of TCW’s unclean hands showed that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> error in the court’s decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In regard to (f), it was argued on TCW’s behalf that the defendants’ allegation (that TCW withdrew RM3m from the bank account of AOFI)

</div> disputed the “interconnection” between the OS and the injunction application in the Suit as a ground for leave to appeal.  Wee asserted that TCW’s argument is misconceived – just because an appeal arises out of the same fact pattern is not a ground for leave to appeal.  TCW’s appeal (in CA 94/2019) in the OS can proceed independently without there being an appeal in the Suit for the injunction application. Further, the OS has no overlap with the legal test relevant to the injunction application, which is concerned with whether there is a serious question to be tried and whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting an injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Wee added that there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> error of law as TCW had contended so as to warrant granting TCW leave to appeal.

</div> that this court had failed to account for the period 24 April 2019 and 10 May 2019 (when the second EGM referred to in the OS was held) and that during that interval, given the orders made in the OS, it must follow that TCW and Lin remained directors of ACPAM prior to 10 May 2019. Wee pointed out that part of the second 24 April Order provided that the interim measures made in the 9 April Order would be discharged once the orders made under the second 24 April Order are implemented. By directing that the appointments of the second to fourth defendants would be held in abeyance in the “holding orders” made that day, this court had catered for the interim period 24 April 2019 to 10 May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64   As for TCW’s alleged legitimate expectation to participate in the management of ACPAM pursuant to the alleged agreement made between him and SWY in or around 2017, Wee deposed there was no evidence to support TCW’s assertions.

</div> that he withdrew RM3m to meet contractual payment obligations but he failed to explain why no mention was made of this fact at the 9 April 2019 hearing, which was one day before he made the withdrawal in Kuala Lumpur. Neither did he inform ACPAM after he made the withdrawal nor that the payment was to meet contractual obligations. Indeed, ACPAM only discovered the payment five days later when it saw the withdrawal in its bank statement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The dispute arose from a narrow set of facts, there was no law involved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(i) The injunction application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I move now to the arguments that were presented by the parties starting with those presented on behalf of TCW. Essentially, TCW’s arguments were a rehash of his affidavit. According to him, only he is a fit and proper person to be ACPAM’s director, not Wang or Pan or Trina.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In his submissions, TCW place great emphasis on the fact that SWY and him had an understanding that he would always remain a director and shareholder of ACPAM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In regard to the EGM, it was submitted by TCW’s counsel that its requisition by PCGL’s corporate representative Hariz Lee (“Lee”) was invalid for lack for authority. The corporate representative also had no authority to give notice of the meeting as that should have been done by a director. These were not procedural but substantive irregularities (<span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Keng Poon v Thio Syn Pyn and others and another appeal</span> [2010] 3 SLR 143).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Counsel for TCW pointed out that ACPAM and PCGL had not addressed the issue of the invalidity of the EGM that removed TCW as a director. He repeated his submission that notice of the EGM was given by Lee as a corporate representative of ACPAM instead of by a member of ACPAM. This mandatory requirement under s 176 of the Cos Act cannot be overlooked with the result that any resolution passed at the EGM is invalid. A court has no power to order directors to convene an EGM (<span class="font-italic">Smith v Fitzroy Finance</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Ltd</span> (1982) 6 ACLR 294 as PCGL sought to do by the OS. If TCW’s case is one of oppression, a court cannot dispense with the requirement under s 176 and allow PCGL to hold a meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In regard to SWY, it was pointed out by counsel for ACPAM that nowhere in TCW’s first affidavit did TCW raise the understanding – it was only in TCW’s OS affidavit in response to PCGL’s application in the OS that he made mention of the understanding. Moreover, if indeed there was such an agreement, then (according to PCGL’s counsel, Mr Chan), there should be some (strong) evidence placed before the court instead of only a mere allegation. If there is no alleged agreement, then there is no prejudice to TCW in his removal from the board of ACPAM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It was said by Mr Chan that there was nothing pleaded <span class="font-italic">vis</span><span class="font-italic">-à-vis</span> the alleged agreement with SWY in the Suit nor in the affidavit to support the injunction application. That alleged agreement only surfaced in TCW’s OS affidavit. Yet, the defendants noted that the alleged agreement formed almost the entire basis for the injunction application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It was further pointed out by Mr Chan that if TCW is reinstated as a director of ACPAM, would he re-enter into a management agreement with AOF1?  It seemed to him that TCW had adopted a “scorch earth” policy. TCW’s attitude appeared to be “If I can’t benefit from this, neither can you”. In other words, TCW was protecting and could not look beyond, his own interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As for TCW’s claims that MAS’ reprimands were directed at SWY, counsel for the defendants (Mr Pillai) disagreed. He drew the court’s attention to the language/contents of the reprimands – they were addressed to TCW.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Both counsel for ACPAM and PCGL contended that TCW had failed to satisfy the second and third principles required for injunction applications – quite apart from the fact that there must be triable issues. TCW did not address (i) the balance of convenience issue and (ii) whether damages would be an adequate remedy were the injunction to be discharged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">(ii) The Leave Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 While TCW contended he had, counsel for the defendants contended that he had failed to satisfy the requisite criteria for being granted leave to appeal namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error of law that has a bearing on the decision of the court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there is a question of law decided for the first time or, a question of law of importance upon which a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c)  there is a question of law on which there is a conflict of judicial authority and a pronouncement from a higher court in the judicial hierarchy is desirable citing <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew’s </span>case, which principles were reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman bin </span><span class="font-italic">Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Rahman</span>”) [1999] 3 SLR(R) 138 at [31]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Consequently, the defendants contended that the Leave Application must be dismissed <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">limine.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Counsel for PCGL referred to an exception to criterion no.

He referred to the case that was cited on behalf of TCW in that regard namely <span class="font-italic">Essar Steel Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bayerische Landesbank</span> <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">others</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 25 (“<span class="font-italic">Essar Steel</span>”).

This conclusion is supported by TCW’s conduct post-9 April 2019.  The chronology of events set out at [18] to [25] above showed that on 10 April 2019, the very next day after the interim injunction was granted, unbeknownst to the court and to PCGL or ACPAM, TGCW went behind ACPAM’s back (in the words of their counsel) to withdraw RM3m of AOF1’s funds held in ACPAM’s sub-account with CIMB in Kuala Lumpur.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In this regard, the court is highly sceptical of TCW’s claim

</div> to the following facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The apparent confusion between the affairs of ACPAM and AOF1 – the bank account from which the RM3m was withdrawn was an AOF1 sub-account under ACPAM (which meant the account holder was ACPAM). The only way TCW could withdraw the sum from the said account was pursuant to ACPAM’s rights under the investment agreement with AOF1. ACPAM handled all investment matters of AOF1 and managed all of AOF1’s funds. Accordingly, when TCW withdrew the sum, he was acting in his capacity as a director of ACPAM and not in his capacity as a director of AOF1. Clearly, his action was against the standstill ordered in the 9 April Order;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was disingenuous of TCW to claim that he thought the 9 April Order only applied to ACPAM and not AOF1. If that was really the case, why would TCW need to seek ACPAM’s consent to execute the said transaction?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) TCW well knew before the 9 April hearing that AOF1 had to make the payment (according to him). Yet, in seeking the 9 April Order, he did not see the need to inform the court and obtain the necessary directions and orders. Neither did TCW disclose his withdrawal of the RM3m <span class="font-italic">after </span>10 April 2019; ACPAM only discovered it from their bank statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The court took a dim view of TCW’s deliberate disregard of the standstill orders made on 9 April 2019. His explanation in [80] for his “inadvertent” breach is incredible and unacceptable to this court. It was a well- planned operation on his part – apply to court for an injunction to stop the defendants from removing him and, while he was still a director and CEO of ACPAM, go to Kuala Lumpur to effect the payment on behalf of AOF1 from ACPAM’s CIMB account which he knew full well PCGL and other directors not aligned with him would have opposed and which they did. TCW made use of this court and misused the judicial process for his own ends. Such reprehensible conduct cannot be condoned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 TCW was also guilty of several material non-disclosures. In TCW’s first affidavit, he had made himself out to be an indispensable CEO without whose services ACPAM would be doomed and would lose its RFMC licence issued by MAS.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, the statement in TCW’s first affidavit

None of the defendants were party to that understanding he had with SWY nor were they bound by it if it did exist – so why did TCW not sue SWY? It bears remembering that SWY through his shareholding in Pine Partners is a minority shareholder of ACPAM; he is not even a director. SWY only acquired a majority of the shares in PCGL in or about 4 February 2019.  It is equally noteworthy that TCW’s claim of his common understanding with SWY that he would always remain a director of ACPAM is inconsistent with one of the reliefs he has claimed in the Suit – that ACPAM be wound up.

</div> that clause 10.5 of his employment contract entitled him to have ACPAM bear those expenses is no answer to why he would need six instead of only one mobile telephone like other CEOs. Giving TCW the full benefit of the doubt, the court had even inquired of Mr Pillai if any of the six mobile telephones were for use in foreign countries and was told they were not.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The court also wondered why as a CEO, TCW would need to subscribe to Spotify’s music streaming service and Singtel’s television package. Spotify’s subscribers are usually teenagers, students, young adults and the like. Whilst clause 10.5 of his contract of employment does state that TCW “will be reimbursed all telecommunication expenses incurred”, surely it would not extend to music streaming service or television viewing packages. Indeed, in the ordinary course of business of any company, these services would not even be contemplated as coming within the scope of such a clause for a person in the position of a CEO. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 There was little doubt that TCW abused the perquisites that were given to him as the CEO of ACPAM.  Coupled with a prayer for ACPAM to be wound up as part of the reliefs that he claimed in the Suit, the court entertained grave doubts as to the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of the injunction application.

It is a truism that he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. Here, TCW’s hands were not clean.

This court’s decision there has no relevance to the decision made in the first 24 April Order for which leave to appeal was required and refused - there was no interconnection between the two sets of proceedings.

Based on <span class="font-italic">Smith v </span><span class="font-italic">Cosworth</span>, leave to appeal will be granted unless the grounds of appeal have no realistic prospects of success. However, the appellate court (at [14]) made it clear (and which it endorsed) that <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew’s</span> case required a much higher threshold – the establishment of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of error, before leave to appeal would be granted; it did not approve of the <span class="font-italic">Smith v </span><span class="font-italic">Cosworth </span>test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In TCW’s fourth affidavit, he had relied on paragraph 68 (set out at [80] above) as an error of law for one of his reasons to be given leave to appeal.
