<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This is an application by the plaintiff for leave to commence a

derivative action in the name of the third defendant company against the first and second

defendants. The plaintiff as well as the first and second defendants were at the material

times, directors of the third defendant. The thrust of the plaintiff's application is

founded on breach of fiduciary duties of directors. The subject matter were payments made

in 1997 and 1998 by the Australian Wheat Board (later renamed and reconstituted as the

Australian Wheat Board Limited) by way of rebates known as "volume rebates" for

the purchase of wheat by the third defendant from them. Nothing significant turns on the

change of name of the Australian body so it may conveniently be referred to as the

Australian Wheat Board. The plaintiff claims that the third defendant company, as the

customer of the Australian Wheat Board, was the rightful party entitled to these rebates

but it never received them because the Australian Wheat Board gave the rebates to various

other parties on the instructions of the first defendant and one Tom Goh, a manager of the

third defendant. The third defendant was not a party when the plaintiff took out this

application. Counsel for the company asked for leave to make submissions on behalf of the

company. Leave was refused since the company was not a party to the proceedings.

Consequently, an application was made and the company became the third defendant in these

proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. Mr. Lim appearing on behalf of the first and second defendants

oppose the plaintiff’s application on two grounds. First, he says that the third

defendant was not entitled to the rebates; and secondly, that the application must fail

because the plaintiff himself consented to the rebates being paid to some external

parties, and thus he has not acted in good faith when he brought the present proceedings

before the court. Mr. Bull, on behalf of the third defendant, made a similar submission in

opposing this application. In support of their respective positions, the parties filed

numerous and lengthy affidavits. Notwithstanding that, Mr. Lim sought leave to file some

more affidavits to refute "serious and wrongful assertions of facts" by the

plaintiff. He also submitted that cross-examination of some deponents would be necessary

for the court to determine who speaks the truth. I shall address these points shortly, but

first, it will be helpful to lay down some relevant details.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The plaintiff was a major shareholder of the third defendant and was

one of its directors until his removal in August 2000, the reason for which he claims, was

to prevent him from making further inquiry into the rebate payments in question. He is

presently a 40% shareholder of the third defendant. The first defendant now holds 20% of

the shares and a company called Intermilling Hong Kong Limited holds the remaining 40%

shares and whose interests are being represented by the second defendant on the board of

directors of the third defendant. The plaintiff avers that the third defendant began

purchasing wheat from the Australian Wheat Board in 1997 and it was only in late December

1999 that he discovered that rebates were paid to customers and that the third defendant

enjoyed rebates of US$1.75 per metric tonne in 1997 and US$2.25 per metric tonne in 1998.

However, he learnt from James Dewan, the regional marketing manager of the Australian

Wheat Board, that the rebates amounting to US$950,000 were paid to third party bank

accounts (one of which was said to be in Hong Kong) on the instructions of the first

defendant. Consequently, in June 2000, the plaintiff through his solicitors demanded to

inspect the third defendant's accounts. Instead, he was removed as a director on 11 August

2000 and was denied access to the accounts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The first and second defendants initially denied that the third

defendant was entitled to any rebate from the Australian Wheat Board. They also deposed

that the company purchased wheat for an Indonesian entity known as BULOG (an acronym for <i>Banda

Urusan Logistik</i>) and that if any rebate was given it would have been rightfully given

to BULOG. On my direction, parties obtained the evidence from the Australian Wheat Board.

It wrote a letter dated 8 November 2001 to the plaintiff stating that Citra Flour Mill was

its customer from 1997 to 1999. The Australian Wheat Board also stated in its 8 November

letter that it paid rebates to whichever account as may be instructed by the first

defendant or Tom Goh. It also said that the Australian Wheat Board did not know what

relationship BULOG had with the third defendant and neither did it have any dealings with

BULOG. The said letter suggested that rebates due to Citra Flour Mill in 1997 and 1998

were paid Mitsubishi Australia Limited, and a company called Gismo Investments Limited, a

company in which the first defendant was also a director until 21 August 2001. In addition

to these rebates, which were known as "volume rebates", the Australian Wheat

Board also gave "price rebates" on the price of wheat sold. The plaintiff avers

that these price rebates, like the volume rebates, were also paid to unauthorized third

party accounts when they ought rightfully be paid to the third defendant. The price

rebates came to a sum of US$9,168,083.33 and were paid to a company called Milling

Consultants which is owned by the first defendant and his wife.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The first and second defendants' version of the story was this.

Before the third defendant was created, there was a company called Comfez which acted as

the broker in purchasing wheat from the Australian Wheat Board on behalf of BULOG which in

turn sold the wheat to Citra Flour Mills Persada (Citra Flour Mills - Citra Flour Mills is

now known as PT Panganmas Inti Persada and the plaintiff is its majority shareholder as

well as President Director). In the scheme of arrangement, all rebates from the Australian

Wheat Board were paid to an account of a company called Wheatrac Limited; and the money in

this account went to the individual shareholders of Citra Flour Mills. After the third

defendant was incorporated on 7 August 2001 and took over the role previously played by

Comfez, the rebates (hitherto paid to Wheatrac) were paid to Gismo Investments Ltd, and

presumably, the plaintiff and his father who were its shareholders. No rebates were ever

paid to Comfez or the third defendant. And on this account, it was submitted on behalf of

all the defendants, that the plaintiff's application must fail because the third defendant

was not entitled to any rebate, and secondly, given the role of Gismo Investments Ltd and

the plaintiff's shareholding in it, the plaintiff obviously did not act in good faith when

he made the application.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. Miss Hing responded on behalf of the plaintiff by asserting that the

bank account of Gismo Investments Ltd was operated solely by the first defendant who did

not account to him or his father. This was a strange state of affairs, the how’s and

why’s of which were not adequately explained. Counsel also referred me to the

plaintiff's fourth affidavit which explains the purpose of Gismo Investments Ltd and why

the first defendant was employed by that company, namely to provide consultancy services

to a company called Citra Flour Mills Nusantara. She also pointed to the apparent

weaknesses in a Price Waterhouse Coopers’ report of 14 December 2001 which stated in

its conclusion that it was BULOG which is entitled to the rebates. The plaintiff also

denied any knowledge of payment of rebates into or out of Gismo Investments Ltd's account

in his fourth affidavit. Hence, Mr. Lim sought leave to file a further affidavit in

response to this, and also to have the plaintiff cross-examined. I do not see any need to

expand or broaden the case at this stage. At this stage the court need not and ought not

be drawn into an adjudication on the disputed facts. That is what a <i>prima facie</i>

legitimate or arguable case is all about. Leave to cross-examine in such situations ought

to be sparingly granted. I need only consider the grounds and points of challenge raised

by the defendants to see if they are sufficient in themselves to destroy the credibility

of the plaintiff's propounded case without a full scale hearing to determine who was

truthful and who was not.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The requirements under s 216A of the Companies Act that the

applicant has to satisfy are straightforward and are set out in sub-s 3 of that section.

The defendants in this case challenged the application on all three requirements. I shall

deal quickly with the shortest one first. Mr. Bull argued that the plaintiff did not give

the requisite 14 days notice because he applied to amend the application to include a

claim for the price rebate when his application was initiated on the basis of a claim for

"volume rebates". In my view, the amendment was in respect of the particulars;

the action for which leave was sought concerned a breach of fiduciary duties and I am

satisfied that the defendants were in no way prejudiced by the inclusion the additional

item especially since the basic position of the defendants is the same in respect of both

rebates. Secondly, in respect of the argument that the action cannot be in the interests

of the company. Mr. Bull referred to the decision in <i>Teo Gek Luang v Ng Ai Tiong &amp;

Ors</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47645&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 1 SLR 434</a> for his argument that the phrase "<i>prima facie</i> in the

interests of the company" means that the applicant must show a good arguable case. I

set out below the passage relied upon by counsel, for ease and convenience:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Although it was and is a piece of remedial legislation enacted to

  put in place a procedure to protect the interests of minority shareholders, the

  interpretation of the provisions should be purposive and I entertained some reservation

  that a ‘liberal interpretation in favour of the complainant should be given as stated

  by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd v Kalmacoff </i>(1955)

  123 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 628, 636. Management decisions should generally be left to the

  Board of Directors. Members generally cannot sue in the name of the company. A minority

  shareholder could attempt to abuse the new procedure, which would be as undesirable as the

  tyranny of the majority directors who unreasonably refuse to act. The Canadian appellate

  court, however, at the same page went on to say that ‘(<i>b)efore granting leave, the

  court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable basis for the complaint and that the

  action sought to be instituted is a legitimate or arguable one.</i>’ I agree with

  this latter formulation and adopted that approach" [Emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. I, in turn, agree entirely with what was said in the above case. The

terms "legitimate" and "arguable" must be given no other meaning other

than what is the common and natural one, that is, that the claim must have a reasonable

semblance of merit; not that it is bound to succeed or likely to succeed, but that if

proved the company will stand to gain substantially in money or money's worth. But it is

axiomatic that ordinarily, legal action is best left to the decision of the board of

directors. It will not be in the interests of a company if all shareholders are at liberty

to take it to court on Quixotic crusades. This is obviously more pertinent where there are

many diverse groups of shareholders in the company. In the present case, there are

admittedly, only three groups of shareholders divided into two camps, one the majority and

the other the minority. Furthermore, in this case, if the plaintiff is right and proves

his case, the third defendant stands to gain a large sum of reimbursement from the first

and second defendants - much more than the $13,322.58 that the applicant in <i>Teo Gek

Luang</i> case was granted leave to pursue. These are clearly important considerations.

However, the requirements under s 216A must first be satisfied. In this regard, one must

not lose sight of what the plaintiff sought to achieve with this application. That was

made clear from the beginning, namely, that the first and second defendants were in breach

of their fiduciary duties in causing rebates from the Australian Wheat Board to be

channeled to a third party. The <i>prima facie</i> case that he must show is that the

company was entitled to these rebates. The affidavits and documents that were filed in

this case, as well as the numerous submissions made by counsel for all parties have at

best raised some suspicion that the plaintiff and the first defendant might not have told

their stories to court, the full and true. Cutting away the verbiage, dust and smoke, I am

satisfied that on the documentary evidence that Mrs. Thio (who took over as counsel for

the first and second defendants midway through the proceedings) drew my attention to - in

particular, the documents from the Australian Wheat Board - the beneficiary to any rebate

from the Australian Wheat Board is the company called Citra Flour Mill and not the third

defendant. For this reason alone, the plaintiff's application must fail. I accept that

there are some unanswered questions, for example, it is certainly baffling as to why the

first defendant was running a personal account for Gismo, the company in which the

plaintiff and his father were at all material times the shareholders and through which

rebates from the Australian Wheat Board to Citra Flour Mill were paid. Questions such as

this, by themselves, are not, however, relevant in an application under s 216A. Whether

they may be more relevant in some other cause of action is not necessary for my comment,

although it will not have escaped the parties that if the defendants are right, Citra

Flour Mill (which I understand was and still is under the control of the plaintiff) is the

proper party to claim the rebates. That, of course, is another story. Having perused and

considered the documents and submissions here, I am satisfied that there is no necessity

to file any further affidavit or for any deponent to be cross-examined. Accordingly, those

applications are dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. Counsel for the defendants submitted that the application proper

ought to be dismissed because the plaintiff did not act in good faith. It is not an

important point in view of my finding above, but I will address an argument by Mr. Bull

that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he acted in good faith. The question of

the burden of proof on this specific issue may end up in the great heap of irrelevance,

but all that s 216A(3)(b) says is that the court must be satisfied that the applicant

acted in good faith. If at all, the burden would be on the opponent to show that the

applicant did not act in good faith; for I am entitled, am I not, to assume that every

party who comes to court with a reasonable and legitimate claim to be acting in good faith

- until proven otherwise. What the term <i>good faith </i>actually means in this context

has baffled many an academic scholar of the law - see, for example, <i>Corporate Law In

Canada: The Governing Principles</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed) by GB Welling, at page 528, and <i>Minority

Shareholders' Rights And Remedies</i>, M Chew at page 246. It would appear, in my view,

that this requirement overlaps in no small way with the requirement that the claim must be

in the interests of the company. Beyond that, whether malice or vindictiveness of the

applicant ought to be taken into account must be left to the touch and feel of the court

in each individual case because, as in most requirements of the law that repose a measure

of discretion with the court, there are bound to be matters and factors that defy any or

any precise description. Having address my mind thus, I revert to the present case. In

this regard, I shall have to reiterate my doubts that the parties have been fully candid.

But it must be remembered for the purposes of an application under s 216A, the party whose

good faith is put in issue is that of the applicant. In taking the circumstances as set

out in the affidavits and gleaned from the documents, regardless of whose burden it was to

prove or disprove good faith, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff came before me in good

faith. Good faith would have required him to set out the story in full from the beginning

but he did not do so. I am not persuaded that he had no idea that the Australian Wheat

Board had been giving and paying rebates through the company Gismo Investments in which he

and his father were shareholders and directors. The plain statement that the bank accounts

of that company were operated by the first defendant alone is not a sufficient explanation

because it raises further questions such as to how and why that was allowed to be so. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. For these reasons this application fails and is accordingly

dismissed. I shall hear the parties as to the question of costs at a later date if they

are unable to agree.</p>
