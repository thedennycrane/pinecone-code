        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”) which is reported as <em>ANB v ANC and another</em> [2014] 4 SLR 747 (“the
                    GD”). At the conclusion of proceedings below, the Judge set aside,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, an interim injunction previously
                    granted at the <em>ex parte</em> stage in favour of the
                    Appellant restraining the Respondents from using, disclosing or destroying
                    certain information in their possession which was extracted from the hard disk
                    of the Appellant’s personal notebook computer and which the Appellant
                    alleged was taken, copied and distributed in breach of confidence. We allowed
                    the appeal and granted an interlocutory injunction on terms and upon certain
                    undertakings given by the Appellant and the solicitors of both parties. The full
                    details of the orders made and the undertakings given are set out in the
                    document titled “Annex A” which is appended to our grounds of
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       We were informed only recently that the parties
                    had arrived at an amicable full and final settlement. In the circumstances, and
                    given that the parties had consented to the discharge of the undertakings
                    mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this court directed that the undertakings
                    be discharged forthwith without requiring the parties’ attendance before
                    it. However, given the importance of the legal issues hitherto raised in the
                    proceedings before us we are of the view that – in addition to setting out
                    the reasons for our decision – we should also flag out some of the more
                    salient points that will need to be considered in more detail when these issues
                    come before the courts for a definitive ruling in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant and the 1st Respondent were,
                    at the time the appeal was heard and decided, husband and wife, respectively.
                    They were also, at that particular point in time, involved in acrimonious
                    divorce proceedings. They have two children aged six and eight who were, as
                    noted by the Judge at various junctures of the GD, unfortunately caught in the
                    acrimonious currents of the divorce proceedings. The 2nd Respondent was the
                    law firm which represented the wife. Although there were various circumstances
                    surrounding the divorce proceedings that were laid down by the Judge in the GD,
                    we reproduce only the relevant facts that concerned the case before us,
                        <em>ie</em>, those surrounding the alleged
                    surreptitious copying of information stored in the Appellant’s personal
                    notebook computer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It was not disputed that the 1st Respondent had
                    moved out of the matrimonial home on 26 September 2012 to reside somewhere
                    else. Divorce proceedings were thereafter commenced by the 1st Respondent on
                    10 October 2012. The 1st Respondent then returned to the matrimonial home
                    on 18 December 2012 while the Appellant was overseas with their two
                    children to find the doors to the matrimonial home padlocked. She then, on the
                    same day, engaged a locksmith to unlock the padlock for her to gain entry into
                    the matrimonial home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The 1st Respondent found the Appellant’s
                    personal notebook computer while she was in the house. She took it from the
                    house and passed it to her private investigator. The private investigator then,
                    upon the 1st Respondent’s instructions, proceeded to make copies of files
                    contained in the hard disk drive. The copied data was saved onto an external
                    hard disk drive by the private investigator and he passed it to the 1st
                    Respondent who then passed on the information to the 2nd Respondent for use
                    in the divorce proceedings she was engaged in with the Appellant. The 1st
                    Respondent also returned the Appellant’s personal notebook computer to its
                    original location in the matrimonial home where she had initially found
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant subsequently discovered the
                    surreptitious copying of the information from his personal notebook computer
                    when the 1st Respondent attempted to adduce some of that information as evidence
                    in the divorce proceedings they were engaged in. He then commenced proceedings
                    claiming, <em>inter alia</em>, breach of confidence and
                    obtained the interim injunction which the Judge had discharged in the
                    proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the High Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Aside from the Judge’s views concerning
                    the exclusionary discretion of the court in civil proceedings which we will, for
                    the reasons given below (at [10]–[12]), deal with tentatively at a later
                    part of our grounds, the Judge, in discharging the interim injunction, based his
                    decision on his finding that there was no serious question as to whether there
                    was a breach of confidence to be tried. In coming to this conclusion, the Judge
                    provided the following reasons (see the GD at [66]–[67]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The information did not possess the
                        necessary quality of confidence and was different from the sexual affairs of
                        a person – a matter found by Judith Prakash J to possess the
                        necessary quality of confidence in the Singapore High Court decision of
                            <em>X Pte Ltd and another v CDE</em> [1992]
                        2 SLR(R) 575 (“<em>X v CDE</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     The information was not obtained in circumstances
                        importing an obligation of confidence as the relationship between the
                        husband and wife had already broken down in the light of the fact that they
                        were living apart.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Although his finding that there was no serious
                    question to be tried was a sufficient ground for discharging the interim
                    injunction, the Judge observed that the balance of convenience also lay in
                    favour of the Respondents as, in relation to the information already placed
                    before other courts in the course of the divorce proceedings, “allowing
                    the [interim] [i]njunction to stand would be tantamount to interfering with
                    another court’s fact-finding process and its right to decide on
                    admissibility, relevance and weight” (see the GD at [72]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Some words of caution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before we give the detailed grounds for our
                    decision, it is important, in our view, to state at the outset what this case is
                    – and is not – about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     This case is, first and foremost, about
                        <em>the law of breach of confidence</em>. It is
                        <em>not</em> one that turns (at least on the <em>facts of the present case</em>) on <em>the law
                        of evidence</em>. Further, this case relates to the granting of an
                        <em>interlocutory</em> injunction and <em>not</em> a <em>final</em> injunction.
                    Put simply, we allowed the appeal in the present case on the basis that the test
                    applicable to the granting of an interlocutory injunction laid down in leading
                    House of Lords decision of <em>American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon
                        Ltd</em> [1975] AC 396 (“<em>American
                        Cyanamid</em>”) was satisfied, since: (a) there was a
                    serious question – as to whether a breach of confidence was committed
                    – to be tried; and (b) the balance of convenience lay in favour of
                    granting the interlocutory injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In so far as the need to emphasise the point
                    that this case related to the law of breach of confidence and not the law of
                    evidence is concerned, we note at this particular juncture that the Respondents
                    had, in the court below, focused instead (and wrongly, at least on the facts of
                    the present case) on the law of evidence. Indeed, in the court below, counsel
                    for the Respondents, Mr S Suressh, sought to argue that the principal
                    precedent on which the Appellant had relied on in establishing his case that
                    there had been <em>a breach of confidence</em> (<em>viz</em>, the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Imerman v Tchenguiz and others</em> [2011] Fam 116
                        (“<em>Imerman</em>”)) was <em>not applicable</em> in the <em>Singapore</em> context because it was, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, <em>premised on</em> a <em>different rule of evidence</em>. In particular,
                    Mr Suressh submitted that <em>Imerman</em> proceeded
                    on the assumption that the court <em>could</em> refuse to
                    admit improperly or illegally obtained evidence whereas, by virtue of the
                    decision of the Court of 3 Judges in <em>Law Society of Singapore
                        v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
                        (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”), the Singapore
                    courts had <em>no</em> similar discretion to exclude such
                    evidence. However, the Judge noted, in this regard, that this court had, in the
                    criminal decision of <em>Muhammad bin Kadar v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<em>Kadar</em>”), held that a court nevertheless retained a
                    discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence if the
                    prejudicial effect of that evidence towards a party exceeded its probative value
                    (hereinafter referred to as “the exclusionary discretion”). The
                    Judge then proceeded to opine that <em>the exclusionary
                        discretion</em> would <em>not</em>, however, be
                    exercised in the context of <em>civil</em> proceedings in
                    most instances (see the GD at [51]) and (more specifically) in the context of
                    the present case (see the GD at [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     While it may be that an interlocutory
                    injunction, if ordered, would practically prevent the Respondents from tendering
                    the information as evidence <em>by copying and distributing the
                        information</em> in any other suit <em>in potential
                        breach of confidence</em>, it must be noted that such an injunction
                    does not equate to a decision as to the <em>admissibility of such
                        information as evidence</em>. The latter decision will only have to be
                    made if, for example, the information in the present case was tendered as
                    evidence in support of a suit and the Appellant objects to its admissibility on
                    the ground that it was being used in breach of confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Further, and with respect, it was by no means
                    clear, in our view, that the Judge had rendered a correct statement of the
                    relevant legal position as to the exercise of an exclusionary discretion in the
                    context of civil proceedings for reasons which we tentatively state below. Our
                    views (set out briefly below at [27]–[31]) are tentative simply because,
                    as already mentioned, given the fact that this appeal turned on the law relating
                    to <em>breach of confidence</em> (and whether there was a
                    serious question to be tried in this regard), the law of evidence was <em>not even engaged to begin with</em> –
                    <em>at least on the facts of the present case</em>. Since
                    the issue of admissibility under the law of evidence did not even arise, the
                    (further) issue as to whether or not the exclusionary discretion may also be
                    exercised in civil proceedings (such as the present) did not, <em>a fortiori</em>, arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It thus follows from the preceding paragraphs
                    that we did <em>not</em> accept Mr Suressh’s
                    argument that <em>Imerman</em> is <em>not</em> good law in the Singapore context in so far as the relevant
                    legal principles concerning breach of confidence were concerned. Nonetheless,
                    there was <em>also </em><b><em>no
                        </em></b><em>need for us to reach a </em><b><em>conclusive </em></b><em>decision</em> in
                    the present case as to whether the legal principles enunciated in <em>Imerman</em>, and other associated overseas decisions
                    concerning the protection of private information in the context of the law of
                    confidence (which have not been considered by our courts prior to the present
                    case), should be accepted in Singapore. This leads us to our second caveat
                    – that this case concerned the granting of an <em>interlocutory</em> injunction, <em>not</em> a
                        <em>final</em> injunction. As stated above, it was
                    sufficient for us to be satisfied that there was, in the present case, a serious
                    question to be tried as to whether or not there had been a breach of confidence
                    by the Respondents. In our view, in conjunction with the live factual disputes,
                    the novel and difficult question of law as to whether our law of confidence
                    protects, at least to a certain extent, private information that is
                    surreptitiously extracted or obtained (as illustrated in cases such as <em>Imerman</em>) was to be properly dealt with at trial (see
                    also the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Lim and Tan
                        Securities Pte v Sunbird Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 776 at
                    [22], cited with approval by this court in <em>Obegi Melissa and
                        others v Vestwin Trading Pte Ltd and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R)
                    540 at [40] (“<em>Obegi Melissa</em>”)). It
                    was, in the light of this and the fact that the balance of convenience lay in
                    favour of the Appellant, that we allowed the appeal and granted the
                    interlocutory injunction on terms and upon certain undertakings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Bearing these caveats in mind, we now proceed
                    to give the detailed grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties did not dispute the applicable
                    test <em>vis-à-vis</em> the granting of an interlocutory
                    injunction. In our view, the only issues before this court were whether:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Judge was correct in finding
                        that there was no serious question as to whether there had been a breach of
                        confidence to be tried; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Judge was correct in finding that the balance of
                        convenience lay in favour of the Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Serious question to be tried</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In determining whether there was a serious
                    question to be tried, the Judge below relied on the formulation of the test for
                    breach of confidence set out in the seminal decision of Megarry J in the
                    English High Court ruling in <em>Coco v A N Clark
                        (Engineers) Ltd</em> [1969] RPC 41 (“<em>Coco</em>”), a decision which has been cited with approval in
                    various local High Court decisions (see <em>X v CDE</em> at [27]; <em>PH
                        Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Intrepid Offshore
                        Construction Pte Ltd and another</em> [2012] 4 SLR 36 at [55];
                    and <em>Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and
                        others</em> [2015] 1 SLR 163 at [64]). The three elements that
                    must be established by a plaintiff in a breach of confidence claim, as stated by
                    Megarry J in <em>Coco</em> (at 47), are that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     the information to be protected must
                        have the necessary quality of confidence about it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     that information must have been
                        imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     there must be
                        an unauthorised use of the information to the detriment of the party who
                        originally communicated it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We did not disagree with the applicability of
                    this test in the context of what has been described as “old fashioned
                    breach of confidence” cases (see Paul Stanley, <em>The Law
                        of Confidentiality: A Restatement</em> (Hart Publishing, 2008)
                        (“<em>Stanley</em>”) at p 6),
                        <em>ie</em>, cases such as those which involve the
                    transmission of information between transacting parties in a commercial context,
                    or even the alleged engagement in an extra-marital affair between a man and his
                    personal secretary (see <em>X v CDE</em>).
                    However, the strict application of this test in relation to cases such as the
                    one before us that involved the surreptitious taking of personal information
                    must be viewed with at least some circumspection – the protection of such
                    private information having been “shoehorned” into the law of
                    confidence in England, not least owing to the need (see below at [21]) for the
                    English courts to give effect to the relevant provisions (and corresponding
                    articles) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42) (UK) (“the HRA”)
                    (see <em>per</em> Lord Phillips of Worth
                    Matravers MR (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Douglas and others v Hello! Ltd and others
                        (No 3)</em> [2006] QB 125 at [96]). The HRA is, of course, not
                    law in the Singapore context (see also below at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We thus disagreed with the Judge’s rigid
                    application of the test in <em>Coco</em> to the facts of
                    this case in dealing with whether there was a serious question of a breach of
                    confidence to be tried. In doing so, the Judge failed to consider English (and
                    other) jurisprudence which has, under the confidentiality <em>genus</em>, developed “different features” for cases
                    involving the protection of private information in contrast to the “old
                    fashioned breach of confidence” cases (see <em>Imerman</em> at [67]). For example, rather than asking whether the
                    information possessed the necessary quality of confidence and whether that
                    information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence
                    pursuant to the first and second elements in the test laid down in <em>Coco</em> respectively, the question asked in England in a
                    case concerning the protection of private information is whether the plaintiff
                    had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” in relation to that
                    information (<em>per</em> Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
                    and Lord Hope of Craighead in the House of Lords decision of <em>Campbell v MGN Ltd</em> [2004] 2 AC 457 at [21] and
                    [85], respectively). Further, with respect to the third element, it was held in
                        <em>Imerman</em> (at [71]) that there was no need to
                    prove that there had been a misuse of the information for the claim to succeed
                    (although this holding purported to apply to “old fashioned breach of
                    confidence” cases as well).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In our view, the main issue which arose from
                    this case was whether we should (and, if so, to what extent) adopt the English
                    (or other) jurisprudence concerning surreptitiously acquired private information
                    into our law of confidence. This would include consideration of, <em>inter alia</em>, the decision in <em>Imerman</em> where an injunction was granted by the English Court of
                    Appeal upon its finding that the surreptitious procurement of information by the
                    wife’s brother from the husband’s personal computer amounted to a
                    breach of confidence – a case factually similar to the case before
                    us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Respondent submitted that many of these
                    cases, including <em>Imerman</em>, were driven by the
                    coming into force of the HRA which was enacted pursuant to the UK’s
                    membership of the European Union and which incorporated into English law the
                    right to privacy under Art 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human
                    Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (4 November 1950), 213 UNTS 221 (Art 8
                    is to be found in Schedule 1 of the HRA). In this regard, the
                    1st Respondent argued that there was no serious question to be tried since
                    these cases were irrelevant in the light of the absence of any express guarantee
                    of such a right under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore
                    (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”) and
                    that the Judge was consequently correct in strictly applying the test in
                        <em>Coco</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Whilst it is true that the right to privacy is
                    not expressly enumerated under the Constitution, it must nevertheless be
                    acknowledged that the protection of privacy under the law of confidence in
                    England in fact materialised <em>before</em> the enactment
                    of the HRA pursuant to a <em>common law right to
                        privacy</em>. The first authoritative extension of the law of
                    confidence to information obtained without the consent of the plaintiff is to be
                    found in Lord Goff of Chieveley’s seminal judgment 25 years ago
                    in <em>Attorney-General v Observer Ltd and others</em>
                    [1990] 1 AC 109 (at 281) (see also generally Tanya Aplin, Lionel Bently,
                    Phillip Johnson &amp; Simon Malynicz, <em>Gurry on
                        Breach of Confidence – The Protection of Confidential
                        Information</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012),
                    especially at paras 6.52–6.191 as well as <em>Stanley</em>). Further, other common law jurisdictions, such as New
                    Zealand, have also extended protection to private information <em>via</em> the law of confidence in the absence of any express
                    constitutional (or similar) guarantees to the right to privacy. Finally, on a
                    policy level, legislative developments in recent years, which included the
                    enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) and
                    the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No 26 of 2012), also point towards
                    an increasing recognition of the need to protect personal privacy –
                    developments which must also be viewed in the context of recent spates of data
                    breaches involving commercial customers and government employees in the United
                    States.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In our view, these factors meant that a
                    serious legal issue arose from this case as to whether we should afford, like
                    the courts in England and various other jurisdictions, protection to one’s
                    privacy by way of the law of confidence regardless of whether such a right is
                    guaranteed under the Constitution (an issue which is also dealt with in the
                    comprehensive and perceptive article by George Wei Sze Shun, “Milky Way
                    and Andromeda: Privacy, Confidentiality and Freedom of Expression” (2006)
                    18 SAcLJ 1, especially at paras 81-89). The extent to which we should
                    adopt such jurisprudence, <em>ie</em>, the circumstances
                    under which the law of confidence would extend its protection to private
                    information acquired without consent, also depended on a determination of the
                    facts (that are to a certain extent disputed) of the case. These matters, to our
                    mind, gave rise to a serious question to be tried as to whether there was a
                    breach of confidence and we thus disagreed with the findings of the Judge on
                    this issue. However, we would again highlight the caveat that we were by no
                    means endorsing, or even encouraging, the identification of a right to
                    protection of private information under our law of confidence. We were simply of
                    the view that such an issue was better left to be determined at trial upon a
                    full and comprehensive canvassing of the relevant legal as well as factual
                    arguments by counsel for both sides (which is of course now moot in view of the
                    settlement arrived at between the parties (see above at [2])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As a final point of note, we held in <em>Obegi Melissa</em> that a triable issue concerning a breach
                    of confidence arose in a case where documents which were allegedly
                    “abandoned” were obtained by one party from another
                    surreptitiously. Although that case dealt with whether there was a triable issue
                    in relation to the granting of leave to defend upon an application for summary
                    judgment, we nonetheless found that it supported our conclusion that there was a
                    serious question to be tried in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The balance of convenience</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As observed by Lord Nicholls in the House
                    of Lords decision of <em>Cream Holdings Ltd and others v
                        Bangerjee and another</em> [2005] 1 AC 253 (at [18]),
                    “[c]onfidentiality, once breached, is lost for ever”. Given that
                    there was a serious issue to be tried in relation to a breach of confidence, we
                    found that the balance of convenience also lay in favour of granting an
                    injunction to preserve the confidential (or private) quality of the information.
                    The Respondents relied on the Judge’s reasoning below and submitted that
                    prejudice could arise if the information obtained could not be used in the
                    divorce proceedings between the parties. Again, we point out that these
                    proceedings did not relate to the admissibility of the information as evidence
                    in the divorce proceedings (see above at [12]). In any event, we made it clear
                    in the orders made that our holding in this case did not prevent the
                    1st Respondent from relying on her knowledge of the information to seek
                    disclosure of the information <em>via</em> specific
                    discovery in other proceedings in the usual course of litigation (although the
                    admissibility of the information as evidence would be subject to the decision of
                    whichever court is seized of the matter) (see Order of Court in Annex A at
                    paras 1(c) and 10). In our view, such an arrangement obviated the practical
                    prejudice contemplated by the Respondents and the Judge below that may arise
                    upon a granting of an injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the reasons given above, we held that the
                    test in <em>American Cyanamid</em> was satisfied by the
                    Appellant and granted an interlocutory injunction in terms. These reasons formed
                    the <em>sole basis</em> of our decision. Nonetheless, we
                    would also proceed to take the opportunity to provide our tentative views on the
                    inherent discretion of the courts to exclude evidence which the Judge had dealt
                    with substantially below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Some observations on the inherent discretion to exclude
                evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As we have explained at the outset of these
                    grounds (at [9]–[14]), it was <em>unnecessary</em>,
                    in our view, for us to have considered whether or not the information which
                    formed the subject matter of the injunction was admissible pursuant to <em>the law of evidence</em>. However, this does <em>not</em> mean that the law of evidence will <em>never</em> be engaged. <em>Much will depend on
                        the particular facts of the case itself</em> (see the example provided
                    above at [12]). Nevertheless, where (as on the present facts) an interlocutory
                    injunction ought to be issued to prevent a potential breach of confidence in the
                    first place, it is important to reiterate that the court need not (consistently
                    with what the Appellant argued, albeit contrary to what the Respondents had
                    argued in the court below) even begin to enter into an inquiry as to whether or
                    not the information that constitutes the subject matter of a breach of
                    confidence claim is (or is not) admissible pursuant to the relevant principles
                    of the law of evidence. Indeed, what the relevant principles of the law of
                    evidence are in this last-mentioned regard would need to be decided when
                    detailed arguments are made on a future occasion when the issue arises directly
                    for consideration by the court. We would thus only make a few observations at
                    this particular juncture in relation to the views expressed by the Judge below
                    as to the court’s inherent discretion to exclude evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Judge below, after considering <em>Phyllis Tan</em> and <em>Kadar</em>
                    (cases which concerned criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings), found that the
                    courts did possess an inherent discretion to exclude evidence in <em>both</em> criminal and civil proceedings (and for an
                    excellent overview of this particular area of the law, see ch 10 of Jeffrey
                    Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2013)). However, he was also of the view that a distinction
                    should be “made between civil and criminal proceedings because of the
                    need for precautions against injustice in the latter” (see the GD at [51]
                    (and citing Prof Jeffrey Pinsler’s article, “Admissibility and
                    the Discretion to Exclude Evidence: In Search of a Systematic Approach”
                    (2013) 25 SAcLJ 215 (“<em>Pinsler</em>”)
                    at para 2 (which paragraph was, however, referring specifically to the then
                    new <em>statutory</em> discretion introduced by the
                    Evidence (Amendment) Act 2012 (No 2 of 2012))). He thus concluded that, in
                    the context of civil proceedings, the prejudicial effect in the probative
                    value/prejudicial effect balancing exercise enunciated in <em>Kadar</em> “assumes a far lighter weight and role when put in
                    the balance against the probative value component” and that “[i]n
                    most instances, it boils down to a matter of weight in civil proceedings”
                    (see the GD at [51]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Whilst we agree that different societal and
                    policy reasons as well as arguments may apply <em>vis-à-vis</em> the inherent discretion of the court to exclude
                    evidence as between criminal and civil proceedings, we do not, with respect,
                    think that this <em>necessarily</em> leads to the
                    conclusion arrived at by the Judge, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    exclusionary discretion would be exercised with less rigidity such that most
                    evidence would not be excluded in civil proceedings. First, it may simply be the
                    case that the probative value/prejudicial effect balancing exercise (though
                    well-suited to the nuances of and the values at stake in criminal proceedings)
                    cannot be applied to civil proceedings and that a different balancing exercise
                    should be conducted in that respect. Secondly, <em>Phyllis
                        Tan</em> and <em>Kadar</em> related to fact
                    situations which concerned the propriety of the conduct of law enforcement
                    officers and private investigators with regard to the obtaining of the evidence
                    and the effect of that conduct on the quality of the evidence. This is different
                    from cases such as the present which was not only concerned with the propriety
                    of the conduct of the Respondents, but also with the protection of the
                    Appellant’s potential pre-existing <em>proprietary</em> rights over the evidence as well, the protection of
                    such potential proprietary rights in general being a matter of public interest.
                    Thirdly, whilst the exclusion of the evidence in <em>Phyllis
                        Tan</em> and <em>Kadar</em> may have deprived the
                    prosecuting parties in both cases of certain evidence which could have been used
                    to convict the defendants (<em>ie</em>, that the evidence
                    in question could only have been admitted in the form and manner in which it was
                    obtained), which may weigh against the court excluding the evidence, the same
                    cannot be said of cases such as the case before us. The Respondents had an
                    obvious alternative to obtain the same evidence, but in a lawful manner –
                    that is, by way of discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The factors discussed above illustrate the
                    fact that too sharp a distinction should not be drawn between criminal and civil
                    proceedings without further analysis of the <em>precise
                        type</em> of impropriety or illegality behind the evidence attempted
                    to be adduced – although we hasten to add that nothing we state should
                    detract from the importance of the exclusionary discretion with regard to
                        <em>criminal</em> cases because the life or liberty of
                    the accused are at stake. Returning to the facts of the present case, although
                    the 1st Respondent in this case might – looked at from one point of view
                    – be said to have taken the information improperly or illegally, we note
                    (consistently with the views we have just expressed) that this <em>might</em> be <em>a different conception of
                        the concept of “unlawfully or illegally obtained evidence”
                        which forms the basis of decisions in cases such as</em> Kadar
                        <em>and</em> Phyllis Tan, and we therefore (except to
                    the extent of our observations on the exclusionary discretion) say no more about
                    this particular issue in this judgment. What we would note, however, is that
                    there are good reasons why the inherent discretion to exclude evidence may also
                    be needed to be exercised more robustly – or at least more vigorously than
                    what the Judge envisaged in his decision below – in <em>civil</em> proceedings in the light of the very different
                    countervailing factors that arise from the need to protect potential proprietary
                    interests and the public interest in promoting the obtaining of evidence by way
                    of legally prescribed methods. Put simply, the respecting of such rights and
                    rules is something which is expected when one is living in a civilised society
                    where the Rule of Law (and not of the jungle) must prevail. This is especially
                    needful in the context of the sea change in both the quality – as well as
                    the availability of – technology in the modern world. Much would of course
                    also depend, in the final analysis, on the precise facts as well as context of
                    the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We have enunciated the views above for the
                    purpose of highlighting how the inherent discretion to exclude evidence may,
                    contrary to the views of the Judge below, not be exercised as sparingly in civil
                    proceedings as he had envisaged in his decision. Nonetheless, as we have already
                    caveated above, these views are merely tentative and a full and final
                    pronouncement on this issue, including the applicability of <em>Phyllis Tan</em> and <em>Kadar</em> (the former
                    decision of which, we note, was strongly critiqued by Prof Ho Hock Lai in
                    ““National Values on Law and Order” and the Discretion to
                    Exclude Wrongfully Obtained Evidence” [2012] Journal of Commonwealth
                    Criminal Law 232), should only be made after considering the detailed arguments
                    in an appropriate case in the future. Indeed, Prof Pinsler was of the view
                    that the fact that the <em>common law</em> exclusionary
                    discretion discussed above presently exists side-by-side with a more specific
                        <em>statutory</em> exclusionary discretion embodied
                    within ss 32(3) and 47(4) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (in relation to hearsay evidence and expert opinion evidence, respectively)
                    results in a situation that is, in his view, “unsatisfactory” (see
                        <em>Pinsler</em> at para 40).</p>
