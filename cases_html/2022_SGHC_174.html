The plaintiff alleged that, of the rent due over the five-year term totalling S$300,000, only S$100,000 in total was sporadically paid over the five years.

</div>  It should be noted that, even if I were to accept that there was a triable issue that loans were made by Liu to the plaintiff, it did not immediately follow that such loans made by <span class="font-italic">Liu </span>should have had any impact on the <span class="font-italic">defendant’s </span>payment obligations under the Tenancy Agreement.

This was, of course, entirely sensible.

</div>  The fact that MOH grants were received prior to August 2015 indicated quite clearly that the Home was indeed separately managed and operated.

</div>
</div>
</div>  In my view, there was no sensible reason that the defendant would be paying off these loans if they were indeed owed by the plaintiff.  This showed quite unequivocally that the defendant, as opposed to the plaintiff, was responsible for repaying Liu.  At the hearing of the registrar’s appeal, counsel for the defendant made a submission from the bar that the defendant paid this money from MOH grants that were intended for a period prior to the Separation Agreement (executed on 9 August 2015) and therefore such grant moneys rightly belonged to the plaintiff.  Quite apart from the fact that there was nothing in the affidavits filed by Liu in support of this submission, I found it to be hopelessly unpersuasive because the plaintiff was not entitled to the defendant’s revenue for the period even prior to the Separation Agreement, as I have already explained (see [34(a)] above).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my judgment, the defendant failed to discharge its tactical burden of showing that it had a fair or reasonable probability of raising a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence in respect of the alleged loan.  This was for two key reasons.  First, in view of the above analysis, the defendant had not put forth credible evidence that loans were made to the plaintiff.  The sums advanced by Liu went into bank accounts controlled, and later owned, by the defendant.  There was no merit to the defendant’s argument that the loans made to it were effectively made to the plaintiff.  Also, it was not disputed that the defendant had been making repayments of the loans advanced by Liu (see above at [35]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Second, the defendant’s version of events was utterly improbable.  It entailed the court accepting that the arrangement between the parties was that the plaintiff was not involved in managing the Home and thus was not entitled to income generated by the Home, which would all be kept by the defendant, but that the plaintiff would somehow remain liable to fund the Home’s operational expenses, since the loans were made by Liu for that purpose.

</div>
</div>  Further, because of the alleged Set-Off Agreement (which will be dealt with later at [40] to [49]), the plaintiff would not be receiving any rent for the defendant’s use of the Demised Premises for a period of up to 10 years, as it would be paying off such loans to Liu.  To put things mildly, the defendant’s version was rather remarkable.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I also noted the glaring evidential deficiencies faced by the defendant in that there was no written evidence of any agreement on the alleged loan between Liu and the plaintiff.  The defendant also failed to supply details on material terms relating to such a loan, including the relevant interest rate and terms of repayment.

</div> was rejected because this was not what counsel for the defendant informed me at the hearing on 17 February 2022 when he asked for more time to produce the Schedule of Advances.  The plaintiff argued that an adverse inference should be drawn against the defendant that the Schedule of Advances, if disclosed, would show that the alleged loans were made to the defendant and not the plaintiff.  However, given the views I have already expressed on whether there was a triable issue as to the alleged loans to the plaintiff, it was not necessary for me to express any view on whether an adverse inference should be drawn from the defendant’s failure to provide the Schedule of Advances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a triable issue as to the alleged Set-Off Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Given that the defendant has not shown that there is any triable issue that Liu had made any loan to the plaintiff, it followed that the alleged Set-Off Agreement must have been a fiction dreamt up by the defendant.  Without any loan having been made to the plaintiff, there could be nothing for the rental payments due to the plaintiff to be set-off against.  Nonetheless, for the sake of argument, even if I were to accept that there were loans made by Liu to the plaintiff, the defendant would still have needed to establish that there was a fair or reasonable probability that it has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence in the form of the alleged Set-Off Agreement in order to resist the summary judgment application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As earlier mentioned (at [25] above), the defendant claimed that there was an orally concluded Set-Off Agreement pursuant to which the rent due under the Tenancy Agreement would have been set-off against the loans allegedly advanced by Liu to the plaintiff.  At this juncture, I noted that the defendant’s pleadings were unclear on who the parties to the agreement were.  In response to the plaintiff’s request for particulars on the parties to the agreement, the defendant responded, “Plaintiffs’ said Chairman with one SEE HOCK CHEE (Caretaker) present and Defendants’ said Mr. Liu assisted by Mr. Wilson Lim and/or Mr. Han”.

In the defence, dated 21 January 2021, the stated date of the alleged Set-Off Agreement was 9 August 2015.  After having sight of the plaintiff’s documents in support of the summary judgment application, including See’s second affidavit dated 26 July 2021, which referred to clause 2(1) of the Tenancy Agreement, the defendant mentioned for the first time in Liu’s affidavit dated 19 August 2021, that the date of the Set-Off Agreement “should be on or about 30 September 2015 when parties signed the Tenancy Agreement”.

The defendant had not produced any written evidence of the agreement.  Further, its own account of the details concerning the Set-Off Agreement was inconsistent.  In addition to the discrepancy as to the date of the Set-Off Agreement, the defendant changed its account of the individuals who were present when the oral agreement was allegedly made.  In the defence, the defendant stated that the agreement was concluded in the presence of the plaintiff’s then chairman and the plaintiff’s then treasurer;

</div>  Indeed, if this alleged Set-Off Agreement also applied to any renewed term of another five years, the defendant would not need to pay any rent at all for that second term as well.  This would mean that there was no need for the defendant to pay rent for a period of 10 years.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 If this were all true, it was puzzling that the defendant would have made S$100,000 in rental payments to the plaintiff during the term of the tenancy.  Counsel for the defendant explained in oral submissions that rental payments were occasionally made when the plaintiff needed money.  In this respect, the defendant relied on a letter dated 13 December 2017 from Sng &amp; Company, the plaintiff’s then solicitors, which stated that “ … it would be appreciated if [the defendant] could make payment of … $55,000.00 to [the plaintiff’s management committee] as soon as possible”.

</div>  The defendant’s argument was that, if the plaintiff were entitled to receive rent, it would have demanded, rather than requested, the sum.  However, reading the letter in full, it appeared quite clear that the plaintiff’s then solicitors were only aware of the Management Agreement but not the Tenancy Agreement (and it was only the latter that obliged the defendant to pay rent).  The letter referred to “the Committee Management Appointment in writing dated 19-04-2013”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Management Agreement,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as the basis for requesting payment of S$55,000.

</div>  It was difficult for the court to accept that, although the defendant made rental payments occasionally, it was actually not obliged to do so.  If parties had intended an arrangement where “rent” was paid on a voluntary basis, it would not have been necessary to enter into the Tenancy Agreement, which expressly created a contractual obligation to pay rent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my judgment, the defendant failed to raise any triable issue in relation to a set-off, in that, it had not shown that it had a fair or reasonable probability of raising a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence in respect of the alleged Set-Off Agreement.  The defendant’s assertion that there was a Set-Off Agreement was not substantiated by any credible evidence: the Set-Off Agreement was allegedly orally concluded, there was no written evidence that supported its existence, and none of the persons who were allegedly present at its conclusion filed any affidavit in support of Liu’s claims as to its existence.  Further, the defendant presented inconsistent versions of the alleged Set-Off Agreement with changes in its position that appeared to have been necessitated by a need to meet the plaintiff’s case.  The change in the alleged date of conclusion of the Set-Off Agreement was an attempt to circumvent the challenge that clause 2(1) of the Tenancy Agreement presented (see [42]–[43] above).  The defendant also pivoted on its position as to the rent payable under the Tenancy Agreement.  Its pleaded case was that, taking into account the set-off, rent was <span class="font-italic">not</span> payable at all and in fact S$552,622.58 remained outstanding from the plaintiff.  However, counsel for the defendant admitted in oral submissions that rental payments were indeed made.  This change in position appeared to have been necessitated by the plaintiff’s evidence of rent actually having been paid (see [45] above) and was irreconcilable with the defence as pleaded.  In view of the defendant’s unsubstantiated and changing positions, I found there was no triable issue as to the alleged Set-Off Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether leave to defend should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The purpose of O 14 is to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there is plainly no defence to the claim: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> Vol I </span>(Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 14/1/2.

</div>  The defendant did not make any arguments that the plaintiff should not be entitled to a claim for double value if it is found by the court that the defendant had wrongly held over.  In this case, the defendant had no contractual right to renew the lease under clause 9 of the Tenancy Agreement given that it was in clear default of its obligation to pay rent to the tune of S$200,000.  The plaintiff had also written to the defendant to notify it of the termination of the Tenancy Agreement.  As such, I found that the defendant had wrongfully held over after the expiry of the tenancy on 30 September 2020.  I therefore ordered that the defendant was to pay double the value of the Demised Premises from 1 October 2020, which was when the Demised Premises should have been vacated by the defendant, to the date of judgment on 17 March 2022.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In <span class="font-italic">UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corporation</span> [2013] SGHC 236 (“<span class="font-italic">UDL Marine</span>”), it was explained that double value means the “market rent during the holding over period” (at [92]), as opposed to the last rent paid.  The plaintiff provided some evidence of double value in the form of an email dated 2 November 2020 from one Oh Puay Ngor of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) which referred to the annual value of the Demised Premises as S$197,000.

</div>  However, I was of the view that the actual notice of assessment of property tax from IRAS, which would show the most recent assessed annual value of the property, should have been provided in evidence.  I also took the view that the defendant should be given an opportunity to challenge this manner of determining the quantum of double value, if it wished to do so.  As such, I ordered that, if there was no agreement on the double value of the Demised Premises from 1 October 2020 to the date of judgment, the plaintiff was at liberty to write in for directions for the quantification of such double value by the court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Subsequently, the plaintiff wrote to the court in a letter dated 30 March 2022.  In this letter, the plaintiff provided further evidence as to double value in the form of the notices of assessment issued by IRAS for the periods of January to December 2020, January to December 2021, and January to December 2022.

In particular, the defendant was to state whether it accepted the annual value as stated in IRAS’s notices of assessment and if it did not, whether it intended to adduce any evidence as to the annual value of the Demised Premises.

</div>  The defendant did not comply with my directions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Section 4(2) of the Property Tax Act 1960 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Act”) places responsibility on the Chief Assessor for the assessment of the annual values of properties under the Act.  Section 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act defines annual value as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“annual value” –– in relation to a house or building or land or tenement, not being a wharf, pier, jetty or landing-stage, means <span class="font-italic">the gross amount at which the same can reasonably be expected to be let from year to year</span>, the landlord paying the expenses of repair, insurance, maintenance or upkeep and all taxes (other than goods and services tax) … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Chief</span><span class="font-italic"> Assessor v Keppel Corp Ltd </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 457, Warren L H Khoo J, in interpreting s 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, explained (at [8]) that annual value is “what the hypothetical tenant might reasonably be expected to pay by way of rental on a yearly tenancy upon the terms stipulated under the relevant part of the definition [in the Act]”.  This is consistent with what double value represents, as explained in <span class="font-italic">UDL Marine </span>(see [53] above).  In view of the above, I found that it was appropriate to refer to the annual value in the IRAS notices in computing double value.  This was especially given that the defendant, despite having been given the opportunity to do so, did not challenge this manner of determining the quantum of double value, nor did it challenge the annual value of S$197,000.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 On 7 June 2022, I thus made an order as to the quantum of damages for holding over, with such damages fixed in the amount of S$575,076.61.  This sum represents the double value of the Demised Premises for the period of 1 October 2020 to 17 March 2022, computed on the basis of the annual value of S$197,000.  The computation was set out in paragraph 5 of the court’s letter to the parties dated 7 June 2022, and I reproduce it here: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Period</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1 Oct 2020 to 31 Dec 2020 (92 days)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S$197,000 ÷ 366 × 92 × 2 = S$99,038.25 </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2021 (1 year)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S$197,000 × 2 = S$394,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">1 Jan 2022 to 17 Mar 2022 (76 days)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S$197,000 ÷ 365 × 76 × 2 = S$82,038.36</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">S$575,076.61</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As for costs, following the general principle that costs follow the event, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff three sets of costs.  For SUM 3491/2021, which was the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff costs of S$12,000.  For RA 332/2021, which was the plaintiff’s appeal against the AR’s decision to grant the defendant unconditional leave to defend, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff costs of S$12,000.  Finally, in respect of the main action, Suit 1225/2020, I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff costs of S$13,000.  For the last figure, I took into account that there would have been some overlap in work done for Suit 1225/2020 which the plaintiff would already be compensated for in the costs orders for SUM 3491/2021 and RA 332/2021.  All sums were inclusive of disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Parmar Karam Singh and Leong Lijie (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Seah Choon Huat Johnny (Seah &amp; Co) </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
