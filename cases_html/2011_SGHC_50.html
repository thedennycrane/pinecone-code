<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the defendant to
                    strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim under Order 18 rule 19 of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) on the ground that
                    the plaintiff’s claim is frivolous and vexatious as well as an abuse of
                    the process of the Court. The defendant’s counsel, Mr Toh Kian Sing
                    SC, says this is so because the plaintiff’s claim is obviously
                    unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s pleaded case is as
                    follows. Through email correspondence, the parties entered into an agreement on
                    27 July 2009 for the defendant to sell to the plaintiff 65,000 metric tonnes
                    (more or less 10% at the defendant’s option) of iron ore fines at US$86
                    per dry metric ton, with a laycan period from 1 to 10 August 2009. To record the
                    terms of this agreement, the plaintiff forwarded a formal purchase contract to
                    the defendant. There was, however, an error in this document. It stated that
                    payment was to be made in two stages with 97% through a letter of credit and a
                    balance of 3% through telegraphic transfer instead of the agreed 100% payment
                    through a letter of credit. Despite this error, a binding agreement had already
                    been concluded through the email correspondence and this contract was a mere
                    formality to record the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Four days later, on 31 July 2009, a
                    representative of the defendant sent an email to the plaintiff denying that an
                    agreement had been reached between the parties, citing the error in the formal
                    purchase contract. In so doing, the defendant had repudiated the agreement and
                    the plaintiff has suffered loss. The plaintiff claimed US$1,353,105 in
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sole issue raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For the purposes of this application,
                    Mr Toh said the defendant would take the plaintiff’s pleaded case at
                    its highest because even then, it is obviously unsustainable. Specifically, even
                    if it were true that an agreement had been concluded, in failing to open a
                    letter of credit before the laycan period, the plaintiff had itself breached a
                    condition precedent to the defendant’s performance. As a result, the
                    defendant need not have performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff’s counsel,
                    Mr Srivathsan, accepted that the opening of a letter of credit before the
                    laycan period was a condition precedent to the shipment of the goods. However,
                    he argued that in the face of the defendant’s renunciation of the
                    agreement through the email of 31 July 2009 by wrongfully denying its
                    existence, it would be futile for the plaintiff to open a letter of credit. This
                    was why the plaintiff did not open a letter of credit but instead wrote to the
                    defendant, through its representative, on 1 August 2009 (and on 3 and
                    7 August thereafter) to ask the defendant to sign a version of the formal
                    purchase contract correcting the aforesaid errors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Because the defendant has taken the position
                    that for the purpose of this application it will take the plaintiff’s
                    pleaded case at its highest, I proceed on the assumption that (1) the agreement
                    for the sale of iron ore fines was valid; and (2) the defendant had communicated
                    unequivocally, through its representative, on 31 July 2009 that this
                    agreement did not exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Hence, the single issue raised is whether the
                    defendant’s renunciation of the agreement on 31 July 2009 freed the
                    plaintiff from its obligation to open the letter of credit. If it did not, the
                    plaintiff’s claim is obviously unsustainable and should be struck out
                    because, even taking its case at its highest, the plaintiff has breached a
                    condition precedent with the result that the defendant did not have to perform.
                    If it did, the plaintiff has a viable claim and there is no reason to strike it
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The issue raised turns on the question of
                    whether an innocent party, in the face of the wrongdoer’s renunciation of
                    the contract, has an option, in addition to (1) acceptance of the renunciation
                    so as to terminate and sue for damages or (2) affirmation of the contract and to
                    continue to perform, to affirm the contract but be absolved from tendering
                    further performance unless and until the wrongdoer gives reasonable notice that
                    he is once again able and willing to perform (“the third
                    option”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The third option has been considered and
                    rejected in English jurisprudence. In <em>Fercometal SARL v
                        Mediterranean Shipping</em> [1989] 1 AC 788
                        (“<em>Fercometal</em>”), Lord Ackner,
                    with whom the other law lords agreed, stated (at 805):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When A wrongfully repudiates his contractual obligations in anticipation
                        of the time for their performance, he presents the innocent party B with two
                        choices. He may either affirm the contract by treating it as still in force
                        or he may treat it as finally and conclusively discharged. There is no third
                        choice, as a sort of via media, to affirm the contract and yet to be
                        absolved from tendering further performance unless and until A gives
                        reasonable notice that he is once again able and willing to perform. Such a
                        choice would negate the contract being kept alive for the benefit of
                            <em>both</em> parties and would deny the party who
                        unsuccessfully sought to rescind, the right to take advantage of any
                        supervening circumstance which would justify him in declining to complete.
                        [emphasis original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Nonetheless, there is of course some time
                    given to the innocent party before he is due to perform to decide whether to
                    terminate or affirm the contract (see <em>Stocznia Gdanska SA v
                        Latvian Shipping Co (No 2)</em> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 436; <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> vol 1 (London:
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at
                    [24-002]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Australian position is different. It
                    accepts the existence of the third option. In <em>Peter Turnbull
                        &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Mundas Trading Co (Australia) Pty Ltd</em> (1954)
                    90 CLR 235 (“<em>Peter
                    Turnbull</em>”), a decision of the High Court of Australia, the
                    parties had entered into an agreement for the sale of a quantity of oats to be
                    shipped from Sydney. The appellant was obliged to nominate a ship to load the
                    oats from Sydney in January or February 1951 and to give the respondent 14
                    days’ notice of such nomination. In January, the respondent informed the
                    appellant that they could not ship from Sydney and would ship from Melbourne
                    instead. The appellant did not accept this proposal. The respondent persisted in
                    its assertion that it could only ship from Melbourne. The sale did not go
                    through and the appellant sued for damages. The issue before the court was
                    whether the appellant’s failure to nominate a ship and give notice of such
                    nomination precluded it from claiming damages for the respondent’s
                    breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Dixon CJ held (at 248) that the
                    respondent’s persistence in its position that it could not ship from
                    Sydney, excused the appellant from its obligation to nominate a ship and to give
                    notice of such nomination. Webb and Kitto JJ agreed. Kitto J took the
                    view (at 251) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle, which applies whenever the promise of one party, A, is
                        subject to a condition to be fulfilled by the other party, B, may, I think,
                        be stated as follows. If, although B is ready and willing to perform the
                        contract in all respects on his part, A absolutely refuses to carry out the
                        contract, and persists in the refusal until a time arrives at which
                        performance of his promise would have been due if the condition had been
                        fulfilled by B, A is liable to B in damages for breach of his promise
                        although the condition remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Taylor J dissented. He rejected the third
                    option, making the following observations (at 262):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The future rights of the innocent party] must also be determined
                        according to his election; he may retain the benefit <em>and
                            risk</em> of the contract or he may rescind and recover damages.
                        But that he may not have both is, I should think, clear beyond doubt. Nor,
                        having elected to keep the contract on foot, may he, after having failed to
                        fulfil a condition precedent to his right to performance on the part of the
                        other party, rescind upon a refusal, then continued, to perform the contract
                        for, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, whatever ground is assigned
                        for such a continued refusal the other party is not then under any
                        obligation to perform the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     
          <em>Peter Turnbull</em>
                    was one of the cases cited by counsel in <em>Fercometal</em> (see <em>Fercometal</em> at
                    792), but it was not discussed in the judgments of the law Lords. Nonetheless,
                    the decision of the House of Lords to reject the third option makes it clear
                    that it did not take the same position as the Australian High Court in <em>Peter Turnbull</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Australian High Court had the opportunity
                    to reconsider its position in <em>Peter Turnbull</em> in
                    the light of <em>Fercometal</em>. In <em>Foran and another v Wight and another</em> (1989)
                    168 CLR 385 (“<em>Foran</em>”), the
                    vendors of certain property informed the purchasers two days before the date of
                    completion that they were unable to register a right of way which was required
                    of them under the sale and purchase agreement. On the date of completion,
                    neither party took steps to complete. Two days thereafter, the purchasers gave
                    the vendors a notice of rescission. The purchasers sought a declaration that
                    they had rescinded the contract and sought a return of the deposit. The vendors
                    contended that the notice of rescission was invalid on the ground that the
                    purchasers themselves were not ready and willing to complete on the due date for
                    want of funds. The vendors succeeded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On appeal, the High Court held (with a
                    majority of four to one) that the purchasers’ notice of appeal was not
                    invalid and that they were entitled to the return of their deposit. Various
                    reasons were given by the majority for this decision. Brennan and Dawson JJ
                    took the view that although the purchasers were required to show that they were
                    ready and willing to perform, the fact that the vendors had intimated that they
                    were unable to complete relieved the purchasers of the need to show more than
                    that they were not incapacitated from raising the necessary funds and had not
                    resolved against doing so, and on the evidence they had discharged that burden.
                    Brennan J (at 421-422) made the following observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would hold, in accordance with <em>Peter
                            Turnbull</em> and <em>Mahoney v Lindsay</em>
                        ... that an intimation of non-performance of an essential term of a contract
                        amounts to repudiation and dispenses a party who acts upon it from
                        performance of his dependent obligation though he does not rescind the
                        contract. Therefore, I am unable, with respect, to agree with Lord
                        Ackner’s rejection of what his Lordship described as a “third
                        choice” in [<em>Fercometal</em>]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“When A wrongfully repudiates his contractual obligations in
                            anticipation of the time for their performance, he presents the innocent
                            party B with two choices. He may either affirm the contract by treating
                            it as still in force or he may treat it as finally and conclusively
                            discharged. There is no third choice, as a sort of via media, to affirm
                            the contract and yet to be absolved from tendering further performance
                            unless and until A gives reasonable notice that he is once again able
                            and willing to perform. Such a choice would negate the contract being
                            kept alive for the benefit of <em>both</em> parties
                            and would deny the party who unsuccessfully sought to rescind, the right
                            to take advantage of any supervening circumstance which would justify
                            him in declining to complete.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The proposition that, if repudiation by anticipatory breach
                        is not accepted, the contract subsists is undoubted; but it does not follow
                        that an intimation by one party that tender of performance by the other will
                        be nugatory cannot, if acted on, dispense the other from his obligation of
                        performance under the contract by raising an equitable estoppel. It may be
                        that Lord Ackner acknowledges some role for estoppels in this context for he
                        said ...:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“it is always open to [B], who has refused to accept
                            [A’s] repudiation of the contract, and thereby kept the contract
                            alive, to contend that in relation to a particular right or obligation
                            under the contract, [A] is stopped from contending that he, [A], is
                            entitled to exercise that right or that he, [B], has remained bound by
                            that obligation. If [A] represents to [B] that he no longer intends to
                            exercise that right or requires that obligation to be fulfilled by [B]
                            and [B] acts upon that representation, then clearly [A] cannot be heard
                            thereafter to say that he is entitled to exercise that right or that [B]
                            is in breach of contract by not fulfilling that
                            obligation.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, an equity created by estoppels arising from an intimation by A
                        that he does not intend to perform which conveys to B that performance by
                        him would be nugatory absolves B “from tendering further performance
                        unless and until A gives reasonable notice that he is once again able and
                        willing to perform”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It appears that although Brennan J finds
                    support for acceptance of the third option (though the learned judge seemed to
                    prefer not to use that terminology) in the decision in <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em>, his reasoning is different. Dixon CJ and Kitto
                    J’s conclusion in <em>Peter Turnbull</em> that an
                    intimation by the wrongdoer of an intention not to perform absolves the innocent
                    party from performance was derived from an extrapolation of principles stated in
                        <em>Jones v Barkley</em> (1781) 99 ER 434
                        (“<em>Jones</em>”) (if the wrongdoer
                    manifests an intention not to perform his part, it is not necessary for the
                    innocent party to go father, and do a nugatory act) as well as <em>Ripley v M’Clure</em> (1849) 154 ER 1245
                        (“<em>Ripley</em>”) and <em>Cort v The Ambergate &amp;c Railway Co</em> (1851)
                    117 ER 1229 (“<em>Cort</em>”), both
                    of which state the same principle as that stated in <em>Jones</em>. In <em>Cort</em>, it was further
                    stated, by Campbell CJ, that <em>Ripley</em> could be
                    explained in terms of a waiver, in that the wrongdoer’s refusal to perform
                    was evidence of a continuing refusal and waiver of the condition precedent which
                    the innocent party had to perform.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Dixon CJ states (at 247) that the
                    principle in <em>Jones</em> “in [his] opinion,
                    controls the decision of [the] appeal [before him].” Kitto J also
                    acknowledges (at 250) that “the principle which is decisive [of the
                    appeal before him] is that which is illustrated by [Campbell CJ’s]
                    statement in [<em>Cort</em>] of the decision in [<em>Ripley</em>].” Brennan J’s reasoning for
                    accepting the third option, that the intimation of the wrongdoer of its
                    intention not to perform and the reliance of the innocent party thereon raises
                    an estoppel in favour of the latter, is therefore quite different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Furthermore, with respect, I do not think that
                    the part of Lord Ackner’s observations on estoppel referred to by
                    Brennan J (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above, second quote
                    of Lord Ackner’s observations) supports his general proposition that an
                    innocent party is absolved from performance if the wrongdoer conveys to the
                    former his intention not to perform so that the former’s performance is
                    nugatory. Lord Ackner’s observations must be read in context. Lord Ackner
                    characterises that passage quoted by Brennan J as a response to an
                    “essentially ... new point” raised by counsel (which is separate
                    from the issue of whether there exists the third option) (see <em>Fercometal</em> at 805). Lord Ackner then goes on to comment whether,
                    on the facts, an estoppel could arise. It is clear that Lord Ackner was not
                    making a <em>general pronouncement</em> of law
                    acknowledging the existence of the third option (as defined above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) but an assessment <em>on the
                        facts</em> as to whether an estoppel could arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Be that as it may, the decision in <em>Foran</em> affirms the position in <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em>, although the rationalisations may be different. The
                    Australian position remains different from the English position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Locally, the Court of Appeal in <em>Straits Engineering Contracting Pte Ltd v Merteks Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 864 (“<em>Straits Engineering</em>”) has cited <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em> favourably. In that case, the appellant had entered into
                    an agreement to sell all the shares in one of its wholly owned subsidiary to the
                    respondent. The appellant subsequently insisted on a sale on the basis of a
                    “clean company” without trade debtors and trade creditors. The
                    respondent disagreed and brought a claim against the appellant, alleging breach
                    of contract, for specific performance and damages. The judge found that there
                    was no agreement that the sale would be on the basis of a “clean
                    company”. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part in relation to
                    the judge’s assessment of the damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Court of Appeal, nonetheless, cited
                        <em>Peter Turnbull</em> and <em>Foran</em> favourably in dicta. L P Thean JA (delivering
                    the judgment of the court) made the following observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24 ... There was nothing to suggest that the respondents had not intended
                        to complete the transaction but for the new term introduced by the
                        appellants [requiring that the sale be on the basis of a “clean
                        company”]. In such circumstances, it would be futile and nugatory for
                        the respondents to tender the balance purchase price with a view to
                        completing the purchase in terms of the March Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25 In [<em>Peter Turnbull</em>,]
                        Dixon CJ said, at p 245:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... I think that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed on the ground
                            that, in so far as there was a non-fulfilment of the condition requiring
                            the nomination of a February ship and the giving of 14 days’
                            notice of the ship and shipping date, the defendant dispensed the
                            plaintiff from such fulfilment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26 His Honour gave the reasons as follows, at
                        p 246:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The defendant persisted up to 2 March that it could perform the
                            contract only in one way, namely, by substituting a shipment by the same
                            vessel in Melbourne for that in Sydney contracted for. By seeking the
                            plaintiff’s help in an attempt to effect this substitution and at
                            the same time persisting that it could not perform the contract
                            according to its terms, the defendant clearly intimated to the plaintiff
                            that it was useless to pursue the conditions of the contract applicable
                            to shipment in Sydney and that the plaintiff need not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">L P Thean JA then referred favourably (at
                        [27]) to Brennan J’s decision
                    in <em>Foran</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In <em>Siti and another v Lee
                        Kay Li</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 934 (“<em>Siti</em>”), L P Thean JA (delivering the judgment
                    of the court) referred to and reiterated the point made in [24] of <em>Straits
                        Trading</em> (quoted above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It must be noted that in both <em>Straits Trading</em> and <em>Siti</em>,
                        <em>Fercometal</em> was neither cited nor discussed.
                    This is why Mr Toh submitted that those decisions were decided <em>per incuriam</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Subsequent to those decisions, <em>Fercometal</em> has received the endorsement of the High
                    Court. Choo Han Teck J in <em>Silverlink Holdings Ltd v
                        Rockline Ltd and others</em> [2011] SGHC 10
                        (“<em>Silverlink Holdings</em>”) at
                        [11]-[12] accepted counsel’s argument based on <em>Fercometal</em>, commenting that: “[i]t cannot be the
                    case that the wrongful party continues to be bound by the terms of a repudiated
                    contract, while the innocent party is not.”
                    <em>Fercometal</em> was also endorsed by Lai Siu
                    Chiu J in <em>Stork Technology Services Asia Pte Ltd v First
                        Capital Insurance Limited</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 652 at [92]
                    and by G P Selvam J in <em>MP-Bilt Pte Ltd v Oey
                        Widarto</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 908 at [56]. <em>Siti</em> and <em>Straits Trading</em> were not
                    discussed in these decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I respectfully agree with the position taken
                    by the High Court and would depart from the <em>dicta</em>
                    of the Court of Appeal in <em>Siti</em> and <em>Straits Trading</em>. Mr Toh had sought to convince me
                    that in any event the Court of Appeal’s pronouncements in <em>Siti</em> and <em>Straits Trading</em>
                    in reference to <em>Peter Turnbull</em> and <em>Foran</em> could be distinguished from the present
                    application on the ground that the cases before the Court of Appeal were
                    concerned with <em>concurrent</em> obligations and not a
                    condition precedent with which this application is concerned. With respect, I do
                    not agree. <em>Peter Turnbull</em> was a case concerning a
                    breach of a condition precedent on the part of the innocent party as a result of
                    an intimation of an intention not to perform by the wrongdoer: the innocent
                    party had to nominate a ship and given notice of such nomination <em>before</em> the wrongdoer could perform.
                    Dixon CJ’s observations (in <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em> at 246-247) also make it clear that the principle
                    enunciated in <em>Peter Turnbull</em> applies with equal
                    force to situations concerning a breach of a condition precedent and not just to
                    a situation concerning concurrent obligations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now long before the doctrine of anticipatory breach of contract was
                        developed it was always the law that, <em>if a contracting
                            party prevented the fulfilment by the opposite party to the contract of
                            a condition precedent therein expressed or implied, it was equal to
                            performance thereof</em> ... But a plaintiff may be dispensed from
                        performing a condition by the defendant expressly or impliedly intimating
                        that it is useless for him to perform it and requesting him not to do so.
                            <em>If the plaintiff acts upon the intimation it is just
                            as effectual as actual prevention</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Hence, although the decision in <em>Peter Turnbull</em> was based on <em>Jones</em>, a case concerned with concurrent obligations, it was
                    clear that the principle enunciated in <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em> was intended to also cover situations concerning a
                    condition precedent. Furthermore, when the High Court of Australia had the
                    opportunity to reconsider <em>Peter Turnbull</em> in
                        <em>Foran</em>, a case concerning concurrent
                    obligations, it did not qualify <em>Peter Turnbull</em> to
                    limit its application to such cases. The Court of Appeal in <em>Straits Trading</em> and <em>Siti</em> also made
                    no such qualification when referring to <em>Peter
                        Turnbull</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Furthermore, I do not think such a distinction
                    can be justified as a matter of principle if one examines the rationale
                    underlying the decision in <em>Peter Turnbull</em> to
                    accept the existence of the third option. It seems to me that the third option
                    was developed as a result of a commonsensical concern on the need to reduce
                    commercial wastage. Simply put, if the wrongdoer makes it clear that he is not
                    going to perform so that the innocent party’s performance would be an act
                    in futility, why should the law require the innocent party to perform? This is a
                    valid concern regardless of whether the innocent party has to perform a
                    condition precedent or carry out a concurrent obligation. If the wrongdoer has
                    made it clear that he will not perform, the innocent party’s acts in
                    fulfilment of a condition precedent or a concurrent obligation would be futile
                    in both situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     And it is for these reasons that I do not
                    think <em>Straits Trading</em> and <em>Siti</em> can be distinguished in the way urged by Mr Toh. But I
                    would depart nonetheless from the position stated in the <em>dicta</em> of those cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I agree with the position taken in <em>Fercometal</em> for two reasons. First, even through the
                    innocent party’s performance in the face of a clear refusal to perform by
                    the wrongdoer is an effort in futility, where repudiation has not been accepted,
                    the contract is kept alive for both parties and does not exist for one but not
                    the other (see also <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> at
                    [24-011]; <em>Silverlink Holdings</em> at [12]). To hold otherwise would be contrary to
                    basic principles of fairness as between contracting parties for one side is held
                    to the bargain, while the other is not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Second, although the appeal to prevent
                    commercial wastage resulting from the futile acts of the innocent party (see
                    also <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above) is, at first blush, a
                    persuasive argument for the recognition of the third option, the existing
                    principles of contract law in the absence of the third option allow for
                    substantially the same result to obtain without its problems (as stated in the
                    preceding paragraph). The innocent party may accept the renunciation, terminate
                    and renegotiate a new contract. In so doing, the innocent party may still claim
                    damages and be absolved from acting in futility because it is no longer required
                    to perform. Although successful renegotiations would require the assent of the
                    wrongdoer, so would the third option which requires the wrongdoer to give
                    reasonable notice that he is once again willing to perform for the contract to
                    be back on track.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For these reasons, I accept the position in
                        <em>Fercometal</em> and reject the existence of the
                    third option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I agree with Mr Toh that the
                    plaintiff’s claim is obviously unsustainable even taking the
                    plaintiff’s case at its highest. The plaintiff did not accept the
                    renunciation of the agreement and instead persisted in seeking its performance
                    through the email communication on 1 August 2009 asking the defendant
                    to sign the corrected version of the formal purchase contract. The contract was
                    not terminated and the plaintiff had to satisfy the condition precedent by
                    procuring a letter of credit. It failed to do so and therefore the
                    defendant’s failure to perform is not wrongful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There is one last point I would address. The
                    plaintiff had sought, in the alternative, to rely on the doctrines of waiver and
                    estoppel. If by reference to these doctrines, Mr Srivathsan had sought to
                    persuade me of their applicability in the form envisioned by Brennan J,
                        <em>ie</em> as a general principle of law that a
                    renunciation by a wrongdoer absolves the innocent party from performance, I
                    cannot agree for reasons already stated (see also <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above). If he is instead arguing that <em>on
                        the facts</em> an estoppel or waiver can be found, I would simply say
                    that the facts pleaded do not support the finding of an estoppel or waiver of
                    the condition precedent requiring the plaintiff to open the letter of credit.
                    The defendant may have intimated that it would not perform and that it took the
                    view that there was no agreement between the parties but this without more does
                    not ground an estoppel or waiver.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For the reasons stated, I strike out the
                    plaintiff’s statement of claim and dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
