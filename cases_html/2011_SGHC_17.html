<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellants were each convicted of four
                    charges for providing public entertainment by way of making an address in a
                    place to which the public has access without a licence under s 19(1)(a) the
                    Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (Cap 257, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (“PEMA”). The offences were committed on four different occasions
                    (in particular, on 16 November 2005, 8, 12 and 15 April 2006) at separate
                    locations. A fine of $5,000 (in default five weeks’ imprisonment) for each
                    charge was imposed on Chee Soon Juan (“Dr Chee”) while a fine
                    of $2,000 was imposed on the other appellant, Yap Keng Ho
                    (“Mr Yap”) for each of the offences (with 10 days’
                    default imprisonment for the offences committed on 16 November 2005,
                    8 April 2006, 12 April 2006, and 14 days’ default
                    imprisonment for the offence committed on 15 April 2006).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The trial in respect of the offences committed
                    on 8 April 2006 was heard by District Judge Jasvender Kaur over 10 days (MA
                    133 and 134 of 2008). The trial in respect of the offences committed on 16
                    November 2005 and 12 April 2006 lasting 33 days was heard by District Judge
                    Thian Yee Sze (MA 273 and 279 of 2009), while District Judge Jill Tan heard the
                    15-day trial in respect of the offences committed on 15 April 2006 (MA 233
                    and 234 of 2010). The appellants appealed against all the convictions and the
                    respective sentences. The three District Judges are hereinafter collectively
                    referred to as “the trial Judges”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is provided under s 3 of the PEMA that
                    no public entertainment shall be provided unless it is in an approved place and
                    in accordance with a licence issued by the Licensing Officer. Section 19(1)(a)
                    of the PEMA stipulates that any person who provides any public entertainment
                    without a licence issued under the PEMA shall be guilty of an offence and liable
                    to a fine not exceeding $10,000 upon conviction. Section 2(m) of the Schedule to
                    the PEMA defines public entertainment to include, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, any “lecture, talk, address, debate or
                    discussion…in any place to which the public or any class of the public
                    has access whether gratuitously or otherwise.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It is undisputed that the appellants were
                    physically present at the scene where the offences were committed, and that the
                    offences took place at the locations where the public had access. It was also
                    not disputed that the appellants did not apply for a licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellants raised four main arguments in the
                    appeals before me:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the appellants asserted their
                        right to freedom of speech under Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic
                        of Singapore (“the Constitution”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the appellants argued that the
                        police, the Executive, and the Public Entertainments Licensing Unit’s
                        (“PELU”) blanket policy of not granting licences under the
                        PEMA to political parties was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional,
                        in contravention of the appellants’ right to equal protection of the
                        law, under Art 12 of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the appellants contended that they were victims of
                        bad faith and discriminatory enforcement of the PEMA. The appellants claimed
                        to have modelled their activities to be similar to those conducted by
                        hawkers and stall-owners at public places, but were singled out and targeted
                        by the police. The appellants argued that their prosecution was
                        discriminatory and a denial of equality contrary to the law enshrined in Art
                        12 of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the appellants contended that they were only
                        making a sales pitch which did not amount to an “address”
                        within the meaning of s 19 of PEMA. I shall consider each of the
                        arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the PEMA contravenes the appellants’ asserted right to
                freedom of speech under Art 14 of the Constitution </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Mr Chia Ti Lik
                    (“Mr Chia”) represented the appellant, Dr Chee in
                    MA 133/2008. However, his role as counsel for Dr Chee was limited to
                    advancing the legal submission that the provisions of the PEMA are in violation
                    of the freedom of speech enshrined in Art 14 of the Constitution. It is not
                    denied that the same legal issue was raised and resolved in two earlier High
                    Court decisions, <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Public
                        Prosecutor and another appeal</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 419
                        (“<em>JBJ v PP</em>”) and <em>Chee Soon Juan v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 445 (“<em>Chee Soon Juan v
                        PP</em>”). In both decisions, the High Court held that the
                    freedom of speech under Art 14 of the Constitution is not an absolute right.
                    Specifically, in both decisions, the High Court held that the enactment of the
                    PEMA was permitted under Art 14(2)(a) of the Constitution. The High Court in
                        <em>Chee Soon Juan v PP</em> made the following
                    pertinent observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    The right to freedom
                            of speech is enshrined in art 14(1)(a) of our Constitution. However,
                            this right is expressly made subject to the limitation in art 14(2)(a)
                            of the Constitution, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    Parliament may by law impose -</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    on the rights conferred by clause (1)(a), such
                                restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest
                                of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations
                                with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions
                                designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide
                                against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence;
                                ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    In any society, democratic or otherwise, freedom of
                            speech is not an absolute right. Broader societal concerns such as
                            public peace and order must be engaged in a balancing exercise with the
                            enjoyment of this personal liberty. This is embodied in art 14(2)(a). I
                            did not find the provisions of PEMA to be in any way contrary to our
                            Constitution. Indeed, it seemed eminently clear that the enactment of
                            PEMA was fully within the power of the legislature pursuant to the power
                            granted to it by art 14(2)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Dr Chee and Mr Yap both adopted
                    Mr Chia’s submission on the alleged unconstitutionality of the PEMA
                    for their respective appeals. Before me, Mr Chia’s legal submission
                    was essentially the same arguments which were raised and subsequently rejected
                    in the two earlier High Court decisions. In addition, Mr Chia drew my
                    attention to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in
                        <em>Vancouver (City) v Zhang</em>
                    [2010] BCCA 450 (“<em>Vancouver v
                        Zhang</em>”) to mount a fresh challenge against the
                    constitutionality of PEMA. The case concerned an application by the City Council
                    of Vancouver for an injunction compelling Falun Gong practitioners to remove
                    their billboards containing political expressions from a grassy portion of the
                    city street in front of the Chinese consulate because they were in contravention
                    of s 71 of the Street and Traffic By-Law (Revised By-law No 2849)
                    (“the by-law”). The Court of Appeal of British Columbia held that
                    s 71 of the by-law was unconstitutional as it was inconsistent with the
                    freedom of expression guaranteed under s 2(b) of the Canadian Charter. A
                    close examination of <em>Vancouver v Zhang</em> would
                    reveal that it provides no assistance to the appellants in the appeals before
                    me. First, the provisions of the Canadian Charter are quite different from that
                    found in the Constitution of Singapore. Section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter
                    provides the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom
                        of the press and other media of communication…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The freedom of expression under s 2(b) is,
                    however, qualified by s 1 of the Canadian Charter which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>
                        guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such
                        reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
                        free and democratic society.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The restriction under s 1 of “such
                    reasonable limits prescribed by law” has been interpreted by the Canadian
                    case law <em>R v Oakes</em> [1986] 1 SCR 103 to
                    refer to the “minimal impairment requirement”. Therefore, under
                    the Canadian regime, the freedom of expression guaranteed under s 2(b) of
                    the Charter is subject only to restrictions prescribed by law provided it meets
                    the minimum impairment requirement. The position in Singapore is, however, quite
                    different. Art 14 is expressly made subject to the right of Parliament to impose
                    such restrictions as it may consider necessary or expedient by reasons of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, interest of the security of
                    Singapore or “public order”. Unlike the position in Canada, there
                    is no requirement in Singapore for such restrictions to meet the minimal
                    impairment requirement. Furthermore, there is no dispute that the PEMA was
                    validly passed by Parliament pursuant to Art 14(2)(a) of the
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Vancouver v
                        Zhang</em>, the court was persuaded to find that s 71 was
                    unconstitutional because the City Council chose to maintain a <em>complete</em> ban against the use of structure for political
                    expression. In the appeals before me, there is simply no evidence that a
                        <em>complete</em> ban exist. The very fact that the
                    PEMA specifically provides for a procedure to apply for a licence to provide
                    public entertainment, which by definition includes making an address, would
                    negate the existence of such a <em>complete</em> ban. As
                    such, there is no merit whatsoever in the appellants’ renewed submission
                    as regards the alleged unconstitutionality of the PEMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the alleged discriminatory licensing policy provides a
                defence to the appellants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellants argued that, as members of a
                    political party, they were subjected to an alleged discriminatory application
                    and enforcement of the PEMA by the police authorities, the Executive and the
                    PELU. The appellants contend that there exists an Executive policy to impose a
                    blanket ban on the issuance of licences to political parties to make speeches,
                    and that such a policy contravenes their right to equal protection under the law
                    as guaranteed by Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I find the appellants’ contentions to be
                    wholly misconceived. First, during the appeal, I questioned Dr Chee as to
                    how such a policy, even assuming that it exists, could translate into a defence
                    against his convictions under s 19(1)(a) of PEMA. In particular, I asked
                    Dr Chee whether such a policy would render the PEMA unconstitutional.
                    Dr Chee was unable to provide a clear explanation. However, he accepted
                    that the policy did not affect the constitutionality of the PEMA (see Notes of
                    Evidence of the present appeal (“N/E”) at p 75):</p>

                            that this policy was in place and this policy was unconstitutional, are
                            you therefore saying that PEMA is unconstitutional?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Chee:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">   No, your Honour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The logical effect of Dr Chee’s
                    clarification is that the PEMA remains valid and if so it continues to be an
                    offence under the PEMA to make an address without a licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Second, it is undisputed that the appellants
                    did not apply for the requisite licence to make an address. Given that there was
                        <em>no application</em> for the licence under the PEMA,
                    there is no decision that the Court can review. Without an application for a
                    licence by the appellants, any alleged discriminatory <em>licensing</em> policy would have <em>no
                        effect</em> on the appellants and would therefore be irrelevant to the
                    appellants’ offences under the PEMA. Indeed, s 13 of the PEMA
                    expressly provides for the proper procedure to be adopted in the event that the
                    PELU rejects an application for a licence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Refusal of licence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13</b>.—(1) The Licensing
                        Officer may, in his discretion, refuse to issue or renew any
                        licence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) The Licensing Officer shall, if so required by the applicant
                        or the licensee, as the case may be, furnish the applicant or the
                        licensee within 7 days of being so required with the <em>grounds of such refusal in writing</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved by the refusal of
                        the Licensing Officer may, within 14 days of the furnishing to him of
                        the grounds of the refusal, <em>appeal in writing to the
                            Minister whose decision shall be final</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) Where the Minister decides to grant the appeal for the issue
                        or renewal of a licence, he may impose such conditions as he thinks
                        fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The proper remedy for a complainant whose
                    licence application was refused, is to seek grounds for such refusal in writing
                    under s 13(2) and to appeal in writing to the Minister under s 13(3).
                    This was elaborated by Chan J (as he then was) in <em>JBJ v
                        PP</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    Under s 13(2) of the Act, the first appellant
                            was entitled to ask the licensing officer for the reasons for rejecting
                            his application. He omitted to exercise this right at that stage. He
                            contended that he was still entitled to exercise it at the trial. In my
                            view, he was wrong. The purpose of s 13(2) is not to enable a
                            person charged for an offence under the Act to ask for the reasons at
                            the trial. The purpose is to enable an aggrieved applicant to appeal to
                            the Minister under s 14 of the Act. There was no question of an
                            appeal to the Minister in this case….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The soundness of the first appellant's submission
                            may be tested by assuming that the licensing officer wrongfully refused
                            the licence. What were his legal rights? The court would have quashed
                            the decision if the appellants had commenced proceedings for judicial
                            review. The licensing officer would then have to consider the
                            application afresh. If he refused, the court would have the power to
                            direct him to do so. But, the court would not have been able to grant a
                            licence to the first appellant or direct the licensing officer to do so,
                            as the power of court is exercisable by way of supervisory jurisdiction
                            in these matters. Therefore, the invalidity of the decision of the
                            licensing officer would result in nothing more than the appellants'
                                <em>status quo ante</em> the application. They
                            would still have had no licence when they provided the public
                            entertainment. The law was that no public entertainment might be
                            provided without a licence under the Act and except in accordance with
                            the terms of the licence. The law was not that public entertainment
                            might be provided subject to such restrictions as might be imposed under
                            the Act. It must follow that the answers of the licensing officer,
                            whatever they might have been, could not have provided any defence to
                            the appellants on the charges against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The appellants tried to explain away their
                    omission to apply for the licence. They claimed that there would have been no
                    point in applying for a licence as they believed that the PELU or police
                    authorities would in any event not consider and reject applications by political
                    parties. I am unable to accept this contention. First, it has been decided in
                        <em>Tan Khee Wan Iris v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    1 SLR(R) 723 (“<em>Tan Khee Wan
                    Iris</em>”) that the offence of providing public entertainment
                    without a licence under the PEMA is one of strict liability. There is no burden
                    on the Prosecution to establish any <em>mens rea</em> as
                    regards the absence of a licence. Second, the truth of the matter is the
                    appellants had never intended to apply for a licence because such a requirement
                    had not operated on their minds before and during the commission of the
                    offences; the appellants did not believe that the licence was required since,
                    according to their own case, <em>they had only intended to make a
                        sales pitch</em>. Indeed, Dr Chee testified that he did not apply
                    for a licence because he believed that none was required (see N/E at pp 265?266
                    for MA 133/2008):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">On that day, you did not have a licence to speak to
                            the crowd as shown in the video. Agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No. We were selling the newspaper. As I made it
                            abundantly clear, I have been doing so for years and never had a permit
                            to do what we were doing on 8 April 2006.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You agreed you were the person talking in the
                            video. All I am asking is did you on that day have a
                        licence?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We have a permit on the newspaper to sell the
                            newspaper which we have been doing it for years. There is a separate
                            licence which we can apply to the PELU and do it online but because we
                            were not giving a speech we did not apply for a licence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Dr Chee reiterated the same position
                    subsequently (see N/E at p 593 for MA 233/234 of 2010):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But you were certain of one thing, which is that
                            you did not need a public entertainment licence because your purpose in
                            engaging in these sort of activities was to sell your publications and
                            raise funds?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And what was the basis of this
                        belief?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I am not sure what you mean.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What was the basis of your certainty that you did
                            not need a licence under PEMA?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I suppose because our intention was to go out and
                            sell the newspaper, as far as I understand it, that doesn’t fall
                            under PEMA. Only if you want to make a speech. So it’s not
                            something that seemed to be congruent, I guess.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is also noteworthy that District Judge Jill
                    Tan observed in her judgment, <em>Public Prosecutor v Chee Soon
                        Juan &amp; another</em> [2010] SGDC 298 (“<em>PP v Chee Soon Juan &amp; anor</em>”), the
                    same:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    [Chee] did not apply for a public entertainment
                            licence because he considered it to be unnecessary as he only intended
                            to sell the publications, not make a speech. He contended that all his
                            utterances that day were to further the sale of the publications, and
                            that if the exhortations to the public to buy the publications were
                            removed, his remaining words would have no meaning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In light of the above, it is misleading for
                    the appellants to submit that they did not obtain a licence because of their
                    belief that a policy existed to deny licences to political parties for making
                    public addresses and that such a policy is unconstitutional. The truth is that
                    the appellants made a wrong judgment call that no licence was
                required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I further note that there is no evidence of
                    the alleged discriminatory policy. The appellants attempted to suggest that the
                    lack of evidence of the discriminatory policy was due to the trial Judges’
                    refusal to allow the appellants to cross-examine the police officers and
                    officers from the PELU on the parliamentary statements made by Minister Wong Kan
                        Seng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In
                    particular, the appellants contended that the trial court was the appropriate
                    forum to consider the constitutional challenge of the discriminatory licensing
                    policy, and submitted that the trial Judges should have allowed the appellants
                    to conduct the cross-examination. In the oral submissions before me, the
                    appellants argued that they were entitled to raise the issue on the
                    unconstitutionality of the discriminatory licensing policy before the trial
                    Judges, and submitted that if the policy was indeed found to be
                    unconstitutional, it would have provided a complete defence to the offence under
                    the PEMA. The appellants relied on the decision of <em>Boddington
                        v British Transport Police</em> [1992] 2 AC 143 (“<em>Boddington”</em>) to support their position that such
                    collateral challenges are permitted in criminal proceedings, and argued that it
                    was not necessary for such constitutional challenges to be dealt with by way of
                    a separate judicial review. Dr Chee made the following submissions in the
                    appeal (see N/E at pp 69 and 70):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Chee:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">   …on the

                            addressed by the Courts but only by way of a judicial review, your

                            review is not a straight-jacket which must be put on before rights can

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Boddington</em>, a
                    railway company exercised its powers pursuant to s 67(1) of the UK
                    Transport Act 1962 to create a by-law to ban smoking in all carriages. In his
                    defence to a conviction of smoking in a carriage, the appellant argued that the
                    railway company’s decision to create the relevant by-law was <em>ultra vires</em> the UK Transport Act. The House of Lords
                    held that such an argument could be raised as a defence to criminal proceedings
                    and need not be brought by way of a separate enquiry for judicial review. The
                    decision of <em>Boddington</em> can be understood in its
                    context; if the by-law was found to be <em>ultra
                    vires</em>, it would have been declared invalid, and there would have been
                    no offence for which the appellant in that case could have committed. This is in
                    contrast to the present case, where, as already emphasised above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, the existence of the unconstitutional
                    licensing policy, if any, would have <em>no effect</em> on
                    the constitutionality of the PEMA. The statute which creates the offence would
                    still remain valid. Furthermore, as highlighted above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>, the purported existence of the
                    unconstitutional licensing policy would, in the absence of an application for a
                    licence, be irrelevant to the appellants’ case in any event. Moreover, I
                    have serious doubts that the principle in <em>Boddington</em> would apply similarly for <em>constitutional</em> challenges raised in subordinate court
                    proceedings, given the subordinate court’s lack of powers to grant public
                    law remedies such as <em>certiorari</em> and <em>mandamus</em>. Indeed, it has been emphasised in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin and others v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1994] 3 SLR(R) 209 (“<em>Chan Hiang
                        Leng”</em>) that the position in England is quite different
                    from the local position, given that our Subordinate Courts have the guidance of
                    s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Subordinate Courts Act”), or more recently, of s 395 of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (No. 15 of 2010) (“ the CPC
                    2010”). Both provisions are dealt with in greater detail below at
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>–<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>. The Court in <em>Chan Hiang Leng</em>
                    pointed out that the principle in <em>Boddington</em> may
                    apply to an <em>ultra vires</em> challenge of the relevant
                    Order in question, but <em>constitutional</em> challenges
                    should properly be governed by applications under s 56A (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no provision in England similar to our s 56A. The English
                        position can therefore be distinguished in this respect. However, in the
                        context of this case, I am of the view that the English principles are
                        relevant. Section 56A can be read as being confined to constitutional issues
                        alone. The issues raised here include challenges to the validity of orders
                        on the basis that they are <em>ultra vires</em>.
                            <em>Ultra vires</em> issues are not necessarily
                        issues arising out of or with respect to an interpretation of the
                        Constitution and therefore cannot be referred to the High Court under
                        s 56A. As I have stated earlier, the district judge's ruling on these
                        preliminary issues was correct. I would add however that it should also be
                        subject to the refinement enunciated by Woolf LJ in <em>Bugg
                            v Director of Public Prosecutions</em>. It is clearly not proper
                        to raise <em>ultra vires</em> issues which extend
                        beyond substantive validity, in the sense of being clearly wrong on the face
                        of it, in Subordinate Court proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In any event, the trial Judges’
                    decisions not to allow the appellants to cross-examine the police or officers
                    from PELU on the Parliamentary reports made by the Minister were plainly correct
                    for the simple reason that the reports had <em>no bearing or
                        relevance</em> to the appellants’ case. The Minister’s
                    statements related to the prohibition of <em>outdoor and street
                        demonstrations and protests</em>; the statements relied upon by the
                    appellants say nothing about prohibiting political parties from making addresses
                    (under the PEMA) in public places. The Minister’s statements are
                    reproduced below for ease of reference; see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates</em> (28 February 2008) vol 84 (Mr Wong Kan
                    Seng, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have also evolved our policies in relation to different forms of
                        expression.  To recapitulate, in the year 2000, we created the
                        Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches.  In 2004,
                        we liberalised its use to include performances and exhibitions.  In
                        addition, we exempted all indoor public talks from the licensing requirement
                        under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, so long as the organisers
                        and speakers are Singapore citizens.  The only content restriction to
                        all these is that the speeches must not touch on race or religion,
                        and Members know why.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>We have stopped short of allowing outdoor and street
                            demonstrations</em></b>.  However, we allow demonstrations if
                        they take place indoors or within the confines of stadiums, as the Police
                        assess that any disorder will be better contained in such venues. We are
                        presently reviewing how we can further liberalise the use of Speaker's
                        Corner as an outdoor venue for more political activities including
                        demonstrations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our experiences in the past have taught us to be <b><em>very
                            circumspect about outdoor and street protests</em></b>.  The 1950
                        Maria Hertogh riots and the 1964 race riots, both started as peaceful
                        assemblies, but eventually ended up with 54 dead, 736 injured…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> …we constantly review our assumptions by monitoring the
                        developments in other countries.  And what we learn tells us that our
                        concerns remain valid.  In many supposedly mature societies, we see
                        cases where <b><em>peaceful protests</em></b> do degenerate
                        into riots and violence.  <b><em>Protest
                            organisers</em></b> do not typically declare that they want to hold a
                        violent protest.  And although most people involved in a demonstration
                        may have no intention of using violence, a handful of agitators can
                        spark off mob violence quite easily.  So, for young people in their
                        exuberance, they may think that it is fun to demonstrate for whatever the
                        cause.  They have no control of the situation should agitators choose
                        to exploit it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question for Singaporeans is <b><em>whether we should
                            accept the risk and permit a culture of street
                            protests. </em></b> That is the key question.  In my view,
                        one riot is one riot too many.  The scars of violence in a community
                        take a long time to heal.  Once lost, public confidence in our
                        stability and security will take a long time to re-build.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Evidently, there is nothing in the
                    Minister’s parliamentary speech to suggest any alleged blanket ban on the
                    issuance of permits to political parties to make addresses at public places. The
                    parliamentary statements pertained to the prohibition of outdoor and street
                    demonstrations and protests. The appellants’ contention in the context of
                    the offences before me was therefore devoid of any merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Dr Chee had also relied on some
                    parliamentary statements made by Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee. These
                    statements are reproduced below; see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> (27 August 2007) vol 83, col 1337 (Associate Professor Ho
                    Peng Kee for the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Home
                    Affairs):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ms Sylvia Lim asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home
                        Affairs if he will provide reasons for the rejection of a police permit to
                        hold the Workers' Party 50th Anniversary Cycling Event on 9th September 2007
                        at the East Coast Park.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for
                        Home Affairs): Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why political parties
                        are not allowed to organise outdoor activities has been explained in
                        Parliament before.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Police does not allow political parties to <b><em>organise
                            outdoor gatherings</em></b> because such activities have the potential
                        for public disorder and mischief, and may disrupt community life. 
                        Police's requirement is that such party activities be held indoors or within
                        stadiums, so that any law and order problems would be contained. 
                        <b><em>This policy applies to all political
                        parties</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Workers' Party had applied to the Police to organise a <b><em>mass cycling event</em></b> to celebrate the party's 50th
                        anniversary at the East Coast Park.  The East Coast Park is a
                        recreational park for Singaporeans and their families.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not meant to be used by a political party to promote its cause.
                        Apart from displacing the usual recreational users of East Coast Park, it is
                        an open area where there is greater potential for a breach of the peace,
                        public disorder and unruly behaviour. As I have explained, Police takes a
                        more cautious approach towards outdoor activities organised by political
                        parties. In line with this approach, Police rejected Workers' Party's
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the Workers' Party may wish to consider organising its
                        celebrations at an indoor venue or in a sports stadium.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is unclear why Dr Chee had sought to
                    rely on these parliamentary statements. There is nothing in them to suggest that
                    a policy exists to impose any blanket ban on all applications for licences by
                    political parties under the PEMA to make addresses in a public place. The
                    statements were made in the specific context of a cycling event, and are
                    relevant only to the broader context of <b><em>outdoor
                        gatherings</em></b> organised by political parties. They have no relevance
                    to the present appeals. I should add that Dr Chee, in his submissions, had
                    omitted to mention Associate Professor Ho’s clear statement that the
                    policy against outdoor gatherings applies to <em>all</em>
                    political parties.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Section 395 of the CPC 2010 represents a
                    consolidated provision which governs the process in which <em>any</em> question of law is referred from the trial court to a higher
                    court. The Explanatory Statement to the <em>Criminal Procedure
                        Code Bill (Bill No 11/2010)</em> (27 April 2010) at p 432
                    provides a concise description of s 395:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Section] 395 relates to the power of a trial court to state a case on
                            <em>any</em> question of law to a superior
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this regard, a reference of a question of
                    law which relates to the interpretation or effect of any constitutional
                    provision, which was previously governed by the standalone provision under
                    s 56A, is now <em>subsumed</em> under s 395 (in
                    particular, s 395(2)(a)) of the CPC 2010. Indeed, with the enactment of
                    s 395 of the CPC 2010, s 56A is no longer required and has <em>consequently</em> been repealed (see Sixth Schedule,
                        <em>Consequential and Related Amendments to Other Written
                        Laws</em>, <em>Criminal Procedure Code Bill (Bill No
                        11/2010)</em> (27 April 2010) at p 390, paragraph 105(c)). I
                    further observe that s 395 of the CPC 2010 (in particular,
                    s 395(2)(b)) encapsulates aspects of the repealed s 263 of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed), a provision which
                    had previously governed the procedure of reserving points of law from a
                    Subordinate Court acting in summary jurisdiction in any criminal cause or matter
                    to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In my view, both s 56A and
                    s 395(2)(a) (read with s 395(4)) of the CPC 2010 propound a two stage
                    test. First, the Subordinate Court has to determine from the facts and
                    submissions presented by the accused (or in certain cases, by the Prosecution),
                    whether a <em>relevant</em> question concerning the
                        <em>interpretation</em> or <em>effect of
                        any provision of the Constitution</em> has arisen for determination by
                    the High Court (“the first stage”). This requirement is evident
                    from the language of s 56A(1) and s 395(2)(a) of the CPC 2010, and was
                    alluded to in the decision of <em>Chan Hiang Leng</em>,
                    where the Court decided that the lower court was correct <em>not</em> to make any reference to the High Court since no
                    constitutional issue had arisen in that case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Section 56A can be read as being <em>confined to constitutional issues alone</em>. The issues
                            raised here include challenges to the validity of orders on the basis
                            that they are <em>ultra vires</em>. <em>Ultra vires</em> issues are not necessarily issues
                            arising out of or with respect to an interpretation of the Constitution
                            and therefore cannot be referred to the High Court under
                            s 56A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The first stage requires the Subordinate Court
                    to characterise the factual matrix and arguments presented by the party
                    asserting the constitutional challenge so as to determine whether a question has
                    arisen on the interpretation or effect of a constitutional provision. The burden
                    is on the party asserting the constitutional challenge to satisfy the Court that
                    such a relevant question has arisen for determination. The mere assertion or
                    allusion to a contravention of a provision of the Constitution is
                    insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The second requirement of s 56A and
                    s 395(2)(a) (read with s 395(4)) of the CPC 2010 (“the second
                    stage”) arises for consideration once the Subordinate Court decides that
                    the proceedings does give rise to a question relating to the interpretation or
                    effect of a provision in the Constitution which is relevant to the determination
                    of the criminal proceedings. The Subordinate Court would thereafter have to
                    decide whether it is a proper case to be referred to the High Court. As is
                    evident from the phrase “the court hearing the proceedings <em>may</em> stay the proceedings” under s 56A(1),
                    this is a matter of judicial discretion as was observed in <em>Johari bin Kanadi and another v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR(R) 422 (at [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    A subordinate court has the discretion whether or
                            not to stay proceedings when an application is made before it under
                            s 56A of the [Subordinate Courts Act]. This discretion, properly
                            exercised after judicious consideration of the <em>merits</em> of the application, will <em>prevent unnecessary delay and possible abuse</em> every time
                            a party in the proceedings purports to raise an issue of constitutional
                            interpretation or effect. To merit a reference under s 56A, the
                            applicant must show that there are new and difficult legal issues
                            involving the Constitution which have not been previously dealt with by
                            the superior courts. It is not sufficient merely to set out a new
                            factual situation because new factual permutations will always arise.
                                <em>Where questions of law have already been decided
                                or principles relating to an article in the Constitution have been
                                set out by the superior courts, a subordinate court need not stay
                                proceedings</em> under s 56A but should proceed to apply
                            the relevant case law or extrapolate from the principles enunciated to
                            reach a proper conclusion on the facts before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The pertinent question governing the second
                    stage is, <em>how</em> should the Subordinate Court
                    exercise this discretion? It should, at the outset, be stressed that the
                    judicial discretion is necessarily a <em>limited</em> one.
                    The Subordinate Court has to exercise this discretion with caution and judicious
                    sensitivity to its own lack of jurisdiction to deal with the substantive issues
                    of the constitutional challenge. Unlike the powers conferred on the High Court
                    by way of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed ), the Subordinate Courts are <em>not</em> conferred the powers to grant <em>certiorari</em> or <em>mandamus</em> orders.
                    Without such powers, the Subordinate Court has no jurisdiction to determine the
                    substantive issues of any constitutional challenge. The Subordinate Court can
                    however, properly exercise its discretion <em>not</em> to
                    refer constitutional challenges which are frivolous, or which are made for
                    collateral purposes or to delay proceedings, or if they otherwise constitute an
                    abuse of process. In this regard, the Subordinate Court may consider the merits
                    of the case <em>in so far as</em> to determine whether the
                    constitutional issue raised is a genuine or serious one and not a frivolous one
                    merely to delay proceedings. If the constitutional question raised has already
                    been resolved by a superior court, such that the position in that area is
                    settled and uncontroversial, no reference to the High Court should be permitted.
                    Indeed, as compared to s 56A, these considerations are now <em>expressly</em> provided by statute: s 395(4) of the CPC
                    2010 expressly confers on the trial court the discretion to <em>refuse</em> an application (unless it is an application made by the
                    Prosecution) to refer the purported constitutional question to the High Court,
                    if the trial court considers the application to be frivolous or without any
                    merit. Nevertheless, I emphasise the importance that the Subordinate Court
                    should apply its mind to the facts of each case to determine if it indeed
                    involves a constitutional question which has decidedly been resolved by a
                    superior court, or whether a different, unresolved, constitutional question has
                    arisen from the unique facts of the particular case at hand. If a serious or
                    novel constitutional question does arise, the Subordinate Court should
                    ordinarily stay the proceedings and refer the question to the High Court. In
                    these circumstances however, the Subordinate Court should also be mindful that
                    s 56A and s 395 of the CPC 2010 is not misused as a backdoor approach
                    to evade the leave requirement for applications for judicial review under Order
                    53 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Turning the analysis to the present case, I am
                    of the view that the trial Judges made the correct decisions not to stay the
                    respective criminal proceedings in the courts below in order to refer the
                    purported constitutional challenges to the High Court. I make no specific
                    observation on the reasoning relied upon by the trial Judges to come to their
                    respective decisions. I will however explain why there was indeed no necessity
                    to stay the criminal proceedings to refer the purported constitutional questions
                    to the High Court for determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     First, as explained above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>–<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>, the appellants’ assertion of the alleged
                    discriminatory policy of the police, the Executive and the PELU in imposing a
                    blanket ban on the issuance of permits, even if taken as true, does not give
                    rise to any question concerning the interpretation or effect of any provision of
                    the Constitution that would have any bearing on the Prosecution’s case or
                    the appellants’ defence. The alleged discriminatory policy to deny
                    political parties the licence to make an address, even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that it exists, is wholly irrelevant to the
                    present appeals as the appellants admitted that they had no intention to apply
                    for a licence in the first place. The requirement of a licence had never
                    operated on the appellants’ mind before and during the commission of the
                    offences since they claimed that they had no intention to make a speech or to
                    make an address. The appellants allegedly only had the intention to make a sales
                    pitch of the newsletters. In effect, the first stage of s 56A is not
                    satisfied as the appellants’ allegations do not give rise to any relevant
                    question concerning the interpretation or effect of any provision of the
                    Constitution, and as such, does not warrant any reference to the High
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     With regard to the constitutional challenge
                    based on Art 14, the second stage of s 56A is not satisfied. It has already
                    been shown above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> that the law in this
                    area is well settled by the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The appellants further argued in the
                    alternative that they had modelled their conduct and activities to be the same
                    as hawkers and stall-owners, and that by singling the appellants out, they were
                    the target of discriminatory prosecution in contravention of Art 12 of the
                    Constitution. This contention is <em>in effect</em> a
                    substantive defence framed in the guise of a constitutional challenge. If the
                    appellants’ conduct was indeed the same or similar to that of hawkers or
                    stall-owners, the appellants would merely be selling goods, and that would
                    operate as a defence to the offence of making an address without a licence. The
                    proper analysis for this question therefore hinges on whether what was said by
                    the appellant was a sales pitch. If the appellants’ conduct was found to
                    be making only a sales pitch and nothing more, that would translate into a
                    defence on the merits. However, as will be shown in the succeeding paragraphs
                    below, the appellants’ conduct was manifestly different from those of
                    hawkers and stall-owners; and was shown to have gone patently beyond that of
                    merely making a sales pitch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the appellants did make an “address”
            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     To constitute an offence under s 19(1)(a)
                    of the PEMA, the burden is on the Prosecution to satisfy the following
                    elements:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the appellants were present at the scene of the
                            offence;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the place where the offence took place was one to
                            which the public had access;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">each of the appellants had made an address at the
                            material time; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">each of the appellants did not have the requisite
                            licence issued under the PEMA to make the address.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There is no dispute that the appellants were
                    at the locations at the material time, and that each of the locations was a
                    place to which the public had access. It was also undisputed that the appellants
                    did not have the requisite licence at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In addition, there was no dispute that the
                    appellants did speak to a crowd of people at each of those public places. The
                    dispute before the trial Judges in the proceedings below was whether those
                    instances constituted “addresses” within the meaning of the PEMA.
                    After each of the lengthy trials, the trial Judges reached their respective
                    conclusions, having the benefit of the oral testimony of the various witnesses
                    as well as the transcripts of the video recordings, that the appellants did make
                    addresses on each of the four occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is trite that an appellate court will only
                    disturb findings of fact made by the trial judge when they are clearly against
                    the weight of the evidence or plainly wrong: See <em>Lim Ah Poh v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 192. Having examined
                    the evidence, I can see no reason to disturb their findings. From my review, as
                    explained below, the evidence supports the findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As a starting point, there is no dispute on
                    the content of what was said as recorded in the transcripts. Before me, the
                    appellants dealt with this issue only at the threshold level, that is, they
                    simply disagree with the trial Judges’
                    <em>interpretation</em> of what was said. No specific
                    submission was made by the appellants in relation to each of the four incidents
                    as to why, given the contents of what was said, they nonetheless did not
                    constitute “addresses” within the PEMA. The appellants maintained
                    that they were merely making a <em>sales pitch</em> to
                    promote the sale of The New Democrat. As such, the only issue here is whether
                        <em>what was actually said</em> amounted to an
                        “<em>address</em>” under the PEMA.
                    Specifically, Mr Yap claimed in the appeal before me that his subjective
                        <em>purpose</em> at the material time was to sell the
                    New Democrat, as opposed to making an address (see N/E Day 2 at
                    p 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your Honour…the difference, I think, I like the first angle to be
                        drawn to … what’s the purpose. If it was an address, I think
                        the person making the address would have just the <em>objective</em> of delivering its content…but for---for
                        sales, <em>the purpose was to promote the sales and get the
                            revenue. So the purpose, the main content being delivered is to tell
                            people this is $2</em>… If the contents were all relating
                        towards the promotion purpose and the sales purpose and …gaining the
                        attention and get[ting] the revenue, it will not be the same as [an]
                        address…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Mr Yap’s self-declared subjective
                    intent must be considered in the context of his actual objective conduct at the
                    material time. In this regard, the <em>actual words</em>
                    said by the appellants are material in determining whether an
                    “address” was made. The law in this area is clear. The intention
                    or purpose of the accused is irrelevant. In <em>JBJ v
                        PP</em>, the Court explained the meaning of the word
                    “address” in s 2(m) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…by reason of the statutory definition, <em>whether
                            an activity is ‘public entertainment’ is not determined by
                            its purpose</em> or its nature and/or effect but simply by its
                        form.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The ordinary meaning of the word “address” is a
                        speech made to a group of people, usually on a formal occasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This position was endorsed in <em>Chee Soon Juan v PP</em>, where the Court observed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">13</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">…for an activity to come within the scope of
                            PEMA, the activity must be directed at the public; in the sense of
                            procuring their involvement whether actively or passively. This should
                            be read implicitly into the activities listed in s 2 of the
                            Schedule, and is an objective test to be satisfied on the facts of the
                            case...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The appellants also submitted that they did
                    not make any address since their “<em>speeches</em>” were short and they were made at informal settings.
                    However as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the length of the
                        “<em>speech</em>” is not <em>per se</em> determinative of the issue. The contents of the
                        “<em>speeches</em>”, the manner in which
                    they were made and the audience to which they were addressed are all relevant
                    factors for consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I turn my attention now to the actual words
                    said by the appellants on each of the four occasions to examine whether they
                    constitute as <em>addresses</em> within the meaning of the
                    PEMA.</p>

                    clearly went beyond that of making a sales pitch. He addressed the public on
                    social issues, and attempted to advance his party’s political agenda by
                    persuading members of the public to “refuse to be deceived” and to

                    raise several issues of social concern, as well as to advance their

                    the government and by advising members of the public on how to cast their votes.

                    merely highlight from the transcripts that they did ask members of the public at
                    certain instances to purchase the New Democrat. In the circumstances, I have no
                    doubt that the offence of making an address without a licence was made out under
                    the PEMA in respect of each of the four incidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Before concluding, I should add that
                    Mr Yap did raise a completely new point during his oral submission before
                    me. He purported to rely on s 79 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    1985 Rev Ed), which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact
                            believing himself justified by law</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>79</b>. Nothing is an offence <em>which is done</em> by any person who is justified by law, or who
                        by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good
                        faith believes himself to be justified by law, <em>in doing
                            it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Yap acknowledged that this submission
                    was not raised in the courts below or in any of his petitions of appeal. In any
                    event, Mr Yap’s submission is sorely misconceived. He is precluded
                    from relying on s 79 because he does not even admit to have committed the
                    relevant act – he does not admit to making an address under the PEMA. As
                    explained above, his defence is that he did not make nor did he intend to make
                    any address in breach of the PEMA. There was therefore no question of
                    “mistake” which is a prerequisite to invoke the defence under s79
                    of the Penal Code. I should add that it has been decided in <em>Tan Khee Wan Iris</em> that a defendant who seeks to rely upon
                    s 79 of the Penal Code as a defence to the offence of providing public
                    entertainment without a licence under the PEMA has the burden to show on a
                    balance of probabilities that he had acted under a mistake, and by reason of
                    that, <em>he believed in good faith that he had a valid licence
                        at the material time</em>. Mr Yap has clearly failed to discharge
                    this burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the appeals before me, the appellants did
                    not make any submission on the sentences imposed. The appellants did not explain
                    how and why the sentences were manifestly excessive. Indeed, they did not even
                    make the assertion that the sentences were manifestly excessive. No mitigating
                    factors were adduced, and no sentencing precedents or benchmarks were submitted
                    to the court. I am of the view that the sentences imposed were appropriate and
                    fair. A higher fine and a higher corresponding default sentence were rightly
                    imposed on Dr Chee in view of his similar antecedents under the
                    PEMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For the reasons set out above, the appeals
                    against both convictions and sentences are accordingly dismissed.</p>
