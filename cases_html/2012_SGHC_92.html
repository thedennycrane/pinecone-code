<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns ancillary
                    matters flowing from the breakdown of a long marriage of 36
                    years. The parties, who were married on 9 December
                        1972<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, are
                    now well into their mid-60s – the wife is 65 years old
                    and the husband is 66 years old. Divorce proceedings were
                    commenced by the wife on 4 February 2008, and the
                    interim judgment for divorce was granted on 18 April
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties had two children
                    during their marriage. Both are independent and
                    self-supporting – the daughter is now 37 years old,
                    and the son, 35 years old<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    – and no custody issue arises. The ancillary issues at
                    hand thus relate only to the just and equitable division of
                    the matrimonial assets, and maintenance of the wife that
                    would be reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       After the parties married in
                    1972, they stayed in a 2-room flat in Toa Payoh at a monthly
                    rental of $40, paid by the husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> They
                    moved into a 5-room HDB flat in Ghim Moh (“Ghim Moh
                    flat”) in 1976<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, and
                    subsequently bought a terrace house at Namly Place
                    (“the Namly House”), which they rented out
                    from 1993 to 1996 at $1,800 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They
                    began to live in the Namly House in September
                        1996.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In
                    October 1999, three years after moving into the Namly House,
                    differences between the parties drove the wife to move to a
                    separate bedroom in the Namly House (“the Separate
                    Bedrooms Arrangement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respective financial contributions to the
                family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It was undisputed that the
                    husband was, throughout the marriage, the main breadwinner
                    of the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> By
                    contrast, the wife had been a homemaker since the birth of
                    the children. She did, however, engage in part-time or ad
                    hoc work from time to time<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>, which
                    gave her the flexibility to care for the children and the
                    family. The wife’s low level of income during the
                    marriage was reflected in a record of her employment history
                    between 1980 and 2008, produced by the husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Namly House was
                    purchased at $780,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The
                    mortgage has since been discharged. Its current value is
                    approximately $3.4 million. The parties’ respective
                    direct financial contributions towards the purchase of the
                    Namly House are disputed. While the husband claims to have
                    paid 100% of the purchase price<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>,
                    the wife claims to have contributed 12% of the purchase
                    price using $19,000 from her CPF account and $78,000
                    withdrawn from her POSB Bank account and paid towards the
                    10% deposit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> (see
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Of her indirect financial
                    contributions, the wife pointed to<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>
                    (a) payments allegedly made for household furnishing,
                    renovations, and landscaping; and (b) her share of the Ghim
                    Moh flat sale proceeds, which she claims to have ploughed
                    back as loan repayments in respect of the Namly
                        House.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respective non-financial contributions to the
                family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The wife’s
                    non-financial contributions to the family were quite
                    substantial. As the family did not engage domestic help for
                    most part of the marriage<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, the
                    wife did the marketing and took care of the household and
                    the children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It
                    was also the wife who managed the tenancy matters of the
                    Namly House during the period of its rental, <em>viz</em>, putting out and paying for
                    advertisements, arranging for viewings of the house and
                    collecting rent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The husband claims that he
                    also made non-financial contributions to the household by
                    cooking for the family, doing the household chores and
                    participating in the upbringing of the children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> This
                    is disputed by the wife who claims that the husband was an
                    absent father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    She claims that instances of the “recent
                    phenomenon” of him cooking for the family are few and
                    far between.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    The children have not sworn any affidavit in support of
                    either parent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Earning capacity of each party</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The husband claims that he
                    is currently unemployed, with a last drawn gross monthly
                    salary of $10,300 as of 31 March 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> In
                    other words, he ceased to be gainfully employed some three
                    weeks after the divorce was granted. His position is that
                    while he continues to assist his son and daughter-in-law in
                    the running of their company (“the Company”),
                    he does not draw a salary and has no interest in the
                        Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    Indeed, the relevant ACRA documents state the parties’
                    son as the manager and the daughter-in-law as the sole
                    proprietor of the Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I
                    note that while the wife asserts that the Company is the
                    husband’s own business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, she
                    has not produced any objective evidence proving the same.
                    She relies instead on her belief that the business is
                    “a very specialised field which only [the husband]
                    would have expertise and experience in”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The husband claims that
                    his assets are worth $562,864.56 and the wife’s
                    disclosed assets total $180,925.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    The wife claims that her assets are worth only
                        $64,582.89<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and
                    that the husband’s disclosed assets are worth at least
                        $835,627.25.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Each
                    accuses the other of failing to disclose substantial assets
                    (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> to <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The wife submits that, for
                    the sake of convenience, only the Namly House should be
                    divided while considering all the matrimonial assets of the
                        couple.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> This
                    was the only common ground between the parties. She claims
                    70% of the Namly House sale proceeds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The husband, however,
                    argues that the maximum proportion of the matrimonial assets
                    the wife should get is 25% of the Namly House sale
                        proceeds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> He claims
                    that in light of the Separate Bedrooms Arrangement, parties
                    had effectively been married for only three years after
                    moving into the Namly House, and that, since the children
                    had become independent by then, “the
                    Plaintiff’s non-financial contributions for the Namly
                    Place terrace house were not
                        significant”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     While the husband is only
                    willing to pay a lump sum maintenance of $12,000 ($200/mth x
                    12 x 5 years)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, the
                    wife claims a lump sum of $179,400, calculated in the
                    following manner<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The claim for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The parties cannot agree
                    on the total value of the matrimonial assets. Although they
                    agree that the Namly House is worth about $3.4 million
                    (there is an in-principle agreement expressed to be
                    effective from 27 April 2012 to 31 May 2012 to
                    sell the house at $3.4 million), there is a vast difference
                    in the valuation of the assets held in each party’s
                    name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     During the hearing on

                    (“Mr Wong”), tendered a helpful supplementary
                    Comparative Table of Matrimonial Assets (“the
                    Comparative Table”) setting out and explaining the
                    disparities between each party’s valuation of the
                    assets. After examining the evidence adduced by the
                    respective parties, I determine the husband’s assets
                    to be $700,800 and the wife’s assets to be $67,500.
                    For ease of reference, my determination is set out in the

                    ($85,873.20) and Item 10 ($315,683.61). These are based on
                    valuations as at July 2008 and supported by
                        evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> I reject the
                    husband’s unsubstantiated figures including his

                    I have included it in the common pool. I disregard Item 13
                    as there is nothing, apart from the husband’s bare
                    assertion, to prove the alleged debt of $6,100 due from the

                    support the inference that the husband had closed some of

                    that person by ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed
                    assets to the other party or, where possible, proceed to
                    determine the actual value of the undisclosed assets based
                    on available information, and include such value in the pool
                    of assets to be divided (see <em>NK v

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In light of the foregoing,
                    I would draw an adverse inference against the husband in
                    relation to Items 3 and 4 as he has failed to disclose
                    the whereabouts of the proceeds of those unit trusts sold in
                    March 2008 for $26,486.20.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> I would

                    Item 7. The bank account was closed shortly after the
                    commencement of divorce proceedings, on 5 March

                    and he has not accounted for the whereabouts of the closing

                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I reject both
                    parties’ valuations of Item 8. The wife relies on

                    to be $20,500. The husband has not accounted for the
                    dissipation of the balance to $13,000 between March to June
                        2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, and to $0 in July

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The valuation of Items 1,
                    2 and 3 are not disputed. For Item 4, I have adopted the
                    husband’s valuation ($8,144), which is the maturity
                    value of the policy as discovered by the wife<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>, and rejected the
                    wife’s unsubstantiated valuation of $5,192.28. As for
                    Item 5, the husband’s valuation ($23,319.33) was
                    wrongly premised on the sum insured under the policy, and so
                    I reject it. This is an annuity policy. The monthly
                    annuities of $107.04 were paid into the wife’s POSB
                    Bank account (Item 6), and to avoid double counting, I
                    disregard Item 5. The difference in the parties’
                    valuation of Item 7 was only $8.70 and so I accept the
                    higher figure volunteered by the wife. As for Item 11, the
                    husband relies on outdated 2006 and 2007
                        statements<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>, which I
                reject.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I have valued Items 6, 8
                    and 9 based on the wife’s figures as at July/August
                    2008, which were closer to the date of the interim judgment,
                    rather than the figures used by the husband, which were
                    based on valuations as at December 2008 and
                    September/December 2009. There is no fixed operative date
                    for the determination and valuation of matrimonial assets
                    (see <em>Anthony Patrick Nathan v Chan Siew
                        Chin</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1121 at [18], [25] and [29]). Given that the
                    ancillary hearings only took place four years after the
                    interim judgment was granted in April 2008, and given the
                    adverse inferences I drew against the husband in relation to
                    his treatment of his assets in the interim period (see
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> to <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), I am of the view
                    that it would be appropriate to value the assets as at
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The husband claims that
                    the wife has failed to provide full disclosure of her bank
                        accounts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Relying
                    on <em>Rosamund</em>, he argues that
                    the wife had been extremely uncooperative throughout the
                    discovery process, and so, an adverse inference should be
                    drawn against her. The alleged
                    “uncooperativeness” of the wife on the present
                    facts is, however, a far cry from that in <em>Rosamund</em>, where the court drew an adverse
                    inference against the wife who had failed to satisfactorily
                    explain her failure to disclose details of her bank accounts
                    which were revealed during discovery (<em>Rosamund</em> at [39]–[43]). On the present facts, despite the
                    husband’s attempts to uncover undisclosed DBS accounts
                    belonging to the wife, and the Court Order dated
                    23 November 2011 allowing him to administer
                    interrogatories to DBS’ representative, nothing has
                    been uncovered, and costs of $3,400 was awarded in favour of
                    the wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The husband claims that
                    the wife has under-declared the value of her jewellery (Item
                    10) as $13,000 when they are actually worth
                        $80,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> A
                    spouse cannot ask the court to draw an adverse inference of
                    the financial worth of the other spouse simply because
                    he/she claims that that spouse is worth “at
                    least” a certain amount (<em>Rosamund</em> at [37]). He must be able to adduce
                    “some substratum of evidence that establishes a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case against
                    the person against whom the inference is to be drawn”

                        Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [28]). As the husband has
                    not been able to do so, I have rejected the husband’s
                    unsubstantiated valuation of Item 10 at $80,000 and adopted
                    the wife’s valuation at $13,000.</p>

                assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The court derives its
                    power to order division of matrimonial assets from
                    s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The goal is to
                    achieve a just and equitable division, taking into account
                    all circumstances of the case, including the factors listed
                    under s 112(2) of the Act (see <em>NK v
                        NL</em> at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     A few principles must be
                    borne in mind. First, no one factor is determinative (see
                        <em>NK v NL</em> at [29]). Secondly, the court
                    should not treat the respective financial contributions of
                    each party as the <em>prima facie</em>
                    starting point, before making adjustments to reflect their
                    non-financial contributions (see <em>NK v
                        NL</em> at [23]–[24] and [27]). Given the prevailing ideology of
                    marriage as an equal cooperative partnership of efforts,
                    financial and non-financial contributions are <em>equally</em> recognised as both roles
                    need to be performed equally well for the marriage to
                    flourish (see <em>NK v NL</em> at
                        [20] and
                        [41]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Thirdly, the court is not
                    expected to make an exact calculation of each spouse’s
                    financial or non-financial contributions. Rather, it should
                    be prepared to make a rough and ready approximation in the
                    absence of documentary evidence, based on “feel and
                    the court’s sense of justice” (see <em>NK v NL</em> at [28] and <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 1157 <em>(“Yeo
                        Chong Lin (CA)</em>”) at
                [78]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Long marriage of 36 years</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     An important factor to
                    consider in the present case is the length of the marriage.
                    While I am mindful that division orders made in earlier
                    cases are no more than <em>guides</em>,
                    since no two cases are identical (<em>Yeo
                        Chong Lin (CA)</em> at [79]), it is useful to note
                    that in cases involving longer marriages, the general trend
                    is to award the homemaker wife a greater proportion of the
                    assets. This recognises the fact that the non-financial
                    contributions of a homemaker would typically be substantial
                    where the marriage is long.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     From my review of the
                    cases, the proportion awarded to homemaker wives who have
                    made modest financial contributions for marriages lasting
                    17 to 35 years with children ranged between 35% to 50%
                    of the total matrimonial assets (see <em>ZD v
                        ZE and Another</em> [2008] SGHC 225,
                        <em>Tan Cheng Guan v Tan Hwee
                        Lee</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1148, <em>AXC v AXD</em> [2012] SGHC 15,
                        <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong
                        Ling</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 416, <em>Yow Mee </em><em>Lan v
                        Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659,
                        <em>Rosaline Singh v Jayabalan
                        </em><em>Samidurai (alias Jerome
                        Jayabalan)</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 457 and

                        (“<em>Lock Yeng
                    Fun</em>”)). Where the wife also worked and
                    supported the family financially, the courts have not
                    hesitated to award her up to 60% of the total assets (see
                        <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim
                        Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 and <em>Tan Bee Bee v Lim Kim Chin</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 242 (“<em>Tan
                        Bee Bee</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The exceptions, where the
                    apportionment in favour of the wife was less than 35%,
                    typically concerned cases where the total pool of
                    matrimonial assets had been very substantial, in excess of
                    $100 million (see, <em>Ng Ngah Len @ Datin
                        Sandra Kuah v Kuah </em><em>Tian
                        Nam @ Dato Peter Kuah</em>

                        Chong Lin (CA)</em>). In those exceptional
                    situations, the apportionment to the wife had been, in
                    absolute terms, substantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As this case does not
                    involve very substantial assets, the husband’s
                    reliance on <em>Ng Ngah </em><em>Leh</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>,

                        One, that the wife did not have debts should not affect
                        her entitlement...Two, the wife’s needs or
                        expectations being low also should not affect her

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is not in dispute that
                    the husband paid for most of the household financial
                    expenses as well as the Namly House purchase price. During
                    the ancillary hearings, counsel for the husband,
                    Ms Alyssa Lee (“Ms Lee”) highlighted
                    that the husband also bought a car for the son in 1999, paid
                    about $110,000 for the daughter’s overseas music
                    education, and had contributed $25,000 to the son’s
                    wedding and renovation expenses. She argued that these
                    financial contributions to the children should also be
                    considered pursuant to s 112(2)(b) of the Act, which
                    provides that, in exercising its power under s 112(1),
                    the court shall have regard to “any debt owing or
                    obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their
                    joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the
                    marriage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     While debts incurred on
                    behalf of any child of the marriage are certainly relevant
                    (although more so at the earlier stage of valuing the entire
                    pool of matrimonial assets than at the later stage of
                    achieving just and equitable division: <em>Halsbury’s </em><em>vol 11</em> at [130.827]), there are, on the
                    present facts, no outstanding debt, for the purposes of
                    s 112(2)(b), to speak of.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Non-financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The extent of the
                    husband’s non-financial contributions to the family
                    was very much in dispute (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). On totality, I find that the
                    wife, who had stayed at home to manage the household, had
                    contributed much more in the non-financial aspects. Although
                    the husband has been helping his son and daughter-in-law
                    with the running of the Company <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>, I do not accord this
                    factor much <em>significance</em> since
                    (a) the son has already reached adulthood and
                    (b) the husband’s assistance in relation to the
                    Company commenced fairly recently, in 2004.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     To be clear, I am not
                    suggesting that non-financial support rendered to a child
                    who has reached adulthood would <em>never</em> be relevant to the court’s
                    exercise of its power under s 112(1). However, on the
                    facts of the present case, it is unclear what the
                    husband’s exact involvement with the Company has been.
                    Any weight ascribed to such contributions, relative to the
                    non-financial contributions by the wife, is therefore, on
                    balance, not significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Wife’s contributions to the
                household</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     During the ancillary
                    hearing, Ms Lee accepted that the wife’s CPF
                    contribution of $19,000 was used as part of the Namly House
                    purchase price. Indeed, this was supported by
                        evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    Ms Lee, however, challenged the wife’s purported
                    payment of the 10% deposit. It is not disputed that the
                    10% deposit, comprising the initial sum of $7,800,
                    being the option money, and the balance of $70,270.22, were
                    paid from the wife’s POSB current account. The
                    husband, however, alleges that as the wife’s income
                    was low, the 10% deposit must have been transferred
                    from the parties’ joint bank account or originated
                    from cash deposited by the husband into the wife’s
                    POSB current account. As there is no evidence to support the
                    husband’s case theory as regards the payment of the
                    10% deposit, I can see no reason why the 10% deposit
                    payment should not treated as the wife’s financial
                    contribution. It is an undeniable fact that the 10% deposit
                    came from her POSB current account. There is no objective
                    evidence to indicate otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Account should also be
                    taken of the wife’s indirect financial contributions
                    by way of payments for renovation and furnishing, as well as
                    her repayment of the mortgage using the Ghim Moh flat sale
                    proceeds. Although she has not been able to prove the former
                    to a certainty, she has produced several invoices stating
                    her name<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> and should perhaps be
                    given the benefit of the doubt. As for the latter, the
                    husband has not produced documentary evidence to
                    substantiate his assertion that the wife had used the sale
                    proceeds of the Ghim Moh flat for her own benefit. In fact,
                    the documents contradict his position. The bank statements
                    produced by the wife show that, out of the net sale proceeds
                    of about $429,000, $100,000 was initially paid to the
                    husband’s HSBC bank account<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> and $300,000 was paid
                    to the parties’ joint bank account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> This $300,000 had
                    then been substantially used by the husband personally and
                    for the procurement of the Namly House<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>, and
                    to this end, Mr Wong drew my attention to documents
                    evidencing two mortgage capital repayments totalling
                    $100,000 from the parties’ joint account in April and

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Non-financial contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I am of the view that the
                    wife’s non-financial contributions to the family has
                    been substantial, given the length of the marriage, the two
                    children whom the wife had to care for, and the fact that
                    for most part of the marriage, parties did not employ any

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is impossible to calculate non-financial

                        have been significant or where the marriage has
                        continued for a long time before divorce, her

                    (a) the marriage had effectively only lasted up till

                    Bedrooms Arrangement; and (b) by 1993, the children
                    (aged 16 and 18) were independent and capable of
                    washing and ironing their own clothes, and in 1995, the

<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   Separate bedrooms arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I disagree with the
                    husband’s submission based on the Separate Bedrooms
                    Arrangement. First, the cases Ms Lee relied on,
                        <em>ie</em>, <em>S v
                        S</em> [1977] 1 Fam 127 and <em>Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Chueng
                        Kevin</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 172
                        (“<em>Karen
                    Wang</em>”) concerned marriages which lasted
                    five years or less. It is certainly accepted that the
                    division order would usually closely approximate the
                    parties’ respective financial contributions where the
                    marriage had been very short (<em>Karen
                        Wang</em> at [15]), given that the non-financial
                    contribution of the homemaker is far less significant in
                    short marriages, and given that evidence relating to the
                    actual contributions made by spouses in short marriages
                    should remain fairly clear and more easily proffered
                        (<em>Halsbury’s
                        </em><em>vol 11</em> at
                    [130.822]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the present case, the
                    marriage lasted 36 years. Even if the Separate Bedrooms
                    Arrangement is taken into account, the marriage would have
                    lasted at least 27 years before its breakdown. By any
                    measure, the marriage was a long one and due regard must be
                    given to the wife’s non-financial
                    contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Secondly, and more
                    importantly, the husband’s argument is inconsistent
                    with the Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Yeo
                        Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</em> [1996]

                        Lolita</em>”) and <em>Chan
                        Teck Hock David v Leong Mei Chuan</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 76 (“<em>David
                        Chan</em>”), which established that the
                    wife’s non-financial contributions should not be taken
                    to have automatically, or as a matter of law, ceased upon
                    the breakdown of the marriage. This is so as the
                    wife’s contributions to the family could have remained
                    largely the same. The Court of Appeal held as follows in
                        <em>Tianzon Lolita</em> at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In making a division under s 106(3) the court

                        contribution, if any, made by the wife during the
                        period. In this case, the wife’s indirect
                        contribution continued: she continued to look after the
                        child after she had filed the petition, and her
                        contribution fell within s 106(3).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The matrimonial home was acquired when the marriage
                        had not broken down. However, the same clearly cannot be
                        said about the stock options, because even at the time
                        of the first agreement to grant stock options to the
                        husband on 12 August 1996, the marriage was already
                        on the brink of breakdown...Indeed, from 1994...the wife
                        had harassed him at his workplace because of her
                        suspicion that he was indulging in extramarital
                        activities. So, instead of helping him in his work, she
                        was doing just the reverse...However...while the husband
                        was in Hong Kong pursuing his career with Dell, she was
                        taking care of the children in Singapore...<em>We have serious doubts whether just because

                            alleged extramarital affairs, and had threatened to
                            contact the chairman of Dell, her contribution to
                            the wellbeing of the family should be deemed any
                            less and thus her share to the stock options should
                            thereby be reduced...</em>More importantly,
                        while he was working in Hong Kong, the wife was
                        maintaining the home here for the children and taking
                        care of them. <em>It seems to us that her

                        because of her care for the children here, the husband
                        was able to work in Hong Kong and focus on his job. So
                        while he was away, she was shouldering the burden of
                        taking care of the home and family all by herself, even
                        though she had a maid to assist her.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In light of <em>Tianzon Lolita</em> and <em>David Chan</em>, the Separate Bedrooms
                    Arrangement <em>per se</em> should not
                    have any automatic impact on the court’s assessment of
                    the wife’s non-financial contributions to the
                    household. Everything boils down to the facts – the
                    court must consider whether the wife’s contributions
                    to the household and the family had <em>actually</em> ceased or lessened post-October
                    1999. On the present facts, there was no indication that the
                    wife had ceased caring for the children and the household
                    since October 1999.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     That the children have
                    become independent would also not automatically negate the
                    relevance of a spouse’s non-financial contributions to
                    the children’s wellbeing. The following remarks by the
                    Court of Appeal are instructive (<em>Yeo

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Husband sought to lessen the significance of the
                        Wife’s contribution by saying that after their

                        in a boarding school, there was not much for her to
                        do...We are not persuaded that this argument should be
                        given much weight...<em>It stands to
                            reason that in all long marriages, where the wife is
                            a full-time homemaker, there will come a point in
                            time when the children will become independent as
                            adults and their demands on the Wife, as a mother,
                            will decrease. But her duty to maintain the home

<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(c)   Purported Agreement regarding the Ghim
                Moh flat sale proceeds</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Ms Lee submits that the
                    wife’s non-financial contribution should be about 10%.
                    In support of this argument, she relies on a purported
                    agreement between the parties on the division of the sale
                    proceeds of the Ghim Moh flat, under which the wife was
                    entitled to only 29% of the sale proceeds, whereas the
                    husband was to get the remaining 71%. The husband claims
                    that since the wife only paid 19% towards the purchase of
                    the Ghim Moh flat ($12,500 using her CPF monies), while he
                    paid $50,384 towards its purchase and renovation ($30,384
                    from his CPF monies and $20,000 for renovation and
                        furnishings)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>,
                    the subsequent agreement of the wife to accept 29% of the
                    sale proceeds meant that her non-financial contributions
                    were therefore at best only 10%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I cannot agree with
                    Ms Lee’s submission. First, the asserted
                    financial contributions towards the Ghim Moh flat have not
                    been satisfactorily established. Secondly, although the
                    wife’s previous solicitors appeared to accept that the
                    wife had a “29% share” in the Ghim Moh flat
                    sale proceeds<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span>, any agreement to such
                    effect was not made in contemplation of divorce. It is thus
                    not an agreement which the court should consider pursuant to
                    s 112(2)(e) of the Act. Thirdly, even if such an
                    agreement had been made in contemplation of divorce, it
                    would not bind the court, which has to consider what a just
                    and equitable division between the spouses would <em>now</em> be (see Professor Leong Wai Kum,
                        <em>Butterworths’ Annotated
                        Statutes of Singapore</em>, vol 6

                    assumed that the wife’s financial contributions
                    towards the Ghim Moh flat was 19%, as alleged by the
                    husband, apportioning a mere 29% share of the sale proceeds
                    to the wife would be highly inequitable since parties had
                        <em>by then</em> been married for
                    about 24 years and the wife had contributed quite
                    significantly to the welfare of the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> As the

                    where spouses have sold their old matrimonial home and

                    marriage is long, this is likely to be substantial <em>vis-a-vis</em> a homemaker. The Court of
                    Appeal held (at [32]–[42]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The parties' first matrimonial home was 28, Jalan
                        Ladah Puteh which was acquired by the husband before the
                        marriage. That property was sold in 1974 for $118,000
                        and partly with the proceeds of sale the husband
                        purchased 44, Princess of Wales for $220,000. The funds
                        for the acquisition of this property were provided
                        solely by the husband, but the property was conveyed or
                        transferred to the husband and wife as joint tenants...
                        It became their matrimonial home for well over ten years
                        until some time in the early part of 1987 or
                        thereabouts....Sometime in 1986 [the parties decided to]
                        sell 44 Princess of Wales, use the proceeds of sale for,

                            was sold and the sum of $684,812.68 was realised,
                            this sum belonged to the husband and
                            wife.</em> The property was held by the
                        husband and wife as joint tenants<em>.</em> If the presumption of advancement
                        applies she would be entitled to a half share of the
                        proceeds. On the other hand, if the presumption does not
                        apply, <em>this property being acquired

                            substantial share thereof by virtue of her
                            contribution made to the welfare of the family by
                            looking after the home and caring for the

                        about 17 years, and substantially throughout this period
                        the wife was a housewife and her contribution in looking
                        after the home and caring for the family during this
                        period was undoubtedly considerable, and if the net
                        proceeds were to be divided between the husband and wife
                        under s 106 she would be entitled to a substantial

                            were contributed jointly by the husband and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In light of all the

                    her 12% contribution to the purchase price of the Namly

                    and (e) the length of the marriage and the general trend of
                    awarding more to a wife of a long marriage (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> to <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) – it
                    would, in my view, be just and equitable to award the wife
                    50% of the pool of matrimonial assets, taking into account
                    the adverse inference drawn against the husband for his
                    failure to disclose all his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In making my order for
                    50:50 division, I am mindful that there is no
                    “norm” or default position of equal division
                    (see <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em> at
                        [50]–[57]). Courts have, however, not hesitated
                    to award 50% or more to the wife where the facts so
                    justified (see <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>
                    at [58]). This is,
                    in my view, an appropriate case for equal
                division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The manner of division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The court has a large
                    measure of flexibility as to the actual order it chooses to
                    make against any particular matrimonial asset within the
                    pool of assets to be divided (see <em>Halsbury’s </em><em>vol 11</em> at [130.770] and [130.836]). On
                    the present facts, the most convenient and non-intrusive
                    manner of apportioning the pool of matrimonial assets is for
                    each party to retain their respective assets, and to split
                    only the proceeds from the sale of the Namly House. This
                    manner of splitting the matrimonial assets was the only
                    common ground between the parties in the present case (see
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Of course, the
                    apportionment of the Namly House sale proceeds will be based
                    on my consideration of the <em>entire</em> pool of matrimonial assets (<em>NK v NL</em> at [38]–[40]). As I have assessed
                    the common pool of assets to be worth $4,168,300 (see
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), a 50%
                    share works out to $2,084,150. Taking the value of the Namly
                    House to be $3.4 million, this would translate into about
                    59.3% share of the Namly House in favour of the wife
                    ([{2,084,150 – 67,500} / 3.4 million] x 100%), which I
                    round up to 60%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lump sum maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In exercising its power to
                    order maintenance of a former wife pursuant to s 113 of
                    the Act, the court must consider the non-exhaustive list of
                    factors set out in s 114. The assessment of the
                    appropriate lump sum figure is <em>discretionary</em> in that there is an
                    unavoidable element of speculation, especially when
                    assessing the appropriate multiplier (see Professor Leong
                    Wai Lum, <em>Elements of Family
                        Law</em> (LexisNexis, 2007), at p 829).
                    Ultimately, “it is the court’s sense of justice
                    which demands and obtains a just solution to many a
                    difficult issue” (see <em>BG v
                        BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [74]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The legal principles
                    relevant to the power under s 113 were recently discussed by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam
                        </em><em>Heng Chow</em>
                    [2012] SGCA 15 (“<em>Foo Ah
                        Yan</em>”). Briefly, the assessment of the
                    appropriate monthly multiplicand begins with the
                    wife’s financial needs as derived from her particulars
                    of expenditure, scaled down for reasonableness. The
                    overarching principle of financial preservation, as embodied
                    in s 114(2) of the Act, requires the wife to be
                    maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent,
                    commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed
                    during the marriage (<em>Foo Ah
                        Yan</em> at [13]). This principle of financial
                    preservation must be applied in a commonsense holistic
                    manner, which takes into account the new realities flowing
                    from the breakdown of the marriage. Therefore, where
                    possible, the wife must exert reasonable efforts to help
                    preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle (see <em>Foo Ah Yan</em> at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The court must also
                    consider the husband’s financial ability to meet the
                    maintenance order; although he is <em>prima

                    beyond his retirement and up to the former wife’s
                    remarriage or the death of either party, the former wife who
                    has assets of her own should not expect a full subsidy for
                    her lifestyle (see <em>Foo Ah Yan</em>

                    depends on the particular facts (see <em>Foo

                    claim <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    husband’s ability to pay, which guides the
                    court’s application of the principle of financial
                    preservation (see <em>AQS v AQR</em>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The wife claims a lump sum

                    and asserts that the wife is financially capable in that (a)
                    she has substantial undisclosed assets; (b) she has other
                    sources of income in the form of monthly payouts of $107.04

                    the wife’s bank account (into which he deposited the
                    monthly $200 maintenance payments he currently pays) had an

                    benefit should be taken into account by the

<p class="Judg-1">I note that her expenses have been scaled down

                    Based on the current breakdown, her monthly expenses seem

                    is slightly more than half of her claimed monthly expenses,
                    is also not extravagant – it speaks to her willingness
                    to contribute to preserve her pre-breakdown
                    lifestyle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Wife’s age and financial
                dependence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The husband claims that
                    the wife owes him $3,900, which was borrowed between October
                    2009 and March 2010,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>
                    and that up till January 2011, the outstanding debt due from
                    the wife amounted to $6,100.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> He produced
                    some receipts that were signed by the wife in support of the
                    $3,900 loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> If the documents, which
                    have annotations such as
                    “marketing/food/supplement” and
                    “dental”, are taken to be probative of the
                    alleged loans, such loans for those stated purposes could be
                    suggestive of the wife’s lack of financial
                    independence, and the inadequacy of the monthly $200
                    payments she is currently receiving from the
                husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     To this extent, the
                    husband’s reliance on <em>Tan Bee
                        Bee</em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> is
                    misplaced – the wife in <em>Tan Bee
                        Bee</em> was financially strong and the Judge had
                    specifically found that she did not require maintenance
                        (<em>Tan Bee Bee</em> at [24]). His reliance on
                        <em>Tay Ang Choo Nancy v Yeo Chong Lin
                        and another</em> [2010] SGHC 126
                        (“<em>Yeo Chong Lin

                    also problematic. The court in <em>Yeo Chong
                        Lin (HC)</em> chose not to make a maintenance
                    order in light of the fact that the wife had received more
                    than $11 million post division of assets. Given that she was
                    already 71 years old, the court was of the opinion that her
                    financial resources were unlikely to be exhausted in her
                    lifetime (see <em>Yeo Chong Lin
                        (HC)</em> at [60]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given the wife’s
                    relatively old age (65), and the long period for which she
                    has been away from the workforce, it would be unreasonable
                    to require her to seek employment now.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The Husband’s age and financial
                ability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The husband is now 66
                    years old. As mentioned (at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above), there is a dispute over whether
                    he is currently drawing any salary from the Company. The
                    wife has not produced credible evidence proving the same.
                    However, despite the husband’s retirement, I note that
                    he owns fairly substantial assets in the form of shares,
                    unit funds, cash and CPF monies, and would be able to meet
                    the maintenance order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I note that there was no
                    indication as to the wife’s living arrangement after
                    the sale of the Namly House, and indeed, she does not claim
                    any rental which she might subsequently have to incur.
                    Taking into account all the circumstances, in particular,
                    the wife’s monthly expenses of $2,415, which seems
                    reasonable, her old age, the fact that the children have
                    since ceased making contributions towards her monthly
                    expenses (the wife has undertaken to file an affidavit that
                    she has ceased receiving any monthly contribution from the
                    children since late last year), her monthly AIA annuities of
                    $107.04, as well as the husband’s retirement, his
                    assets and his age, a fair and reasonable multiplicand would
                    be $1,300 per month for the future maintenance. This amount
                    does not present a “meal-ticket for life” as
                    it requires the wife to be self-reliant to some
                    extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Arrears in maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There is also no reason
                    why the husband should not be required to pay the monthly
                    arrears in maintenance of $1,250 for the last three years.
                    Ms Lee argues that the wife ceased to be a
                    “married woman” with effect from the date of
                    the interim judgment, and so, her claim for arrears in
                    maintenance amounting to $45,000 is untenable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> She
                    argues that the wife should have applied for interim
                    maintenance. I cannot agree with Ms Lee’s
                    submissions. First, dissolution of a marriage does not of
                    itself put an end to a maintenance order. As observed in
                        <em>Halsbury’s </em><em>vol 11</em> at [130.700]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Short of death there is no event
                            that immediately terminates a maintenance order that
                            is continuing. </em>
<em>The
                            order continues until another court order is made
                            that it be rescinded.</em> The Women’s
                        Charter provides that the court may rescind a
                        maintenance order on proof of a change in the
                        circumstances of the applicant for rescission, his wife
                        or child or for any other good cause. This confirms the
                        discretion that lies with the court...there is still
                        discretion whether to rescind the maintenance order for
                        the reason that the beneficiary has since become
                        divorced from the payor. Only where the court regards
                        the circumstances as justifying rescission will it be
                        ordered. <em>Thus, a maintenance order
                            for a validly married woman need not be rescinded
                            when she ceases to be so.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Secondly, a wife should not generally be compelled
                    to apply for interim maintenance pending the hearing of
                    ancillaries if she is willing or able to wait until the
                    ancillary matters are heard (<em>AMW v
                        AMZ</em> [2011] 3 SLR 955
                        (“<em>AMW v
                    AMZ</em>”) at [10]–[11]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Multipler</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Effectively, the wife is
                    seeking a multiplier of 11 years, three years in arrears and
                    eight for the future. Mr Wong tendered information from
                    the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DSS) to show that
                    the life expectancy of Singaporean women is now 84.1 years.
                    This was to support his submission that a higher multiplier
                    should be applied, and that assessment on the
                    “straight line basis” in <em>Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau </em><em>Poo</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545
                        (“<em>Ong Cheng
                    Leng</em>”) should not be followed. The life
                    expectancy of the wife is, however, not the sole factor
                    influencing the assessment of the appropriate multiplier.
                    Other factors are also relevant, <em>eg</em>, the possibility of the wife remarrying,
                    the proportion of matrimonial assets allocated to the wife,
                    the husband’s retirement, <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It is trite that the
                    approach in <em>Ong Chen Leng</em>
                    (maintenance up till 67 years old, as a compromise
                    between the average life expectancy of a woman (70) and
                    the usual retirement age of a Singapore male
                    worker (65)) does not apply invariably. In <em>Ng Ngah Len</em> (at [13]), Prakash J took
                    the husband’s retirement age as 68, observing that
                    while he had no compulsory retirement age (since he was
                    self-employed), there was no need for him to work till he
                    dropped as he was well-heeled. A multiplier of 16 years was
                    applied, in consideration of the fact that that would take
                    the wife who was 46 years old into her early 60s, and
                    that even if she should live a considerable period
                    therefrom, the extremely large lump sum ordered ($20,250/mth
                    x 12 x 16 = $3,888,000) should allow her to enjoy a
                    reasonably comfortable life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>Foo
                        Ah Yan</em>, lump sum maintenance was computed
                    until the wife was 67 years old. Although the husband who
                    was 72 years old had retired in his 50s, just a year after
                    the marriage, he continued to receive rental and annuities
                    totalling $2,600 (<em>Foo Ah Yan</em>
                    at [3]). Lump sum
                    maintenance of $126,000 ($1,500/mth x 12 x 7 years) was
                    awarded to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Woo Bih Li J held in
                        <em>AMW v AMZ</em> at [9] that, as compared to
                    the date of the ancillary order, the date of the writ is
                    generally a better reference point for commencement of
                    maintenance. This is however not a rigid rule; ultimately,
                    the court should order maintenance to commence from the date
                    which it considers, in its discretion, to be fair (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> at [12]–[13]). I agree with
                    Woo J’s observations, though I note that, unlike
                    in <em>AMW v AMZ</em>, there is on the
                    present facts an existing maintenance order, which the
                    husband has failed to comply with for the last four years
                    (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above),
                    although there is no indication that he cannot continue
                    complying with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Taking into account all
                    the circumstances – including (a) the wife’s old
                    age (65), and therefore, low likelihood of remarrying; (b)
                    the husband’s old age (66) and his current
                    unemployment/retirement; (c) the proportion of matrimonial
                    assets awarded to the wife; and (d) the current life
                    expectancy of women (84.1) – none of which is
                    determinative, in my judgment, a fair and reasonable
                    multiplier would be six years comprising three years in
                    arrears and three years of future maintenance, using the
                    date of this judgment as a reference point (effectively,
                    until the wife reaches 68 years of age).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In the circumstances, I
                    award the wife a lump sum maintenance of $91,800, based on
                    the following computation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     Arrears as at
                        date of hearing (3 years): Shortfall of $1250 per month
                        x 12 x 3 years = $45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     Future maintenance (3 years,
                        until the wife is 68): $1,300 per month x 12 x 3 years =
                        $46,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     By reason of my findings,
                    I make the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     A joint
                        valuation of the Namly House to be conducted
                        forthwith.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Namly House to be sold at a price
                        no less than the valuation under sub-para (a) above
                        unless expressly agreed in writing by both
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_c"></a>(c)     The net sale proceeds of the Namly
                        House, less all expenses of the sale including the costs
                        of the valuation, to be divided 60% in favour of the
                        wife and the balance 40% in favour of the
                        husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_d"></a>(d)     Each party to refund their respective
                        CPF contributions and accrued interest to their
                        respective CPF accounts from their share of the net sale
                        proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_e"></a>(e)     The husband to pay the wife a lump
                        sum maintenance of $91,800 to be deducted from the
                        husband’s share of the net sale proceeds of the
                        Namly House;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_f"></a>(f)     The husband and the wife to retain
                        their respective assets in their own
                    names.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_g"></a>(g)     Costs fixed at $10,000 inclusive of
                        disbursements to be paid by the husband to the
                        wife.</p>
