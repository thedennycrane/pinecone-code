Fortunately, this is rare. Unfortunately, the present application allegedly involves one such occasion. It concerns a broken and severely fractured relationship between former spouses. Counsel for the Appellant (the ex-wife), Mr Thomas Sim, described it as a “high-conflict case”. But, indeed, he went further in this application: he argued that the High Court judge (“the Judge”) did not give his client a fair opportunity to put forward her case through her then counsel (his colleague). The Appellant therefore wanted the Judge to recuse herself from the case. An application was brought after consultation with her lawyers. The Judge heard and rejected the application. That led to the present appeal. We dismissed the appeal and now give the detailed grounds for our decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the outset, two general but important observations, which also apply to the present case, are in order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 First, counsel are not the mere “mouthpieces” of their clients. They are not mere automatons, executing every instruction of the client, especially where the client wants each and every point to be taken in order to inflict maximum “damage” on the other party, and where the taking of such points is – in a word – pointless and would not only engender a wastage of the other party’s, but also the court’s, time and resources. There is a reason why lawyers are also known as “counsel” – in such situations, lawyers must <span class="font-italic">counsel</span> their clients and apprise them of what is permissible and what is not. We operate within an adversarial system. However, as the learned Lord Chief Justice Cockburn observed in an extra-judicial address (see George P Costigan Jr, “The Full Remarks on Advocacy of Lord Brougham and Lord Chief Justice Cockburn at the Dinner to M Berryer on November 8, 1864” (1931) 19 Cal L Rev 521 at p 523), which our courts have endorsed and recapitulated on several occasions (most recently by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Goh Seng Heng v Liberty Sky Investments Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2017] 2 SLR 1113 at [62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My noble and learned friend, Lord Brougham ... said that an advocate should be fearless in carrying out the interests of his client; but I couple that with this qualification and this restriction—that <span class="font-italic">the arms which he wields are to be the arm</span><span class="font-italic">s of the warrior and not of the assassin</span>. It is his duty to strive to accomplish the interests of his clients <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">fas</span>, but not <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">nefas</span>; it is his duty, to the utmost of his power, to seek to reconcile the interests he is bound to maintain, and the duty it is incumbent upon him to discharge, with the eternal and immutable interests of truth and justice. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In order to wield the “correct” set of arms, the lawyer, whilst owing a duty to his or her client, obviously cannot be the mere conduit pipe of that client. He also owes a duty – and indeed a paramount one – to the court. A lawyer has to tread a <span class="font-italic">fine line</span> when adhering to these occasionally inconsistent duties in practice, but that is the <span class="font-italic">very essence</span> of being a legal professional.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On a related note, the lawyer also needs to guard against his or her own bias, which may be subconscious and insidious. In particular, the lawyer must guard against taking on, especially subconsciously, the <span class="font-italic">persona</span> of his or her client. This is all the more so in cases where the parties’ emotions run high. There is sound logic in this because a lawyer who takes on the <span class="font-italic">persona</span> of his or her client is also likely to lose his or her objectivity and sense of perspective. And such loss often results (ironically) in advice and possibly even outcomes that are ultimately to the client’s detriment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Secondly, whilst patience and rectitude ought to be the ideal at all times, we are all only human. Hence, there must be the proverbial give and take on the part of both judge and counsel alike. This relates to the issue of <span class="font-italic">perspective</span>, and the following oft-cited advice from a father to his daughter in a famous novel ought to be noted (see Harper Lee, <span class="font-italic">To Kill A Mockingbird</span> (William Heinemann Ltd, 1960; reprinted in the New Windmill Series, 1966) at p 35):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First of all, … if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 This sage advice was quoted by the Court of Three Judges in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Medical Council v Wong Him Choon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2016] 4 SLR 1086<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [4]) in relation to the need for a doctor to be cognisant of the patient’s perspective as well, but it embodies a universal truth that applies perhaps <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> to the present case. In our view, both judge and counsel could have been more patient with each other had they stepped into each other’s shoes even if for a brief moment – with the lawyers concerned simultaneously realising that, if they had inadvertently stepped into their client’s shoes, they ought to have stepped out of them with some haste. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 That having been said, impatience has never been a ground for recusal of a judge. The hope is that everyone is an angel but the truth is that we are all only human and ought to bear, as far as possible, with each other’s foibles and weaknesses. One cannot help but feel that had there been more give and take in the present case, it would not have escalated into the proceedings that we now have before us. Perhaps some good can come out of this unfortunate situation if judges and lawyers (and, indeed, all who are involved in the discipline of law) learn the lesson, if not of perfect patience, then at least of the need for perspective as well as for self-restraint that has the quest for patience at its foundation, especially when every fibre within oneself seeks (or even cries out) to conduct oneself otherwise. Notwithstanding the fact that it is often bandied about out of context, there is much truth in the old adage that one ought to at least disagree without being disagreeable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 With these observations in mind, we now turn to the case proper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The factual backdrop</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The parties to the present appeal are former spouses. The Appellant commenced divorce proceedings on 23 December 2013 and interim judgment was granted on 4 February 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The ancillary matters were scheduled to be heard before the Judge on 9 November 2016, 8–9 February, 18 April, 21 April, and 20–21 June 2017. A further full day hearing date was fixed on 11 July 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 7 July 2017, the Appellant filed Summons No 240 of 2017 (“SUM 240”) in the High Court seeking the recusal of the Judge from hearing the ancillary matters, and for another judge to hear the same. The application for recusal was premised on the Judge’s alleged conduct at the hearings on 18 April, 21 April, 20 and 21 June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 2 October 2017, the Judge heard the parties and dismissed SUM 240.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the parties’ submissions below, the Appellant’s main ground for recusal was that the Court had been infected by apparent bias. The Appellant elaborated that this was because her counsel had been unduly hampered in the presentation of her case before the Judge; the Judge had favoured the Respondent by giving his counsel more time and greater leeway; and the Judge had prejudged the case against the Appellant without having heard the parties fully. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Respondent submitted that apparent bias was not made out on the facts. The Respondent added that the recusal application was a backdoor appeal prematurely brought before any order was made by the Judge because the Appellant was unhappy with the Judge’s factual findings. Further, as a matter of public policy, the recusal application should not be allowed as it would condone “judge shopping”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 At the time this appeal was heard, the hearing of the ancillary matters in the divorce suit had not concluded and no orders had been made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge saw no reason to recuse herself. In her unpublished grounds of decision, she began by describing the general procedure in ancillary matters hearings. Unlike trials, ancillary matters hearings do not involve cross-examination of parties and witnesses. Instead, evidence for such hearings would comprise affidavits of assets and means as well as joint summaries of relevant information. The evidence is supplemented by written submissions. All the court is concerned with is the objective evaluation of what has been placed before it. The court can therefore adopt a more interventionist judge-led approach. This, according to the Judge, is reinforced by r 22 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (GN No S 813/2014) (“the FJR”), which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to make orders and give directions for just, expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">22.</span>—(1) Despite anything in these Rules, the Court, when dealing with any cause or matter, is to adopt a judge‑led approach —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to identify the relevant issues in the cause or matter; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to ensure that the relevant evidence is adduced by the parties to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) In adopting a judge‑led approach, the Court may, at any time after the commencement or at the hearing of any proceedings, of its own motion or on an application by any party to the proceedings, direct any party or parties to those proceedings to appear before it, for the Court to make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Judge added that the court has wide powers to manage the flow of the proceedings, including the power to limit time for oral arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Next, the Judge rejected the allegation of prejudgment on her part. She explained that after she had reviewed each issue with counsel, she would sometimes indicate her finding or likely findings. In any case, there were still issues that had not been covered, and she could not have prejudged the outcome of the case since the factual matrix would have to be viewed in its entirety in order to arrive at a decision on the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Judge also made some observations on counsel’s conduct of the case. Acknowledging that she had been less than patient with lead counsel for the Appellant below, Ms Linda Joelle Ong (“Ms Ong”), she also commented that Ms Ong tended to prevaricate and not give direct answers to questions or issues posed. Additionally, Ms Ong frequently engaged in whispered exchanges with her assistants and spent time looking for documents and affidavits. On the other hand, counsel for the Respondent below, Ms Judy Ang (“Ms Ang”), was direct in answering questions and upfront in acknowledging any point that she had not covered or was not sure about. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Judge further explained that her approach was to pose questions in order to furnish counsel the opportunity to specifically address her concerns, and to provide clarification whenever such clarification was required. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We first set out the gist of the parties’ cases on appeal. We will delve into further details where appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Appellant’s case was essentially two-pronged. First, the Appellant argued that the Judge was apparently biased against her and that she had wrongly applied the “real danger” or “real likelihood” test, as opposed to the “reasonable suspicion” test, in determining whether apparent bias had been made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Secondly, the Appellant reiterated largely the same arguments on apparent bias as she did before the Judge below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Judge had unduly obstructed and hampered Ms Ong from effectively presenting the Appellant’s case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Judge had treated the parties unequally by giving Ms Ang more leeway and time. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Judge had prejudged the case in a manner adverse to the Appellant and was not open to hearing evidence that did not conform to her pre-formed views. On one occasion, the Judge led Ms Ang to make certain arguments that purportedly reached the conclusion that the Judge had already made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Respondent refuted the above arguments, reiterating in particular the policy argument that the Appellant’s unfounded allegations of bias should not be allowed as they would create doubt in the public’s mind about the impartiality of the judiciary and hinder the effective administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 We will address three grounds for recusal, although we note from the outset that the Appellant subsumed the second and third grounds under an overarching argument in relation to apparent bias: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the doctrine of apparent bias was made out; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the Judge had predetermined the issue; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the Judge interfered excessively in the proceedings, thus denying the Appellant a fair opportunity to present her case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Given that these grounds overlap to some degree and, as counsel for the Appellant noted in his oral submissions, the arguments made were interrelated points, we will begin by setting out the applicable legal principles before applying them to the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Appellant’s first argument that the Judge applied the wrong test for apparent bias can be summarily dismissed as the Judge explicitly referred to and applied the “reasonable suspicion” test. It is well-established that this is the applicable test in determining whether the doctrine of apparent bias is made out, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether “there are circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts that the [decision-maker] was biased” (see the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>”) at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Be that as it may, the implicit premise of the Appellant’s first argument is that there <span class="font-italic">is</span> a <span class="font-italic">distinction</span> between the two tests that have traditionally been applied for apparent bias – the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test on the one hand and the “real likelihood of bias” test on the other. As to whether there exists any material difference between the two tests, there have been two local High Court decisions that seemingly conflict: <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa v Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board </span>[2005] 4 SLR(R) 604 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>. Given the apparent divergence in local jurisprudence, we consider it appropriate to take this opportunity to address this apparent conflict that has been in existence for over a decade.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In essence, the conflict between <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>is more apparent than real if one considers that the “real likelihood” test examined in <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> the test set out in <span class="font-italic">R </span><span class="font-italic">v Gough </span>[1993] AC 646 (“<span class="font-italic">Gough</span>”) but, rather, the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Porter v Magill </span>[2002] 2 WLR 37 (“<span class="font-italic">Porter</span>”) – bearing in mind the fact that <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar Alan </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">disapproved</span> of the test set out in <span class="font-italic">Gough</span>. As we will elaborate on below, <span class="font-italic">Gough </span>stands for the proposition that apparent bias is to be ascertained from the perspective of the court and that it is <span class="font-italic">unnecessary </span>to look at a particular matter through the eyes of a reasonable man. On the other hand, in <span class="font-italic">Porter</span>, the test for apparent bias is whether the <span class="font-italic">fair-minded and informed observer</span>, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased. As such, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as between the test in</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Porter</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> (which was endorsed in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Tang Kin Hwa</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> and the “reasonable suspicion” test (endorsed in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Re</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Shankar Alan</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, there is a fundamental </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">commonality</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">perspective</span>: under both tests, <span class="font-italic">the court is to </span><span class="font-italic">adopt </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the vantage point</span><span class="font-italic"> of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">a r</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">easonable observer</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold">I</span><span class="font-weight-bold">n our view, once it is appreciated that there is this </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">commonality</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">perspective</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, </span><span class="font-weight-bold">there is no longer a significant difference between the two tests (see generally [90]−[95] below).</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We will begin by summarising <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>.

This survey will also be helpful in elaborating on how the reasonable observer construct is to be applied, and we will conclude by summarising and restating the applicable position in Singapore today. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa <span class="font-italic">and </span>Re Shankar Alan</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span>, the High Court referred to both the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test and the “real likelihood of bias” test. It recognised that the prevailing test in Singapore was whether “a reasonable and right-thinking person sitting in court and knowing the relevant facts would have any reasonable suspicion that [in that particular case] a fair trial for the appellant was not possible” (at [16]), although it had been left open in <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lee Kuan Yew </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 576 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span>”) whether the allegedly more stringent “reasonable likelihood of bias” test should apply (at [18]). Since neither test was satisfied on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span>, the court did not need to take a definitive view on which test should be preferred (at [20] and [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The court nevertheless expressed a “tentative view” that there was no real conflict between the two tests (at [24]), and that the “common substance” of both tests was “whether or not there was a perception on the part of a reasonable person that there would be a real likelihood of bias” (at [39]). The court’s reasoning may be further broken down into four parts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 First, the focus in <span class="font-italic">Gough </span>was on the concept of “possibility” rather than “probability” (at [26]), and this standard of “possibility” was reflected as well in the “reasonable suspicion” test (at [39]). Secondly, both tests were premised on an objective basis (at [36]). As Leggatt J observed in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Cook International </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v B V Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux and Braat, Scott and Meadows </span>[1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 225 (“<span class="font-italic">Cook International</span>”) at 231, the true contrast was between “reasonable suspicion of bias” and “the <span class="font-italic">appearance</span> of a real likelihood of bias”, both of which were concerned with <span class="font-italic">apparent </span>rather than actual bias; when the “real likelihood” test was expressed in such a fashion, there was little (if any) difference between the two tests (<span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>at [37] and [39]). Thirdly, one ought not to draw a sharp distinction between the court’s perspective and that of the public. Both were “integral parts of a holistic process” since the court would have to ascertain the perspective of the public and, to that extent, “personifie[d]” the reasonable man (at [40]). Equally, the court could not replace the reasonable man and should not inappropriately rely upon special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure, or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed member of the public (at [40], citing the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd and another </span>[2000] QB 451 (“<span class="font-italic">Locabail</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The court in <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>also cautioned that there was a need to guard against gratuitous semantic confusion, and that a practical substance-over-form approach must be taken that takes into account not only the possible meanings of the words and phrases in question but also the context in which they appear (at [39] and [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 On the other hand, in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>, a different member of the High Court distinguished the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test from the “real likelihood of bias” test articulated in <span class="font-italic">Gough</span> and stated that <span class="font-italic">Gough</span> was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the law in Singapore (at [53]). The court considered that <span class="font-italic">Gough</span> had “shifted” the inquiry “from one directed at how it might all appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is in fact a sufficient possibility of bias” (at [62]). The emphasis of the “real likelihood of bias” test was “whether the court thinks there is a real likelihood … that the tribunal is biased” (at [66]), which went towards the issue of actual bias instead of apparent bias. This was a “very significant point of departure”, even assuming that “likelihood” was to be equated with “possibility” (at [62] and [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The court in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>therefore disagreed with the observation in <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>that there was no practical difference between the two tests. That court highlighted two differentiating aspects: of <span class="font-italic">perspective </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether bias was assessed from the viewpoint of the court or that of a reasonable member of the public) and of <span class="font-italic">substance </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the test concerned the degree of possibility of <span class="font-italic">actual </span>bias or the <span class="font-italic">appearance </span>of bias to an observer). The “real likelihood of bias” test would be met as long as a <span class="font-italic">court</span> was satisfied of a <span class="font-italic">sufficient degree</span> <span class="font-italic">of possibility of bias</span>. In contrast, the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test would be met as long as a <span class="font-italic">reasonable </span><span class="font-italic">member of the public</span> could harbour a <span class="font-italic">reasonable suspicion of bias</span>, even if there was no real danger of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> bias on the facts. The former test was directed at mitigating the difficulty of proving bias, whereas the <span class="font-italic">latter</span> test was <span class="font-italic">driven by the public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice</span> (at [74]–[75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The court in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>then expressed its preference for the latter test, and the reasons provided for its preference include judicial support for the “reasonable suspicion” test; the fact that the “reasonable suspicion” test made no adverse finding on whether the tribunal in question was actually biased (thereby avoiding the possibility that the “real likelihood” test could create public disquiet in the administration of justice); the imprecision inherent in the “real likelihood” test (which the court found to be impossibly subjective); and the fact that the “reasonable suspicion” test focuses on the real mischief and inquiry, that is, whether the fair-minded member of the public would reasonably entertain a suspicion or apprehension of bias (at [81], [83] and [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As evident from the above account, the two cases differ in respect of whether there is any meaningful contrast to be drawn between the “reasonable suspicion” and “real likelihood” tests. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, as already alluded to above (at [</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">29]), this difference may be more apparent than real – a point to which we return to elaborate upon in much greater detail (see generally [90]−[95]</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">below)</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">after having first surveyed</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">test for apparent bias in the various Commonwealth jurisdictions</span>.

In a joint judgment by Barwick CJ, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ, the majority reviewed the Australian cases cited earlier at [39] and undertook a comprehensive review of all the authorities (including those of the Supreme Courts of the various States in Australia) up to the time of the decision (at 260–262). Having done so, the court took the position that it would suffice to show a reasonable suspicion of bias against a judge, and that this was correct in principle as it was of fundamental importance that the public have confidence in the administration of justice (at 262–263).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the subsequent decision of <span class="font-italic">Livesey</span><span class="font-italic"> v The New South Wales Bar Association </span>(1983) 151 CLR 288 (“<span class="font-italic">Livesey</span>”), the High Court of Australia affirmed its earlier decision of <span class="font-italic">Armstrong</span> and observed (at 293–294) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was common ground between the parties to the present appeal that the principle to be applied in a case such as the present is that laid down in the majority judgment in <span class="font-italic">Reg</span><span class="font-italic"> v Watson; Ex parte Armstrong</span>.

The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation … Judges, at trial or appellate level, who, in exchanges with counsel, express tentative views which reflect a certain tendency of mind, are not on that account alone to be taken to indicate prejudgment.

Each of these considerations lays emphasis on the need to consider the complaint made ultimately, <span class="font-italic">not by what </span><span class="font-italic">adjudicators and lawyers know, but by how matters might reasonably appear to the parties and to the public. That is why one does not attribute to the fictitious bystander highly specialised knowledge, such as that known perhaps to only some lawyers concerning the supposed inclinations and capacities of a particular adjudicator.

The court contrasted the “reasonable apprehension of bias” test to its main alternative, the “<span class="font-italic">real danger of actual bias</span>” test.

The learned Law Lord was also of the view that the focus here was on the concept of “possibility” as opposed to probability (at 665F–H and 668B–D); indeed, he also referred (at 668C) to “a real </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">possibility</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">of bias” as well [emphasis added]. This particular focus will also be significant for reasons that will become apparent in a moment.

Likewise I consider that, in cases concerned with jurors, the same test should be applied by a judge to whose attention the possibility of bias on the part of a juror has been drawn in the course of a trial, and by the Court of Appeal when it considers such a question on appeal. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Furthermore, I think it unnecessary, in formulating the appropriate test, to require that the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man</span>; and in any event the court has first to ascertain the relevant circumstances from the available evidence, knowledge of which would not necessarily be available to an observer in court at the relevant time. <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias</span>.

However, Lord Goff was nevertheless of the view (at 668C–D) that the criterion of a “real <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> of bias” sufficiently served the principle that justice must manifestly be seen to be done, and rendered it “<span class="font-italic">unnecessary </span>… to have recourse to a test based on mere suspicion, <span class="font-italic">or even reasonable suspicion</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>It is suggested that <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">novelty of the approach</span> in <span class="font-italic">Gough </span>consists in the fact that Lord Goff <span class="font-italic">had wholly (and radically) transformed the test for apparent bias under English law by </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reconceptualising the “reasonable person”</span>.

Her approach must not be confused with that of the person who has brought the complaint. The “real possibility” test ensures that there is this measure of detachment. The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be justified objectively. But she is not complacent either. She knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. She knows that judges, like anybody else, have their weaknesses.

It could also have characterised the actual decision in <span class="font-italic">Porter</span> more accurately (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> the characterisation at [33]). Unfortunately, these two last-mentioned points probably contributed to a perceived inconsistency between <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Shankar Alan </span>when there was (in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">substance</span> at least) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">none to begin with</span>. Perhaps most importantly it should be noted that in <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span>, the court was at pains to emphasise (at [37]) that the “real likelihood of bias” is indeed concerned with the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">appearance</span> <span class="font-italic">of bias</span> (and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">actual</span> bias), citing <span class="font-italic">Cook International</span> at 231 (also referred to above at [33]). The court went on to observe (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the oft-cited words of Lord Hewart CJ in the English Divisional Court decision of <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he King v Sussex Justices, ex p McCarthy </span>[1924] 1 KB 256 at 259 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">that “it is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done”</span> therefore apply not only to the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but also </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to the “real likelihood of bias” test as well.</span> [emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Evidently, both <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Shankar Alan </span>(see especially the latter at [70]–[72]) are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">entirely consistent</span> in terms of the importance accorded to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">appearance </span>of justice being done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>Finally, we note that, on a <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> level, there is <span class="font-italic">no material difference</span> between the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test and the “real likelihood of bias” test. Indeed, it is difficult to see how a reasonable person might reasonably suspect bias <span class="font-italic">without</span> considering that there was a real likelihood of bias (see <span class="font-italic">Auckland Casino Ltd</span> at 149, quoted at [50] above). In this regard, the English decisions of <span class="font-italic">Hannam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(in particular, Cross LJ’s remarks at 949, reproduced at [74] above) and <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [17], see [81] above) also support the view that there is “little (if any) difference” between the two tests and that they would lead to the same outcome in the “overwhelming majority of cases”. We highlight again the observations in <span class="font-italic">Porter</span>, <span class="font-italic">In re Medicaments</span>, <span class="font-italic">Saxmere</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gillies </span>(see [68] above) that the <span class="font-italic">Porter </span>test<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">notwithstanding the usage of the phrase “real possibility” in its formulation</span>) aligned the English position with the positions in the Commonwealth and Scotland, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test</span>. Reference, in this regard, may also be made to the relevant academic literature (see, for example, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan, “Reasonable Suspicion or Real Likelihood: A Question of Semantics?” [2008] Sing JLS 446 (“<span class="font-italic">Reasonable Suspicion or Real Likelihood</span>”) at p 449 and Tham Lijing, “The Rule Against Apparent Bias – Language Disguising Thought”, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Law Gazette</span> (July 2014), p 21 (“<span class="font-italic">The Rule Against Apparent Bias – Language Disguising Thought</span>”) at p 23). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>However, there is nevertheless <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">both conceptual and practical merit in adopting a standard terminology</span> (see also <span class="font-italic">Reasonable Suspicion or Real Likelihood </span>at p 454). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We therefore take this opportunity to state that the appropriate test henceforth is the “</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">reasonable suspicion of bias</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">” test</span>.

It should also be noted that the exclusion of extraneous considerations has gained barely any attention in local jurisprudence (likely because the point has never been raised or determinative of the case). Courts applying the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span> have generally referred to how the fair-minded reasonable observer is to have knowledge of the “relevant facts”, and stopped short of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">addressing </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">what ought to be regarded as irrelevant </span>(see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Singapore High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Kemp</span><span class="font-italic">inski Hotels SA v PT Prima International Development </span>[2011] 4 SLR 633 at [66] (appeal allowed, <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals </span>[2012] 4 SLR 98 (but not on this particular point)); <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 at [122]; <span class="font-italic">JRP &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Associates Pte Ltd v Kindly Construction &amp; Services Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 575 at [53]; <span class="font-italic">AMZ v AXX </span>[2016] 1 SLR 549 at [94]; <span class="font-italic">TOW v TOV </span>[2017] 3 SLR 725 (“<span class="font-italic">TOW v TOV</span>”) at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Metropole Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Designshop Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 4 SLR 277 at [47]; and <span class="font-italic">UES Holdings Pte Ltd v KH </span><span class="font-italic">Foges Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 3 SLR 648 at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 We touched on this issue at [92] above by referring to [40] and [41] of <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>and to what the English Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span>. In essence, <span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">he reasonable observer should not be taken to have detailed knowledge of the law or court procedure, or insider knowledge of the character, inclinations or ability of the members of the relevant court</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Livesey</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([41] above) at 299; <span class="font-italic">Gillies </span>at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Vakauta</span> ([42] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 585; <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [13] and [49]; <span class="font-italic">Hannam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 949 per Cross LJ; and <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh Kalpanath </span>at [82]). As the court in <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>put it (at [17]), <span class="font-italic">the court must not </span><span class="font-italic">inappropriately rely on “special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed member of the public”</span> (see also <span class="font-italic">The Rule Against Apparent Bias – Language Disguising Thought</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 22: “so long as the Court takes a broad common sense approach <span class="font-italic">without inappropriate reliance on </span><span class="font-italic">specialised knowledge</span>, the reasonable man is personified by the Court” [emphasis added]). On the flipside, as Kirby J noted in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>, it would be a mistake for the court to impute all that what was eventually known to the court to the imaginary observer because it would only be holding up a mirror to itself (at [49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The reasonable observer is also informed. Although the observer is not a lawyer, he or she <span class="font-italic">is not wholly uninformed and uninstructed</span> about the law in general or the issue to be decided: <span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [53]. Further, the observer <span class="font-italic">will </span><span class="font-italic">take the trouble to inform himself or herself on all relevant facts that are capable of being known by members of the public generally</span>, and he or she would also be able to consider what has been seen or read together with its proper context<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Gillies</span> at [17] and [39]; <span class="font-italic">Helow</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [3]; <span class="font-italic">H </span><span class="font-italic">v L </span>at [16]; <span class="font-italic">Cofely </span>at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The reasonable observer is also taken to know of the traditions of integrity and impartiality that administrators of justice in general have to uphold. Hence, <span class="font-italic">he or she would not jump to hasty conclusions based on isolated episodes of temper </span><span class="font-italic">or remarks taken out of context</span>. On a related note, the observer may also be taken to know generally that the court (or an adjudicator) may adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted (<span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [53]; <span class="font-italic">R </span><span class="font-italic">v S (RD) </span>([58] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [111]; <span class="font-italic">Basson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([63] above) at [35]–[36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The last point to be made in respect of the reasonable observer (which is unrelated to the question of knowledge) is that he or she is <span class="font-italic">fair</span><span class="font-italic">-minded</span>. The observer is “<span class="font-italic">neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Johnson </span>at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Gillies </span>at [39]). The observer is the sort of person who always reserves judgment on every point until he or she has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument (<span class="font-italic">Helow</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [2]). He or she will be able to distinguish between what is relevant and what is irrelevant, and to decide what weight should be given to the facts that are relevant when exercising his or her judgment (<span class="font-italic">Gillies </span>at [17]). The reasonable observer should not be confused with the person who has brought the complaint. There must be this measure of detachment. The assumptions that the complainant makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be justified objectively (<span class="font-italic">Helow</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [2]). As the court in <span class="font-italic">H </span><span class="font-italic">v L </span>noted (at [16]), litigation is highly stressful and expensive, and litigants would likely oppose anything which they perceive would imperil their prospects of success; hence, the complainant is likely to lack objectivity and be far from dispassionate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 But the observer is not a complacent one either. He or she knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. He or she knows that judges, like anybody else, have their weaknesses. He or she will not shrink from the conclusion, if it can be justified objectively, that things that they have said or done or associations that they have formed may make it difficult for them to judge the case before them impartially (<span class="font-italic">Helow</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [2]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Restatement of the applicable principles</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 This is an appropriate juncture to restate the applicable principles in relation to the doctrine of apparent bias in Singapore:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicable test is whether there are circumstances that would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias in the fair-minded and informed observer. We do not think this is any different from asking whether the observer would conclude that there was a “real possibility” of bias, bearing in mind that the word “real” here refers to the <span class="font-italic">degree of likelihood</span> of bias (which must be substantial and not imagined), and not whether the bias is actual<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span> at [39] and <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As the test for apparent bias involves a hypothetical inquiry into the perspective of the observer and what the observer would think of a particular set of circumstances, the test is necessarily objective (see <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa</span> at [36]; see also the Singapore High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd (in members’ voluntary liquidation) (Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd and another, interveners) and another matter</span> [2018] 3 SLR 687 at [161] and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TOW v TOV </span>at [32] and [34]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A reasonable suspicion or apprehension arises when the observer would think, from the relevant circumstances, that bias is <span class="font-italic">possible</span>. It cannot be a fanciful belief, and the reasons for the suspicion must be capable of articulation by reference to the evidence presented (see <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [49]). But adopting a standard of possibility rather than probability furthers the vital public interest of ensuring that the administration of justice is beyond reproach from the perspective of reasonable members of the public (<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [64] and [75]; <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Hwa </span>at [37]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In establishing whether the observer would harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias, the court must be mindful not to supplant the observer’s perspective by assuming knowledge outside the ken of reasonably well-informed members of the public (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, detailed knowledge of the law and court procedure, or insider knowledge of the inclinations, character or ability of the members of the court or adjudication body) (see [98] above). The observer would be informed – that is, he or she would be apprised of all relevant facts that are capable of being known by members of the public generally (see [99] above). The observer would also be fair-minded; he or she would be neither complacent nor unduly sensitive and suspicious. He or she would know the traditions of integrity and impartiality that administrators of justice have to uphold, and would not jump to hasty conclusions of bias based on isolated episodes of temper or remarks taken out of context (see [100]–[102] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In line with (d), the relevant circumstances which the court may take into account in finding a reasonable suspicion of bias would be limited to what is available to an observer witnessing the proceedings. Such circumstances might include, for example, the demeanour of the judge and counsel, the interactions between the court and counsel, and such facts of the case as could be gleaned from those interactions and/or known to the general public. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Other issues</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 There are two other penumbral issues that we will briefly discuss. First, in <span class="font-italic">TOW v TO</span><span class="font-italic">V</span>, Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) considered whether there is also a separate requirement for a nexus between the lack of impartiality and the issues requiring determination in the future if the judge does not recuse himself or herself (at [33], citing <span class="font-italic">Murray &amp; Tomas and another </span>[2011] Fam CAFC 81; this corresponds to the second step of the test laid out in <span class="font-italic">Ebner</span> ([45] above)). The learned judge took the view that it would not be appropriate to do so given that the “reasonable suspicion of bias” test is aimed at considering the perception of bias through a hypothetical observer. This being the case, whether or not a nexus exists would seem immaterial. This was not a point that the parties addressed, and we will consider it in the future if the need arises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Second, it has also been said that the phrase “reasonable apprehension” ought to be preferred to “reasonable suspicion” given the potentially inappropriate connotations the latter might engender: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">South</span><span class="font-italic"> African Rugby Football Union</span> ([63] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38] and <span class="font-italic">Livesey</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 294. However, it should be recalled that in <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>, the court noted that the “reasonable suspicion” test made no adverse finding on whether the court or tribunal in question was affected by actual bias (at [81]; see [37] above); we agree with that holding and we therefore do not think there is any unintended nuance of meaning that the phrase “reasonable suspicion”, as opposed to “reasonable apprehension”, would convey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Having said the above, we reject the first prong of the Appellant’s case (see [22] above), not only because we find that the Judge had correctly identified the right test to apply, but also because we find that in substance, there is no material difference between the two tests. We now turn to the applicable principles relating to prejudgment and excessive judicial interference.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prejudgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The rule against prejudgment prohibits the decision-maker from reaching a final, conclusive decision before being made aware of all relevant evidence and arguments which the parties wish to put before him or her. The primary objection against prejudgment is the surrender by a decision-making body of its judgment such that it approaches the matter with a closed mind (<span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng </span>at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 While it has been said that prejudgment is distinct from (though related to) apparent bias (see the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Chua Siew Wei Kathleen </span>[2016] 2 SLR 713 (“<span class="font-italic">Kathleen Chua</span>”) at [24]), the preponderance of authority has referred to prejudgment as something that <span class="font-italic">amounts to a</span><span class="font-italic">pparent bias</span>. Locally, in <span class="font-italic">Sim Yong Teng</span>, the appellants’ argument on prejudgment or predetermination was characterised as an apparent bias argument (at [47]). This Court agreed (at [63]–[64]) that any reasonable, fair-minded and fully informed observer looking at the circumstances of the case would have formed the view that there was prejudgment <span class="font-italic">amounting to apparent bias</span>. In addition, in <span class="font-italic">Kay Swee Pin v Singapore Island Country Club </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 802, this Court regarded prejudgment as a form of apparent bias (at [65]). Prejudgment has also been classified as a form of apprehended bias in most other jurisdictions: see <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span>, and in particular [21], where <span class="font-italic">South African Rugby Football Union, Auckland Casino Ltd</span>, <span class="font-italic">R </span><span class="font-italic">v S (RD)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Locabail</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are cited; see also the recent High Court of Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">Laurie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(where the High Court found that the reasonable observer would apprehend that the judge might not move from the position expressed in an earlier interlocutory judgment) and the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Otkritie</span><span class="font-italic"> International Investment Management Ltd and others v Urumov </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 1315 at [1]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 To establish prejudgment amounting to apparent bias, therefore, it must be established that the fair-minded, informed and reasonable observer would, after considering the facts and circumstances available before him, suspect or apprehend that the decision-maker had reached a final and conclusive decision before being made aware of all relevant evidence and arguments which the parties wish to put before him or her, such that he or she approaches the matter at hand with a closed mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 To this, we would add the following. Judges are obliged to make the effort to prepare for a hearing beforehand and inevitably, provisional views and conclusions would be formed during such preparations: see the decision of this Court in <span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine Pte Ltd v King, Ann Rita and another appeal </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Prometheus</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]. The court in <span class="font-italic">Prometheus </span>also noted that an open mind does not mean an empty mind and it is consistent with the judicial function to pose provisional views and concerns to counsel for them to be addressed. Indeed, as the court went on to observe, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan</span>, counsel are often assisted by the chance to peek into the judicial mind as they then have the opportunity to persuade the court to come to a different view if they so wish. The same view was expressed in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at [13]. The High Court of Australia noted that the reasonableness of any apprehension of bias was to be considered in the context of the exigencies of modern-day practice and the need for active case management. Judges could not be expected to sit mute until the presentation of the parties’ cases was over, and prejudgment could not be made out solely because tentative views reflecting a certain tendency of mind were expressed during exchanges with counsel. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Excessive judicial interference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Quite apart from apparent bias, there is also the separate ground of whether the Judge excessively interfered with the proceedings. This Court dealt with this ground at length in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 1058 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari</span>”) at [117] <span class="font-italic">et </span><span class="font-italic">seq</span>, and it would suffice for present purposes to set out the summary of principles at [175] of the judgment, which represents the current state of the law (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Suan Elizabeth and others v Goh Kok Hwa Richard and others </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 193 at [173]; <span class="font-italic">Nim</span><span class="font-italic"> Minimaart (a firm) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1079 </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Nim</span><span class="font-italic"> Minimaart</span>”) at [10]; and <span class="font-italic">Sinnappan</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l Nadarajah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] SGCA 21 at [3]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The system the courts are governed by under the common law is an adversarial (as opposed to an inquisitorial) one and, accordingly, the examination and cross-examination of witnesses are primarily the responsibility of counsel. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) It follows that the judge must be careful <span class="font-italic">not </span>to descend (and/or be perceived as having descended) into the arena, thereby clouding his or her vision and compromising his or her impartiality as well as impeding the fair conduct of the trial by counsel and unsettling the witness concerned. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) However, the judge is not obliged to remain silent, and can ask witnesses or counsel questions if (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) it is necessary to clarify a point or issue that has been overlooked or has been left obscure, or to raise an important issue that has been overlooked by counsel; this is particularly important in criminal cases where the point or issue relates to the right of the accused to fully present his or her defence in relation to the charges concerned; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) it enables him or her to follow the points made by counsel; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) it is necessary to exclude irrelevancies and/or discourage repetition and/or prevent undue evasion and/or obduracy by the witness concerned (or even by counsel); </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) it serves to assist counsel and their clients to be cognisant of what is troubling the judge, provided it is clear that the judge is keeping an open mind and has not prejudged the outcome of the particular issue or issues (and, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, the result of the case itself). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judge, preferably, should not engage in sustained questioning until counsel has completed his questioning of the witness on the issues concerned. Further, any intervention by the judge during the <span class="font-italic">cross-</span><span class="font-italic">examination </span>of a witness should <span class="font-italic">generally </span>be <span class="font-italic">minimal</span>. In particular, any intervention by the judge should not convey an impression that the judge is predisposed towards a particular outcome in the matter concerned (and <span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>some examples of interventions which are unacceptable which were referred to in [<span class="font-italic">Regina v Valley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(1986) 26 CCC (3d) 207] (“<span class="font-italic">Valley</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) What is crucial is not only the quantity but also the qualitative impact of the judge’s questions or interventions. The ultimate question for the court is whether or not there has been the possibility of a denial of justice to a particular party (and, correspondingly, the possibility that the other party has been unfairly favoured). In this regard, we gratefully adopt the following observations by Martin JA in <span class="font-italic">Valley </span>(reproduced above at [138]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Interventions by the judge creating the appearance of an unfair trial may be of more than one type and the appearance of a fair trial may be destroyed by a combination of different types of intervention.

The “excessive judicial interference” ground guards against the risk of a fair trial being compromised because of the failure of a decision-maker to observe his proper role and his duty not to descend into the arena (<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [110]), and is borne out of the fact that the system of justice in Singapore is founded on an adversarial model rather than an inquisitorial model (<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [107]). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The mischief arises from the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">decision-maker taking up a position and pursuing it with the passion of an advocate, thereby slipping into the perils of self-persuasion</span> (<span class="font-italic">Re Shankar</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan </span>at [115]). And as the learned judge in that case noted at [117(b)], the resolution of a complaint of excessive judicial interference depends not on appearances or what impressions a fair-minded observer might be left with, but rather on whether the reviewing court is satisfied that the manner in which the challenged tribunal or judge acted was such as to impair its ability to evaluate and weigh the case presented by each side.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 We would add that another mischief that the “excessive judicial interference” ground guards against is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">impeding a party’s presentation of its case </span>(as noted in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin </span><span class="font-italic">Johari </span>at [175(b)]). In the Ontario Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Regina v Valley </span>(1986) 26 CCC (3d) 207 (“<span class="font-italic">Valley</span>”) (cited in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari</span> at [138]), the situation “[w]here the interventions have made it really impossible for counsel for the defence to do his or her duty in presenting the defence” was raised as one of the principal types of intervention that would lead to the quashing of criminal convictions (at 231). The case of <span class="font-italic">Nim</span><span class="font-italic"> Minimaart </span>is a useful example of how such excessive interference impinges on a party’s ability to prove his case. There, the counsel bringing the complaint deposed in his affidavit that the remarks made by the judge led him to feel traumatised and to think that he would be in contempt of court if he continued, and he therefore decided to settle (at [17]–[18]). In <span class="font-italic">Kathleen Chua</span>, both the hampering of a party’s conduct of its case as well as the “descent into the arena” to pursue a particular position were listed as grounds of challenge (at [24]), and both were made out on the facts of the case (at [32] and [40]). Notably, the court identified how the Prosecution’s presentation of their case was hampered by identifying lines of potentially relevant questioning that had been prematurely stopped by the judge below (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Having set out the applicable legal principles, we turn now to the facts of the case, beginning with the circumstances the Appellant relies on to make out her argument on apparent bias.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our findings</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The Appellant raises the following arguments to support her case on apparent bias:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Appellant argues that Ms Ong was unduly hampered in the presentation of the Appellant’s case because she was allegedly interrupted mid-sentence and berated constantly by the Judge. The “harsh comments” and “hostile environment” made it “impossible for [Ms Ong] to effectively present the [Appellant’s] case to the Court”. According to the Appellant, the Judge repeatedly raised her voice, used harsh rebukes such as “Stop”, “Enough”, “No”, “Never mind”, and “Don’t bother”, and, on at least two occasions, slammed her hand on the table.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the Appellant argues that the Judge pre-judged certain issues, including the purpose of moneys that the Appellant loaned from her sister. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Appellant argues that the Judge treated the parties unequally, and this can be seen from (a) the wide latitude given to the Respondent to introduce new arguments and/or allegations that were unsupported by affidavit evidence; (b) the relatively less intense scrutiny given to the Respondent’s case; and (c) the Judge’s inclination to find in favour of the Respondent on issues in the absence of documentary proof from the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 We disagree with the Appellant’s arguments, and we find that the circumstances would not give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias on the part of the fair-minded and informed observer. We make five points in relation to this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 But before we elaborate on these points, we make a preliminary observation. The recusal application was brought based on what transpired during the final ancillaries hearings, and the proceedings were captured by Appellant’s counsel in an unofficial transcript that the Appellant has relied heavily upon. The Respondent has not objected to the accuracy of this transcript. We note, however, the Judge’s comment that she did not accept it wholesale though it did cover the salient aspects of the proceedings. Indeed, we find the transcript to be tinted with a certain view of the Judge and the proceedings. This is evident from the various editorial adjustments to the transcript, such as the use of uppercase, multiple exclamation marks and the inclusion of the recorder’s comments in parentheses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 For instance, during the proceedings on 18 April 2017, it was recorded that the Judge went “on rant for 2 minutes about tables and their importance”. Further, the following exchanges between the court, Ms Ang, and Ms Ong (both counsel were referred to as “JA” and “LO” respectively in the transcript) transpired on 18 April 2017:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  Cut to the chase.

This is the very pitfall that we cautioned against at [5] above, and it is indicative that the Appellant’s counsel has failed to take a dispassionate view of the proceedings<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> It also brings to the fore the importance of bearing in mind that the reasonable observer is not to be confused with the person who has brought the complaint (see [101] above). We are satisfied that even if we were to wholly accept the transcripts (including what </span>the use of uppercase was intended to convey as well as the aforesaid parenthetical remarks), there would still not have been a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The first reason for this is that the manner in which the proceedings panned out required the Judge to play a more active role in case management. As the parties had said, the case was a “high conflict” one, and parties therefore had little success in narrowing the disputed issues and facts down to a more limited scope. In fact, we had the impression that counsel were instructed to challenge every last point, and this unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings to a great extent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For instance, one of the issues that caused annoyance was an asset referred to as monies in a Thinkorswim account. The Judge thought that there were many aspects of this account that the parties could have reached agreement on – such as the date on which the account was opened, the date on which the account was closed and the closing balance. Yet, a considerable amount of time was expended on these easily ascertainable (and objective) facts, as the Appellant sought to argue that she had suffered a net loss in relation to that account, which was a wholly separate substantive point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Shortly thereafter, the parties dealt with another asset, a fixed deposit account, which the wife had labelled as “unknown” in the parties’ joint summary. The Judge thought that the account should be excluded from the matrimonial pool because the account had been closed on 31 May 2008, many years before the divorce proceedings. The Appellant explained that she had labelled the account as “unknown” because the Respondent had claimed, in an earlier affidavit, that the account was closed on 1 June 2007 instead, and because they were not aware of the closing balance of the account. Again, a lot of time was expended, even though it would not have mattered whether Ms Ong was right about the date or not. As the Judge noted (based on the Appellant’s transcript), after listening to what counsel had to say:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There was an email of 1 February 2016 from the same person at DBS saying that the account was closed as of 1 June 2007, which was exhibited in the husband’s affidavit of 12 February 2016 at page 17, Tab 55, Vol 13. As it would seem that this account was closed by June 2007 or May 2008.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This account, as earlier stated will not be included in the pool.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All this time wasted. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 This was, in fact, the basic manner in which the proceedings unfolded, as the Judge trudged through the items on the parties’ summary of assets, repeatedly imploring both counsel to narrow the scope of their dispute. Neither budged very much, purportedly on their clients’ instructions. Matters were made worse by the fact that the joint summary prepared by the parties did not state clearly what the dispute was, and after some questioning by the Judge, it became clear that, in respect of numerous issues, there was no real dispute to begin with and the parties could have come to an agreement between themselves. This led the Judge to tell the parties the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I told lawyers before as well as parties, it’s not the job of the court for both counsels or both parties to simply disagree. And then I run through and say after going through all of this don’t you agree that its very obvious? This is this, so why can’t you concede so that we can save time. So this approach I prefer to take. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[In relation to the fixed deposit account earlier mentioned:] All I’m saying is that if it was factual, when the account was opened, when the account was closed, it’s factual. Agree or not? Cause if I were to look at it I can’t see anything to disagree. There is nothing for me to decide. So let’s not disagree for the sake of disagreement. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The present case was therefore one that cried out for judicial intervention. The Judge had to keep a tight rein on the proceedings and steer them in the direction of a resolution of the final ancillary matters. We have some sympathy for the Judge because of the unenviable task that she faced. While she had to intervene and pose questions to the parties frequently, this was necessitated by how the proceedings were progressing (or, rather, not progressing). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It also did not help that the Appellant could not furnish information for matters that would ordinarily be within her knowledge. For instance, the Appellant, despite being the owner of the Thinkorswim account, did not know when the account was opened. Further, in relation to a car owned by the Appellant, the Appellant claimed to not have records of the value of the car at the time of the interim judgment because it was driven by the Respondent. The Judge offered a solution – to take the value of the Certificate of Entitlement at the time of the interim judgment and then to make adjustments based on that. She sought information in respect of this. Ms Ong agreed to speak to the client during the lunch break. When she returned after lunch, Ms Ong essentially repeated her client’s position that they had no evidence pertaining to the value of the car as of the interim judgment date, and that her client “leaves it to the court” to decide on the value of the car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In our judgment, the fair-minded observer would have concluded that the Judge was not affected by apparent bias, but was determined to expedite the proceedings instead. As we have mentioned above, the observer may be taken to know generally that the court would adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted (see [100] above), even if the observer is not to be taken to know of the minutiae of court procedure such as the judge-led approach provided for under r 22 of the FJR (<span class="font-italic">cf</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Judge’s reasoning at [17] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 On a related note, our second reason as to why the observer would not have reasonably apprehended or suspected bias is the fact that the Judge treated Ms Ang in a <span class="font-italic">similar </span>manner. For instance, in relation to the value to be ascribed to the Appellant’s car mentioned at [125] above, Ms Ang was admonished for not providing a proper basis of valuation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  What value do you then propose?

When you do a Joint Summary, you take a position on it. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA: Estimated value of $25,000</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: And how did you work that out? Based on?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA:  Based on my client’s car value, half of that YH. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court: I don’t think it helps me. I don’t know what your client’s car is. And half of that? Of what? Look this is a Court of Law it’s not a …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Judge’s annoyance with the snail’s pace at which the proceedings were going was expressed towards <span class="font-italic">both</span> parties and their respective counsel. For instance, Ms Ang was chided for not promptly providing the relevant information to the Judge:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  So Ms Ang the next time you give me dates that would sort it out</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA: Sorry YH</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  If the wife or the husband takes issue with everything under the sun, right? Whether it is the wife or the husband then you point out to me all relevant information so I don’t spend 10 minutes or 20 minutes going through the dates!!</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA:  Sorry YH</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">And when Ms Ang unnecessarily wasted the court’s time, she too was admonished by the Judge. In particular, the Judge (understandably) grew annoyed when Ms Ang informed her belatedly of her client’s intention to exclude certain insurance policies reflected in the Joint Summary. The following exchange is recorded in the Appellant’s transcript of the proceedings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  4F!!!! You mean we wasted all that time for a policy that was going to be excluded?? I cannot believe this!!!! I’m going to record this, I just cannot believe this! So which other policies are we excluding please?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Court:  … Counsel then informed the Court that 12 policies were excluded, including policy (f) for which we had spent time at the hearing to determine if the bonus was payable at time of IJ, when such an exercise was wholly unnecessary as this policy had been agreed for exclusion. Directions had even been given. Directions given for documentary evidence to be produced by Prudential are therefore revoked. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I don’t wish to belabour the point, I just do this to illustrate all I’m asking for… look just be aware, WHY did we spend time on that policy?! And why was the comment made about that policy? Alright?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA: Do we still have to produce a document?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ct: NO! We don’t disagree for everything simply because, you know.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These exchanges demonstrate very clearly that the Judge’s patience was being tested by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">both </span>counsel’s inability to cut down on the issues of dispute, the unnecessary wastage of time, and the “high conflict” nature of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 This takes us to our third point: even if the Judge expressed her annoyance and frustration and was not a model of patience with the parties, that would not amount to apparent bias. Discourtesy is generally to be discouraged – but try as judges may, they will not always maintain a perfect judicial temperament, especially in a case like the present. We have touched on this above at [7]–[8].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 During the oral hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Appellant suggested that the question as to when discourtesy crosses into bias is a question of degree. His case on apparent bias is premised on the sustained, multiple occasions on which the Judge allegedly spoke to Ms Ong harshly. But we do not think that the test of apparent bias can be reduced to the number and severity of instances when the judge may be said to have been discourteous towards counsel. There is no magical threshold at which a judge is so discourteous that there is a reasonable suspicion of bias. The question is simply whether the fair-minded observer would reasonably apprehend or suspect bias, viewing the alleged instances of discourtesy in their respective contexts, and also taking into account other relevant circumstances (for example the judge’s demeanour towards opposing counsel). As we have earlier mentioned, the reasonable observer is taken to know of the traditions of integrity and impartiality that courts have to uphold. He or she will not jump to hasty conclusions of bias simply based on isolated episodes of temper or remarks taken out of context. Given the context earlier described, we do not think that apparent bias is made out at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The fourth point relates to the Appellant’s argument on prejudgment. The issue that the Appellant claims the Judge prejudged is whether loans taken by the Appellant from her sister were wholly for her legal bills (and should therefore be disregarded) or whether they went towards meeting family and household expenses. The Appellant’s argument on this issue is that the Judge focused solely on the evidence that supported the view that the loaned moneys were used for the Appellant’s legal bills and was not receptive to evidence that supported the other view, which Ms Ong highlighted the following day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 We do not agree with the Appellant. In the first place, the Judge refrained from making any final orders in relation to the division of assets until the outcome of this appeal. Putting that to one side, even if we accept that the issue was discrete, we do not think that the Judge pre-judged the matter. When this issue was first raised before the Judge on 20 June 2017, Ms Ong did not even put any contrary views across. During the hearing on 21 June 2017, Ms Ong then decided to highlight statements made by the Appellant in her affidavit which supported the Appellant’s position that the loaned sums were used for household expenses instead. The Judge responded with “Fine I will record it. I have gone through this but I can” and “Let me record so I don’t miss it”. She proceeded to note the citations given by Ms Ong. She then mentioned that the Appellant had made statements to that effect multiple times. She even invited Ms Ang to pick up the affidavits to look at what Ms Ong was referring to. This sequence of events detracts from there being prejudgment on the part of the Judge in two main respects. In the first place, the Judge had already seen and considered the evidence that Ms Ong wanted to raise. All Ms Ong did on 21 June 2017 was to highlight what the Judge already had sight of. Hence, even if the Judge had reached a firm conclusion after reading the affidavits, and Ms Ong did not have the opportunity to orally reiterate what was in the affidavits, that would not amount to prejudgment. More importantly, the Judge’s mind was not closed to what Ms Ong was raising. She wanted to record what Ms Ong said so that she would not miss it, only stopping when she realised that Ms Ong was raising something that she had already read. In our view, what the Appellant has raised is far removed from being a case of prejudgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, we find that the Appellant’s argument on unequal treatment (which, in a nutshell, is based on the Judge’s preference for the Respondent’s case and the greater leeway that the Judge purportedly showed to the Respondent in respect of documentary proof) should more properly be regarded as a matter for appeal, not recusal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Excessive judicial interference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The circumstances supporting the Appellant’s argument on apparent bias overlap with the basis on which the Appellant purports to demonstrate excessive judicial interference by the Judge, and we reiterate what we have set out at [120]–[130] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 As this Court held in <span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin Johari </span>at [175(d)], what is crucial is the <span class="font-italic">qualitative</span> (not only the quantitative) impact of the judge’s interventions. The ultimate question to be answered, paraphrasing what was held in <span class="font-italic">Valley</span>, is whether a reasonably minded person present throughout the ancillaries hearing would consider that the Appellant had not had a fair hearing. We answer this question in the negative and find that the Appellant was not hampered in the presentation of her case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Unlike <span class="font-italic">Nim</span><span class="font-italic"> Minimaart </span>and <span class="font-italic">Kathleen Chua</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [113] above), the Appellant has not demonstrated how her case was hampered in any way. In addition, unlike a trial where evidence is to be elicited from the witness orally, Ms Ong was given ample opportunity to tender written submissions and joint summaries, which the Judge took note of. For these reasons, Ms Ong was not unduly hampered in the presentation of the Appellant’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The Appellant argues that the Judge descended into the arena by asking leading questions to counsel for the Respondent in order to reach a conclusion that she had already made. The sole basis for this argument is the following exchange between the Judge and counsel for the Respondent on 20 June 2017:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA:  This was the 4th tranche</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ct:  <span class="font-weight-bold">So you are saying that the evidence could have been obtained well before?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA:  <span class="font-weight-bold">Yes. </span>I note that the Wife’s request to DBS for this confirmation was made on 2 December 2016, with the confirmation given on the same day</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ct:  <span class="font-weight-bold">So what does that imply to you?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA: <span class="font-weight-bold">It implies </span>to me she could have made the request and obtained it on the same day before the AM was filed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ct:  Why could she have produced it on the same day? What could she have produced? She could have produced her bank statement, or anything. <span class="font-weight-bold">Is there anything you wish to imply?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">JA:  <span class="font-weight-bold">It implies </span>that she could have gotten the information before the filing the 2nd AM, with the cheque no. and cheque date. I take that this is an application for them to admit this evidence, and if it is admitted I will accept that this is the Wife’s contributions</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We reject this argument. The exchange is short and one-off, and on this sole basis, it seems too much of a stretch to draw the conclusion that the Judge descended into the arena and was pursuing a particular position as an advocate. We agree with the Respondent that the Judge was merely expanding upon and clarifying the point that the Respondent was making.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For the reasons set out above, we find that apparent bias was not made out and that the Judge did not interfere excessively in the proceedings. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 We would like to conclude much as we began. First, as we emphasised right at the outset of this judgment (at [3] above), counsel are not the mere “mouthpieces” of their clients. They have to be especially aware of this in family proceedings (such as the present) because such proceedings are frequently driven by emotional and even bitter clients. To the extent that they do not counsel (and/or even, if necessary, admonish) their clients and scrupulously observe their duty to the court, lawyers fail to live up to their calling as members of a profession whose hallmarks are honour and justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 We also emphasised the importance of <span class="font-italic">perspective</span> (at [6]−[7] above). It bears reiterating that had all concerned stepped into the other’s shoes, if even for a brief moment, the present situation might well have been averted. As we also said, however, counsel should also <span class="font-italic">avoid</span> stepping into their client’s (ill-fitting) shoes and should, if they have inadvertently done so, step out of them with some haste. There is some evidence that at least suggests that counsel were, in fact, guilty of this in the present case. Be that as it may, the <span class="font-italic">perspective</span> required here is one characterised by <span class="font-italic">patience and empathy</span> – the complete <span class="font-italic">antithesis</span> of what happened in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Finally, we cannot emphasise enough how extremely serious allegations of judicial bias are. Indeed, such allegations can be utilised not only as a weapon of abuse by disgruntled litigants but also waste valuable court time and resources in the process. We would imagine that, by their very nature, such allegations would be rare in the extreme. Should such proceedings arise before the court in the future and be found to be unmeritorious, there may be serious consequences.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon       Andrew Phang Boon Leong             Judith Prakash<br/>Chief Justice        Judge of Appeal                             Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sim Yuan Po Thomas, Linda Joelle Ong and Lim Xiao Wei Charmaine (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the appellant;<br/>N Sreenivasan SC and Lim Shu Fen (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><font face="Calibri">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong):</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 8pt 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span><font face="Arial">The Court of Appeal provides guidance in relation to the test of apparent bias, and affirms the High Court Judge’s dismissal of the recusal application brought against her. </font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span><font face="Arial">Background<span></span></font></span></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt 40px; text-align: justify;"><span><font face="Arial"><span>1.The parties to the appeal are former spouses. At the time of the recusal application, they were in the midst of divorce proceedings. The ancillary matters were scheduled to be heard by the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) between November 2016 and July 2017. Before the conclusion of the ancillary matters, and before the issuance of any decision in respect of these matters, the ex-wife made an application for the Judge to recuse herself on grounds of apparent bias. </span></font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt 40px; text-align: justify;"><span><font face="Arial"><span>2. The Judge saw no reason to recuse herself. She referred to the Family Justice Rules 2014 (GN No S 813/2014) which provided that she was entitled to adopt a judge-led approach. She dismissed any allegation of prejudgment as there were still issues that had not been covered, and the factual matrix would have to be viewed in its entirety in order to arrive at a decision on the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. The ex-wife appealed, arguing that the Judge applied the wrong test (the “real danger” or “real likelihood” test), and that apparent bias was made out on the facts.</span></font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Decision on appeal</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">3. The Court of Appeal restated the test for apparent bias in Singapore. The question to be asked is whether there are circumstances that would give rise to a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias in the fair-minded and informed observer. The test is objective. A reasonable suspicion or apprehension arises when the observer would think, from the relevant circumstances, that bias is possible. In establishing whether the observer would harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias, the court must be mindful not to supplant the observer’s perspective by assuming knowledge outside the ken of reasonably well-informed members of the public (<em>ie</em>, detailed knowledge of the law and court procedure, or insider knowledge of the inclinations, character or ability of the members of the court or adjudication body). The observer would be informed – that is, he or she would be apprised of all relevant facts that are capable of being known by members of the public generally. The observer would also be fair-minded; he or she would be neither complacent nor unduly sensitive and suspicious. He or she would know the traditions of integrity and impartiality that administrators of justice have to uphold, and would not jump to hasty conclusions of bias based on isolated episodes of temper or remarks taken out of context. (<strong>[103]</strong>)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">4. The Court of Appeal found that apparent bias was not made out. First, the parties were unable to narrow the disputed issues and facts to a more limited scope, and were pursuing every last point. The Judge therefore had to play a more active role in case management, and the fair-minded observer would have concluded that the Judge was not affected by bias, but was determined to expedite the proceedings instead. Second, the Judge’s annoyance with the snail’s pace at which the proceedings were going was expressed towards both parties and their respective counsel. Third, even if the Judge expressed her annoyance and frustration and was not a model of patience with the parties, that would not necessarily amount to apparent bias. Fourth, the Judge had not prejudged the specific issue complained about. Fifth, the argument on unequal treatment (which was based on the Judge’s preference for the Respondent’s case and the greater leeway that the Judge purportedly showed to the Respondent in respect of documentary proof) was a matter for appeal, not recusal. (<strong>[120], [126], [128], [129], [132], [133]</strong>)</span></p>
<p style="margin: 16pt 0cm 0pt 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">5. The Court of Appeal also found that the Judge had not excessively interfered with the proceedings. Counsel for the ex-wife was not unduly hampered in the presentation of the ex-wife’s case; on the contrary, ample opportunity was afforded to tender written submissions and joint summaries. The argument that the Judge had descended into the arena was based on one brief exchange, and it was too much of a stretch to conclude that the Judge had descended into the arena and pursued a particular position as an advocate when all the Judge had been doing was merely expanding upon and clarifying the point that the ex-husband was making. (<strong>[136], [137]</strong>)</span></p>
