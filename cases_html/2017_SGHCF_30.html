</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> On the matrimonial assets, the District Judge ordered that the Property, which was in the joint name of the Husband and Wife, was to be transferred to the Wife in full and final settlement of all issues relating to the division of property upon the Wife paying the Husband a sum of $381,000. This sum was calculated based on the net equity of the Property as at the date of the District Judge’s order and the parties’ respective shares in the Property, which in the District Judge’s assessment was 59:41 in the Wife’s favour. The District Judge valued the Property at $1.8m and derived its net equity by deducting the outstanding mortgage as at August 2015 of $870,664. Later, on appeal, it was agreed by both parties that the value of the Property to be used should be $1.78m, and that the net equity as at 10 September 2015 was therefore $909,336 (see [8] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The District Judge also ordered that the transfer was to be completed within three months from the date of the certificate making interim judgment final. If not, the Property was to be sold in the open market within nine months of the date of final judgment, and the net sale proceeds, after the repayment of the outstanding mortgage and interests, costs and expenses of sale, divided in the ratio of 59:41 set out above. No specific order was made on who should bear the mortgage payments and property taxes of the Property pending the completion of the transfer or sale. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appeal to the High Court and orders made on division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Both Husband and Wife appealed to the High Court against the District Judge’s decision. While these appeals were pending, neither party applied for final judgment. Hence, the timelines provided by the District Judge for the transfer or sale of the Property were never triggered, which was the cause of the delay in its eventual transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After hearing the appeals, I made some variations to the District Judge’s orders; they are not material to the present issue. What is relevant is my order, made on 19 December 2016,

</div> that should the Wife wish to fully take over the Property, then she has to pay the Husband $377,684 for the transfer.

He relied on the fact that the transfer sum of $377,684 stipulated in the court order was a fixed sum, and any further payment would benefit the Wife solely. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I heard the parties on this specific issue on 27 June and 31 August 2017.

</div> As noted above, that was the date when the net equity of the property was fixed by the District Judge based on the outstanding mortgage as of August 2015 of $870,664. It was agreed by the parties that, based on this revised order, the mortgage and property tax amounts which was to be repaid by the Wife to the Husband was $30,246.48. It was thus ordered that, upon completion of the transfer of the property to the Wife, she was liable to pay the Husband the sum of $377,684 (as ordered on 19 December 2014) and the further sum of $30,246.48. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Wife’s appeal against the revised order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Wife now appeals against my revised order made on 31 August 2017. Her position was that the revised order was unjust because there is no meaningful distinction between the situation where she elects for the Property to be transferred to her and the position if she had chosen for it to be sold. She argued that, in both situations, the parties should bear the ongoing liabilities of the Property in proportion to their shares pending the completion of the transfer. She also contended that the status quo would be disrupted by her having to bear the ongoing liabilities solely because, until and unless the Property is transferred to her, both Husband and Wife were still its co-owners. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The issue, as identified above at [1], is a narrow one, and the answer is not complicated. The starting principle is that ownership of a matrimonial property is divided on the date the court makes the order on the division of assets (see <span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah</span> [1987] SLR 182 at 191–192). However, and crucially, when the order is for the matrimonial property to be transferred to either the husband or the wife for a fixed sum <span class="font-italic">based on the value and net equity of the property as at the date of the order</span>, then the transferee naturally bears the risk of any rise or fall in the property’s value after that date. If the value of the property rises, then the transferee (and the transferee alone) would profit as the fixed transfer sum determined by the court would be favourable to her. The flipside of this is that, if the property value falls, then the transferee would be worse off. The same logic applies to the <span class="font-italic">net equity </span>of the property – if the net equity of the property is increased by the time of the transfer, because of mortgage payments made after the date of the court order, then the transferee, and again <span class="font-italic">only the </span><span class="font-italic">transferee</span>, would be better off as she will be getting a property with a higher net equity for the same fixed transfer sum. The difference, however, is that unlike the risk of the property value rising and falling, which is subject to market forces, the increase in the net equity of the property due to the payment of the ongoing liabilities of the property is a factor which is within the control of the parties and the court. And given that such payments only benefit the transferee, it is only fair and logical that it is the transferee who should bear these liabilities. By contrast, if the transferor is ordered to make these payments, then this will upset the status quo and leave him in a worse position. He will be out of pocket and get nothing in return. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The situation, however, is completely different when the order made is for the property to be <span class="font-italic">sold in the open market </span>and for each party to then receive the sale proceeds, less the outstanding mortgage and interests and the costs of the sale, in proportion to their shares in the matrimonial property. In such a scenario, there is no fixed transfer sum, and the sale price will only be determined when a suitable buyer is found. Any rise or fall in the value of the property, and any increase in its net equity, will affect<span class="font-italic"> both parties</span>. If the net equity is increased, then both husband and wife will receive more in proportion to their shares in the property. In such a scenario, it is only fair and logical that both parties ought to bear the mortgage payments, property tax and any other ongoing liabilities, in proportion to their shares in the property pending the completion of the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I should also emphasise that the above reasoning only applies where there is no specific order of court dealing with the ongoing liabilities of the matrimonial property pending the completion of the transfer or sale. It is, of course, open to the court to tailor a specific order based on the circumstances of the case if, for instance, the wife is a home-maker and unable to bear the mortgage payments of the property (after making suitable adjustments to the other orders on the division of the matrimonial pool to ensure that neither party is left worse off).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On the present facts, my initial order made on 21 June 2017 was that the parties were to contribute to the mortgage and property tax payments for the Property as from 10 September 2015 in proportion to the ratio of 56:44, in the Wife’s favour, <span class="font-italic">until the property is transferred or sold</span> (see [14] above). This order was made on the basis that it was not yet determined whether the Wife would elect to take over the Property or if it would be sold in the open market. If the Wife had elected to take over the Property, then adjustments would have had to be made at the point of transfer. In particular, the Husband would have been entitled to recover any payments made towards the Property from the date of the court order from the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Indeed, that was, in essence, what transpired. The premise of the Husband’s request for further arguments dated 21 June 2017 was that the initial order made was unjust to him because the Wife’s position has always been that she would want the Property to be transferred to her. This position was unequivocally confirmed by the Wife on both the hearings of 27 June and 31 August 2017. In such circumstances, there was a need to vary the initial order to make clear that, since the Wife had elected to take over the Property, the Husband should not be liable to make any further mortgage payments. As noted above, any such payments by the Husband would have had the effect of increasing the net equity of the Property and would have unjustly enriched the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I also made it clear that this order was to apply to all mortgage payments and property taxes paid from 10 September 2015. This was the date on which the division of assets was effected by the District Judge’s order of court. It was also the date based on which the net equity of the Property was calculated, taking into account the mortgage payments made as of August 2015. It followed that any further payments made towards the Property after that date would have solely benefitted the Wife, as explained above. In such circumstances, there was a need for suitable adjustments to be made and it was ordered that the mortgage and property tax payments of $30,246.48 made by the Husband since 10 September 2015 were to be repaid to him by the Wife upon the transfer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Wife’s arguments against the revised order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As noted above, the Wife argued against the above analysis on the basis that the revised order was unjust. Her position was that there is no meaningful distinction between the situation where she elects for the Property to be transferred to her and the position if she had chosen for it to be sold. While the former transfer would be based on a fixed sum determined by the court, she submitted this was simply due to practical reasons as, in the absence of an offer from a third party, the court could only work out the consideration based on the evidence before it on the net equity of the Property. She also contended that the status quo would be disrupted by her having to bear the ongoing liabilities of the Property pending the completion of the transfer because, until and unless the Property is transferred to her, both Husband and Wife were still its co-owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, the Wife’s submissions were flawed because they failed to appreciate the key fact that, in the event that she takes over the property in return for a fixed sum based on the net equity of the Property as of 10 September 2015, then any increase in the net equity after that date would only benefit her and her alone. As outlined above, this is the crucial distinction between a scenario where a property is ordered to be transferred to one of the parties based on a fixed sum and the situation where it is ordered to be sold on the open market, with both parties receiving their respective shares of the net sale proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TZG v TZH</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Wife also relied on my decision in <span class="font-italic">TZG v TZH </span>[2017] SGHCF 9 (“<span class="font-italic">TZG v TZH</span>”). In that case, it was determined that the matrimonial home was owned by the husband and wife in the ratio of 50.8:49.2 in the husband’s favour (at [4(b)]). The net equity of the home was determined as being $2,612,394 as of the date of the order. Therefore, if the wife wished to fully take over the matrimonial home, then it was ordered that she was to notify the husband in writing within one month of the date of the order and thereafter, within five months, effect the transfer by paying to the husband 50.8% of the net equity of the home (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 50.8% of $2,612,394). Just as in this case, it was ordered that if the wife did not take up this option, then the property was to be sold in the open market with the net sale proceeds (less the costs and expenses of sale) to be divided in proportion to the parties’ shares in the property. The relevant part of the decision on who was to bear the mortgage and other property payments pending the transfer or sale of the matrimonial home is as follows (at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Husband has also appealed against my indication that parties are to bear the mortgage payments and other payments relating to the matrimonial home in the same proportion as 50.8:49.4 (H:W) (see above at [4(b)]). I had informed counsel when I gave my decision on 28 November 2016, that as the division of the assets, including the matrimonial home, had been effected upon my decision that day,  that thereafter (unless changed on appeal), the remaining mortgage instalments as well as other outgoings should rightly be borne in proportion to the ratio of 50.8:49.2 (H:W). <span class="font-italic">The actual sorting out of accounts on this score could be effected upon completion of the transfer of the Husband’s estate title and interest in the matrimonial home at KL Road to the Wife or upon completion of the sale of the property, if such was the case.</span> My view was that it was not necessary for a specific order to be made in that regard.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As the passage makes clear, the order for both parties to bear the mortgage and other property payments in proportion to their shares in the matrimonial home was made in circumstances where it was not yet determined whether the wife would, in fact, be electing to take over the husband’s estate and title in the matrimonial home. This was similar to the initial order which I made on 21 June 2017 in the present case. The passage also contains a proviso that “[t]he actual sorting out of accounts on this score could be effected upon completion of the transfer of the Husband’s estate title and interest in the matrimonial home ... or upon completion of the sale of the property”. I accept that this proviso was somewhat general and is not as clear as it should have been. However, it does provide for the possibility that if the wife elects to take over the matrimonial home, then financial adjustments could be made and the husband would be able to recover the mortgage and other property payments borne by him pending the completion of the transfer. This was the same principle applied in the present case. Thus, the order made in <span class="font-italic">TZG v TZH</span> does not assist the Wife.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 For the above reasons, I rejected the Wife’s arguments and ordered that she was to be solely liable for the ongoing liabilities, including the mortgage payments and property taxes, of the Property from 10 September 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Foo Tuat Yien <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Appellant in person;<br/>Walter Ferix Silvester (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-right"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
