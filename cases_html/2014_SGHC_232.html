<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The defendant, Ser Kim Koi, employed the
                    plaintiff, GTMS Construction Pte Ltd, as the contractor for a building project.
                    In the course of the project, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff under
                    two interim payments, notwithstanding that these sums were certificated and
                    approved for payment by the defendant’s architect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant alleged that the certificates
                    issued were tainted by “fraud, improper pressure or interference”
                    as stated in cl 31(13) of the terms under the Singapore Institute of Architects
                    Conditions of Building Contract (Lump Sum Contract, 9th Ed, 2011 Reprint)
                    (“the SIA conditions”). If they were, the certificates could be
                    set aside and the plaintiff would not be entitled to payment. The plaintiff
                    disagreed and sued for payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the hearing below, the plaintiff applied for
                    summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”). His application was granted by the AR.
                    Dissatisfied with the AR’s decision, the defendant appealed. I heard the
                    appeal and dismissed it. He has appealed against my decision and I now give my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendant is the owner of Lot 98388L Mukim
                    04 at Leedon Park (Bukit Timah Planning Area).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He engaged the plaintiff to build three
                    two-storey detached houses on that plot of land (“the
                        Project”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Chan Sau Yan Associates (“the
                    Architect”) was engaged by the defendant as the architects of the Project
                    via a Memorandum of Agreement dated 16 June 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Architect is the second
                    third party to these proceedings. The first third party to this action is the
                    proprietor of the Architect, Chan Sau Yan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff was engaged as the Project’s
                    building contractor pursuant to an open tender.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Its contract with the
                    defendant contained the SIA conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The dispute concerns the
                    interpretation of certain terms found in the SIA conditions, particularly,
                    cl 31(13).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On or about 3 September 2013 and 6 November
                    2013, the Architect issued Interim Certificates (“IC”) No 25 and
                    26 (collectively known as “the Certificates”) for the payment of
                    $390,951.96 and $189,250.21 respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to the Certificates,
                    the Plaintiff issued Invoice No 25 and 26 for $418,318.60 (inclusive of Goods
                    and Services Tax (“GST”) of $27,366.64) and $202,497.72 (inclusive
                    of GST of $13,247.51) respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In total, the claimed sum was
                    $620,816.30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The defendant refused to pay the claimed sums
                    and missed the 30-day period within which he was required to pay the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He felt that the Architect and the
                    plaintiff had been acting together so that the Certificates were issued when
                    they should not have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant alleged that the Certificates had
                    been tainted by the plaintiff’s fraud, improper pressure or interference
                    as it had caused the Architect to issue the Certificates even though there were
                    work defects, the Completion Certificate (“CC”) was prematurely
                    issued and unwarranted time extensions were granted, <em>inter
                        alia</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Since the defendant refused to pay the
                    plaintiff, the latter filed a writ of summons and statement of claim against him
                    on 13 January 2014 claiming $620,816.30. After the defendant filed his defence,
                    the plaintiff filed for summary judgment against the defendant on 28 February
                        2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff took the view that it was
                    unjustified for the defendant to withhold payment that was certified by the
                    Architect. It argued that cl 31 of the SIA Conditions entitled it to full
                    payment of the claimed sum. The relevant portions of cl 31 reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.(1)    The Contractor
                            shall be <em>entitled to interim payments</em> for
                            the Works carried out or supplied under this Contract by way
                        of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">…</p>

                                thereof carried out by the Contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.(13)    No certificate of the architect under this
                            contract shall be final and binding in any dispute between the Employer
                            and the Contractor, whether before an arbitrator or in the courts,
                                <em>save only that, in the absence of fraud or
                                improper pressure or interference by either party, full effect by

                                absence of express provision, be given to all decisions and
                                certificates of the architect … whether by payment or
                                otherwise</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff’s view was that the issues
                    raised by the defendant did not show fraud, improper pressure, or interference.
                    As the third party to the action, the Architect’s evidence (on behalf of
                    both himself and the first third party) was also that the Architect had not been
                    fraudulent or subject to any improper pressure or interference when he issued
                    the Certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The plaintiff’s summary judgment
                    application was heard by the AR on 23 May 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The
                    application was granted by the AR, who ordered that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant pay the plaintiff a
                        total of $620,816.32;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     the defendant pay the plaintiff interest on the plaintiff’s
                        total claim at 5.33% per annum from the date of judgment to the date of
                        final payment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the defendant pay the plaintiff $10,000 for the costs of the
                        application plus reasonable disbursements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The AR held that cl 31(13) made it clear
                    that the court should not be concerned with “shoddy, poor or
                    unsatisfactory workmanship”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Rather, the
                    issue was whether the Certificates had been tainted by dishonesty or impropriety
                    so that it was inequitable for them to stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The AR’s view was that the evidence did
                    not raise any question regarding the Architect’s legitimate intentions in
                    issuing the Certificates. Therefore he granted summary judgment to the plaintiff
                    and the defendant appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant’s appeal raised three
                    issues arising from the Architect’s issuance of the Certificates despite
                    the presence of work defects, an alleged premature issuance of the CC and
                    unwarranted timeline extensions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Certificates were
                        tainted by fraud;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Certificates were tainted by improper pressure;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the
                        Certificates were tainted by interference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I answered all the questions in the negative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     O 14 r 1 of the ROC reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1. Application by plaintiff for summary judgment (O.
                            14, r. 1)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a statement of claim has been served on a defendant and that
                        defendant has served a defence to the statement of claim, the plaintiff may,
                        on the ground that that defendant has no defence to a claim included in the
                        writ, or to a particular part of such a claim, or has no defence to such a
                        claim or part except as to the amount of any damages claimed, apply to the
                        Court for judgment against that defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>For a summary judgment to be granted, the plaintiff needs to
                        show that there is plainly no defence to the claim: <em>Ganesan Carlose &amp; Partners v American Home Assurance Co</em>
                        [1994] 1 SLR(R) 223 and <em>Home and Overseas Insurance Co
                            Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [1990] 1
                        WLR 153 at 158. When the ICs were issued, the plaintiff had the benefit of
                        “temporary finality” in that he would be entitled to payment
                        on the basis of the ICs: <em>H P Construction &amp;
                            Engineering Pte Ltd v Chin Ivan</em> [2014] SGHC 137
                            (“<em>H P Construction</em>”) at
                        [17]. The question was whether the defendant could show that his defence was
                        an arguable one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant alleged that the plaintiffs were
                    not entitled to payment as the Architect who issued interim payment certificates
                    had been influenced by the plaintiff’s fraud, improper pressure or
                        interference.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> That being the case, temporary
                    finality should not be a shield against excesses or abuses of power by the
                    certifier (<em>H P Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Chin
                        Ivan</em>). Thus summary judgment should not be granted: <em>Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1989] 1 SLR(R) 591 (“<em>Tropicon
                    (HC)</em>”) at [15]. The defendant argued that he had a fair case
                    or reasonable grounds for his defence. Thus he ought to have been given leave to
                        defend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Certificates were tainted by fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant submitted that the Certificates
                    were tainted by fraud. The Court of Appeal in <em>Panatron Pte
                        Ltd and another v Lee Chew Lee and another</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435
                        (“<em>Panatron</em>”) at [13] held that
                    the definition of fraud is a deliberate intention to deceive, an absence of
                    honest belief or recklessness such as amounts to lack of honest belief. (see

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant also alleged that the
                    Certificates were tainted by improper interference or pressure. In his view, a

                allegations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant argued that the Architect had
                    shown a “consistent pattern of reckless conduct” in his
                    certification duties during the course of the Project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The following acts of the Architect could not

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The CC was issued prematurely</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     First, the defendant submitted that

                    when the Project appeared to be complete and complied with the contract in

                    that had to be fulfilled under Item 72 of the Preliminaries (terms which were
                    part of the contract) included the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the Project was ready for
                        occupation and for use in the Architect’s opinion;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     that all services were to be tested,
                        commissioned and operating satisfactorily; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     that all the works included in the Contract were

                        Project to the satisfaction of the Architect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendant submitted that the above had not
                    been fulfilled. In his view, the Project must have reached “a state of
                    readiness for use or occupation by the owner with the exception of trivial
                    omissions or defects” (Chow Kok Fong, <em>The Singapore

                    be issued. He stated that <em>Emden’s Construction
                        Law</em> (Andrew Barlett and Isabel Hitching gen eds) (LexisNexis,
                    2013) at paras 9.4–9.5 took a similar position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He cited the following incidents to show why
                    the CC was issued prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Temporary Occupation Permit (“TOP”) had
                not been issued when the CC was issued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     First, the defendant submitted that the CC
                    should not have been issued. The TOP was issued only after five months from the
                    date on which the CC was issued and hence the Project was not in a state ready
                    for occupation and use on 17 April 2013 when the CC was issued.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Since the CC constitutes <em>prima facie</em> evidence that a building is suitable for occupation
                    (s 12 of the Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed)),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> the Project could not have been ready for
                    occupation and use by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The testing of the services was incomplete</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Second, the defendant submitted that the
                    Architect did not have an honest belief that the services had been tested,
                    commissioned and operating satisfactorily as at 17 April 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The Architect was a very experienced
                    professional in the construction industry. He also knew the contractual terms
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>
                    Furthermore, the plaintiff’s own evidence was that the gas supply was
                    turned on <em>only</em> after 6 August 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> to which the Architect’s only response
                    was “the supply of gas is not a requirement for TOP
                        inspection”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Since the testing and
                    commissioning of <em>all services</em> was needed before
                    the CC could be issued, it had been issued prematurely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The operating manuals were only submitted by the plaintiff
                sometime between September 2013 and November 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Third, it was a requirement under
                    Item 72(b) of the Preliminaries, a term in the contract, that the operating
                    manuals were to be handed over in April/May 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However,
                    they were handed over only between September 2013 and November 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Therefore the conditions for the issuance of
                    the CC had not been complied with and its issuance was premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Moreover, the CC was issued on 17 April 2013.
                    The date was coincidentally the same date as the Project’s revised
                    completion date approved by the Architect. Therefore serious doubts arose as to
                    whether there was undue pressure or influence, which the plaintiff exerted on
                    the Architect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Since [21] to [25] indicated that the
                    Architect had been reckless in issuing the Certificates, the defendant submitted
                    that they evidenced fraud, improper pressure, or interference. Summary judgment
                    should thus be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Project had extensive defects</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, the defendant submitted that the
                    Architect’s honest belief in the condition or state of the Project was
                    questionable since the Project had extensive defects and yet the Certificates
                    were issued.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Clause 24(5) of the SIA
                    conditions provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]f any minor works are outstanding which can be completed
                        following the removal of the Contractor’s site organisation and all

                        Employer’s full enjoyment of and occupation of the property, then upon
                        the Contractor undertaking in writing to complete such outstanding work
                        within such time or times as may be stipulated by the Architect, <em>the Architect may (but shall not be bound to) issue a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendant submitted that there was
                    significantly more outstanding work that had yet to be completed – the
                    Architect had under-declared the amount of uncompleted work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> He engaged Building Appraisal Pte Ltd
                    (“BAPL”), an independent surveyor, to show that more extensive
                    defects existed as compared to those that the Architect had identified and the
                    additional defects identified were as follows: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     the swimming pool, koi ponds and
                        water features leaked;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     the external walls cracked and leaked;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     the marble
                        floor and timber flooring installations were poor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the defendant’s view, the additional defects showed
                        that the work was incomplete. Hence, the Project could not be fully enjoyed
                        or occupied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Architect had certified payment for the landscaping and timber
                flooring works recklessly</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Third, the defendant submitted that the
                    Architect had certified payment for the landscaping works recklessly. The
                    Architect had taken the view that loamy soil was used as per the contract.
                    However, the defendant’s landscape consultants, Landscape Konsortium,
                    stated that based on soil samples obtained from the project site, no loamy soil
                    had been supplied or applied in the Project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Therefore the Architect was reckless when it
                    certified payment for the landscaping works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant also submitted that the
                    Architect was reckless when it certified payment for the timber flooring
                        works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The specification of the timber to
                    be used was Indian Rosewood of 15mm thickness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> However,
                    on measurement, the defendant found that the thickness was only 10mm<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and the Architect had not adequately disproved
                    that finding. Therefore he had certified the payment for the timber flooring
                    works recklessly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Architect had granted unwarranted extensions of time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Fourth, the defendant alleged that the
                    Architect had granted unwarranted extensions of time. Originally, the plaintiff
                    was to ensure that there was permanent electricity supply to the Project by 11
                    August 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> However, a connection was only
                    made on 3 September 2012 and the delay was due to the plaintiff’s
                    fault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Moreover, the electrical connection was done
                    later than scheduled. Yet, the Architect had granted a time extension without
                    considering whether it was the plaintiff’s fault that caused this to
                    happen. Therefore, the Architect could not have granted the time extension with
                    honest belief<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> or alternatively, he must have
                    been subject to undue pressure or interference when it was
                granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff submitted that the
                    defendant’s appeal had to be totally dismissed. In its view, work defects
                    were irrelevant as to whether payment was due under the Certificates – the
                    only grounds that the defendant could contest their entitlement were based on
                    fraud, undue pressure or interference. Alternatively, the work defects raised,
                    without more, could not constitute fraud, improper pressure or interference. If
                    the defendant truly felt aggrieved, the correct remedy was not to oppose the
                    grant of summary judgment but to take out a separate action against the
                    plaintiff for the defective work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The CC was correctly issued </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff submitted that the CC had been
                    correctly issued. It was not premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Clause 24(4) of the SIA conditions and Item 72 of the
                Preliminaries had been fulfilled</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Architect was of the opinion that
                    cl 24(4) of the SIA conditions and Item 72 of the Preliminaries had
                    been fulfilled. His view was that the Project was complete and in compliance

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff further submitted that the TOP
                    and gas supply were not prerequisites for the issuance of the CC. The Architect
                    confirmed that TOP is only applied for after the issuance of the CC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The building must be completed and ready

                    before the TOP inspection. The problems relating to gas supply were attributable
                    to external pipes laid by Power Grid. It was not the plaintiff’s fault and
                    the plaintiff could not be held liable for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The CC was issued only after the Project had been substantially
                completed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff also submitted that the CC was
                    not issued prematurely as the Project had been substantially completed. Clause
                    24(4) of the SIA conditions and Item 72 of the Preliminaries had been fulfilled,
                    evidencing the Project’s substantial completion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Even if there was substantial work to be done
                    after completion had been certified, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant

                        conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The time extension was correctly granted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff alleged that the time extension
                    for the electrical installations was fairly and validly granted by the
                    Architect. This was made on the M&amp;E Consultant’s recommendations and
                    was in full compliance with cl 23 of the SIA conditions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff submitted that the time
                    extension had been granted because the circumstances leading to the delay were
                    caused by events beyond the plaintiff’s control. There was a delay in
                    Singapore Power’s connection of power to the meter compartments and there
                    was a request for an OG Box (an electrical part) for incoming power supply. A
                    further extension was also granted so that Power Grid’s sub-contractors
                    could work on electrical connector work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. It was only
                    then that the plaintiff could carry out M&amp;E testing and commissioning, light
                    fitting installation and cleaning up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Given that the situations were beyond the
                    plaintiff’s control, the events fell within the situations for which the
                    Architect could validly grant an extension of time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Therefore the extension of time was correctly
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Before turning to the issues proper, it is
                    important to set out the Architect’s evidence which played a significant
                    role in my deliberation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Architect’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The tender process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Architect’s first point was that it
                    was not in cahoots with the plaintiff. Its evidence was that the plaintiff had
                    been selected after a fair and objective tender process as evidenced by the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Architect submitted that
                        it had recommended the plaintiff to the defendant after a proper tender
                        process had been completed. The process was fair and objective since:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_44-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       a pre-qualification
                            exercise was conducted for six contractors with an additional contractor
                            added to the exercise on the request of the defendant;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_44-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the tender interviews were conducted by the
                            Architect, a team of consultants and the defendant was also
                                present;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_44-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the third parties only made a
                            recommendation to the defendant on 4 May 2011 after three rounds of
                            Tender Reports had been compiled by the Quantity Surveyor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Architect submitted that the
                        plaintiff was transparent and mentioned in its Tender Submissions on 15
                        November 2010 that it had worked on the Mont Timah project with the
                            plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> It was only after the defendant visited
                        the Mont Timah project and being impressed with the plaintiff’s work
                        that the defendant engaged the plaintiff as his contractor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Architect submitted that the plaintiff’s
                        quotation was the lowest among all the tenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus the defendant did not show <em>how</em> the
                        previous working relationship between the plaintiff and the Architect
                        compromised the latter’s independence and the tender process testified
                        that they had not been in cahoots.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The issuance of the Certificates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Architect’s next point was that
                    there was no fraud, improper pressure or interference that might have influenced
                    the enforceability of the Certificates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Certificates were validly certified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, the Architect submitted that the
                    Certificates had been validly certified. There was no collusion or unlawful
                    conspiracy between the plaintiff and himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The certification process
                    that attested to this was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     Once the plaintiff had submitted its
                        monthly progress claims, the Quantity Surveyor would visit the site to
                        verify the progress and state of completion of the
                    Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Architect would then consider the Quantity Surveyor’s valuation and
                        prepare the payment certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The
                        payment certification process was commonly used in the construction
                        industry. It involved three parties, namely the M&amp;E Consultant, Quantity
                        Surveyor and the Architect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the
                        defendant’s claim was baseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The time extensions were justified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Second, the Architect submitted that the time
                    extensions granted to the plaintiff were valid. The extensions had been in full
                    compliance with cl 23 of the SIA conditions, which sets out the procedure for
                    the plaintiff’s application for a time extension. On 4 October 2012, 20
                    December 2012, 15 January 2013 and 31 January 2013, the plaintiff had written to
                    the second third party for time extensions on the following grounds:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     delay on marble confirmation and
                        changes in marble selection and cutting sizes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     delay in testing and commissioning
                        M&amp;E services due to Singapore Power’s delay in turning on the
                        power supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The second third defendant took the view that
                    the first reason did not warrant any time extension as it was not critical to
                    the Project. However, a time extension was granted on the second ground as in
                    its view:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2)    We noted that due to request of OG box by Power
                            Grid as per letter dated 21<sup>st</sup> November 2012,
                            the Electrical Turn-on has been affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3)    We noted that the Testing and Commissioning of the
                            M&amp;E Services cannot be carried out without Electrical Turn-on
                            (Electrical supply). And this will lead to delay in handing over the
                            project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the evidence, the Architect was of the
                    opinion that the plaintiff had closely monitored the situation and followed up
                    with Singapore Power in relation to the electricity supply.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> In
                    its view, it was Singapore Power’s slow attendance to the matter that
                    caused the delay.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the plaintiff would have
                    required 25 days to test and commission the M&amp;E services and 15 days to do
                    the light fitting installation. The M&amp;E Consultant also took the view that
                    it usually took 15 days to complete the connection works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Therefore, the Architect granted the plaintiff
                    an initial time extension of 40 days and a second time extension of 15 days on
                    10 April 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The CC was properly issued</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Architect’s third point was that the
                    issuance of the CC was not dependent on whether the TOP had been
                        issued.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> All that was required was that the
                    Architect be satisfied that cl 24(4) of the SIA conditions and Item 72 of the
                    Preliminaries be fulfilled.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> These were done and the
                    Architect was thus satisfied that the CC was properly issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The defects were minor and normal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Architect’s fourth point was that
                    the defects were minor and usual for newly completed projects. The defects were
                    to be fixed during the defects liability period and apparent defects were
                    annexed to the Schedule to CC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> There were also no
                    defects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     to the marble, which had been
                        selected and chosen by the defendant himself;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     in the use of three-hole bricks which was encouraged by
                        the BCA and these were not defective;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_d"></a>(d)     in the laying of the marble tiles;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_e"></a>(e)     in the
                        filling of top soil, which was in accordance with the contract
                            specifications.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Therefore, in the Architect’s view, the
                    defendant had not proven his claim that the Certificates were tainted by fraud,
                    improper pressure or interference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Were the Certificates tainted by fraud?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Turning to the issues proper, I found that the
                    Certificates were not tainted by fraud.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The defendant relied on two cases for his
                    allegation of fraud: <em>Panatron</em> and <em>Wu Yang</em>. In <em>Panatron</em>, L P
                    Thean JA held that in order to succeed on an allegation of fraud, the party must
                    prove actual fraud by showing that there was a false representation made
                    knowingly, without belief in its truth or recklessly, without caring about its
                    truth: at [13]. On the facts of <em>Panatron</em>, no fraud
                    was found. Similarly, in <em>Wu Yang</em>, Andrew Phang
                    Boon Leong J (as he then was) held at [94]–[95] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94    An allegation of fraud entails a high requirement
                            with respect to proof. Whilst still being based on the civil standard of
                            a balance of probabilities, the amount of evidence required is far from
                            trifling. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">95    An allegation of fraud and/or conspiracy is an
                            extremely serious one. It ought not be made lightly. It bears repeating
                            that mere assertion is insufficient. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>Hudson’s</em>
                    at para 4–046 explained the concept of fraud as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of fraud is a deliberate intention to deceive, absence of
                        honest belief or recklessness as to honest belief. It is submitted that
                        collusion with the Certifier or knowledge of their fraud by the other
                        contracting party is not necessary to avoid a certificate affected by fraud
                        of the Certifier alone, <em>although such fraud may be rare
                            in practice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In this case the defendant’s evidence
                    consisted of (a) the Architect issuing the CC prematurely; (b) the Architects
                    issuing the Certificates despite alleged work defects; and (c) the Architect
                    granting unwarranted time extensions for the Project (see [20]–[34]
                    above). They caused the defendant to suspect fraud. However having considered
                    the explanations given by the plaintiff and the Architect, I was satisfied that
                    the evidence, most of which was circumstantial, was insufficient to prove
                    fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     If (and I am not suggesting that he was) the
                    Architect was negligent in issuing the Certificates or issued the CC
                    prematurely, that was one thing. It is another to say that he was dishonest and
                    in cahoots with the plaintiff. In my view, the suspicion was specious and devoid
                    of any cogent direct evidence. The reliance on circumstantial evidence and
                    inferences was insufficient to meet the high standard required to prove fraud
                    (see <em>Wu Yang</em> at [94]–[95]). In the
                    circumstances, I dismissed the first ground of the defendant’s
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Were the Certificates tainted by improper
                pressure?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I also found that the Certificates were not
                    tainted by improper pressure applied on the Architect. In order to show improper
                    pressure, the defendant had to show that there was some influence or
                    interference exerted on the Certifier’s independence. As stated in
                        <em>Hudson’s</em> at para 4-053:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The dividing line between … representations and pressure of an
                        improper kind may not be difficult to discern in practice, and broadly
                        speaking any pressure or action which goes beyond representations confined
                        to the merits of the matter in question, or which does not expressly or
                        impliedly recognise the Certifier’s ultimate right and duty to decide
                        the matter impartially on its merits, will be suspect …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In order for the defendant to establish his
                    case, evidence must be adduced to show that the Architect in this case had acted
                    on the plaintiff’s orders or had been influenced by the plaintiff or his
                    proxy in arriving at his decision. However, there was insufficient evidence to
                    establish that the plaintiff had improperly influenced the Architect. I accepted
                    the plaintiff’s evidence that the Architect’s decision to grant the
                    CC had been based on his professional judgement that the Project could be
                    enjoyed and occupied – it was consistent with the Architect’s
                    evidence which was convincing and detailed (at [44] to [52] above). There was
                    nothing to suggest otherwise. Therefore I also dismissed the defendant’s
                    appeal on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Were the Certificates tainted by interference?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I also held that the Certificates were not
                    tainted by interference. This ground covers any improper interference with the
                    Certifier’s independence and function by either party (<em>Hudson’s</em> at para 4-053). It must be shown that the
                    plaintiff had done something to prevent a true and unfettered exercise of the
                    Architect’s discretion: <em>Hudson’s</em> at
                    para 6-112–6-113.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> The basis for this ground is due to the
                    implied term that both parties will not compromise the Certifier’s
                    independence. This is seen in <em>Minster Trust Ltd v Traps
                        Tractors Ltd</em> [1954] 1 WLR 963 at 974, where Devlin J held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The certificate] must be made independently, for independence is
                        the essence of the arbitral function. If two parties agree to appoint an
                        arbitrator …
                        <em>it would be I think, implied in the contract to give it
                            business efficacy that neither side would seek to interfere with his
                            independence</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     There was no evidence to indicate that the
                    plaintiff had influenced the Architect. The defendant insinuated that they had
                    worked together on the Mont Timah project and the Architect had approved the
                    Certificates despite the many alleged defects in the Project. Thus they were in
                    cahoots. However, I find that it was highly improbable given the manner in which
                    the tender had been conducted and the involvement of other third parties in the
                    certification process. It would have taken a lot of effort for the
                    Architect’s independence to have been interfered with. Therefore, I was of
                    the view that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Architect’s
                    independence had been interfered with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In conclusion, I find the following remarks by
                    Thean J in <em>Tropicon (HC)</em> at [15] apposite (see
                    also <em>H P Construction</em> at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in so far as interim certificates of payment are concerned, it
                        seems to me that the intention of this clause is tolerably clear. It is
                        intended that the contractor be paid the amounts expressed to be payable in
                        the interim certificates, and if no payment is made by the employer it is
                        intended to enable the contractor in the absence of fraud, improper pressure
                        or interference or in the absence of express provisions, to obtain quick
                        summary judgment for the amounts certified as due. In so far as any sum
                        claimed by the employer is concerned, only the amounts expressly deductible
                        under the contract may be set off against the amount due under the interim
                        certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Indeed, as observed by Sundaresh Menon CJ in
                        <em>W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2013] 3 SLR 380 at [18] and [20], cash flow is the lifeblood of the
                    construction industry. Edmund Leow JC’s remarks that temporary finality is
                    the embodiment of the “pay first, argue later” philosophy is very
                    apt: <em>H P Construction</em> at [30]. In the
                    circumstances, I dismissed the defendant’s appeal and ordered him to pay
                    costs of $10,000 with reasonable disbursements to the plaintiff.</p>
