However, I agreed with the defendant that the plaintiffs’ claim was an assertion of ownership which challenged the defendant’s rights of ownership over the Shares. The Deeds transferred ownership of the Shares to the defendant without interference from any other parties claiming to have (in the PTPG Deed) a “pre-emptive right or joint right” or (in the PTSA Deed) a “higher right or joint right” to the Shares.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I also do not agree that the concept of trust or beneficial ownership in the Indonesian law context is not fully recognized. In my view, whether or not Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law applies to the arrangement between the parties and whether or not it falls within the prohibition under Article 33 is very much dependent on the facts of the case, including in particular the agreements contained in the [Deeds]. In this regard, I am of the view that any claims or disputes relating to the ownership of the Indonesia shares including the application of Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law can and should be dealt with by the Indonesian Court. In fact, the issue of Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law strengthens the reasons why it is the Indonesian court, in this regards South Jakarta District Court, that should adjudicate the dispute on this share ownership issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 At the hearing of the stay application, the defendant submitted that its expert did not say that a trust claim will fail in Indonesia and that it therefore followed that the plaintiffs would not be precluded from advancing their case in Indonesia. I disagreed with the defendant. The defendant’s expert’s opinion did not expressly deal with whether the plaintiffs could bring their trust claim in Indonesia. His focus was on whether the dispute in question should be dealt with by the Indonesian Court. In my view, that was the wrong question for him to focus on. The question whether this action should be stayed in favour of the District Court of South Jakarta was a question which I had to decide based on Singapore law, not Indonesian law. Further, the defendant’s expert did not explain why he disagreed with the plaintiffs’ expert’s statement that the concept of trust or beneficial ownership is not fully recognized under Indonesian law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In fact, it seemed to me that the defendant’s expert implicitly agreed that Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law (Law No 25 of 2007) (“Article 33”) could prohibit the plaintiffs’ trust claim. He simply chose not to express any view on whether the plaintiffs’ trust claim would fall within the scope of Article 33. The only view that he expressed on Article 33 was that whether an arrangement was prohibited under Article 33 depended on the facts; with respect, that view was not helpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In my view, it seemed unlikely that a trust claim would be recognized under Indonesian law. Further, the trust arrangement which formed the substance of the plaintiffs’ claim appeared to be prohibited under Article 33. I concluded therefore that it was questionable whether the plaintiffs would be able to bring their trust claim in Indonesia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 There remained the question of the law governing the alleged trust. The plaintiffs’ case that they would be prejudiced if they had to sue in Indonesia would fall away if Indonesian law governed the trust. The proper law of the trust is the law chosen by the trustee, or in the absence of such choice, the system of law to which the trust has the closest connection: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws </span>vol 6(2)”) at para 75.330.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It was not disputed that there was no express choice of law. The plaintiffs submitted that Singapore law was the implied choice of law as well as the law with the closest connection to the trust. In my view, it was clearly arguable that Singapore law governed the trust for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant was incorporated as a special purpose vehicle for the specific purpose of holding the Shares on trust for the plaintiffs. Hence, it may be inferred that the law of the place of incorporation of the defendant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore) was intended as the governing law of the trust: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws</span> vol 6(2) at para 75.332.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The express creation of the trust pointed towards the governing law being that of a jurisdiction that recognized and gave effect to trusts. The use of terminology peculiar to a particular legal system or a form known only to the legal system may be an indication of implied choice of law: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws</span> vol 6(2) at para 75.332.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Letter was issued in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my opinion, the plaintiffs had shown sufficient strong cause against the grant of a stay. If the plaintiffs had to sue in Indonesia, they would be prejudiced by the fact that the trust claim was not likely to be recognized under Indonesian law. Compelling the plaintiffs to bring their trust claim in Indonesia where it was not likely to be recognized was no different from compelling a plaintiff to sue in a foreign court where he would be faced with a time bar which was not applicable in Singapore. If the latter can constitute strong cause (see [13(e)(iii)] above), there is no reason why the former cannot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the final analysis, I could not see how granting a stay in these circumstances would bring about a just result or meet the ends of justice. It also seemed to me that the defendant could not be acting in good faith in  submitting that the trust claim should be brought in Indonesia, knowing as it must that the trust claim was not likely to be recognized under Indonesian law.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The defendant also submitted that a stay should be granted because a judgment of a Singapore court is not enforceable in Indonesia whereas a judgment of an Indonesian court can be enforced in Singapore. In my view, the question of enforcement does not arise. If the plaintiffs succeed before a Singapore court, the defendant would be required to take the necessary steps to transfer the Shares to the plaintiffs or pay damages. The question of enforcement in Indonesia would arise only if the defendant and its directors choose to disobey the order made by the Singapore court. The defendant’s submission was therefore premised upon the defendant and its directors deciding to disobey an order made by the Singapore court. In my judgment, such a submission was unmeritorious. The mere registration of the transfer of the Shares to the plaintiffs would not involve any enforcement of a judgment of a Singapore court; neither would it contravene Article 33 since the mere registration of the transfer would not raise any question of trust or beneficial interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Further and in any event, on balance, the prejudice to the plaintiffs was clearly greater if I were to grant a stay in this case. There would be no Indonesian judgment to talk about unless the plaintiffs’ trust claim was recognized under Indonesian law in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally, the defendant submitted that if a stay was not given, they would be prejudiced by having to face the risk of inconsistent judgments because the disputes between the shareholders of PTPG and PTSA had resulted in litigation in Indonesia. The defendant did not explain what the issues in the shareholders’ litigation in Indonesia were or how they were related to the issues in the present action. In any event, as discussed earlier, I disagreed with the defendant that the plaintiffs could bring their claims before the District Court of South Jakarta.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Indonesia was the proper forum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The guiding principles in determining the question of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> are well settled:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A stay will only be granted if there is some other available and more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of establishing this rests on the defendant. It is not enough just to show that Singapore is not the natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The natural forum is one with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. The facts to consider include not only factors affecting convenience or expense (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the availability of witnesses) but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If at this stage – commonly referred to as stage one of the test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Consulex Ltd</span> [1987] AC 460 (“the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test”) – the court concludes that there is no other available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the court concludes that there is some other available forum which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. For this second stage (commonly referred to as stage two of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test), the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(See, <span class="font-italic">CIMB Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 at [26])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The defendant relied on the same submissions that it made in connection with the exclusive jurisdiction clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, Indonesia was neither an available nor an appropriate forum since it did not seem likely that the plaintiffs’ trust claim would be recognized in Indonesia. As the defendant did not pass stage one of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test, a stay ought not to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript - the defendant’s application for leave to appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 During the hearing of the stay application before me, the defendant’s case focused on the submission that the plaintiffs would not be prejudiced by litigating in Indonesia because they would not be precluded from advancing their trust claim in Indonesia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, in its application for leave to appeal, the defendant’s focus changed. In summary, the defendant first accepted that Indonesian law does not contain the concept of trust and that the trust alleged by the plaintiffs would be barred in Indonesia as a consequence of Article 33. The defendant then submitted that a stay should be granted because the Singapore legal system should not be permitted to be used to circumvent the laws of a friendly foreign state. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It seemed to me that there was no reason why a trust over the Shares could not be enforced in a Singapore court if the trust was governed by Singapore law. Unless Indonesian law governed the trust, the prohibition in Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law would not apply when determining whether the Shares were held on trust. In this present action, the question whether the defendant held the Shares on trust for the plaintiffs is an issue between the plaintiffs and the defendant; it does not require the Company or any third parties in Indonesia to recognize the trust. If the plaintiffs succeed before a Singapore court and the defendant takes the necessary steps to transfer the Shares to the plaintiffs, the mere registration of the transfer of the Shares by the defendant to the plaintiffs would not engage Article 33. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Nevertheless, I granted leave to appeal because I agreed with the defendant that the question how a Singapore court should view trust arrangements involving trust property situated in a foreign jurisdiction which either does not recognize trusts or which expressly prohibits trusts is one which would benefit from a decision by the Court of Appeal. It is well-established that one of the principles upon which leave to appeal ought to be given is where it raises a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> at para 57/16/13.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As observed by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Akers and others v Samba Financial Group </span>[2015] 2 WLR 1281 (“<span class="font-italic">Akers</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34] and [35], there must be large numbers of trusts established under the laws of common law jurisdictions that comprise registered shares in civil law countries amongst their assets; yet, questions as to the effect of such arrangements have seemingly never been fully addressed before. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 <span class="font-italic">Akers</span> was cited by the defendant in support of its application for leave to appeal. Interestingly, <span class="font-italic">Akers </span>concerned an action brought in England by the liquidators of SICL, a Cayman company, to void a disposition of shares in Saudi Arabian banks by one Al-Sanea to the defendant. The liquidators claimed that Al-Sanea held the shares on trust for SICL. The defendant applied to stay the proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>, arguing that Saudi Arabian law (under which trusts were unlawful) applied to the trust and that the Saudi Arabian courts were therefore the more appropriate forum. The Court of Appeal held that it was arguable that the trust was governed by Cayman Islands law and decided against a stay of the action. The Supreme Court gave the defendant leave to appeal and the case is presently pending the Supreme Court’s decision. I should add that <span class="font-italic">Akers</span> also concerned the application of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I was referred to <span class="font-italic">Akers </span>only in connection with the defendant’s application for leave to appeal. It was not cited during the hearing of the defendant’s application to stay these proceedings. As a result, I did not have the advantage of full arguments on <span class="font-italic">Akers </span>in connection with the stay application. I will therefore say no more about it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I dismissed the defendant’s application to stay these proceedings in favour of litigation in Indonesia. In my judgment, the fact that the plaintiffs’ trust claim was not likely to be recognized in Indonesia constituted strong cause to not grant a stay of these proceedings. It also meant that Indonesia was neither an available nor an appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ling Daw Hoang Philip and Yap Jie Han (Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC) for the plaintiffs;<br/>Chew Ming Hsien Rebecca and Chew Xiang (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
