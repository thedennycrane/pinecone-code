In turn, the object of the domestic UN-DPRK Regulations is to give effect to these international obligations imposed by various UNSC resolutions (see reg 2 of the UN-DPRK Regulations).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Chong Hock Yen (“Chong”) had for a number of years traded with the DPRK, and was charged with abetment by engaging in a conspiracy with the three companies and others to supply to the DPRK luxury items such as perfumes, cosmetics, watches and musical instruments.

The breach of the UN-DPRK Regulations may in some instances lead directly to increasing the egregiousness of the very behaviour that is to be discouraged by the sanctions. Thus, where sanctions are imposed to prevent the acquisition of arms or harmful technology, providing the very arms or technology in question would call for heavy punishment. If the offence involves some other prohibited act that is not the direct target of the sanctions, while harm could arise, the calibration of the punishment will need to be more nuanced and there must be greater care exercised in ensuring proportionality. In addition to the direct consequences of the contravention, other types of harm follow, including the detrimental effect on the international reputation and standing of the country in which the offences were committed. Harm would also be increased by various factors, common to many offences, including the number of instances, the duration involved, and the size or scope. Some of these factors could also be considered as going to culpability, and care must be had to ensure that there is no double counting. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">International obligations enacted under national law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 An impact statement was prepared by the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs (“MFA”) which highlighted the impact of the violations by Chong and the three companies on Singapore’s international reputation and standing.

There was also increased scrutiny and criticism from the UNSC Panel of Experts in findings published on the UNSC website in 2018 which was publicly available. The international public attention, in turn, cast a negative light on the integrity and reputation of Singapore and this would affect our economic reputation and competitiveness.

</div> However, any breach would have such an impact. There was no specific evidence that Singapore’s reputation was damaged in this case. The Defence argues that essentially, the Prosecution is asking for Chong to be made a scapegoat. The DJ erred in concluding that the MFA impact statement called for the imposition of a custodial sentence here. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The importance of this factor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I am of the view that what has been invoked by the Prosecution as effect on reputation and standing is a relevant consideration as to harm. Where the Singapore Legislature had specifically enacted laws implementing or supporting international efforts, a contravention or undermining of those efforts would generally involve substantial harm. This does not, I must emphasise, involve a general obligation importing all supposed international norms, rules or laws. What is important is our domestic Legislature’s implementation of national law that protects or furthers such international obligations. Without such enactment, there is simply nothing for the courts to recognise or effect (see <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 2 SLR 1129 at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Effect on reputation and standing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The UN–DPRK Regulations are Singapore’s domestic implementation of the UN sanctions imposed on the DPRK. The international community intended these sanctions to curb the DPRK’s growing nuclear activities which endangered regional stability. The sanctions would only be effective if UN member states complied by restricting trade to the DPRK, thereby exerting pressure on the DPRK to come to the negotiating table to cease their nuclear activities. The trade-related measures adopted by the UNSC in Resolution 1718 (2006) and SC Res 1874, UN SCOR, 6141st meeting, UN Doc S/Res/1874 (2009) (“Resolution 1874 (2009)”) are aimed at convincing the DPRK to comply with its international obligations and return to talks concerning nuclear disarmament, and at inhibiting the DRPK’s ability to acquire technology and financial resources to contribute to its nuclear and missile programmes (see <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">eport of the Panel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 1874 (2009)</span> (5 November 2010) (S/2010/571) at para 18).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The starting point is that violation of a UN measure enacted into domestic law will be taken to affect our international reputation. Certainly, there may be occasions where an international reprimand or warning may be issued specifically against Singapore; where that happens, the scale of harm is increased substantially. But a base level harm would be taken to follow from any breach of an international obligation unless the harm is perhaps <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. On the face of it alone, the breach of an international obligation creates the potential for harm affecting our relations with other nations and with international organisations. This would undermine our national interests and participation in the international sphere. Albeit in a different context (regarding the fight against corruption under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (31 October 2003), 2349 UNTS 41), as observed in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals</span> [2019] 5 SLR 926 at [82] (citing Canadian jurisprudence), the violation of international obligations could prejudice a State’s efforts to foster effective commercial relations with other countries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  Compliance with UNSC resolutions is amongst one of the most substantial international obligations that exist as they concern threats to international peace and security (see UN Charter (26 June 1945) (“UN Charter”) art 39). Singapore must comply with these resolutions as a UN member (see UN Charter art 41), and any non-compliance can have severe repercussions as noted during the second reading of the United Nations Bill (Bill No 42/2001) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 October 2001) vol 73 at col 2436 (Professor S Jayakumar, Minister for Law and Minister for Foreign Affairs): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Singapore is a member of the United Nations. Like all other members of the United Nations, we are legally bound by the UN Charter to implement mandatory resolutions of the UN Security Council. A failure to give effect to the measures mandated by the Security Council would be a breach of our international obligations for which Singapore may be subject to censure and sanctions by the Security Council.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Judicial notice is taken of the impact of scrutiny, especially on our position as an international trade and financial centre. We must always be especially cognizant of the attendant ramifications from breaches of international obligations on Singapore’s hard-earned reputation as a global financial hub (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2019] 3 SLR 606 at [56]–[57]). Concerns about our compliance may lead to various possible consequences, including the stifling of trade, business or investment, whether through discouraging others from dealing with us, or through some form of international disapproval, or even sanctions. While the harm should not be overstated, where there is evidence of international disapproval, the harm would have to be assessed as significant. Criticism through a resolution passed at an international meeting or criticism by political leaders would perhaps be close to the highest level of condemnation, causing great harm. Comments made by the UNSC Panel of Experts would not be at those levels but would be substantive enough.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, the adverse impact is substantiated by the MFA impact statement, referring to the scrutiny by and findings of the UNSC Panel of Experts, and the questioning of our commitment to the upholding of obligations under the UNSC resolutions.

Furthermore, luxury goods, not being necessities, probably provide succour and motivation for the continued defiance or contravention of UN sanctions by those in positions of influence or power within the country.

Furthermore, there would be double counting if one factored in the duration of offending and the volume of trade (as distinct factors) when considering the multiple charges that were proceeded with, particularly given that the harm caused was slight and culpability was only at the medium level.

</div> There was no indifference on the part of Chong to the controls imposed by the international community. The DJ also erred in finding that Chong was aware of the risks and implications of trading with the DPRK, by suggesting that Chong wanted to run a low-key operation to avoid detection. The evidence relied upon by the DJ did not in fact support her conclusion: she relied on a newspaper report which suggested the contrary, and the inference drawn from the failure to list the companies’ names on the floor guides and outside the unit was speculative.

</div>
</div> This is a substantial period of time. Culpability is increased by a lengthy duration simply because the criminal conduct is prolonged and persistent. In contrast, a person engaged in a one-off criminal act, or one that only continues for a relatively short period, would have displayed less culpability and would be less criminally responsible. In addition, the lengthy duration also potentially prolongs the harm caused by the act, though in this case, I would have taken the scale of criminal conduct rather than the number of charges against Chong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The fact that there were multiple charges is a separate consideration from the duration. They affect different sentencing interests. Multiple charges generally show increased criminal culpability through the number of contraventions. The duration of time over which offences are committed may be related, but it highlights a different aspect of culpability: a single contravention spread over a long period of time, may indeed show greater criminal behaviour than multiple contraventions over a short period. Much depends on the nature of the criminal act, and the context in which it exists. But it is clear that there will be no double counting here.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indifference to the controls</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Defence argues that the DJ erred in finding that Chong had continued to expand his trading activities even after the trade became illegal.

This shows, the Prosecution contends, premeditation. It is also argued that Chong had demonstrated a high degree of sophistication and planning to avoid legal scrutiny, by transporting the goods through circuitous routes and having payments sent through front companies incorporated in Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. Chong also kept a low profile to avoid detection by not having the companies’ names on floor directories, as found by a journalist who had visited the registered addresses.

Premeditation should generally be considered in contradistinction with spontaneous or spur of the moment acts, which are generally regarded as carrying less blameworthiness, in recognition of possible momentary foolishness or impetuosity, particularly of those who are regarded as being immature. A person could spontaneously commit an act of violence, and perhaps some property offences such as shop theft. But one does not spontaneously supply goods to a foreign country. Thus, the real complaint concerns the planning, organisation and sophistication involved in the commission of the offences. Generally, the greater the degree of planning involved then, correspondingly, the greater the culpability of the offender (see <span class="font-italic">Mehra Radhika</span><span class="font-italic"> v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 1 SLR 96 at [41]). The same can be said for the presence of organisation and sophistication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I accept the Prosecution’s submissions that the offences were committed with planning as Chong routed the goods through circuitous routes, with payments being made through front companies in various offshore jurisdictions. Though, given the widespread use of offshore companies to shield responsibility and liability in a range of contexts, I do not think that it involved so much sophistication. While such planning merits a heavier sentence because of the greater criminality involved as opposed to a spontaneous act, overall, the uplift here would be relatively muted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I do not accept, however, that the fact that the company names were not listed on the directory of the building that they were in is indicative of any planning or subterfuge. I accept the Defence’s arguments on this score, and this factor should not have been relied upon by the DJ. Newspaper reports should not be used to determine such issues. Furthermore, if the Prosecution wishes to rely on this, it should tie such omission in some way to the proscribed activity; otherwise, it would be entirely speculative. Omission to list the companies’ names outside the unit could be for a number of reasons, some of which may be neutral or innocent. It may not even have been at the direction of Chong.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Profit motivation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Chong did profit substantially from his activities, indicating that his culpability was not low.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Prosecution argues that a total sum of $122,116.96 was made through trading via the three companies, which is, it says, a lucrative profit.

The promise of financial rewards must be outweighed in the minds of possible offenders by the threat of punishment. In some cases, appropriately calibrated fines can achieve this purpose by disgorging any profit (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Su Jiqing Joel</span> [2021] 3 SLR 1232 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Jiqing</span><span class="font-italic"> Joel</span>”)). However, where the criminal conduct involves a substantial contravention of a law protecting our national interests, I am of the view that a fine would not be a sufficient deterrent. In addition, the punitive or retributive aspect would also require a sufficiently heavy sentence, in proportion to the scale and effect of the contravention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Aggravating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The primary aggravating factor possibly at play in this case is the abuse of authority by Chong.

The absence of prior convictions does not show reduced responsibility, nor does it attenuate the harm caused by the offence. The DJ was well justified to decline to consider Chong a first-time offender given the number of offences committed and the duration of offending. Chong has a clean record only because he was not caught earlier for his offences.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 A more substantial sentence is called for given that there was substantial harm to Singapore’s standing and reputation, and the criminal activity occurred over a few years. Planning was present, indicating a higher degree of culpability. The fact that substantial profits were made should also push the sentence upwards. It is also aggravating to some extent that the Appellant involved his secretary. In comparison, little weight can be placed on the mitigating factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I find that the DJ did not sufficiently calibrate the sentence in light of the harm that was caused. To my mind, a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment per pre-amendment offence and four weeks’ imprisonment per post-amendment offence should have been imposed. Subject to my comments below, an appropriate sentence reflecting the harm caused and the culpability of Chong should have been six weeks’ imprisonment globally, even accounting for the plea of guilt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The reservation was that given the number of charges involved (43 in total), I would have thought that more sentences should have been run consecutively. The guidance laid down in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shou</span><span class="font-italic">ffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shou</span><span class="font-italic">ffee</span>”) at [27] and [47], requires the court to have regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle. Consecutive sentences are not generally apt for a single invasion of the same legally protected interest under the one-transaction rule (<span class="font-italic">Shou</span><span class="font-italic">ffee </span>at [30]), but this would be subject to common sense. Under the totality principle, the aggregate sentence should remain proportionate to the criminal conduct and should not be crushing (<span class="font-italic">Shou</span><span class="font-italic">ffee </span>at [47] and [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 With the overall criminal conduct of Chong, and the blatant disregard for the restrictions imposed, it would have been appropriate to order more than two sentences to run consecutively. Such egregious conduct would have merited a separate sentencing response due to the long duration and the sheer number of charges involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 However, as the Prosecution has only submitted for a sentence of six weeks upwards and above total, I will not impose a higher imprisonment sentence as such. I do note that the Prosecution has framed its submissions on the basis that it is seeking at least six weeks, implying that a higher sentence could be warranted.

In contrast, it is possible to envisage situations where a maximum fine of $1 million is appropriate solely to punish an offender based on the harm caused and culpability in the context of offences punishable under s 5(1) of the UN Act as that punishment provision also applies to more serious offences such as supplying items which directly contribute to the DPRK’s nuclear or missile programmes.

</div>
</div> While it is true that the companies have legal personalities, and are treated by the law, at least for some purposes, as separate from the errant director, when it comes to punishment under the criminal law, the legal fiction runs up against the reality that companies cannot be punished in the same way as individuals: any punishment against a company will not be retributive, rehabilitative, or deterrent in nature as there is no moral agency in a company. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Auston International Group Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 882 (at [19]): “A deterrent sentence has effect only on individuals, be they persons who commit the act and are liable for it, or managers responsible for steering the companies.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 My view is that the punishment’s effect, if any, takes place against the humans behind the company: the officers, shareholders, employees, and creditors. It may be questioned whether such punishment is truly effective or is overbroad by enveloping persons who may be innocent of any wrongdoing; it is entirely conceivable to have a legal system in which no corporate culpability exists, and everything is brought home to the human agents involved. But our legal system does prescribe punishment for corporations. The Legislature in so specifying such punishment must be taken to have made a conscious choice, to possibly have the effect that such corporate punishment resound to the detriment of those persons who may otherwise have not been involved or are wholly innocent of any moral culpability in the crime committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, in considering the punishment of corporations, the different nature of the entities being punished must be taken into account. The usual sentencing objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution must be modified. As noted above, these objectives are targeted at human agency, decision-making or moral responsibility. In some objectives, such as deterrence, the distinction between the corporation and those behind it is elided: the human actors behind the corporation are those being deterred, not the corporation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I pause to note the observations in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kopi Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 2 SLR 413 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kopi</span>”) at [11] (in the context of offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed)) that the concept of deterrence is “applicable to companies, in the same way as it is applicable to individual offenders”. I would hesitate to agree that such concepts are applicable “in the same way”. Putting that aside, it was cautioned that where the corporate entity is essentially the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> of the errant director, one must be careful not to impose a deterrent fine on the corporate entity for exactly the same offence for which a deterrent sentence was already imposed on the errant director, as this is tantamount to imposing double deterrent sentences for the same offence: <span class="font-italic">Lim Kopi</span> at [18]. This accords with my view that the distinction between the human actors and the corporation is sometimes blurred when it comes to sentencing considerations. This will be kept in mind when calibrating the fines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the present case, under the statutory provisions, substantial fines are provided for. The precise jurisprudential basis for the punishment or retribution imposed on the corporate entities need not be explicated here; but the punishment of corporations reflecting some form of disapprobation or reckoning for the moral culpability, even of a corporation, seems to be accepted by the legislative scheme. Thus, a company committing an offence is ascribed some moral culpability or responsibility (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lim Kopi</span> at [11]), attracting some level of disadvantage imposed by the State. The calibration will have to be carried out on a robust basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 That then leaves the possibility of disgorgement also operating in some sentences on top of the punitive element. The disgorgement is targeted at the pure economic benefit obtained by the company from its criminal actions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Calibration of the punishment on the corporations here</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I accept here that the fines imposed on the three companies were too low, in not capturing and distinguishing between both the punitive and disgorging aspects of monetary punishment. The punitive element must factor in both the harm and the culpability or responsibility for the actions. The disgorgement will generally be directly proportional to the economic or financial benefit derived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Prosecution relies on a sentencing matrix in its submissions.

</div>
</div> However, given the Prosecution’s avowed reluctance to put forward a sentencing framework because of the dearth of cases, I cannot see that there is, for that same reason, sufficient basis for the adoption of a matrix either. The issue is thus best left to another appellate court at a future juncture once more cases have been heard. Thus, the Prosecution’s matrix is not adopted or endorsed. Rather, for guidance, I will indicate an initial starting point, that can be calibrated up or down depending on the circumstances. The proposed matrix by the Prosecution also purports to provide for fines for a range of behaviour. I do not think, though, that given the nature of the offence here, with potentially very many different kinds of behaviour possibly running foul, it would be appropriate to specify punishments in such a linear fashion, and it may be that certain offence situations may attract a higher sentence than would otherwise be the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Taking these matters into account, I am of the view that the fines imposed should be increased. This is despite the fact that punishment will in practical terms resound, if at all, on the shareholders or the employees of the corporate entities. There may be something to be said for directing punishment at the officers involved, whether for connivance or negligence, in allowing the corporate entity to commit the crimes. Nonetheless, the legislative choice has been made in Singapore that substantive punishment is to be levied on corporations. Such fines as are provided for here are not out of the norm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I noted above at [109] that caution must be exercised not to impose double deterrent sentences, and it seemed that this was a concern of the DJ as well when she considered that the punitive objectives of deterrence and retribution were mostly achieved through the imposition of the custodial sentence on Chong.

</div> However, I do not think that there would be any double counting here as there is a sufficiently strong public interest in deterring both individuals and corporate entities from breaching the UN-DPRK Regulations when it comes to matters that affect Singapore’s international standing. Apart from specific deterrence, the disgorgement of profits also serves the objective of general deterrence and deters other offending companies from engaging in illegal behaviour as the law makes it clear that ill-gotten gains cannot be retained: <span class="font-italic">Su Jiqing Joel</span> at [50].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Given the nature of the offences here, generally the fines should start at the $10,000 range even for minimal infractions, for both pre-amendment and post-amendment offences. I reiterate that compliance with UNSC resolutions is paramount as they concern threats to international peace and security and any contravention could result in intentional condemnation (or even sanctions) being directed at Singapore. Anything lower would not sufficiently protect the interests to be served by the legislation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For post-amendment offences there is a wider spectrum of fines that can be imposed, which may take into account different levels of criminal behaviour. There should also be a general uplift in the fines for post-amendment offences as the reasons set out above at [85]–[86] apply with equal force to the enhancement of fines after the 2014 amendments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In calibrating the fines, a number of factors come to mind including: the type of items involved (whether civilian or military, whether relating to the DPRK’s missile or nuclear programme), the target market of the goods (whether for the general public or destined for use by the DPRK’s senior regime figures), the value of the goods, the amount of subterfuge involved, and the adverse impact on Singapore’s international standing. The factors considered in respect of calibrating the appropriate sentence for Chong would also be material here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I note that, in common to all three corporate offenders, the offences only concerned the supply of general consumer luxury goods that were meant for the general population of the DPRK.

</div> But even the trade of ordinary, quotidian goods may help sustain continued flouting of UN sanctions, and defeat the objectives of the international action. While the harm caused may be lower, the culpability of all three companies is medium given their primary business of supplying luxury goods to the DPRK.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) SCN</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Beginning with the pecuniary value to be disgorged in accordance with the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Su Jiqing Joel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41], in respect of SCN, the total amount of gross profit made throughout the period of offending was approximately S$111,024.27, and this forms the disgorgement component.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Regarding the punitive component, I accept that the fine should be at least S$10,000, but taking into account, the number of charges (six proceeded charges with 33 taken into consideration), the amounts involved (total traded volume of S$492,328.89 and US$29,026.80), the surreptitious means used to avoid detection, I am of the view that for each of the pre-amendment offences, a fine of S$20,000 for the punitive component should be imposed based on the harm caused and culpability. This would give a total of S$40,000 for the two pre-amendment offences (DSC 900745/2018 and DSC 900747/2018). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As for the post-amendment offences, I am satisfied that considering the circumstances, particularly that the criminality had been going on for some time even after the 2014 amendments came into force, the punitive component of S$40,000 per charge should be imposed. The uplift given, as compared to pre-amendment offences, flowed from the greater harm to Singapore’s reputation and greater need for deterrence as indicated above. This gives us a total of S$160,000 for the four post-amendment offences (DSC 900767/2018, DSC 900768/2018, DSC 900769/2018 and DSC 900765/2018). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Thus, the global fine to be imposed for SCN is S$311,000 in total after rounding. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Sindok</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for Sindok, the profit made was about S$7,887.74 and this forms the disgorgement component. Given that there were two charges taken into consideration, with a total trade value of US$20,601.80 (or approximately S$27,921.62) and the avoidance of detection, the starting point should be a fine of S$15,000 for the punitive component for the single pre-amendment offence (DSC 900739/2018). The global fine to be imposed is S$23,000 after rounding. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Laurich</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Turning to Laurich, the profit made was about S$3,204.95 and this forms the disgorgement component. Given the circumstances where the total traded value was US$12,000.00 (or approximately S$16,263.60) for one occasion and the avoidance of detection, the punitive component would be S$27,000 for the single post-amendment offence (DSC 900740/2018). While there are fewer charges as compared to SCN and Sindok, the justification is that this was a post-amendment offence and it occurred at a time when there was a heightened need for response to the threats by the DPRK, increasing the harm caused. The global fine to be imposed is S$30,000 after rounding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Global sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I note that the Prosecution’s submissions were focused on the global sentences to be imposed for the offending parties. It is true that the totality of the sentence should be considered by the court. However, it is generally not appropriate, to my mind, to submit only on the global sentence without considering the individual sentences. Proportionality and appropriateness must be considered not just for the total, but also for each individual charge proceeded with. Focusing only on the global position runs the risk of individual sentences being out of whack. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Prosecution’s appeals are thus allowed, though not entirely for the reasons put forward.
