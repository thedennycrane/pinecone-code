        V K Rajah JA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These proceedings began as an appeal by
                    Mr Ong Chow Hong @ Ong Chaw Ping (the “Appellant”) against a
                    disqualification order barring him from taking part in the management of any
                    company for a period of one year (the “Disqualification Order”).
                    He was charged and convicted of failing to exercise reasonable diligence in the
                    discharge of the duties of his office as a director of Airocean Group Limited
                    (“Airocean”). However, after I intimated to counsel that the
                    length of the Disqualification Order might, on the contrary, be manifestly
                    inadequate, the Prosecution obtained leave and filed an appeal against sentence
                    as well. After hearing full submissions, I decided to increase the
                    disqualification period imposed on the Appellant to 24 months. In addition,
                    I gave short written grounds and informed the parties that detailed reasons
                    would follow at a later date. These are the full grounds of my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It would be churlish of me if I do not, at the
                    outset, record my debt to all Counsel (and, in particular, Ms Melanie Chng
                    (“Ms Chng”), the <em>Amicus Curiae</em>) for
                    their invaluable assistance in this matter. I found their submissions
                    illuminating, comprehensive and, most importantly, useful in assisting me to
                    arrive at my decision. Ms Chng’s written submissions, in particular,
                    were a model of clarity. Mr Jeffrey Chan SC, for the Prosecution, and
                    Mr Bernard Doray, for the Appellant, ought to be also commended for the
                    even-handed presentation of their submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       All things considered, the central
                    considerations in these appeals were the seriousness of the Appellant’s
                    lapse of judgment and whether it warranted a disqualification from acting as a
                    director. If disqualification was warranted, this court had to also determine
                    the appropriate length of disqualification to impose. As for the legal issues,
                    the fundamental enquiry was to ascertain if the statutory objective of
                    Singapore’s disqualification regime for directors was protective, punitive
                    or an amalgam of both. Such an enquiry would take into account the history of
                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) and the
                    entire statutory scheme for directors’ responsibilities and corporate
                    governance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background and Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Airocean was a company listed on the Mainboard
                    of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited. The Appellant was its
                    non-executive Chairman and an independent director. At the material time,
                    Airocean’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) consisted of six
                    members:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The catalyst for the charge against the
                    Appellant occurred on 6 September 2005. That morning, officers from
                    the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) picked up
                    Thomas Tay from his home and brought him to their office for questioning on
                    allegations of corruption involving Airocean and two other companies in the
                    airline industry. During the investigation, and on CPIB’s instructions,
                    Thomas Tay directed his staff at Airocean’s premises to compile all his
                    e-mails and business proposals connected to the corruption allegations. On
                    7 September 2005, Thomas Tay was released on bail but his passport was
                    impounded by CPIB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 8 September 2005, the Airocean directors
                    (with the exception of Dunn) convened an urgent board meeting to discuss what
                    the company should do following the investigation of Thomas Tay. The relevant
                    minutes of the meeting showed that the Board was informed of the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">on 6 September 2005 at about 7.00am, CPIB
                            officers had called upon Thomas Tay to assist the CPIB in an ongoing
                            investigation;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">CPIB had requested for and obtained from Airocean
                            all e-mails of Thomas Tay from 1 January 2005 to 6 September
                            2005;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay had asked for certain documents
                            relating to the corruption allegations;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay’s passport was impounded by
                            CPIB;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay was questioned for 36 hours by
                            CPIB;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay was questioned on whether he had
                            offered any gratification to the staff of some companies in the airline
                            industry;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay had sought his own legal advice on the
                            CPIB investigation; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(h)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Thomas Tay’s counsel was of the opinion
                            that the worst-case scenario was that Thomas Tay might be exposed to a
                            criminal charge of offering gratification.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Unrecorded in the above minutes, was the additional and very
                    significant fact that Thomas Tay informed the Board that he was released by CPIB
                    on bail. (Thomas Tay subsequently confirmed with the Commercial Affairs
                    Department (“CAD”) that he <em>did</em>
                    indeed do so.) At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board resolved that nothing
                    further needed to be done at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       About more than two months after the
                    8 September 2005 meeting, events came to a head when the Thomas Tay
                    investigation surfaced to the public <em>fora</em>. On the
                    morning of 25 November 2005, the Straits Times published an article (see
                    Azrin Asmani, “Airocean’s chief executive Thomas Tay under CPIB
                    probe”
                    <em>The Straits Times</em> (25 November 2005))
                    (“the Article”). The Article, among other facts, included a quote
                    from Thomas Tay denying that he was the subject of a CPIB investigation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was called up by the CPIB for an interview months ago. I believe, to the
                        best of my knowledge, that it concerns an investigation over some people in
                        my industry and <em>it has nothing to do with me
                            …</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Later that morning, Singapore Exchange Limited
                    (“SGX”) contacted Airocean, requiring “Airocean to explain
                    why the fact that [Thomas Tay] was under a CPIB probe was not made
                    public” and “to confirm whether or not [Thomas Tay] was in fact a
                    subject of CPIB investigations”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Airocean eventually requested for SGX to suspend the trading of its shares
                    pending an announcement. At 9.15am, Airocean’s company secretary,
                    Ms Ang Lay Hua (“Ms Ang”), e-mailed all the directors,
                    informing them of the trading halt announcement and that SGX had requested
                    Airocean to make a clarificatory statement responding to the
                Article.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Ms Ang later contacted the Appellant, who
                    was also the non-executive Chairman of Airocean’s Board by telephone, and
                    updated him on the latest developments. According to the agreed Statement of
                    Facts, the Appellant then informed Ms Ang that “<em>he
                        would agree to any announcement issued by [Airocean] if [Madhavan] approved
                        of it. [The Appellant] said that that was because he was going to play golf
                        that day</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added]. In fairness to the Appellant, I should also add that he tried
                    to explain that the golfing event he attended was not a mere social affair.
                    Apparently, it was organised by the Aljunied Town Council; the Appellant was the
                    Chairman of its Audit Committee and had a prominent role to play in the
                        event.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On account of what transpired, the Appellant
                    was charged with contravening s 157(1) of the CA, in failing to use
                    reasonable diligence in the discharge of his official duties as a director of
                    Airocean. The relevant provisions of s 157 of the CA provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>157. </b>—(1) A director shall at all
                        times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the
                        duties of his office.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    An officer or agent who commits a breach of any of
                            the provisions of this section shall be —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="-p3_b"></a>(b)       guilty of an offence and shall be
                            liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment
                            for a term not exceeding 12 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where a person has been convicted of an offence under s 157 of
                    the CA, s 154(2) of the CA allows the court to make a disqualification
                    order. The relevant provisions of s 154 are reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where a person is convicted in Singapore of
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    any offence under section 157 or
                                339,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the court may make a disqualification order in addition to any other
                        sentence imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A person who is disqualified under subsection (1)
                            or who has had a disqualification order made against him under
                            subsection (2) shall not act as a director of a company or of a foreign
                            company to which Division 2 of Part XI applies nor shall he take part,
                            whether directly or indirectly, in the management of such a company or
                            foreign company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the District Court, the Appellant pleaded guilty and was fined
                    $4,000, in default four weeks’ imprisonment, and also disqualified from
                    managing the affairs of any company for a period of 12 months (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ong Chow Hong</em>
                    [2009] SGDC 387 (“the GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Nature of Disqualification of Directors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The District Judge (“DJ”)
                    proceeded on the basis that the objective of a disqualification order made under
                        s 154(2)(<em>b</em>) of the CA was
                        “<em>predominantly punitive in
                    nature</em>” [emphasis added] (see [44] of the GD). It was on that
                    basis that the DJ found a disqualification order appropriate. In fairness to
                    him, he had good reasons to adopt such an approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Pronouncements from different Singapore courts
                    to date had, with varying emphasis, sought to justify like orders on the basis
                    of either “punishment” or “protection”. In <em>Lim Teck Cheng v Attorney-General</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 223 (“<em>Lim Teck
                    Cheng</em>”) at [13],
                    Amarjeet Singh JC held that the disqualification provision was essentially
                    protective in nature. However, in the subsequent case of <em>Lee
                        Huay Kok v Attorney-General</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 287
                        (“<em>Lee Huay Kok</em>”) at [10], Choo Han Teck JC disagreed and held
                    that the disqualification order was essentially punitive in nature. Simply on
                    precedent alone, the DJ was not entirely incorrect to follow the
                    “punitive” line of authorities. This distinction was crucial as
                    the statutory objective informed the court on the applicable relevant
                    considerations when assessing the appropriateness and extent of a
                    disqualification order. The punitive rationale assumes that disqualification is
                    the law’s response to wrongdoing and ought to incorporate classical
                    sentencing principles such as retribution and proportionality. On the other
                    hand, the protective rationale focusses on prospective considerations that may
                    well be divorced from past culpability. With these conflicting authorities in
                    mind, the central issue was to clarify whether the subject disqualification was
                    pre-dominantly punitive or protective in nature. To resolve this, it would first
                    be useful to consider the history of the regime on the disqualification of
                    directors in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The genesis of the judicial power to
                    disqualify company directors was the United Kingdom (“the UK”)
                    companies’ legislation first enacted in 1928 (Companies Act 1928).
                    Although the statutory power to disqualify originated from the UK, the
                    architecture of the current scheme outlining the statutory duty of honesty and
                    reasonable diligence, as well as the automatic disqualification regime, was
                    sired by the 1961 Victorian Companies Act (No 6839 of 1961) in Australia.
                    This automatic disqualification regime was the primary influence of
                    Singapore’s initial disqualification regime when our Companies Act
                    (Act 42 of 1967) was enacted in 1967 (“the 1967 CA”). In so
                    far as the early provisions of the three jurisdictions were concerned, it was
                    not disputed that “protection” was the overarching object embedded
                    in the power to disqualify. Since the introduction of the 1967 CA, all three
                    jurisdictions have embarked on different regulatory paths. The question now was
                    whether “protection” was still the be all and end all of the
                    present disqualification regime. It seemed to me that the statutory developments
                    in the UK and Australian jurisdictions caused a move away from the original
                    conception of protection as the <em>predominant</em>
                    consideration for disqualification orders (in varying degrees). Some legal
                    archaeology is necessary to explain this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Parliament in the UK replaced the old
                    disqualification regime in their general companies’ legislation with a
                    specialised regime known as the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986
                    (c 46) (UK) (“CDDA”). The CDDA had a mandatory
                    disqualification provision under s 6 and discretionary disqualification
                    provisions such as ss 2 and 5. Section 6 of the CDDA was the UK
                    version of s 149 of our CA (disqualification of “unfit”
                    directors of insolvent companies). Most of the cases cited by the parties were
                    cases relating to s 6 of the CDDA as it was the most frequently invoked
                    avenue for disqualification in the UK. The UK cases interpreting s 6 of the
                    CDDA had expanded the considerations for disqualification orders beyond
                    protective purposes to include deterrence and punitive considerations. In
                        <em>In re Grayan Building Services Ltd. (In
                        Liquidation)</em> [1995] Ch 241 (“<em>Re Grayan</em>”), disqualification of “unfit”
                    directors of insolvent companies was imposed on the basis of past misconduct,
                    even in the face of present suitability. Lord Hoffman in <em>Re Grayan</em> (at 253), expressed objectives of general deterrence,
                    in his view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of making disqualification mandatory was to ensure that
                        everyone whose conduct had fallen below the appropriate standard was
                        disqualified for at least two years, whether in the individual case the
                        court thought that this was necessary in the public interest or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, even when there was no need for protection,
                    disqualification was imposed for deterrent purposes. Lord Woolf MR in
                        <em>Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Griffiths
                        &amp; Ors (No 2), Re Westmid Packaging Services Ltd
                        (No 3)</em> [1998] B.C.C. 836 at 843 also expressed punitive
                    considerations for disqualification under s 6, stating that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Despite the fact that the courts have said disqualification is not a
                        ‘punishment’, in truth the exercise that is being engaged in is
                        little different from any sentencing exercise. The period of
                        disqualification must reflect the gravity of the offence. It must contain
                        deterrent elements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As s 6 placed greater emphasis on the director’s <em>past conduct</em>, this may have led to an increase in
                    importance in <em>punitive</em> considerations rather than
                    the historically predominant consideration of protection (which takes a more
                    prospective perspective) (see the application of retributive considerations in
                        <em>Re Crestjoy Products Ltd</em> [1990] BCC 677 and
                    disqualification as a means of deterrence in <em>Re Morija
                        plc</em> [2008] 2 BCLC 313 at 323). However, while there may have
                    been a shift towards greater consideration of <em>deterrence</em> and <em>punitive</em>
                    considerations, it was expressed in Adrian Walters and Malcolm Davis-White,
                        <em>Directors’ Disqualification &amp; Insolvency
                        Restrictions</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        3rd<sup> </sup>Ed, 2010) at p 45 that
                        “<em>the authorities (and in particular, those on CDDA
                        ss.6 and 8) suggest there is a judicial consensus in favour of the view that
                        disqualification is primarily protective rather than
                    penal</em>” [emphasis added]. This protective view was expressed in
                        <em>In Re Sevenoaks Stationers (Retail) Ltd</em>.
                    [1991] Ch 164, the first appeal against a disqualification order under
                    s 6 of the CDDA. The Court of Appeal held (at 176) that it was
                    “beyond dispute that the purpose of section 6 is to <em>protect the public”</em> [emphasis added]. Therefore,
                    while the disqualification regime in UK expanded its considerations to include
                        <em>deterrent</em> and <em>punitive</em> considerations, it had not shifted entirely from its
                    historically protective objective. The shift in Australia as described below has
                    been more pronounced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Under the current Australian Corporations Act
                    2001, besides the established statutory grounds for disqualification (<em>eg</em>, persistent breaches of statutory requirements),
                    disqualification is used uniquely in Australia as a civil penalty. This
                    “civil penalty” regime was implemented under the Corporate Law
                    Reform Act 1992 (No 210 of 1992) as a way to sanction misconduct of
                    directors even where the conduct fell short of a criminal offence (see
                    Australian Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs,
                        <em>Company Directors’ Duties – Report on the
                        Social and Fiduciary Duties and Obligations of Company Directors</em>
                    (November 1989)). Thus in Australia, the introduction of civil penalty
                    provisions had notably infused into its disqualification regime some degree of
                    punitive considerations. The High Court of Australia in <em>Rich
                        and Another v Australian Securities and Investments Commission</em>
                    (2004) 50 ACSR 242 (“<em>Rich v
                        ASIC”)</em> broadly equated the applicable considerations for
                    disqualification in the civil penalty regime with those in the criminal
                    sentencing context. <em>Rich v ASIC</em> recognised that
                    the disqualification regime was <em>not purely
                        protective</em> (at [52]), and that retribution was as much a factor
                    as the protection of the public (at [56]). However, one must be cautious in
                    importing the Australian cases under the “civil penalty” regime
                    which places more emphasis on punitive considerations such as retribution and
                    deterrence <em>entirely</em> into our local context. As a
                    statutory replacement for criminal sanctions, civil penalty disqualifications
                    were accordingly intended to provide a reduced form of
                    “punishment” – hence it was natural for the Australian
                    courts to articulate punitive objects underlying disqualification orders (see
                        <em>Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v
                        White</em> [2006] VSC 239 at 265 and 272).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It therefore appears that while protective
                    considerations remained relevant in Australia and the UK, the power to
                    disqualify directors had expanded to accommodate various additional policy
                    interests since 1928. While Singapore’s disqualification regime may have
                    originated from Australia and was influenced by developments in the UK, it is
                    clear that the modern statutory developments in Australia and the UK have led to
                    a difference in emphasis in the considerations underlying their respective
                    disqualification regimes. I have mentioned some of these developments in
                    Australia and the UK to underscore and explain why our courts should be slow to
                    apply, without qualification, case law from these jurisdictions. While I
                    accepted that the experience in those jurisdictions were helpful, they now have
                    to be evaluated with reference to the structure of the disqualification
                    provisions and the context of corporate governance in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In Singapore, the amendments in 1993 via
                    Companies (Amendment) Act (Act 22 of 1993) (the “1993
                    amendments”) remodelled the earlier rigid automatic disqualification
                    regime into our present discretionary regime. Pre-1993, a director was
                    automatically disqualified when he was either found guilty of breaching his
                    statutory duty or committing an offence touching upon fraud or dishonesty. That
                    changed in 1993 when the legislature adopted a bifurcated approach of having a
                    discretionary disqualification regime for breaches of statutory duties, and an
                    automatic disqualification regime for offences concerning fraud and dishonesty.
                    Notwithstanding this change, the judicial pronouncements in pre-1993 cases
                    remain instructive where the broader nature and purpose of disqualification is
                    concerned. In other words, the general judicial policy pertaining to
                    disqualification has not changed after the 1993 amendments since the factors
                    used in arriving at the decision of whether to grant leave to manage a company
                    after the automatic disqualification (pre-1993) are generally similar to those
                    used in arriving at the decision to disqualify (post-1993). In my view, the 1993
                    amendments which introduced a discretionary element in the disqualification
                    regime were not intended to detract from the predominantly protective purpose of
                    s 154 as it was originally enacted in 1967.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the case of <em>Huang Sheng
                        Chang and others v Attorney-General</em>
                    [1983–1984] SLR(R) 182 at [38], Wee Chong Jin CJ stated
                    that the court, in exercising its discretion whether to grant leave to manage a
                    company after the automatic disqualification, ought to consider:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the nature of the offence of which the applicant
                            has been convicted;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the nature of the applicant's
                        involvement;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the applicant's general character;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the structure and the nature of the business of
                            each of the companies which the applicant seeks the leave of the court
                            to become a director of or to take part in its management;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    the interests of the general public, the
                            shareholders, creditors and employees of these companies and the risks
                            to the public and to those persons should the applicant be permitted to
                            be a director or to take part in management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These factors were later cited with approval by the Privy Council
                    in <em>Quek Leng Chye and another v Attorney-General</em>
                    [1985–1986] SLR(R) 282, and followed (after the 1993 amendments)
                    in <em>Lim Teck Cheng</em>. In all three cases, it was
                    rather clear from the considerations set out that our regime was pre-dominantly
                    protective in nature. In my view, the above factors remain relevant in the
                    present regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, in a later case of <em>Lee Huay Kok</em>, there was a departure from this protective aspect
                    of disqualification. Pausing, it bears mention that while both <em>Lim Teck Cheng</em> and <em>Lee Huay
                        Kok</em> involved automatic disqualification of persons convicted of
                    any offence involving fraud or dishonesty, the principles were equally
                    applicable to the discretionary regime under s 154(2)(<em>b</em>). In <em>Lee Huay Kok</em>, Choo Han
                    Teck JC (“the JC”) dismissed the application, and in doing
                    so, found that the disqualification regime under s 154 was punitive in
                    nature. The JC stated (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are some who are of the view that disqualification under s 154 is
                        not a punitive provision but a "protective" measure. I must respectfully
                        disagree. I think that there is a strong, if not predominant, punitive
                        element in the disqualification provision. Whether it is punitive or
                        protective is relevant when the issue of reducing the period comes before
                        the court. If it were a “protective” provision, then in
                        principle, a reduction of the disqualification period would be justified
                        when it can be shown that the protection objective is met or has been
                        satisfied, but it is not entirely clear what interest is being protected
                        here. In this case, for example, the company in which the applicant wishes
                        to participate as a director and manager is his own personal company. It is
                        virtually a sole proprietorship. What needs protection here? When will
                        protection cease to be required, and why? It cannot be at an arbitrary fixed
                        period whether at five years, or three, or ten. Similarly, if it was
                        intended to protect those who may have to deal with the convicted person, in
                        principle, there may be adequate protection if the court is satisfied that
                        there is a layer of supervision overseeing the acts of that person. If that
                        were so, it requires a more explicit expression in the wording of
                        s 154. <em>In my view, the context of this section
                            implies that the intention of Parliament was to inflict a period of
                            disqualification as part of the punishment on such an
                            offender</em>. That there may be a measure of protection to the
                        public or shareholders of the company is but a natural corollary to the
                        disqualification. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, the learned JC departed from the original protective
                    basis, and in my view, this departure sits uneasily with the statutory structure
                    of the disqualification regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     An analysis of the statutory structure
                    fortifies the view that our disqualification regime is predominantly protective
                    in nature. Section 154 of the CA is only one of several provisions that
                    address the issue of disqualification. The other provisions includes
                    ss 148, 149, 149A, 155 and 155A of the CA. Certain key features of
                    s 154(2) of the CA strongly suggest that it was not intended to be
                    essentially punitive. First, its sister provision, s 154(1), quite
                    evidently was not intended as a means to impose criminal sanctions for the
                    underlying criminal conduct. That provision imposes an automatic 5-year
                    disqualification period for offences concerning fraud or dishonesty, regardless
                    of the circumstances attending the offence or, significantly, the location of
                    the offence. The inclusion of foreign convictions militated against
                    disqualification being intended as a form of criminal punishment for the
                    underlying offence. The rationale behind s 154(1) ought logically be that
                    the individual’s fraudulent or dishonest conduct was <em>prima facie</em> evidence of his or her suitability of being a
                    director, thereby justifying the automatic restraint. Second, the available
                    alternative of securing s 154(2) orders through subsequent <em>civil</em> proceedings (see s 154(6)) indicated that
                    such orders were not inherently punitive in nature. These applications, which
                    are to be heard in a civil court, suggest that s 154(2) orders were not
                    intended to form part of the criminal sanctions imposed for the underlying
                    offences stated in ss 154(2)(<em>a</em>) and
                        (<em>b</em>). The availability of analogue civil
                    procedures is a cogent reason to support the view that s 154(2) orders are
                        <em>collateral protective orders</em> independent of
                    the punishment imposed for the primary offence. The statutory policy therefore
                    appears to be that disqualification orders ought to be generally imposed to
                    protect the public from individuals who are shown to be unworthy of being
                    privileged with the protective shield of corporate autonomy. In other words, the
                    disqualification regime serves to protect the public from abuses of the limited
                    liability privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Given the above local jurisprudence up until
                        <em>Lee Huay Kok</em> and the statutory structure of
                    the disqualification regime, I am therefore of the opinion that the
                    disqualification regime in Singapore remains essentially protective in
                    nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This shield of protection, however, has two
                    sides to it. On one hand, the public ought to be protected from an individual
                    who has failed to discharge his obligations <em>qua</em>
                    director. This side of protection may be viewed as specific protection, or what
                    I would prefer to term as the “<em>thin</em>”
                    definition of protection. To date, case law in Singapore appeared to have been
                    largely focused on this narrower aspect of protection as being the <em>only</em> appropriate consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the other hand, there is another side of
                    protection that has been overlooked. This side is equally, if not even more,
                    significant in some matters, particularly those involving listed companies. This
                    is the need to generally protect the public from all errant directors by an
                    uncompromising reaffirmation of the expected exemplary standards of corporate
                    governance. As the then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Loong,
                    highlighted during the second reading of the Securities and Futures Bill, the
                    domestic shift from merit-based regulation to a disclosure-based regime
                    “demands an effective market enforcement regime” which ensured
                    that “[a]ny transgressions must be swiftly and firmly dealt with, in
                    order to preserve investor confidence in Singapore’s capital
                    markets” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (5 October 2001) vol 73 at
                    col 2135 (BG Lee Hsien Loong, Deputy Prime Minister)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Therefore, given the disclosure-based regime,
                    there is a corollary need for the courts to ensure the accuracy of market
                    disclosures to the public. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi
                        Able</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 1082 at [1], I remarked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like a delicately-balanced spinning gyroscope, the equilibrium of the
                        financial market is pivoted upon the reliability and integrity of market
                        communications. Further, given the disclosure-based nature of our securities
                        market regime ..., the burden of maintaining market integrity by monitoring
                        and ensuring the security of investments no longer rests on regulatory
                        bodies; instead it has substantially shifted to market participants who are
                        expected to follow the rules of responsible market conduct and
                        communications so that other interested participants may access and act
                        confidently on all available information. It is therefore imperative that
                        all market players comply with requirements relating to both the quality and
                        quantity of information disclosed - not only must such information be
                        adequate, it must also be <em>accurate</em>. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This form of protection of the public is expressed through the
                    appropriate calibration of disqualification orders assessed to be sufficient to
                    deter serious lapses in corporate behaviour. I would characterise this as the
                        “<em>thick</em>” definition of
                    protection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     These two notions of specific and general
                    protection are therefore not mutually exclusive and, indeed, are often
                    intertwined. Accordingly, precedents on disqualification orders of directors
                    that do not acknowledge these Janus-like considerations of protection ought to
                    be viewed warily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With the objective of disqualification orders
                    clarified, I now turn back to the appeals before me. Given my views, it
                    therefore followed that the DJ erred as a matter of law when he proceeded on the
                    wrong footing that the disqualification scheme is essentially punitive and
                    failed to consider the wider public interests that ought to be taken into
                    account. Consequently, he had given undue consideration to the standing of the
                    Appellant since, in the context of the protective objective of the
                    disqualification regime, the Appellant’s good standing had only a
                    penumbral significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appropriate sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     It must have been obvious to any competent
                    director that the response required by SGX was of grave importance to Airocean.
                    All directors had to discharge an obligation of utmost candour to the
                    shareholders and other stakeholders of Airocean. It was perhaps important to
                    note that the gravamen of the charge was that the Appellant consciously
                    abdicated from his responsibilities; he never asked to see the draft
                    announcement before it was released to the public, and he was quite content to
                    delegate his responsibilities to another director. Moreover, he was either
                    indifferent to his wider responsibilities or failed to appreciate
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Appellant, I note, had sought to downplay
                    his role and knowledge of the material facts. He argued that he did not have
                    sufficient knowledge or understanding of the gravity of the investigations
                    against Thomas Tay and subsequently asserted that he did not want to cause
                    “unnecessary delay” to the making of the announcement. The
                    Prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that the Appellant knew about the
                    gravity of the matter, but deliberately chose to “cop out” when it
                    most mattered. I was inclined to think that in the final analysis, while it may
                    be an overstatement to say that the Appellant intentionally “copped
                    out”, this difference in characterising the facts was of slight
                    consequence. The Appellant, it cannot be gainsaid, had committed nothing short
                    of a serious lapse in entirely abdicating his corporate responsibilities. My
                    reasons were as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     First, I did not accept that the Appellant
                    failed to grasp the reality of the difficult decisions faced by Airocean on
                    8 September 2005. The minutes recorded during the Board meeting were as
                    striking for what they stated, as much as for what they did not state. The
                    Appellant was informed unambiguously that Thomas Tay, the Chief Executive
                    Officer of Airocean, was under investigation for corruption. If the
                    investigation was trivial or did not involve Thomas Tay as suggested by the
                    Appellant, why would Thomas Tay’s passport be impounded and why did he
                    have to spend 36 hours being probed? He surely had not been invited for a
                    friendly business discussion over afternoon tea.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The seriousness of the corruption allegations
                    provided the important context in which the Appellant breached his statutory
                    duty on 25 November 2005. In my view, the minutes recorded during the
                    Board meeting should have put him on heightened vigilance, and on the facts of
                    this case, the Appellant was thoroughly informed of the gravity of the
                    circumstances. To suggest any ignorance or any perception that the events were
                    of minute importance, were to me, at the very least, divorced from reality. The
                    urgency in convening the Board meeting on 8 September 2005 was a palpable
                    indication of the dark clouds encircling the company. Furthermore, even if I
                    were to accept that the Appellant was under a mistaken apprehension of the
                    severity of the circumstances (which I did not), such a fact in my view would be
                    a contention that worked against the Appellant. If he could not even perceive
                    the severity in such palpable circumstances, it seemed to me that he should all
                    the more be kept away from such directorship positions where perceptive
                    judgments are fundamental.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Second, even if the Appellant was immediately
                    engaged and/or could not assist in the substantive drafting of the announcement,
                    he ought to have insisted on having sight of the final draft of the public
                    announcement. At the very minimum, he could have vetted and approved the final
                    announcement after the conclusion of his golf flight, before it was released. It
                    bore mention that the announcement was eventually only released at 8.00 pm that
                    night. Furthermore, the length of the draft announcement was extremely short and
                    it would have at most taken him about ten minutes to read, comment or approve
                    the announcement. Even if he did not have a mobile device that allowed him to
                    personally read the draft, the company secretary could very well have read the
                    announcement to him. Considering the circumstances, there was an abundance of
                    time and opportunity for the Appellant to take a proactive involvement in the
                    release of the announcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     What aggravated the breach was the
                    Appellant’s clear knowledge of the circumstances leading up to the
                    announcement. The Appellant knew of the investigations against Thomas Tay when
                    he was briefed in the urgent Board meeting of 8 September 2005. With that
                    at the back of the mind, any doubts pertaining to the severity of the matter
                    would have been extinguished when the Straits Times ran a story on the
                    investigation and SGX thereafter sought clarification on that issue. It seemed
                    to me that the Appellant had unambiguously failed to appreciate the seriousness
                    of his corporate responsibilities when he adopted such a cavalier view of his
                    duties as a director. It was not an insignificant consideration that the
                    clarification was sought by no less than SGX, the body having supervisory
                    responsibilities over listed companies in Singapore. One would have thought that
                    any competent director would immediately comprehend the pressing urgency and
                    significance of such a query and the critical need to respond accurately and
                    promptly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Thirdly, it would have been imprudent to
                    accept the Appellant’s contention that he relied on another
                    director’s responsibility of handling the public announcement. In the
                    appeal, the Appellant contended that his breach of statutory duty could be
                    mitigated by the fact that the making of the public announcement was a legal
                    issue to be handled by the lawyers sitting on the Board. As a preliminary point,
                    I must be clear to point out that the court was not (in the appeal) looking at
                    the accuracy of the substantive content of the announcement. Obviously, if a
                    false or misleading announcement was made and if the Appellant had a hand in its
                    dissemination, he could have faced a more severe charge that the present one.
                    While I accept that there are of course limits to the extent of knowledge and
                    expertise a director may be expected to have, and that some reliance may be
                    placed on the advice given by professionals, each director of a listed company
                    has a solemn and non-delegable duty of due diligence to ensure compliance with
                    market rules and practices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Directors of listed companies in Singapore
                    have to appreciate that our present disclosure based regime requires accurate
                    and prompt disclosure to function effectively. It would never be sufficient or
                    acceptable for a director to say that he expected his co-directors to do
                    “right” by the company. Every director has to ensure that he
                    discharges his responsibilities with due diligence in <em>all</em> pertinent matters. Therefore, any reliance on professionals
                    or any reliance placed on “specialised” directors must be balanced
                    against the responsibility that the law placed upon every individual director to
                    bring to bear their own judgment in evaluating the advice received. Directors
                    cannot adopt a silo approach and invariably seek shelter behind other
                    “specialised” directors on the notion of reliance. How this
                    responsibility ought to be discharged in any particular case would be a question
                    of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the above grounds, I was satisfied that the
                    one-year disqualification order imposed by the DJ was manifestly inadequate.
                    While I acknowledged that the Appellant may be viewed as a valuable professional
                    to the community and the companies he had been involved in <em>qua</em> director, and I was even prepared to accept that this may
                    well be a one-off incident, the court must also appropriately calibrate the
                    punishment in order to deter similar irresponsible conduct. It ought to be made
                    plain that the courts will not be slow to disqualify directors for substantial
                    periods of time if and when it is established that there have been serious
                    lapses in the discharge of their responsibilities. The Appellant’s
                    baffling decision to bury his head in the sand was simply unacceptable. It was
                    therefore my judgment that the disqualification order be enhanced to 24 months.
                    It followed that the Appellant’s appeal had to be dismissed and the
                    Prosecution’s appeal allowed.</p>
