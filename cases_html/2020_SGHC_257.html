</div> In his award, the arbitrator found that the plaintiffs had made fraudulent misrepresentations to the defendants in order to induce the defendants to invest in a company. The arbitrator awarded the defendants substantial damages for the fraud, adopting as the measure of damages the sum necessary to restore the defendants to the position they would have been in if the plaintiffs had not fraudulently induced them to make the investment. He therefore awarded the defendants damages which were equivalent to the sums which the defendants had invested less the benefits which they had received by reason of the investment.

I shall refer to all four of these contracts collectively as “the contracts”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 There are three provisions in the RSA which are material to the present application. First, the RSA charges certain assets of the Company to the defendants as security for the plaintiffs’ obligations under that agreement and grants the defendants the accompanying right to appoint a receiver to take control of and realise those assets in an event of default. Second, the RSA provides expressly that it is governed by Singapore law.

</div> Finally, the RSA contains a tiered dispute-resolution clause which begins with an agreement to resolve disputes amicably and culminates in agreement to refer disputes to arbitration. The arbitration agreement provides that any arbitration is to be conducted before a sole arbitrator in Singapore and to be administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”).

The ground, briefly stated, is that the defendants invoked in their notice of arbitration only the arbitration agreement in the RSA. They did not invoke the separate arbitration agreements in the other three contracts between the parties: the IA, the SA and the RIA. But the defendants sought in the arbitration rescission not only of the RSA, but also of those other three contracts. Further, the arbitrator took as his starting point in awarding damages to the defendants a sum equal to their entire investment in the Company under all four of the contracts. But the defendants made only one tranche of their investment under the RSA. They made the remainder of their investment under the IA and the RIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The plaintiffs raised these very same points as a preliminary jurisdictional objection in the arbitration. The arbitrator rejected the objection in his award. He held that the plaintiffs had failed to take their jurisdictional objection in their statement of defence as required by Art 16(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”), given force of law by s 2(1) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed), and Rule 18.3 of the SIAC Rules 2016. He also held that there was no justification for the plaintiffs’ delay in taking the jurisdictional objection.

</div> The plaintiffs were thus denied a reasonable opportunity to address the arbitrator on whether the plaintiffs could, in principle, be held liable to the defendants in damages even though rescission was barred. The arbitrator breached the rules of natural justice on liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants’ response is as follows. The defendants included a general prayer for damages to be assessed at the conclusion of their statement of claim (see [46] below).

Even if the arbitrator did not breach natural justice in finding the plaintiffs liable to the defendants in damages, he denied the plaintiffs natural justice in assessing those damages. The defendants failed to plead the measure of their damages. They also failed to plead, particularise and prove the quantum of their damages. The plaintiffs were thus denied a reasonable opportunity to address the arbitrator on the measure and quantum of damages. The arbitrator breached the rules of natural justice on quantum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The defendants’ response is as follows. The measure of the defendants’ damages for the plaintiffs’ deceit was obvious: it was the sum necessary to put the defendants in the same position they would have been in if the tort had never been committed. Further, the defendants did adduce evidence on the quantum of damages, albeit for the purpose of proving other facts in issue in the arbitration.

In other words, the arbitrator went wrong by going beyond his holding at [22(e)] above. The plaintiffs submit that, on the parties’ cases as pleaded and presented to the arbitrator, he ought to have dismissed the defendants’ claim upon arriving at that holding in his chain of reasoning.

The claims pleaded in the defendant’s statement of claim encompassed the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation, the statutory tort of negligent misrepresentation inducing a contract under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), innocent misrepresentation under s 2(2) of the Act and the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</span> [1964] AC 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Paragraphs 193 and 194 of the statement of claim (see [38] above) expressly plead the claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Paragraph 195 of the statement of claim advances a claim sounding in damages for both statutory negligent misrepresentation and for innocent misrepresentation. That is because paragraph 195 expressly pleads a claim under s 2 of the Act. Section 2 of the Act creates two grounds of relief. By referring to s 2 of the Act generally, paragraph 195 therefore pleads a cause of action under each of s 2(1) and s 2(2). Section 2(1) of the Act creates a statutory cause of action for a negligent misrepresentation. That cause of action is available to a misrepresentee when a misrepresentor’s misrepresentation induces the misrepresentee to enter into a contract and without any need to establish a duty of care in tort. Section 2(2) allows a court to award damages for either a negligent or an innocent misrepresentation (see <span class="font-italic">RBC Properties Pte Ltd v Defu Furniture Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 997 (“<span class="font-italic">RBC Properties</span>”) at [67] per Andrew Phang JA; <span class="font-italic">Salt v Stratstone Specialist Ltd</span> [2015] EWCA Civ 745 (“<span class="font-italic">Salt v Stratstone</span>”) at [17] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Longmore LJ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Paragraph 205 pleads a claim in the common law tort of negligent misrepresentation under the principle in<span class="font-italic"> Hedley Byrne</span>.

</div> They submit that prayer (e) is just like prayer (c) and is therefore a prayer for relief <span class="font-italic">only</span> if rescission is granted under prayers (a) and (b). They point out that prayer (f) is the only prayer introduced by the word “Alternatively”. Prayer (e) is not qualified by the same word. The plaintiffs therefore submit that the natural reading of prayer (e) is that it is a claim for relief which is dependent upon rescission and not a claim for relief in the alternative to rescission.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Prayer (e) must be interpreted in context and not in isolation. Its context includes all the other prayers for relief in paragraph 206 of the statement of claim. In that context, it appears to me that the plaintiffs’ submission is wrong. That is because prayer (d) is unconnected to rescission. Prayer (d) is a claim for contractual interest due to the defendants under a specific clause of the RSA on the aggregate sum of $1,005,000 which the defendants lent to the plaintiffs after they entered into the RSA in an attempt to salvage their investment.

</div> That claim, framed as a contractual claim, can stand only if rescission is denied. That suggests to me that <span class="font-italic">only</span> prayer (c) is advanced as relief sought as a consequence of rescission and that prayers (d) onwards are not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 But it also seems to me that the context for interpreting prayer (e) is far wider than just the other prayers in paragraph 206. Prayer (e) must be read in the wider context of the entirety of the statement of claim as well as the notice of arbitration, the response to the notice of arbitration, the parties’ subsequent pleadings and, most importantly, the general law. It is now necessary, therefore, to state some propositions from the general law on the nature of rescission which form part of the wider context in which prayer (e) must be read.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On the nature of rescission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Rescission is the dissolution of a contract <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> on the ground that the apparent assent of a party to the contract is vitiated by one or more of the factors recognised by law. The remedy of rescission therefore vindicates the right of that party to withdraw his assent to the contract and to be restored to his pre-contractual position. The right is vindicated by reversing the exchange of benefits under the rescinded contract. This reversal must of necessity be bilateral. Rescission therefore necessarily entails restoring not only the rescinding party but also the <span class="font-italic">counterparty</span> to its pre-contractual position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Rescission is a remedy both at common law and in equity. Rescission is available at common law for a contract induced by misrepresentation. But common law rescission is available <span class="font-italic">only</span> if the contract is induced by fraudulent misrepresentation. Common law rescission is not available for contracts induced by any other variety of misrepresentation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, negligent or innocent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Like all common law remedies, rescission at common law is available as of right to every representee who can establish the prerequisites for its grant. A common law court has no discretion to withhold rescission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 One of the prerequisites for common law rescission is that it must be possible to effect precise and complete <span class="font-italic">restitu</span><span class="font-italic">tio in integrum</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a precise and complete reversal of the benefits exchanged under a rescinded contract. Even a precise and complete reversal, however, may not suffice to restore a misrepresentee to its pre-contractual position. That could happen, for example, if the misrepresentee has incurred expenses by paying money to third parties in order to perform its obligations under the rescinded contract. In that situation, the common law has the power to award the usual common law remedy of damages in addition to common law rescission. But if a misrepresentee cannot establish any of the prerequisites for common law rescission, including the ability to effect precise and complete <span class="font-italic">restitu</span><span class="font-italic">tio in integrum</span>, the claim for rescission must fail. The only remedy available then at common law is the usual remedy of damages <span class="font-italic">instead of </span>rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Even if a claim for rescission at common law fails, a claim for rescission in equity may yet be available. Equitable rescission is wider and more flexible than common law rescission. It is wider than common law rescission because it is available as a remedy for a contract induced by negligent and innocent misrepresentation, not just fraudulent misrepresentation. It is more flexible than common law rescission because it does not require precise and complete <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. It requires only substantial <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div> All that is required is that “practical justice” can be done in restoring the misrepresentee and misrepresentor to their pre-contractual positions (<span class="font-italic">Salt v Stratstone</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Equitable rescission may be supplemented by other equitable remedies as necessary to do justice between the parties. Thus, for example, equitable rescission may be supplemented by the taking of an account where that is necessary to reflect the benefits which a misrepresentee has received under the rescinded contract or the losses which a misrepresentor will suffer as a result of rescinding the contract. Equitable rescission can also be accompanied by an equitable indemnity to make a misrepresentee whole for the losses it has suffered or will suffer in the performance of its obligations under the rescinded contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Equity cannot, however, accompany rescission with an award of “damages” <span class="font-italic">stricto sensu</span>. Damages are solely a common law remedy. Equity cannot award damages save where expressly permitted by statute. For example, s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2013 Rev Ed) read with paragraph 14 of the First Schedule allows a court to award damages in lieu of an injunction or specific performance. An example more pertinent for present purposes is s 2(2) of the Act, which allows a court to award damages in addition to or in lieu of equitable rescission, but only for negligent or innocent misrepresentation. There is no general statutory power which permits equity to award damages in addition to or in lieu of equitable rescission and, in particular, for fraudulent misrepresentation. The pecuniary compensation which equity awards is not “damages” but “equitable compensation”. And even then, equity awards equitable compensation only for an equitable wrong such as a breach of fiduciary duty. Inducing a misrepresentee to enter into a contract may yield the remedy of rescission in equity but is not an equitable wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58  This historical anomaly creates no remedial gap, only a terminological gap. Our courts administer both law and equity concurrently and can therefore award every type of relief for misrepresentation, whether at common law or in equity, in every civil cause or matter (see s 3(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)). So it is indeed now possible for a misrepresentee to seek rescission and damages from the same court and in the same action. But it remains the case that equitable rescission and common law damages are two remedies which come from two different historical sources. The court invokes two separate jurisdictions to grant the two remedies and any associated remedies. To put it another way, equitable rescission can be accompanied only by other equitable relief. Common law rescission can be accompanied only by other common law relief. It is therefore only in a claim in fraudulent misrepresentation that a prayer which seeks both rescission and “damages” can seek them cumulatively. That is because only the common law can grant rescission in addition to “damages” <span class="font-italic">stricto </span><span class="font-italic">sensu</span> and because it is only for fraudulent misrepresentation that common law rescission is available. In all other cases, a prayer which seeks both rescission <span class="font-italic">and</span> “damages” must necessarily be seeking them as mutually exclusive alternatives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Equitable rescission is also more precarious than common law rescission. Unlike common law rescission, equitable rescission is a discretionary remedy. Even if all the prerequisites for equitable rescission are made out, the remedy may yet be denied on any of the grounds upon which equitable relief may generally be denied, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by applying the maxims that those who come to equity must come with clean hands or that those who seek equity must do equity. In addition, there are four specific situations in which equitable rescission will be barred when it is sought as a remedy for misrepresentation: (a) if the misrepresentee has affirmed the contract; (b) if substantial <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span> (in the sense of doing practical justice) is not possible; (c) if there has been an inordinate lapse of time; or (d) if <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> third parties have purchased rights for value in any property which would be affected by rescission.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis of the prayer in the statement of claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I now return to the prayers in the defendants’ statement of claim. Prayer (c), read in context, is certainly sought as a consequence of rescission. But even when prayer (e) is read in the context prayers (a) to (c), it is reasonably capable of being read as a claim for damages in the alternative, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, even if rescission is denied. I say that for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, prayer (e) is reasonably capable of being read as encompassing a claim for damages without rescission. The defendants’ statement of claim advances two claims, both of which sound in damages and both of which have no connection to rescission. These are the defendants’ alternative claims for negligent misrepresentation <span class="font-italic">outside</span> s 2 of the Act

</div> and for damages for breach of contract (see [39] above). There is no power at common law or in equity to award “damages” <span class="font-italic">in addition</span> to rescission for negligent misrepresentation outside s 2 of the Act. That is because at common law, damages can be awarded in addition to rescission only for <span class="font-italic">fraudulent</span> misrepresentation, not for non-fraudulent misrepresentation. And in equity, the monetary compensation which can be awarded in addition to rescission for negligent misrepresentation is not an award of “damages”, it is an “indemnity”. In short, the power to award “damages” for a negligent misrepresentation arises <span class="font-italic">only</span> either under s 2 of the Act, or at common law on the principle in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne </span>(see <span class="font-italic">RBC Properties</span> at [64]–[66] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Andrew Phang JA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Accordingly, prayer (e) cannot be read as a claim for monetary compensation in equity in addition to rescission in equity if the defendants can prove only negligent misrepresentation (otherwise, it would pray for an “indemnity”, not “damages”). It equally cannot be read as a statutory claim for damages under s 2 of the Act (since the statutory claim is covered by prayer (f)). The plaintiffs are therefore wrong to say without qualification that prayer (e) “covers consequential damages where the order for rescission does not fully compensate the representee”.

</div>
</div> A prayer for “damages” has that meaning only for fraudulent misrepresentation, the only type of claim for which the common law remedy of damages can accompany the common law remedy of rescission. Prayer (e) is therefore reasonably capable, at the very least, of encompassing damages for negligent misrepresentation <span class="font-italic">without</span> equitable rescission. To that extent, it is reasonably capable of being read as a claim for damages independent of rescission, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as an alternative to rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The statement of claim also advances a claim for breach of contract as an alternative to the defendants’ claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. Rescission is not a remedy for breach of contract. Indeed, seeking damages for breach of a contract and seeking rescission of the contract are mutually exclusive remedies. The defendants never abandoned their claim for breach of contract. As a result, the arbitrator had to deal with the claim in contract in his award (see [22(n)] above).

</div>
</div>
</div> There is no other prayer in paragraph 206 which could possibly be read as seeking damages on the defendants’ claim in contract. Prayer (e) is therefore reasonably capable, at the very least, of encompassing damages for breach of contract. To that extent also, it is reasonably capable of being read as a claim for damages independent of rescission, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as an alternative to rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Second, an award of “damages” with or without rescission is a possibility in every misrepresentation claim. Rescission may be denied both at common law and in equity. When rescission is denied, a misrepresentee can recover “damages” <span class="font-italic">stricto sensu</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as opposed to an equitable indemnity) only: (a) in the tort of deceit for fraudulent misrepresentation; (b) under the principle in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span> for negligent misrepresentation; or (c) under s 2(1) of the Act for negligent misrepresentation. Against this context, the plain wording of prayer (e) is broad. It is not qualified by any express link to rescission. It is reasonably capable on its face of being read as a claim for damages for misrepresentation independent of rescission, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as an alternative to rescission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 This conclusion is buttressed by two general points. First, the burden to plead and prove that equitable rescission is barred rests on the misrepresentor, not on the misrepresentee (<span class="font-italic">Salt v Stratstone</span> at [25]). A misrepresentee therefore has no way of knowing, when it frames its pleadings, whether the misrepresentor will or will not plead a bar to rescission. Any rational and well-advised misrepresentee will therefore frame its pleadings in order to maximise its ability to succeed in its claim, whatever defences the misrepresentor might choose to plead in response. Second, I am mindful of the principle (which the plaintiffs themselves accept) that pleadings in arbitration should not be read as strictly or as technically as pleadings in litigation are.

In my view, prayer (e) can reasonably be read as a claim for damages at large, to be assessed for breach of contract or for any of the varieties of misrepresentation which can yield damages without rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As matters stood at the date of the statement of claim, therefore, I hold that prayer (e) was reasonably capable of being read as a claim for damages to be assessed in any of the following events: (a) if the defendants succeed in their claim for breach of contract; (b) if the defendants succeed in their claim for fraudulent misrepresentation and rescission is granted; (c) if the defendants succeed in their claim for fraudulent misrepresentation and rescission is denied; and (d) if the defendants succeed in their claim for negligent misrepresentation under the principle in <span class="font-italic">Hedley </span>Byrne. Of course, the defendants were not obliged to pursue every one of these claims. But they had pleaded their case sufficiently widely that they retained the ability to pursue any of these claims if they chose to, obviously within the procedural bounds of the arbitration. To put it another way, if they were precluded from pursuing any of these claims, it would not be because the wording of their pleadings was too narrow to permit it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The statement of defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The plaintiffs’ statement of defence advances a defence only to the defendants’ substantive claim.

RIA and RSA having been affirmed subsequent to notice of the alleged misrepresentations inasmuch as rights over charged assets have been exercised by the [defendants];</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">b.

The plaintiffs also had never before raised the remedial defence informally, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in their response to the notice of arbitration, in their list of issues, in their witness statements or even simply in correspondence either with the arbitrator or the defendants. The plaintiffs were, however, clearly determined to pursue the new remedial defence at the evidential hearing scheduled to begin in a week’s time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The arbitrator had three choices open to him. His first choice was to require the plaintiffs to amend their statement of defence to plead formally the new remedial defence. But that would have required permitting the defendants to amend their reply to respond to the new defence. That would in turn have required permitting the plaintiffs to file a rejoinder so that they could have the final plea on a defence on which they bore the burden of proof. That would also have required reopening discovery and directing the parties to exchange supplemental witness statements on the new factual issues which the remedial defence raised. The evidential hearing would also in all likelihood have to be postponed, with all of the attendant cost, delay and inconvenience to the parties and to their witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The arbitrator’s second choice was to shut the plaintiffs out from pursuing the remedial defence entirely. But the defendants were not asking the arbitrator to do that. The defendants gave every indication that they were happy to deal with the remedial defence on the merits. In any event, shutting out the plaintiffs would have deprived the plaintiffs of a remedial defence on which they appeared to have a good case, and on which they indeed ultimately succeeded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The arbitrator’s third choice was to allow the plaintiffs to raise the remedial defence informally and to allow the defendants to respond to it informally, without postponing the evidential hearing. This is the approach which the arbitrator adopted, in the absence of any request to the contrary by either party. The plaintiffs were content to proceed in this way without any procedural accommodation. At this point, if anyone could have complained about a breach of natural justice arising from the plaintiffs raising the remedial defence at short notice and informally, it would have been the defendants. But the defendants too were content to proceed in this way. They did not ask for leave to amend their reply, to reopen discovery, to supplement their witness statements or to postpone the evidential hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 From this point forward, the plaintiffs adopted the remedial defence as an integral part of their response to the defendants’ case. The plaintiffs did not require the defendants to amend their pleadings to take a position as to what should happen to the defendants’ claim in misrepresentation if the remedial defence succeeded. The plaintiffs were content to proceed without knowing whether the defendants agreed that the defendants’ claim should fail entirely if the remedial defences succeeded. If the plaintiffs were now proceeding blind, this was ultimately the result of the plaintiffs’ own belated decision to raise the remedial defence at short notice and informally. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">This was a new point, not merely a responsive point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiffs submit that they raised the remedial defence in their opening statement for the first time only because the defendants “sneakily” revealed to the plaintiffs in two paragraphs of a witness statement for the first time that the defendants had appointed receivers under the RSA who had sold the Company’s charged assets and paid $618,312.30 over to the defendants.

The purpose of these paragraphs is twofold. The first purpose is simply to recount as part of the factual background the events which occurred after the parties’ dispute arose. These paragraphs are thus the concluding paragraphs under the heading “Dispute Conciliation Proceedings and the Appointment of Receivers” in the witness statement.

</div>
</div> The second purpose is to disclose to the arbitrator a benefit which the defendants had received under the contract. The defendants thereby signalled to the arbitrator and to the plaintiffs that the defendants were prepared to bring that benefit into account in if rescission were granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As a matter of law, the burden to plead and prove that rescission is barred rests on the misrepresentor, not on the misrepresentee (<span class="font-italic">Salt v Stratstone</span> at [25]). It was therefore for the plaintiffs to plead and prove this remedial defence, not for the defendants pre-emptively to plead and disprove it. I assume in favour of the plaintiffs that they did not know the factual basis for raising pleading affirmation as a remedial defence until they read this witness statement. Even then, however, the plaintiffs never pleaded that rescission was barred by affirmation. All they did was to raise affirmation in this informal way in their opening statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The most that can be said about a connection between these two paragraphs of the witness statement and the plaintiffs’ remedial defence is that the two paragraphs disclosed facts to the plaintiffs for the first time which allowed the plaintiffs to raise the defence. But what the plaintiffs did upon learning these facts was entirely up to them. They were not obliged to raise the defence. And if they chose to do so, they were not obliged to raise the defence informally, through only the opening statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In fact, what the plaintiffs did went well beyond simply raising affirmation as an issue. What they did was to raise all three of the bars to rescission as a remedial defence in the arbitration, not just the one bar plausibly disclosed by the witness statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The purposes of these two paragraphs in the defendants’ witness statement are entirely unconnected to adopting affirmation as part of the defendants’ positive and pre-emptive case in the arbitration. The remedial defence raised is in large part unconnected to the facts disclosed in the witness statement. The plaintiffs’ position that they raised the remedial defence purely in response to the defendants’ witness statement is disingenuous to say the least. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The significance of paragraph 21</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The remedial defence which the plaintiffs raised in paragraph 21 of their opening statement (see [79] above) is significant. It could not and did not, of course, change the text of the defendants’ pleadings. But paragraph 21 of the plaintiffs’ opening statement could and did change radically the context in which the defendants’ pleadings were now to be read. The context of the defendants’ pleadings was not set in aspic. This new context shed a whole new light on the prayers for relief in the statement of claim, and in particular prayer (e). Read in this new context, what was latent in prayer (e) became patent. The remedial defence engaged and enlivened the full scope of the meaning of prayer (e). Until then, prayer (e) was only <span class="font-italic">capable</span> of advancing a claim for damages even if rescission was barred. Now, read in context, prayer (e) <span class="font-italic">did</span> advance that claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 To put it another way, if the plaintiffs had applied for leave to amend their statement of defence to plead the remedial defence as part of their formal case in the arbitration, they would almost certainly have been granted it, subject of course to the usual costs consequences. The defendants would then have been permitted to make consequential amendments to their statement of claim and to their reply. The statement of claim would not have required amendment. The defendants would still have no reason to pre-empt the remedial defence by introducing a new plea in their statement of claim. A statement of claim is forensically anterior to a statement of defence and is not expected to respond to an issue on which a claimant bears no burden of proof. The only appropriate place for a response would be in the defendants’ reply. But, as far as relief was concerned, the plaintiffs’ reply had already expressly pleaded and restated all the prayers set out in paragraph 206 of the statement of claim.

</div> That included in prayer (e) the general prayer for damages to be assessed. The defendants could therefore have responded to the plaintiffs’ hypothetical amendment without amending their existing pleadings at all, taking the position that those pleadings were sufficiently wide without amendment to encompass a claim for damages even rescission was barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 So too, the plaintiffs’ remedial defence enlivened the full scope of the meaning that issues 24 and 25 of the defendants’ list of issues (see [72] above) and issue 4 of the plaintiffs’ list of issues (see [73] above) were capable of bearing. In the new context, these issues now raised squarely the question whether the arbitrator could award damages even if rescission was barred. Contrary to the plaintiffs’ assertion,

</div> that question was now very much in play. And it was in play not because of any act of the arbitrator or of the defendants.

DAMAGES IN LIEU OF RESCISSION</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ISSUE NO.4 IN [DEFENDANTS’] CLOSING SUBMISSIONS)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25.  It is important to mention at the outset that the [defendants] have offered no rebuttal in their Closing Submissions to the bars to rescission pleaded by the Respondents in its Opening Statement before this Hon’ble Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26.  Insofar as the issue of damages in lieu of rescission is concerned, the [defendants] have now after the conclusion of the hearing attempted to set up an entirely new case: (i) which has never been pleaded or quantified before, (ii) with respect to which no supporting material or documents have been supplied, and (iii) which has not even been tested in evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The transition from paragraph 25 to paragraph 26 shows that the argument which the plaintiffs were now raising as to what should happen if the arbitrator found rescission to be barred was that the plaintiffs had failed properly to plead, quantify and prove their loss and damage. This implicitly accepts that it is open to the arbitrator to award damages in the alternative to rescission. But, to be fair to the plaintiffs, they did not abandon the argument of law raised in their principal closing submissions (see [107] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The plaintiffs’ closing submissions were therefore advancing two alternative arguments to meet the defendants’ claim for damages in the absence of rescission: (a) a legal argument that, if rescission was barred, an alternative claim for damages to achieve the same economic result as rescission was equally barred; and (b) a procedural or evidential argument that the defendants had failed to plead, quantify and prove their loss and damage. The important point is that the plaintiffs did not even suggest, let alone allege, that they had not been given reasonable notice of the defendants’ case that the defendants were entitled to damages if rescission was denied, or a reasonable opportunity of being heard on that aspect of the defendants’ case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I find it impossible to identify any failure by the arbitrator or any link in the arbitrator’s chain of reasoning in his award which could conceivably amount to a breach of natural justice on the issue of the plaintiffs’ liability in damages to the defendants if rescission was denied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Formally, the defendants pleaded a substantive claim in fraud with a prayer for consequential relief seeking rescission and damages. The defendants’ prayer was wide enough to cover a claim for damages both <span class="font-italic">in addition to </span>rescission (if rescission was granted) and <span class="font-italic">instead of</span> rescission (if rescission was denied). The plaintiffs bore the burden of pleading and proving a bar to rescission as a remedial defence. But the plaintiffs pleaded only that the defendants were not entitled to any relief at all, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only a substantive defence. They did not plead a remedial defence even as an alternative. As a result, the defendants chose never to put in play formally in the arbitration the issue of what should happen remedially if the defendants succeeded on fraud but failed on rescission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The formal position at the close of pleadings therefore was that rescission would follow as a matter of course if the defendants established fraud. The only issue on remedies which was in play was the mechanics of rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Informally, however, the plaintiffs did put in play the issue of what should happen remedially if the defendants succeeded on fraud but failed on rescission. They did this when they served their opening statement raising the remedial defence for the first time. Neither the arbitrator nor the defendants required the plaintiffs to amend their statement of defence to plead this defence, whether before or after serving the opening statement. Neither the arbitrator nor the plaintiffs required the defendants to amend their statement of claim or reply to plead a response. Both parties and the arbitrator proceeded to and through the evidential hearing on the basis that the defendants had reasonable notice of this remedial defence without need for amendment. They proceeded also on the basis that the plaintiffs had reasonable notice of the defendants’ position in response without need for amendment. The plaintiffs put the remedial defence in play knowing that the evidential hearing was not bifurcated. They thus knew that they were expected to and obliged to bring forward their entire case on liability and quantum, including all consequential issues arising from their remedial defence, at the evidential hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The forensic consequence of the plaintiffs being permitted to put the issue of whether rescission was barred in play in their opening statement was that, from that time forward, both parties were aware that rescission no longer followed as a matter of course if the defendants succeeded in establishing fraud. But what would then happen if the defendants’ claim for rescission failed? Would the defendants’ alternative claim for damages fail too? This consequential question was now in play. It was in play not just informally and not just because of the plaintiffs’ opening statement. It was in play formally upon any reasonable reading of the defendants’ statement of claim and reply and of both parties’ lists of issues in the context of the plaintiffs’ opening statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The arbitrator appreciated that this question was now in play. That is why he asked the defendants expressly on the first day of the evidential hearing to state their position on it. The defendants expressly stated that their position was that the claim for damages did not stand or fall together with rescission because they were seeking an award of damages in the alternative to rescission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 No reasonable party in the plaintiffs’ position could complain that this question being in play or the position that the defendants took upon on it in response took them by surprise. I say that for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 First, a party who raises an issue cannot possibly or plausibly claim to be surprised by the opponent taking a position in response to the issue which arises naturally and obviously from it. To put it another way, the plaintiffs cannot claim that they believed, when they raised the remedial defence that rescission was barred, that the defendants simply accepted that a bar to rescission was a complete defence to their claim, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it must follow as a matter of course that the defendants’ claim in fraudulent misrepresentation must be dismissed and the defendants must be denied relief entirely if rescission was barred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Second, the defendants’ position in response to the remedial defence was not only the natural and obvious position, it was one which they were entitled formally to pursue on a reasonable reading of their pleadings and the parties’ lists of issues in the new context supplied by the plaintiffs’ opening statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Third, whether a party is given reasonable notice of a natural and obvious responsive position taken by an opponent must, in large part, be measured against the reasonableness of the notice which that party itself gave to its opponent of the issue to which the opponent is now responding. By that measure, the defendants gave the plaintiffs reasonable notice of their position, measure for measure. This is especially the case if one bears in mind that it was still open to the plaintiffs when the defendants stated their position on this question (see [95] above) to seek an adjournment of the evidential hearing to consider how to deal with it. To put it another way, a party who springs an issue informally and at short notice on its opponent must expect that the opponent’s natural and obvious response on that issue will come back equally informally and at equally short notice. When that happens, the first party cannot complain that it was not given reasonable notice of the opponent’s response or that it was unable to present its case on the response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In any event, the plaintiffs’ reaction to the defendants’ position on this question shows that they were not, in fact, taken by surprise at all. When the arbitrator asked the plaintiffs to respond to the defendants’ position, the plaintiffs took no objection, whether as to informality or short notice. They simply restated their fundamental jurisdictional objection to the defendants’ claim (see [96] above). And the plaintiffs were content immediately and without objection to commence the evidential hearing and to cross-examine the defendants’ witnesses. That is not how a party taken by surprise by the defendants’ position would have behaved. A party taken by surprise would have objected both to being taken by surprise and also to being expected to commence the evidential hearing immediately after being taken by surprise. A party taken by surprise would have asked for an adjournment in order to reconsider the sufficiency of the evidence and of its cross-examination plan and to reframe the witness statements of its own witnesses and its cross-examination plan for the opponent’s witnesses. Yet the plaintiffs commenced and completed the evidential hearing without objection or hesitation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The defendants’ principal closing submissions continued to maintain a claim for damages even if rescission was denied. They cited textbooks establishing that a claimant in an action for fraudulent misrepresentation was entitled to recover damages in the alternative to rescission. They relied on a leading English authority, <span class="font-italic">Smith New Court</span>, in which a victim of a fraudulent misrepresentation had abandoned a claim for rescission yet was awarded damages in the tort of deceit as an alternative remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The plaintiffs understood that the defendants were advancing a claim for damages even if rescission was barred. And they responded to the claim in both sets of closing written submissions. The plaintiffs made clear in their principal closing submissions that their response was that, if rescission was barred, an award of damages to achieve the economic equivalent of rescission was equally barred as a matter of law. The plaintiffs’ responsive closing submissions advanced an alternative procedural or evidential argument: that the defendants had failed to plead, quantify and prove their damages claim in the alternative to rescission. The plaintiffs did not allege anywhere in either their principal closing submissions or their responsive closing submissions that they were in any way taken by surprise by the defendants’ alternative claim for damages in the event rescission was denied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 There is of course no doctrine of estoppel, let alone of turnabout being fair play or sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander, which precludes a party from complaining about a breach of natural justice. But the facts of this case can easily be accommodated within the existing framework of s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the International Arbitration Act without any reliance on any such principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 First, there was no breach of natural justice at all. The plaintiffs were not unable to present their case on the question of damages in the event that rescission was barred and were not deprived of reasonable notice of the defendants’ case on that question, when that is measured against the notice which they gave the defendants that they were raising the issue that rescission was barred. Further, the arbitrator’s procedural management of the arbitration on the issue of liability cannot be said to fall outside “the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done” (see [34(f)] above). In addition, by the first day of the evidential hearing, any reasonable party would have appreciated that the arbitrator’s chain of reasoning could include a link (see [34(e)] above) proceeding from a holding that rescission was barred by affirmation to a consideration of whether the defendants were entitled in the alternative to damages in the tort of deceit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Second, even if there was a breach of natural justice in some technical sense, it was not connected to the making of the award within the meaning of s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the International Arbitration Act. The root cause of the arbitrator’s holding in the award that it was open to him to award damages to the defendants in lieu of rescission was not his failure to hear from the plaintiffs on this point but the plaintiffs’ own failure to ask for the evidential hearing to be postponed or bifurcated in order for them to have a reasonable opportunity to present their case on the defendants’ response to the plaintiffs’ remedial defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 And finally, the plaintiffs suffered no prejudice from the arbitrator’s supposed breach of natural justice over and above the prejudice which they caused to themselves by raising the remedial defence late and informally and by failing to ask for the evidential hearing to be postponed or bifurcated in order for them to have a reasonable opportunity to present their case on the defendants’ response to the plaintiffs’ remedial defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The plaintiffs’ case that there was a breach of natural justice on liability therefore fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">No breach of natural justice on quantum </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I now turn to the second limb of the plaintiffs’ case on natural justice. The argument is that the plaintiffs did not have reasonable notice of, or a reasonable opportunity to be heard on, the quantum of the damages which he awarded to the defendants.

In this exchange, the arbitrator did not confine himself to asking the defendants what their position was if rescission was denied. When the defendants took the position that they would then pursue a claim for damages in the alternative, he expressly asked the defendants what the measure of damages would be for that alternative claim:

They asked the arbitrator to award damages equivalent to the sums which they had invested under the contracts less the benefits which they received under the contracts.

</div> The plaintiffs’ complaint in this paragraph is not that the measure of damages is new. The complaint is that the defendants’ case on damages is not pleaded, quantified, particularised or proven. It is true that the measure of damages is not pleaded. But that is because of the informal way in which the plaintiffs themselves had put in play the issue of damages in lieu of rescission. Furthermore, the defendants’ measure of damages was not a new case. The defendants had raised this measure of damages expressly on the first day of the evidential hearing. The plaintiffs had implicitly acknowledged it in their principal closing submissions (see [107] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the measure of damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In the circumstances, the arbitrator’s procedural management of this arbitration in relation to the measure of damages fell well within “the range of what a reasonable and fair-minded tribunal in those circumstances might have done” (see [34(f)] above). Furthermore, by the first day of the evidential hearing, any reasonable party would have appreciated that the arbitrator’s chain of reasoning could proceed from a holding that the defendants were entitled to damages in the tort of deceit to an assessment of those damages on the measure proposed by the defendants (see [34(e)] above). In any event, the arbitrator’s handling of this issue is unconnected to the making of the award and caused no prejudice to the plaintiffs over and above what they caused to themselves (see [125]–[128] above). </div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">142 The plaintiffs’ case that there was a breach of natural justice on the measure of damages fails.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No evidence to support the damages claimed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I turn now to the plaintiffs’ argument that the defendants failed to adduce any evidence to support the quantum of damages which they claimed. The most important aspect of this argument for the plaintiffs is that they had no notice of the defendants’ case in the arbitration that their 50% shareholding in the Company was worthless. In this regard, the plaintiffs’ complaint is different in one critical respect from the other limbs of the plaintiffs’ case on natural justice. The defendants did not give any notice to the plaintiffs on the first day of the evidential hearing that their case was that their 50% shareholding in the Company was worthless. Indeed, they arguably gave no such notice until their principal closing submissions, which were served after the evidential hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In order to analyse this head of the plaintiffs’ application, it is necessary to trace how the parties dealt with the defendants’ evidence of their damages claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Opening statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The plaintiffs’ opening statement, immediately after raising the remedial defence (see [78]–[80] above), objected to the defendants’ claim for damages as being unpleaded, unparticularised and unquantified:

This evidence was admittedly adduced to establish the defendants’ case on fraudulent misrepresentation, and not to prove that the shares were worthless in October 2016. But the presence of <span class="font-italic">some</span> evidence suffices to insulate the arbitrator’s finding that the Company’s shares were worthless as at October 2016 from being vitiated on any natural justice ground. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I accept the defendants’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 First, in my view, the plaintiffs’ complaint in their responsive closing submissions that the defendants were attempting to “set up an entirely new case” on damages

</div> (see [109] above) was not in substance a complaint the plaintiffs were being denied a reasonable opportunity to present their case on damages. If that were indeed the plaintiffs’ complaint, they would not have stopped short at simply complaining that the defendants’ case on damages was new, unpleaded, unquantified and unproven. The plaintiffs would have expressly asked the arbitrator to reopen the evidential phase to permit them to have an opportunity to present their case on damages. They would have particularised the evidence they wished to present in the reopened evidential phase. And they would have identified the witnesses they would call or recall to present it.

</div> In the absence of any such express request, in my view, a reasonable and fair arbitrator would have read the plaintiffs’ responsive closing submissions as the plaintiffs’ engaging with the merits of the defendants’ case on damages. In other words, the plaintiffs’ complaint is fairly and reasonably read as a reason for the arbitrator to reject the claim for damages without further inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Second, I do not accept the plaintiffs’ submission that the defendants placed <span class="font-italic">no</span> evidence before the arbitrator from which he could make a finding as to the value of the defendants’ 50% shareholding in the Company as at October 2016.

</div> The plaintiffs complain that this is not evidence of the Company’s value in October 2016 because the receivers sold the charged assets between October 2016 and July 2017. But evidence was also led in chief and elicited in cross-examination about the Company’s overstated receivables, understated liabilities, overstated fixed assets and inflated future projects in 2016. A witness for the defendants gave evidence that the Company’s business had come to a halt in October 2016: it had no new projects, all the staff had been removed, judgment creditors were levying execution by way of garnishee proceedings and it no longer had any money beyond the minimum to meet statutory payments and to pay a skeleton staff.

</div> The plaintiffs’ counsel in the arbitration did not challenge this evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 It is true that this evidence was elicited to go to a different issue. In this case, the issue was whether the defendants had mismanaged the Company after taking control of it (see [10] above). It therefore suited the plaintiffs’ case not to challenge this evidence. But evidence is evidence just as the truth is the truth. And even if this evidence was not tied directly to the October 2016 valuation date selected by the arbitrator or to his assessment of the quantum of damages in lieu of rescission, it was<span class="font-italic"> </span>nevertheless circumstantial evidence from which he could draw an inference as to the Company’s value in October 2016. The arbitrator’s three reasons for his finding that the Company’s shares were worthless as at October 2016 (see [22(j)] above) shows that he was aware of this evidence. It does not matter on an application to set aside an award on grounds of natural justice whether the evidence was strong or weak, comprehensive or incomplete, focused or incidental, direct or circumstantial. Even if it is assumed that the arbitrator drew an unwarranted inference from the evidence which was before him, that is an error of fact and not a breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I accept therefore that the evidence led and elicited in the arbitration and the parties’ submissions on that evidence formed <span class="font-italic">some</span> basis on which a reasonable and fair-minded arbitrator could have found that the value of the defendants’ 50% shareholding in the Company was worthless. Having engaged with the merits of the defendants’ case on damages, it is not open to the plaintiffs now to recharacterise their complaint during the arbitration as a complaint that natural justice was being breached in order to try their luck at a backdoor appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">160 In conclusion, whether it is on damages as an alternative remedy to rescission, the measure of damages or the quantum of damages, the plaintiffs are not a victim of a breach of natural justice.
