In OS 510/2018, the AG filed Summons No 2196 of 2018 (“SUM 2196/2018”) for Wham Kwok Han Jolovan (“Wham”) to be punished for contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (No 19 of 2016) (“the Act”). Section 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides for the offence of contempt by scandalising the court (“scandalising contempt”). In OS 537/2018, the AG filed Summons No 2192 of 2018 (“SUM 2192/2018”) for Tan Liang Joo John (“Tan”) to be punished for scandalising contempt under the same provision. Wham and Tan are collectively referred to as “the Respondents”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Act came into operation on 1 October 2017. The Respondents are the first individuals against whom proceedings were commenced for scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. The conduct alleged to be scandalising contempt pertain to the Respondents’ respective posts on their Facebook profiles. The Respondents first raised a constitutional challenge to the validity of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), in view of their rights to freedom of speech and expression under Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the Constitution”). The Respondents also denied that they committed scandalising contempt.

Under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), “Parliament may by law impose on the rights conferred by clause (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) … restrictions designed … to provide against contempt of court”. Since s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act which provides for the offence of scandalising contempt is such a restriction designed to provide against contempt of court, I find that s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is consistent with Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution and is consequently valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This finding is supported by V K Rajah J’s interpretation of Art 14(2) of the Constitution in <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 (“<span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin</span>”), which the AG and the Respondents submitted as relevant in determining the constitutional issue.

As the MOA restricts the rights to freedom of speech and expression and assembly in the interest of public order, for the MOA to be validly enacted under Arts 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Constitution, Parliament had to consider that the MOA is a legislative fetter that is “necessary or expedient in the interest of … public order”.

Unlike restrictions that Parliament may impose “in the interest of … public order”, for which Parliament must consider them “necessary or expedient” in this regard, restrictions designed to provide against contempt of court are not similarly qualified as such under Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). I reiterate that the presumption of legislative constitutionality will not be lightly displaced. Since there is a nexus between the object of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act and one of the permissible subjects stipulated in Art 14(2) of the Constitution, s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) was validly enacted under the Constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I will also address the Respondents’ argument that the “real risk” test at common law represented the Art 14 balance that the constitutional framers carefully struck between the right to freedom of speech and expression and the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Respondents submitted that the “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act is “an abrupt and sudden departure” from that balance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I am of the view that any change by legislation from the common law must necessarily be a departure from the common law. Enacting legislation is the prerogative of the Legislature (see Art 38 of the Constitution). A piece of legislation which departs from the common law, however abrupt it may appear to be, cannot <span class="font-italic">per se</span> suggest that the legislation is unconstitutional.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Article 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution confers on Parliament the power to impose legislative restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression, to provide against contempt of court. Prior to the Act, s 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) provided that “[t]he High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have power to punish for contempt of court.” Section 7 of the SCJA was repealed by s 45 of the Act when the Act came into force on 1 October 2017. Before the Act, there was no other legislative provision governing the offence of scandalising contempt. There was nothing in Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution and the SCJA which precluded the courts from developing the common law on scandalising contempt as they did (in the context of the law on defamation, see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal</span> [2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span>”) at [270]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, Art 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution expressly provides that Parliament has the final say on how the balance should be struck between the right to freedom of speech and expression and the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span> at [270]). In enacting the Act, Parliament was exercising its legislative power to impose restrictions on the right to freedom of speech and expression, designed to provide against contempt of court. In fact, Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that the right to freedom of speech and expression is subject to Arts 14(2) and 14(3). It is within Parliament’s legislative power, and the purpose of Art 14, for Parliament to decide how the balance should be struck between this constitutional right and the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice. Parliament can decide the extent to which this constitutional right should be restricted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Parliament has decided to enact the “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act to legislatively overrule the “real risk” test at common law for the offence of scandalising contempt. The result of this is that Parliament has enlarged the scope of conduct that constitutes scandalising contempt. In determining when scandalising contempt is committed, the court will now consider what the applicable principles are under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). It is the role of the court to interpret and apply legislative provisions, as the judicial power of Singapore vests in the Singapore courts (see Art 93 of the Constitution).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I add that while s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act restricts the right to freedom of speech and expression, fair criticism of a court is allowed. As stated in Explanation 1 to s 3(1), fair criticism of a court is not scandalising contempt. The Act also provides other defences that may be raised against allegations of scandalising contempt. These defences are found in ss 14–19, and include the defence for when a person makes a report in good faith to a public authority alleging misconduct or corruption on the part of a judge (s 16). Therefore, it cannot be said that under the Act a Singapore citizen is completely unable to criticise the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In summary, s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act is consistent with Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution and is consequently valid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Since s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act is consistent with Art 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Constitution, I proceed to consider the applicable principles in relation to the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Act states in its Long Title that it is:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[a]n Act to <span class="font-italic">state and consolidate the law of contempt of court for the protection of the administration of justice</span>, to define the powers of certain courts in punishing contempt of court and to regulate their procedure in relation thereto; and to make consequential amendments to certain other Acts. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The purpose of the Act and specifically s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to generally state and consolidate the law of scandalising contempt is confirmed in the parliamentary debates.

The interpretation and application of this second limb were the main areas of dispute between the parties. I will discuss the parties’ respective submissions as I determine the applicable principles for the “risk” test. By way of an overview, the parties’ arguments are largely based on the case law for the “real risk” test at common law, and the arguments are briefly as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the AG argued for what I will call the “categorical approach” when applying the “risk” test, that is, the “risk” test in the second limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is necessarily satisfied as long as the conduct that satisfies the first limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is that which impugns the <span class="font-italic">integrity</span> or <span class="font-italic">impartiality</span> of any court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Respondents argued that a “risk” under the “risk” test still cannot be one that is “a remote or fanciful possibility” that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Respondents also argued that the court should adopt a “quantitative approach” when applying the “risk” test to consider how many individuals in Singapore are in fact aware of the alleged contemptuous conduct, or the conduct in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Analysis of the “risk” test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I will first set out the applicable principles for the “real risk” test at common law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The seminal case on scandalising contempt at common law is the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>.

</div> Therefore, the “risk” test in the second limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is necessarily satisfied. If, on the other hand, the conduct in question satisfies the first limb only because it imputes <span class="font-italic">improper motives</span> to or impugns the <span class="font-italic">propriety</span> of any court instead, such conduct must be separately assessed to satisfy the “risk” test in the second limb. The AG did not make further submissions on how the “risk” test would be satisfied for such conduct, because the AG’s case was that both the Respondents’ conduct impugned the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts.

[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Neither the terms of the first limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) nor the parliamentary debates suggest that a distinction is to be drawn between the various conduct stated in the first limb – conduct impugning the integrity or impartiality of any court, on the one hand, and other conduct stated in the first limb, on the other hand. However, it may be that in a particular case, the facts which satisfy the first limb may make it easier to satisfy the “risk” test in the second limb.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I add that there may well be an overlap between the various conduct stated in the first limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). For instance, depending on the circumstances, conduct which imputes improper motives to or impugns the propriety of any court may well impugn the integrity or impartiality of any court. If indeed the AG’s submitted categorical approach was correct, the temptation would be to categorise the conduct of a respondent as one that impugns the integrity or impartiality of any court so that the “risk” test is necessarily satisfied. This would render otiose the express conjunctive requirement of the “risk” test in the second limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, I am of the view that <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [37] cannot be used to support the proposition that whenever the conduct in question impugns the integrity or impartiality of any court, it would necessarily pose a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. Such a proposition would have entirely contradicted the Court of Appeal’s view in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, where at common law, all conduct had to be assessed to satisfy the “real risk” test before such conduct could be considered as scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal took great pains to set out that the “real risk” test was the applicable test <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> liability for scandalising contempt in Singapore, and not the “inherent tendency” test or the “clear and present danger” test (for the discussion and the consequent rejection of these two latter tests, see <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [51]–[57] and [38]–[49] respectively). Of particular significance is one of the reasons for the Court of Appeal to eschew the use of the term “inherent tendency”, or in other words, to reject the “inherent tendency” test. Briefly, the “inherent tendency” test, as it was first articulated by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">AG v Wain Barry</span><span class="font-italic"> J and others</span> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Wain</span>”), required that the conduct in question “have the inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice” for it to be considered as scandalising contempt (at [54]). In rejecting the “inherent tendency” test, the Court of Appeal explained as follows (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [56]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a holistic reading of <span class="font-italic">Wain</span> suggests that the learned judge did <span class="font-italic">not</span> intend to divorce the [‘inherent tendency’] test from <span class="font-italic">its actual or potential impact on</span><span class="font-italic"> public confidence in the administration of justice</span>. It is, in fact, axiomatic that the law in general and the law relating to scandalising contempt in particular do not – and cannot – operate in a hermetically sealed environment. That this is the case is clearly illustrated by the actual application of the law to the facts by the learned judge himself … This must surely be the case as, in our view, it would be contrary to both logic as well as commonsense for the “inherent tendency” test – or any test for that matter – to be stated only at a purely abstract or theoretical level. Indeed, even a theoretical formulation must have in view the vital sphere of <span class="font-italic">application,</span><span class="font-italic"> having regard of course to the particular facts and context of the case in which that formulation is applied</span>. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> was thus of the view that to determine if the conduct in question was scandalising contempt, its actual or potential impact on public confidence in the administration of justice must be assessed. The categorical approach, which provides that conduct that impugns the integrity or impartiality of any court would necessarily pose a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, would fly in the face of this view. Put bluntly, the categorical approach ignores the particular facts and context of the case in its application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [31] expressly affirmed its approach to the law on scandalising contempt as set out in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>. Accordingly, in the absence of any specific indication to the contrary, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> was not changing its view from that in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that at common law, all conduct, even that which impugned the integrity or impartiality of any court, had to be assessed to satisfy the “real risk” test before such conduct could be considered as scandalising contempt. I add that <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> was a clear case where the contemptuous article posed a real risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. As the Court of Appeal stated at [48]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">This insidious attack on the independence as well as</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> impartiality of the judiciary goes to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the very heart of</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> what the (indeed, any)</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> judiciary stands for and clearly undermines public confidence in the administration of justice.</span> [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 To summarise, at common law, all conduct had to be assessed to satisfy the “real risk” test before such conduct could be considered as scandalising contempt.

Another illustration [is that] … where a letter circulated by a disappointed litigant to the Attorney-General of New South Wales and 13 Registrars of the district courts was found to be in contempt. I am in no position to assess the situation in Australia or New South Wales. But I am very certain that, should the same letter be circulated to the Attorney-General, or the Registry of the Supreme Court or the Subordinate Courts, <span class="font-italic">it will not pose the slightest risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 To Loh J’s comments, the Court of Appeal remarked in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [35]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, we would caution that the illustrations referred to by the Judge, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, rants made at a dinner party and a letter circulated by a disappointed litigant to holders of high public and legal office … cannot admit of <span class="font-italic">only one</span> correct answer in <span class="font-italic">every</span> case.

The point we are making here is simply that having regard for the precise facts and context in which the impugned statement is made is crucial. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Thus, likewise, to determine if the conduct in question poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, much would depend on the precise facts and context.

I understand this to mean that such a letter would not have satisfied the “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act too because the <span class="font-italic">public</span> in general would presumably not have been privy to the letter, and those who were privy to it would have been more discerning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I also find instructive the following statements by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [29] and [36], where the Court of Appeal was cognisant of and warned against:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 … the very real danger of semantic analysis trumping practical factual considerations.

</div> Section 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides for the offence of <span class="font-italic">sub </span><span class="font-italic">judice</span> contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It seems to me that a “risk” concerns, generally, an outcome that may arise in the <span class="font-italic">future</span>, including the very immediate future. This outcome may also not arise. In <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated the “real risk” test as such: “is there a real risk that the impugned statement has undermined – <span class="font-italic">or </span><span class="font-italic">might undermine</span> – public confidence in the administration of justice (here, in Singapore)?” [emphasis added] (at [36]). The statutory “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act is similarly a question of whether such public confidence has been undermined or <span class="font-italic">might be undermined</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether this outcome might arise in the future. The offence of scandalising contempt can thus be made out even if the conduct in question has not in fact resulted in such public confidence being undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As such, I disagree that the court needs to consider how many individuals in Singapore are aware of the conduct in question before it can consider whether the “risk” test is satisfied. The consequences following such conduct, like how many individuals in Singapore are in fact aware of it, are not necessarily determinative of both the presence and the extent of the risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> did not require that the court adopt any quantitative approach when applying the “real risk” test at common law, and neither did Parliament for the “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act. On the other hand, if it is established that in fact many individuals in Singapore are aware of the conduct in question, that fact may assist to establish the existence of the “risk” for the “risk” test. I also add that since the “risk” test involves a careful consideration of the precise facts and context of the conduct in question, it would almost always be relevant to consider the <span class="font-italic">audience</span> of the alleged contemnor for the conduct in question. This would include consideration of the general size of such audience. I caution that unlike the quantitative approach, consideration of the <span class="font-italic">general</span> size of such audience does not require an accounting exercise of the number of individuals in Singapore who are, or may be, aware of the conduct in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fair criticism</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I move on to discuss the concept of fair criticism. Explanation 1 to s 3(1) of the Act states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation 1.</span>—Fair criticism of a court is not contempt by scandalising the court within the meaning of subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Thus, under the Act, the court must also find that the conduct in question does not constitute fair criticism before the court can find such conduct to be scandalising contempt. This has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt (see <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [18]; <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [78]). The explanatory statement relating to the Bill explained that enacting Explanation 1 to s 3(1) was in accordance with the “provisional view” in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> with regard to the characterisation of the concept of fair criticism, and so Part 4 of the Act does not provide for a separate defence of fair criticism (the Bill at pp 40, 44; see also <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [80], [86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Apart from following the “provisional view” in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, Explanation 1 to s 3(1) codifies the concept of fair criticism at common law. At common law, conduct that satisfied the “real risk” test was not scandalising contempt if it constituted fair criticism (<span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [17]–[18], [30] affirming the applicable principles for scandalising contempt that were laid down in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>). Likewise, under the Act, conduct that satisfies the requirements in ss 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) and 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), which include the “risk” test, is not scandalising contempt if it constitutes fair criticism of a court. The structure of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is such that the concept of fair criticism is separately provided for after ss 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) and 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), under Explanation 1. There was no dispute between the parties on the applicable principles for fair criticism.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I will elaborate on the point that conduct which satisfies the two limbs of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is not scandalising contempt if it constitutes fair criticism of a court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal stated at [86] that to apply the concept of fair criticism at common law, the key question was:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… does the impugned statement constitute fair criticism, or does it go on to cross the legal line by posing a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice – in which case it would constitute contempt instead?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage may give the impression that if the conduct in question constitutes fair criticism, it will not pose a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It is also not clear from this passage whether, assuming that the conduct in question impugns, say, the impartiality of a court, and does not constitute fair criticism, this means that such conduct necessarily poses a real risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined or that the court has to go on to consider whether that real risk has been established (at common law). In Gary K Y Chan, “Contempt of Court and Fair Criticism in Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan v Attorney General</span> [2011] SGCA 26” (2011) 11(2) Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal 197 at p 206, the author appeared to assume the latter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I am of the view that the above passage from <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> should not be read to view “fair criticism” and “real risk” as being two sides of the same coin. Likewise, “fair criticism” and “risk” under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act are not two sides of the same coin. After all, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> had explained at [78] that if the court must find that the conduct in question does not constitute fair criticism before it can find such conduct to be scandalising contempt:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The <span class="font-italic">legal</span> burden … would be on the [AG] to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span> that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. … [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In applying the principles for fair criticism in the case before it, the Court of Appeal also demonstrated that conduct that satisfied the “real risk” test could nevertheless constitute fair criticism and not be scandalising contempt. For instance, the Court of Appeal had found that “the 13th statement” satisfied the “real risk” test for stating that the judiciary was compliant and not independent. The Court of Appeal then proceeded to assess if that statement constituted fair criticism and would thus not be scandalising contempt (at [136]–[139]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The applicable principles for determining whether the conduct in question constitutes fair criticism can be found in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span>. <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [82] had also affirmed the High Court’s analysis in this regard in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Fair criticism is criticism that is made in good faith and is respectful (<span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span> at [15]; <span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [30]). It must, “at the very threshold”, be premised on objective facts and on a rational basis (<span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [34]). The court must determine on an objective analysis of the precise facts and context whether the conduct in question constitutes fair criticism (<span class="font-italic">Au </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Pang</span> at [34]). For this analysis, the court can take into account a wide range of factors, which include (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Liang </span><span class="font-italic">Joo John</span> at [16], [18], [20]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the extent to which the criticism is supported by argument and evidence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the manner in which the criticism is made, which must generally be temperate and dispassionate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the party’s attitude in court; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the number of instances of contemning conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I reiterate that the issue of whether the conduct in question constitutes fair criticism is separate from that of whether the conduct satisfies the “risk” test under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act. While there may be an overlap between the relevant facts used to determine both these issues, their respective analyses are quite different. Take for example a hypothetical where a person publishes an article in the local newspaper ranking Singapore 200th out of 200 countries in terms of judicial independence. Assume for the purposes of this hypothetical that the person publishes his article in good faith and is respectful. He elaborates in the article how this ranking was derived, and the court finds that the article is based on some reasonable criteria. Still, such a newspaper article may be considered to be impugning the impartiality of the Singapore courts and also posing a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the article satisfies the “risk” test. However, a court may also conclude that such an article constitutes fair criticism of the courts and is not scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Consider now a different hypothetical where a disgruntled litigant tells only his roommate, assertively and without any reason, that Singapore is ranked 200th out of 200 countries in terms of judicial independence. Assume that the person makes this bare assertion in bad faith. While the assertion impugns the impartiality of the Singapore courts, it is likely that this assertion does not pose a risk that <span class="font-italic">public</span> confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is unlikely that this assertion satisfies the “risk” test, even though such an assertion does not constitute fair criticism of the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In setting out these two hypotheticals, I have used the audience of the alleged contemnor for the conduct in question as a variable in considering whether the conduct satisfies the “risk” test. It is needless to say that the alleged contemnor’s audience is not a determinative factor of whether the “risk” test is satisfied, and much would depend on the precise facts and context. I have provided these hypotheticals <span class="font-italic">only</span> to illustrate in an obvious manner how the analyses and considerations for fair criticism and the “risk” test can be very different.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Act provides in ss 14–19 for defences that may be raised such that a person will not be guilty of scandalising contempt. All defences at common law to scandalising contempt which are not contained in the Act are repealed (s 8(2)). As mentioned, fair criticism is not a defence to the offence of scandalising concept, but the court must find that the conduct in question does not constitute fair criticism before it can find that such conduct is scandalising contempt. As the Respondents did not raise any of these defences in the Act for their respective cases, I will not discuss them further.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of the applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In summary, the following are the applicable principles in relation to the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The standard of proof for establishing the offence of scandalising contempt is that of beyond reasonable doubt (s 28).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> required is an intention to publish the contemptuous matter or do the contemptuous act. A person is guilty of scandalising contempt even if there was no intention to scandalise the court (s 3(2)).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> required is first that on an objective interpretation of the conduct in question, the conduct must impute improper motives to or impugn the integrity, propriety or impartiality of any court (as set out in the first limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)). Second, the conduct must be objectively assessed to pose a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined (as set out in the second limb of s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)). Such risk is to be considered in the light of the precise facts and context and from the view of the average reasonable person. This “risk” test is an adequate formulation in and of itself and requires no further theoretical elaboration. The court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. It is not necessary to establish that the conduct in question has in fact resulted in such public confidence being undermined.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fair criticism of a court is not scandalising contempt (Explanation 1 to s 3(1)). Fair criticism is criticism that is made in good faith and is respectful, and must, at the very threshold, be premised on objective facts and on a rational basis. Whether the conduct in question constitutes fair criticism must be determined on an objective analysis of the precise facts and context. The offence of scandalising contempt requires that the conduct has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt not to constitute fair criticism.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Act provides in ss 14–19 for defences that may be raised such that a person will not be guilty of scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Wham committed scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Having stated the applicable principles in relation to the offence of scandalising contempt under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act, I turn first to consider whether Wham committed scandalising contempt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> requirement is satisfied.

Therefore, I am of the view that Wham’s post poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined regardless of whether 33 or more people have in fact responded to his post. Indeed, the number of people who responded to his post does not say how many people in fact read his post. Furthermore, as discussed at [64] above, even if it can be shown that so far a limited number of people read Wham’s post, that does not mean that the “risk” test is not satisfied.

It is not necessary to establish that Wham’s post has in fact resulted in such public confidence being undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Even if Wham did not hold himself out as a professional commentator or an investigative journalist and thus the risk of his post undermining public confidence in the administration of justice may be less, this does not help him on the issue of liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the light of the precise facts and context as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, I find that Wham’s post poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined. The “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act (the second limb of the <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> of scandalising contempt) is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Explanation 1 to s 3(1) of the Act: fair criticism</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The final question is then whether Wham’s post constitutes fair criticism. Wham’s post contains a bare statement impugning the integrity and impartiality of Singapore’s judges. The link in Wham’s post pertaining to a constitutional challenge in Malaysia also does not discuss Singapore’s judges. The bare statement in Wham’s post does not demonstrate how Wham was comparing the judicial <span class="font-italic">philosophies</span> of the courts in Singapore and Malaysia, which he submitted to be his intention. While Wham might argue that his post is supported by actual case examples and literature on the concept of judicial independence, Wham’s post in and of itself is not supported by argument and evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Fair criticism must, at the very threshold, be premised on objective facts and on a rational basis.

As already mentioned, his post contains a bare statement impugning the integrity and impartiality of Singapore’s judges.

If Wham is to be believed, his assertion was based simply on a comparison between <span class="font-italic">three</span> Malaysian cases and <span class="font-italic">three</span> Singapore cases.

In this regard, I first deal with the AG’s contention that Tan’s post suggests that the outcome of the AG’s action against Wham in OS 510/2018 will be a forgone conclusion. I do not accept this submission as I find it a stretch to interpret Tan’s post as such. I will proceed to consider Tan’s alternative submission that the allegation in his post is directed at the AGC or the AG, and not the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Tan’s alternative interpretation of his post is that the AG, by the AG’s action against Wham in OS 510/2018, “convey[s] to reasonable members of the public the impression” that “there is truth to <span class="font-italic">the assertion that the judiciary is not independent</span>” [emphasis added] (see [109] above). I note two things about this interpretation. First, Tan understood Wham to be saying in Wham’s post that the Singapore judiciary is not independent. Second, Tan also submitted an interpretation for the word “confirms” as used in his post, “the AGC only confirms what he said was true”. Tan submitted that “to confirm” means “to convey to reasonable members of the public an impression”. I disagree with this submission. In its ordinary meaning, “to confirm” would mean more than to merely convey an impression. “To confirm” means “[t]o corroborate, or add support to (a statement, etc.); to make certain, verify, put beyond doubt” (<span class="font-italic">The Oxford English Dictionary</span> vol III (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989) at p 710). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Even if I were to accept Tan’s interpretation for the word “confirms”, Tan’s post would nevertheless be regarded as impugning the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts. Consider the following hypothetical involving persons Alex, Bryan, Calvin and Danny. Alex declares to a group of people, “<span class="font-italic">By overreacting to Bryan’s statement that Calvin is dishonest, Danny only confirms what Bryan said was true</span><span class="font-italic">.</span>” In this hypothetical, Alex’s statement impugns Calvin’s integrity. Alex’s statement is not only about Danny. It is about Danny, Bryan and Calvin, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about Danny’s action, Bryan’s statement and Calvin’s character.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Likewise, even on Tan’s alternative submission that he was only saying that the AG’s conduct conveys the impression that the Singapore judiciary is not independent, Tan’s post still impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts. Tan claimed that the allegation in his post is directed at the AG and not the Singapore courts. However, Tan’s post does not refer solely to the AG. The words “the AGC only confirms what he said was true” in Tan’s post are intertwined with and repeat what Wham said in Wham’s post, and the latter impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Tan’s post, which refers to the Singapore courts, is quite unlike the three non-contemptuous statements that Tan tried in his submissions to analogise his post to.

</div> These three statements were referred to in <span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> as “the second statement”, “the third statement” and “the 14th statement”, and the Court of Appeal found that there was reasonable doubt whether these statements referred to the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 “The second statement” had mentioned how the sentence imposed in question of “only five years” was “a slap on the wrist which was arranged by the Singapore government”. Without reference to the courts, “the second statement” could have referred solely to “how the Singapore government chose to bring reduced charges” on that occasion (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [104]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 “The third statement” had commented on “Singapore’s legal system”, and could have referred to the system exclusive of the courts (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 “The 14th statement” could be interpreted to refer solely to the allegation that “[t]he ruling party in Singapore often sues those who dare oppose it”, without passing any comment on how the courts handle these cases (<span class="font-italic">Shadrake</span><span class="font-italic"> Alan (CA)</span> at [142]). “The 14th statement” could thus have referred solely to executive – as opposed to judicial – action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I find that the message in Tan’s post is: what Wham said in his post is true, and by commencing proceedings against Wham for scandalising contempt, the AG confirms this. Since Wham’s post impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts, Tan’s post likewise impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts. Tan may also be criticising the AG for commencing proceedings against Wham, but this is an additional attack on top of the attack on the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 If Tan may avoid liability for scandalising contempt on the argument that he was criticising the AG or the AGC only, then in the future, others can simply adopt a similar course of action to attack the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In summary, I find that Tan’s post impugns the integrity and impartiality of the Singapore courts, and the first limb of the <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> of scandalising contempt in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Act is satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 3(1)(</span>a<span class="font-italic">)(ii) of the Act: the “risk” test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I turn to consider whether the “risk” test is satisfied in relation to Tan’s post. This analysis is similar to that in relation to Wham’s post (see [90]–[95] above). To recapitulate, I have rejected the AG’s submitted categorical approach (see [54] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I find that the average reasonable person would interpret Tan’s post to mean first that the allegation in Wham’s post that Singapore’s judges are not impartial when adjudicating cases with political implications is true, and second that the AG’s action against Wham in OS 510/2018 confirms this. The average reasonable person would perceive this to be the point that Tan was making.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Like the audience for Wham’s post, the audience for Tan’s post is the public at large since Tan’s post was published under the “Public” setting of Facebook’s audience selector and can thus be viewed by anyone with Internet access. Therefore, Tan’s post poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined regardless of how many people have in fact responded to his post.

</div> Again, it is not necessary to establish that Tan’s post has in fact resulted in such public confidence being undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the light of the precise facts and context, I find that the “risk” test in s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Act (the second limb of the <span class="font-italic">actus</span><span class="font-italic"> reus</span> of scandalising contempt) is satisfied in relation to Tan’s post.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Explanation 1 to s 3(1) of the Act: fair criticism</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The final question is whether Tan’s post constitutes fair criticism.

However, I find that Tan’s post is not premised on objective facts or on a rational basis. Tan’s post asserts that by commencing proceedings against Wham for scandalising contempt, the AG only confirms what Wham said in his post is true, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Singapore’s judges are not impartial when adjudicating cases with political implications. Insofar as Tan’s post itself alleges that Singapore’s judges are not impartial when adjudicating such cases, this allegation is not supported by argument and evidence. Tan’s post also does not explain why the AG’s action against Wham for scandalising contempt would necessarily imply that the allegation in Wham’s post is true.
