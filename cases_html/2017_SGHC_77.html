The particulars of conversion were set out in paragraphs 13(a) and 13(b) of the SOC as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Took the [Plaintiff’s] materials and tools and used them for the Alibaba Projects; and   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Ordered materials and tools on the [Plaintiff’s] account from the [Plaintiff’s] suppliers and used the said materials and tools for the Alibaba Projects.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>On 10 March 2015, the Plaintiff obtained judgment against D2 for default of appearance. The judgment was for damages to be assessed with interest and costs reserved to the Registrar hearing the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span>Accordingly, the Plaintiff continued with the action against D1 only. The trial was held from 4 to 7 October and 14 October 2016. After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I granted the Plaintiff interlocutory judgment on 12 January 2017 against D1 for D1’s conspiracy with D2 to injure the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed by me under paragraphs 11(a), 11(b) and 11(c) of the SOC as well as in respect of workers who did not carry out the Plaintiff’s work. I also granted judgment for the tort of conversion under paragraph 13(b) of the SOC. The Plaintiff had decided it was not pursuing paragraph 13(a) of the SOC. Costs of the trial and assessment and interest were to be determined by me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span>In the circumstances, it was unnecessary for me to grant judgment against D1 for breach of a contractual duty arising from his employment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span>D1 has filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span>The trial was on liability only.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of four men who were not cross-examined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span>The Plaintiff adduced evidence from various persons. The affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) of four men were admitted in evidence without cross-examination. They were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Ponnusamy Vijaykumar (“Ponnusamy”);     </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Kumarasamy Sasikumar (“Kumar”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Chua Sze Beng (“Chua”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Paramasivam Prithivirajan (“Param”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>According to Ponnusamy’s evidence, he was employed by Chan Li Comm Svs Pte Ltd (“Chan Li”) as an assistant electrical engineer from October 2009 to August 2011. Chan Li was in the business of providing manpower and unskilled labour mainly from India. Ponnusamy was sent by Chan Li to work at the Plaintiff where he worked under D2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span>Ponnusamy said that he found out that D2 was sending the Plaintiff’s workers to job sites which the Plaintiff did not have work for. These were the same job sites referred to as the Alibaba Projects in the SOC. D2 would also use the Plaintiff’s materials and tools for these projects. D2 would often give instructions to one Kooy Ten Yen (“Kooy”) to manage the Alibaba Projects on his behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">14 </span>Kumar was assigned to work for the Plaintiff from February 2007, first as a general worker and then as a supervisor. As a supervisor, he reported to D2. He was sacked by D2 around August 2011 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about two months before he signed a statutory declaration which was exhibited with his AEIC).     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span>Kumar mentioned that work was done by the Plaintiff’s workers at an old Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Jurong East (“the Jurong East HDB”), a project which the Plaintiff had not undertaken. This job was identified as one of the Alibaba Projects. He had learned from a worker, P Vijaykumar, who did not turn up at a job site of the Plaintiff that P Vijaykumar had been sent to work at that HDB flat along with five to six other workers. He also learned that the time cards for work done at the HDB flat were signed with no job stated on them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span>Kumar also learned that workers for the Plaintiff were sent to job sites at the National University of Singapore (“NUS”) and the National University Hospital (“NUH”). He had initially thought that these were jobs of the Plaintiff but eventually realised that they were not because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) D2 had told the workers sent there not to use the uniforms of the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) During the daily Tool-Box Meeting and Safety Briefing, the name of “Modernize Engineering” was written on the attendance sheet; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) D2 had instructed the workers sent there to say they were from Modernize Engineering if they were asked which company they were from.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span>According to Kumar, Chan Li was the manpower supplier who supplied Indian and Bangladeshi workers to the Plaintiff. Kooy and Yap Yen Lim were two other manpower suppliers who supplied Malaysian workers to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">18 </span>D2 filled in the time cards of the workers at the Jurong East HDB, NUS and NUH job sites without the jobs stated in the time cards although such information should have been stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>In about the last week of September 2011, Kumar informed the Plaintiff’s managing director Chan Seng Kit, also known as Derek Chan (“the MD”), about what he knew. The MD showed him time cards of some workers who were supposed to have worked at the job sites of the Plaintiff. Kumar said that some of these time cards for a particular job of the Plaintiff with ST Microelectronics bore the names of certain workers who were not in fact at that job site.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>Kumar also said that D2 would order materials in the name of the Plaintiff or take the materials from the Plaintiff’s store for the Alibaba Projects. Large tools had the name of the Plaintiff on them but D2 had instructed workers to spray paint over the Plaintiff’s name.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">21 </span>Chua was a workshop manager of the Plaintiff. His evidence was that on one occasion, the MD gave him a table of names of the Plaintiff’s workers and the dates on which they were supposed to have worked at the Plaintiff’s workshop. The MD said that the information had been extracted from the workers’ time cards. The information showed that Kooy had worked in the workshop in end November 2010 and most of December 2010 but Chua did not see Kooy in the workshop during that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">22 </span>The evidence of Param was that initially he was working at some of the Plaintiff’s projects at Novartis and Gardens by the Bay. From about October 2010 to February 2011, D2 sent him to work at job sites at NUS and at NUH. At these job sites, he and other workers wore T-shirts bearing the name of Modernize Engineering. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">23 </span>I now come to those persons who did give oral evidence at the trial as witnesses for the Plaintiff. They were:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) PW1 -   Tan Ching Kiat, also known as Vincent Tan <br/>                 (“Vincent Tan”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) PW2 -   Tay Chin Huat (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, D2 himself);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) PW3 -   Chan Seng Kit, also known as Derek Chan <br/>                (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the MD); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) PW4 -   Lee Tai Wai, also known as Bernard Lee <br/>                (“the Auditor”). </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Vincent Tan’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">24 </span>Vincent Tan did not provide an AEIC. Hence, his evidence-in-chief was by oral testimony.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">25 </span>Vincent Tan was the sole director and sole shareholder of Modernize Engineering and Services Pte Ltd (“Modernize ESPL”). Modernize ESPL was incorporated on 20 November 2010. Prior to that incorporation, Vincent Tan was working for Modernize Engineering as a senior manager. According to a search made at the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, Modernize Engineering was a sole proprietorship and the owner was one Tan Thiam Seng. The business was terminated on 5 April 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">26 </span>Vincent Tan referred to Tan Thiam Seng as his boss in Modernize Engineering. He said that Modernize ESPL was incorporated to acquire the business of Modernize Engineering. So from the date of incorporation of Modernize ESPL on 20 November 2010 to the date of termination of the business of Modernize Engineering, he was working for both these entities.

The final claim for payment by Modernize Engineering for that job was made in July 2011. This meant the job would have lasted from October or November 2010 to May or June 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>Modernize Engineering also did work for the Plaintiff (at other locations) but Vincent Tan knew the Plaintiff by the name of “A-Controls” and not by its full name Automatic Controls and Instrumentation Pte Ltd.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>Coming back to the NUS work site, Vincent Tan said that as he was halfway through the project at NUS, he was short of manpower. So he approached D1 from A-Controls for help. D1 was a friend of his whom he knew some time ago even before 2010. D1 recommended D2 who in turn recommended Kooy. Vincent Tan said that Kooy was the one who supplied manpower to Modernize Engineering although at one point, he also said he was not sure whether some workers also came from A-Controls.

By the deception, he had dishonestly induced the Plaintiff to deliver a certain sum of payment as that worker’s salary to Chan Li.

Furthermore, D1 did not dispute the questions or that it was he who gave the responses at the cross-examination of the Auditor. Instead, the dispute was in respect of the substance of the responses. Hence it was put to the Auditor that there was no admission about re-directing the Plaintiff’s resources to other projects and there was no offer to speak to third party suppliers with a proposal to settle the misconduct of D1 and D2 or to respond with a proposal the next day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>The Auditor maintained the accuracy of the substance of the responses. As for the last response, he said that he had checked his diary and recollected that he himself turned up at the Plaintiff’s premises the next day to see what offer D1 and D2 would come up with, as discussed. However, D1 and D2 did not turn up the next day at the Plaintiff’s premises.

Vincent Tan did not say that he did so because Kooy was unable to assist for the NUH project. Even if Kooy was unable to assist directly, Kooy would have been able to refer him to another labour supplier. So could D2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>It seemed to me that D1’s involvement was not simply confined to referring Vincent Tan to D2 as both Vincent Tan and D1 were suggesting. D1 was in fact more involved and had in fact conspired with D2 to use workers employed or engaged for the Plaintiff’s account for the work of others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>From Vincent Tan’s evidence, it seemed as though he sought D1’s help each time as a matter of course. I was of the view that he did so because he knew that there was some arrangement between his friend, D1, with D2 whereby workers would be charged to the Plaintiff’s account even though they were to be used for the work of others. His allegation that Modernize Engineering also made some payment for such workers did not mean that there was no misconduct or that he was innocent of the arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>Vincent Tan was also less than candid when the Plaintiff previously sought documents from Modernize ESPL, a non-party, in respect of the Alibaba projects. Vincent Tan executed an affidavit to say that Modernize ESPL had nothing to do with the Alibaba projects. Yet at trial, he said that Modernize ESPL had completed the contracts for Modernize Engineering.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>Furthermore, when the Plaintiff then sought discovery of similar documents from Modernize Engineering, Tan Thiam Seng signed an affidavit to disclose limited documents. According to the Plaintiff, those documents were documents which had already been made available by other non-parties. More importantly, that affidavit should have been signed by Vincent Tan, instead of Tan Thiam Seng, since the former was the one involved in the projects at NUS and NUH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>From Vincent Tan’s evidence at trial, he was the one who was involved in these two projects for the two entities whether it be Modernize ESPL or Modernize Engineering. It seemed to me that he had sought to give the wrong impression that Modernize Engineering and Modernize ESPL were completely different outfits run by different people when the Plaintiff’s applications for discovery of documents against first Modernize ESPL and then Modernize Engineering were dealt with. He was trying to give the wrong impression because he knew something was amiss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>Furthermore, at trial, Vincent Tan said he would be able to provide some documents (which had not been adduced before) but he would have to go to Malaysia to get them. It was surprising that he had to allegedly go to Malaysia to get them when the Alibaba projects were in Singapore and Modernize ESPL and Modernize Engineering were Singapore entities. The fact that these entities might also have other jobs in Malaysia did not explain why the documents for the Alibaba projects should be in Malaysia. Eventually, he produced copies of some payment vouchers, as mentioned above, which were of limited assistance to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span>Secondly, while D2 was a reluctant witness for the Plaintiff, he did say that D1 was his supervisor and he would take D1’s instructions to send workers to their worksites, although he claimed that he did not know who in the Plaintiff controlled the movement of workers.

</div> The point is that D1 was the one whom D2 kept on referring to as his supervisor during D2’s oral testimony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span>I also found D1 to be evasive when he was describing his relationship with D2. When D1 was asked whether he was D2’s supervisor, D1 said that D2 was one of his team members. When he was asked whether D2 reported to him, he said D2 reported directly to the project manager. When it was pointed out to him that D2 had said that he (D1) was D2’s main supervisor, D1 said that he (D1) was in charge of the installation team of which D2 was a member. When he was asked whether D2 reported directly to him, he said he (D2) was under his charge. Eventually D1 agreed that he was D2’s supervisor.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">77 </span>I was of the view that D2 was often taking instructions from D1 directly but D1 attempted to show an inaccurate picture, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that D2 was taking instructions mainly from the project manager. In my view, D1 was not truthful because he had something to hide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>D2 also did give evidence that it was D1 who asked him to sign the workers’ time cards even for those days when D2 was not in Singapore. Although D1 denied having told D2 to do this, it was not disputed that D2 was doing so. It was likely that as D2’s supervisor, D1 was aware that D2 was signing time cards of workers even for those dates when D2 was not in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>Thirdly, D1 had said that he did not check the claims of the labour suppliers even though he was supposed to do so when he signed the Plaintiff’s payment vouchers to recommend payment for the supply of labour. D1 said that he had trusted the Plaintiff’s accounts staff who had prepared the documents for his signature. I did not accept this explanation because D1 did not suggest this was an occasional lapse on his part. Even if D1 had simply trusted an accounts staff, he would have been in breach of an implied duty of care in contract to act with due diligence. I was of the view that D1 had signed the payment vouchers knowing the amounts claimed for the supply of labour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>Fourthly, I accepted that the Interview Record correctly recorded the responses to the questions; otherwise, it would mean that the MD had fabricated the responses and the Auditor had blindly countersigned the Interview Record. Although the Defence complained in closing submissions that it did not have the chance to cross-examine the MD on the Interview Record as it was introduced through the Auditor at trial, the reality was that the Defendant could have, but did not, ask for the MD to be recalled for cross-examination on this document. Indeed, both sides proceeded on the premise that there was no need to recall the MD as a witness. Perhaps this was because he had signed the supporting affidavit for the application to adduce further evidence through the Auditor and his affidavit was self-explanatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Although there were not many specifics in the questions and responses in the Interview Record, it was quite clear to me that the responses, if correctly recorded, were in substance admissions that the Plaintiff’s resources had been used for the project(s) of others and that D1 and D2 had participated in such a wrongful arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>When the Auditor gave evidence that he believed that it was the more senior of the two who was giving the responses to the questions (as mentioned above), it was not put to him in cross-examination that it was D2, instead of D1, who was giving the responses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>In any event, I found it unbelievable that, if D1 were innocent, he could not remember whether D2 had admitted to using the Plaintiff’s resources for other projects. If D2 had admitted to his, it would have come as a shock to D1 who would then have remembered it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>As for D1’s evidence that he and D2 left the meeting without responding to the third question, this was contrary to the Auditor’s evidence. If they had not agreed to go back the next day with a possible proposal of settlement from their accomplices, the Auditor would not have gone back the next day to see what proposal they might come up with. I accepted that the Auditor did go back the next day as he was certain about that after checking his diary. I concluded that, contrary to D1’s evidence, he and D2 did agree to talk to their accomplices about making a proposal of settlement.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>In the circumstances, I found that the Plaintiff had established its case against D1 and I granted interlocutory judgment against D1 as stated above at [7].   </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eric Chew (ECYT Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Chee San (TanLim Partnership) for the first defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
