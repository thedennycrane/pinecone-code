In response to the claimant subcontractor’s payment claim, the respondent builder had proposed to pay nothing because, among other reasons, “the amounts claimed in the payment claim as variations are amounts that should have been carried out pursuant to the contract” (at [5]). In his adjudication determination, the adjudicator said the respondent’s argument did not “make sense” and referred to the argument with the remark “[w]hatever that means” (at [14]). The court found that these exemplified the adjudicator’s “difficulty of understanding” the respondent’s argument (at [27]). It was striking that the claimant however understood the respondent’s argument – it provided a rebuttal to it – but it appeared that the adjudicator had not considered that rebuttal (at [28] and [37]). As the court observed (at [29]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the adjudicator were seeking to understand what was meant by this portion of the payment schedule, one might have thought that he would have referred to the apparent understanding, and rebuttal, given by [the claimant] in its submissions.
