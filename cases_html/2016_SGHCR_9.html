Furthermore, I also note from my perusal of the High Court’s records that the learned Judicial Commissioner, in ordering the conversion of the Civil Proceedings into a writ action (see [2] above), had minuted down his observation that “there is no divorce proceeding pending” as at the date of his order (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>on 5 January 2016).

As I have held at [11] above, this is an incorrect position to take in the present case. The facts as determined show that the proceedings for divorce only commenced when the Defendant herself later took out OS 49735 (Syariah Court) on 29 March 2016 (see Diagram 1 at [12] above). These arguments therefore fall by the wayside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 With regard to the Defendant’s contention in [15(c)] above, this is essentially an argument of duplicity of proceedings between a civil court and the Syariah Court. In the parliamentary debates on the Administration of Muslim Law (Amendment) Bill (No 18 of 1998) (“the Bill”), the Minister who moved the Bill explained the rationale behind the proposed amendments formally conferring the High Court with concurrent jurisdiction over certain matters that may be heard by the Syariah Court, as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Deb</span><span class="font-italic">ates</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Official Report </span>(30 June 1998) vol 69 at col 443 (Abdullah Tamugi, Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Let me reiterate that this Bill seeks to enable established practices which have worked satisfactorily to continue. What the Bill proposes is that, as a base, the Syariah Court would have jurisdiction over all matters presently within its jurisdiction where the parties are Muslims or were married according to Muslim law. However, parties can agree to go to the Civil Courts for disputes over maintenance, custody of children and division of matrimonial property. Where there is no agreement, a Muslim party can only go to the Civil Courts if he first obtains leave from the Syariah Court. A grant of such leave by the Syariah Court can be challenged. Ultimately, the Syariah Court’s Appeal Board will decide on the issue. To avoid duplicity of proceedings, the Bill provides that where one court has jurisdiction over a matter, the other court will cease to have any jurisdiction over that matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I consider it important to state my respectful view that one of the key (and perhaps quite fairly unspoken) principles of interpreting parliamentary debates reports is that the reader must always be open to appreciate that speeches made in Parliament are often – and indeed usually necessarily – pitched at a certain level of generality given the limited time within which Parliament must hope to discuss and debate important issues of law, policy and governance optimally. The legislative amendments flowing from the Bill under consideration in the present case is no exception, all the more so given that the Bill supplements and the Act supplements surrounding the Bill clearly and unambiguously demonstrate that, at the granular level of the legislative amendments, duplicity of proceedings between the High Court and the Syariah Court is precluded for several save for one specified category of matters. This ‘excepted’ category is that which precisely pertains to “disposition or division or property on divorce”, where High Court civil proceedings were commenced <span class="font-italic">before</span> Syariah Court divorce proceedings are commenced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Perhaps the clearest testament and illustration of this is manifested in the juxtaposition of subsection 35A(1) with subsection 35A(2) in the AMLA. Both of these provisions were, among others, introduced to the AMLA following the passing of the Bill:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Leave to commence or continue civil proceedings involving disposition or division of property on divorce or custody of children</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">35A.</span>—(1) Any person who, <span class="font-italic font-underline">on or after the commencement of proceedings for divorce in the [</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">Syariah] Court</span> or after the making of a decree or order for divorce by the [Syariah] Court or on or after the registration of a divorce under section 102, <span class="font-italic font-underline">intends to commence civil proceedings</span> in any court involving any matter relating to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the disposition or division of property on divorce or custody of any child</span> where the parties are Muslims or were married under the provisions of the Muslim law, <span class="font-italic font-underline">shall apply to the [</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">Syariah] Court for leave to commence the civil proceedings</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-italic font-underline">Where proceedings for divorce are commenced in the [</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">Syariah] Court</span> or a decree or order for divorce is made by the [Syariah] Court or a divorce is registered under section 102 <span class="font-italic font-underline">after civil proce</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">edings between the same parties are commenced</span> in any court involving any matter relating to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">the custody of any child</span>, any party who intends to continue the civil proceedings <span class="font-italic font-underline">shall apply to the [</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">Syariah] Court for leave to continue the civil proceedings</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[all emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In the light of the above legislative context, the Defendant’s suggestion that it may be an “abuse of process” that the subject matter to be determined between the Civil Proceedings and Syariah Court proceedings “is one and the same” therefore cuts no ice since the legislature had by legislative drafting clearly allowed an ‘excepted’ category of matters (<span class="font-italic">viz. </span>the “disposition or division or property on divorce”) to still hold in spite of its intention to apply a general policy of non-duplicity of proceedings vis-à-vis matters falling within the concurrent jurisdiction of the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This leads me to the Defendant’s contentions in [15(d)] and [15(e)] above, which are essentially arguments of exclusivity of the Syariah Court’s jurisdiction. It is true that the High Court will not apply principles of Muslim law in the determination of interests in matrimonial properties between parties who are Muslims or who were married under the provisions of Muslim law (see section 17A(7) of the SCJA which provides that “the High Court, in exercising its jurisdiction or powers under [section 17A(2) of the SCJA], shall apply the civil law”). However, it would be a mistake in my view to argue that continuation of the Civil Proceedings “would be against Parliament’s intention to empower the Syariah Court to have exclusive jurisdiction over divorce matters involving Muslims”. That the High Court has concurrent jurisdiction over certain matters with the Syariah Court is to me beyond argument, following the 1999 legislative amendments to the SCJA which expressly conferred on the High Court the jurisdiction to hear and try any civil proceedings involving, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the “disposition or division of property on divorce”. In fact, one might even consider this point to have become so trite that one needs to look no further than two cases recently decided at the High Court level in this regard: see <span class="font-italic">TMO v TMP </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1198 at [6]-[10] and <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shariff Valibhoy and others v Arif Valibhoy </span>[2016] 2 SLR 301 at [87]-[89].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In any case, even if the concern underlying the Defendant’s contentions in [15(d)] and [15(e)] above is to be understood as a concern about having conflicting outcomes in the High Court and the Syariah Court in the “disposition or division of property on divorce”, it is doubted whether such concern realistically rises to such a level as to justify a stay of the Civil Proceedings in the present case. Returning to the parliamentary debates on the Bill, the concern regarding any potential conflicting outcomes between the two courts was specifically addressed by the speakers who rose in support of the Bill. Then Senior Minister of State for the Environment Mr Sidek Bin Saniff said in Parliament (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Official Report </span>(15 April 1999) vol 70 at col 1261 (Sidek Bin Saniff, Senior Minister of State for the Environment)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yes, there were concerns expressed on the question of AMLA proposing to allow the Civil Courts to hear ancillary matters on divorce. <span class="font-italic">True, there are areas where the Civil Courts handling ancillary divorce matters could end up </span><span class="font-italic">unIslamic in nature, but as explained by Minister Abdullah, they are marginal and there will be sufficient safeguards to avoid such pitfalls. </span>Meanwhile, there is a lot more to gain when Muslim Singaporeans are allowed to benefit from vast state resources available from the Civil Courts. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Then nominated Member of Parliament Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin shared the same view (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Official Report </span>(15 April 1999) vol 70 at col 1262 (Zulkifli Bin Baharudin, Nominated Member of Parliament)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many Singaporeans may be unaware and ignorant of the fact that whenever a case involving matrimonial property and custody is being decided in court and given wide publicity in the press, there is great anxiety and apprehension amongst the Malay-Muslim population because of the concern that the decisions taken by the Civil Court may be in conflict with Islam. <span class="font-italic">Many Muslims have the perception that there are wide differences between Muslim and civil laws although, in actual fact, there are only slight, if any, differences between </span><span class="font-italic">Syariah and civil laws relating to the maintenance, custody and division of property on divorce</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Furthermore, speaking on the Select Committee’s report on the Bill, then Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Mr Abdullah Tamugi took pains to put concerns regarding potential conflicting outcomes between the two courts to rest by explaining as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Official Report </span>(15 April 1999) vol 70 at col 1249 and 1270 (Abdullah Tarmugi, Minister for Community Development and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…] [T]he [Select] Committee finds little cause for concern over possible conflict between Civil and Syariah laws if ancillary matters were heard in the Civil Courts. Some representors, for example, were particularly concerned over how Civil law would apply to disputes on the custody of Muslim children. The [Select] Committee consulted the Attorney-General’s Chambers, Muslim lawyers who practise in civil courts and Syariah Court and MUIS and found that there are no differences in basic principles between Syariah law and the Guardianship of Infants Act, as both consider the welfare of the child to be of paramount importance. The AMLA, in addition, also specifically provides for the Civil Courts, in cases where religious issues could be a consideration, to seek advice from the Legal (or Fatwa) Committee of MUIS.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Bill has gone through extensive consultations, study and discussions by individuals, organisations and experts and among the Malay MPs and the institutions concerned. I accept that not everyone would accept every amendment to AMLA. Indeed, I think it is unreasonable for us to expect this. But I am, Sir, comforted by the fact that almost everyone agrees that, as a whole, the amendments serve to strengthen the Syariah Court and also MUIS, the two important institutions to Muslims here. […]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Indeed, in my respectful view, should there ever come a point in time in any civil proceedings when the High Court hearing a matter involving the “disposition or division of property on divorce” finds it appropriate to consider any principle of Muslim law, there is every reason and confidence in our system to believe that the High Court, having as it must the cognizance of the potential sensitivities involved, will fully avail itself of any opportunity as permitted by law to be apprised of the relevant principle of Muslim law in order to arrive at a more enlightened decision applying the civil law. Such an approach conceivably can be undertaken pursuant to section 32(7) of the AMLA which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If in any court any question of the Muslim law falls for decision, and such court requests the opinion of the Majlis on the question, the question shall be referred to the Legal Committee [of the Majlis] which shall, for and on behalf and in the name of the Majlis, give its opinion thereon in accordance with the opinion of the majority of its members, and certify such opinion to the requesting court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27  For the reasons above, I therefore find that the submissions made on behalf of the Defendant are not compelling enough to move this court to order a discretionary stay of the Civil Proceedings pursuant to its “inherent powers” under O 92 r 4 of the ROC, having regard to the touchstone of “need” laid down in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim </span>(see [16(d)] above). This failure on the part of the Defendant is itself sufficient for me to dispose of Issue Two without the need to rule on the merits of the Plaintiff’s allegation of bad faith made against the Defendant (see [16(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 For completeness, I consider it useful to also state for the record that in arriving at my decision on Issue Two, I have carefully considered and dismissed the notion that the expression “disposition or division of property <span class="font-italic">on divorce</span>” (emphasis added) in section 17A(2)(c) of the SCJA means that the High Court can only exercise its civil jurisdiction over matters involving disposition or division of property <span class="font-italic">after</span> a divorce is ordered or registered pursuant to the provisions of the AMLA. Although none of the parties in the present case appears to have suggested so, such a strict interpretation of the expression cannot in my opinion be sustainable. This is because the same identical expression which also appears in section 52(3)(d) of the AMLA – a provision in relation to which the High Court has concurrent jurisdiction – does not bear out such a narrow and restricted meaning at all:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Provisions consequent on matrimonial proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">52.</span>—(1) […]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The [Syariah] Court may, <span class="font-italic font-underline">at any </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">stage of the proceedings for divorce</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>or nullity of marriage or after making a decree or order for divorce or nullity of marriage, or after any divorce has been registered under section 102 before 1st March 2009, on the application of any party, make such orders as it thinks fit with respect to —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the payment of emas kahwin and marriage expenses (hantaran belanja) to the wife;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the payment of a consolatory gift or mutaah to the wife;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the custody, maintenance and education of the minor children of the parties; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) <span class="font-italic font-underline">the disposition or division of property on divorce</span> or nullification of marriage.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in underlined italics added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In conclusion, I find that there can be no mandatory stay of the Civil Proceedings given that the facts of the present case do not fall within the scope of section 17A(3)(a) of the SCJA.
