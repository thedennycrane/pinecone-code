His contention is that Article 2(2)(b) specifies a <span class="font-italic">fixed amount</span> of BXA Coins, whereas Article 2(2)(a) specifies a <span class="font-italic">limit</span>.

That is echoed in Article 3 which provides that funds collected from the issuance of the BXA Coin, or increased share capital, shall be used primarily for making the payments for BTHMB’s Bithumb Korea acquisition (see [13] above). Dr Kim’s contention that Article 2(2)(b) allowed SGBK to give 20% of the BXA Coin for <span class="font-italic">free</span> to anyone (in the event, Dr Kim himself) goes against the grain of Article 2(2)(a) (and Article 3), which are about the raising of funds for BTHMB’s Bithumb Korea acquisition .</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Dr Kim says that the intention was to give him 25% of the total number of BXA Coins for free: 20% under Article 2(2)(b), and 5% under Article 2(3).

</div> I do not accept this. Article 2(3) refers to 5% of the total number of BXA Coins being allotted / allocated to SGBK and 5% to Mr JH Lee, but unlike Article 2(2)(b), the allotment / allocation in Article 2(3) is not said to be “in accordance with” or “pursuant to” Article 2(2)(a). If the parties had intended to give Dr Kim 25% of the total number of BXA Coins, they could simply have said so in Article 2(3) rather than to split the 25% into: 5% going to SGBK under Article 2(3), and 20% going to Dr Kim (as the recipient SGBK might designate) under Article 2(2)(b) read with Article 2(2)(a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Dr Kim tries to explain the reference in Article 2(2)(b) to Article 2(2)(a), by saying that 20% of the total number of BXA Coins would go to him for free under Article 2(2)(b) to incentivise him to raise funds for BTHMB under Article 2(2)(a).

</div>
</div> If that were so, it would have been stated as such. The “incentive” also makes no sense. Article 2(2)(b) does not make entitlement to 20% of all BXA Coins conditional upon Dr Kim doing anything. On Dr Kim’s case, he could simply keep 20% of the total number of BXA Coins for free under Article 2(2)(b) (and a further 5% under Article 2(3)) – even if he did not raise any funds for BTHMB, and indeed even if he made no efforts to do so. BTHMB would then have parted with 25% of the total number of BXA Coins for nothing in return. Gifting all these BXA Coins to Dr Kim would make no commercial sense for BTHMB. Instead, it was evidently the intention of BTHMB to use up to 20% of the total number of BXA Coins to attract financial investors, thereby raising funds to meet BTHMB’s payment obligations under the Bithumb SPA (as stated in Articles 2(2)(a) and 3 of the CIA) (see [41] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I have found that besides 44,543,429 HDAC Coins, Dr Kim received US$22,837,919 in sale proceeds from the sale of 547,696,364 (or, at least, 547,696,363) BXA Coins (at [32] above). The BXA Coins sold amounted to some 2.74% of the 20 billion BXA Coins that were generated. Putting the HDAC Coins to one side, if a full 20% of BXA Coins (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 4 billion BXA Coins)<span class="font-italic"> </span>could be sold at the same pricing, that would yield some US$166,792,555.15 in sale proceeds (4 billion x US$22,837,919 / 547,696,364). It makes no commercial sense to say that Dr Kim could keep all that for himself (and more, if the 5% to SGBK under Article 2(3) of the CIA were also included), leaving BTHMB to fend for itself in the Bithumb Korea acquisition. It should be noted that by the time of the BXA Coins were issued, BTHMB was no longer a vehicle that Dr Kim was the sole ultimate beneficial owner of – by then, Mr JH Lee had become a shareholder in BTHMB’s parent company BKSG, as envisaged in the 12 October 2018 transaction documents: see [11] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The focus of the CIA was on BTHMB raising funds to meet its payment obligations for the Bithumb Korea acquisition, not on giving Dr Kim BXA Coins for free; yet Dr Kim contends that all of the BXA Coins sold by Oran G belonged to him (and consequently that the sale proceeds were his too), and so too the BXA Coins that Dr Kim says he sold through another broker (Harbour). On Dr Kim’s case, he was ahead of BTHMB in the queue, and BTHMB did not manage to sell any of <span class="font-italic">its</span> BXA Coins to raise funds for the Bithumb Korea acquisition. I find Dr Kim’s interpretation of the CIA to be untenable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For completeness, I note that the CIA also states: “Major Shareholder, Investor, BK SG and Company are hereinafter referred to as “Party” individually, or “Parties” collectively.” Moreover, the CIA defines “Major Shareholder” as SGBK, “Investor” as Mr JH Lee, and “Company” as a collective reference to BTHMB and BKSG (see [14] above).

However, neither Dr Kim nor BTHMB regarded the word “Party” in Article 2(2)(b) to be limited to those four persons; they instead appeared to accept that “Party” in Article 2(2)(b) could encompass others that SGBK might decide to allot / allocate BXA Coins to (and I agree with them on this). In particular, Dr Kim contended he was allocated the BXA Coin issued by BTHMB pursuant to Article 2(2)(b) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the word “Party” in Article 2(2)(b) referred to him, even though he was not one of those defined as a “Party” in the CIA).

</div> it says nothing about the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the payments: were they payments of sale proceeds, loans, gifts, payments of share capital, etc? All these types of payments would have achieved Dr Kim’s <span class="font-italic">objective</span> of allowing BTHMB to meet its obligations, but the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the payments would differ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 A simple example will illustrate the point: consider a person who borrows $1m from a bank, then uses the borrowed money to place a fixed deposit of the same amount with the same bank. His payment of $1m to the bank to place the fixed deposit does not discharge his liability to the bank for the bank loan he took. Rather, there are then two loans in existence: (1) he owes the bank $1m and interest on the loan he took; and the bank owes him $1m and interest on the fixed deposit he placed. His payment of $1m to the bank was not <span class="font-italic">meant</span> by him to discharge his bank loan – it was meant as a fixed deposit, and that is the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Returning to the present case, in his evidence Dr Kim does not say he meant the Ten Defence Transactions as payments of the sale proceeds of the BXA Coins. Indeed, for him to say that would be inconsistent with his primary case that the BXA Coin sale proceeds belonged to him, and he was under no obligation to pay the sale proceeds over to BTHMB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Dr Kim thus finds himself in the awkward situation of trying to prove that the Ten Defence Transactions were payments of sale proceeds, whilst not saying that is what he meant them to be. He tried to navigate this by tracing the <span class="font-italic">source</span> of some of the Defence Transactions to the sale proceeds that he had received. He relied on the expert opinion of Mr Wong Joo Wan (“Mr Wong”), who had concluded that US$18,490,836.92 of the sale proceeds was transferred to BTHMB.

As noted above at [88] and [91], the <span class="font-italic">source</span> of a payment does not necessarily determine its <span class="font-italic">nature</span>. BTHMB correctly regarded US$50m of what it received as payments by (or on behalf of) its shareholder, BKSG, to increase BTHMB’s share capital.

In particular, he pleaded that he had arranged for a further US$43,500,000 from his own funds to be paid to BTHMB by way of an investment by him in a fund called “Winners Fund”, which paid the said sum to a company called BMC Global Limited (which in turn paid the sum of US$41,039,995 to BTHMB on or around 8 February 2019 for shares in BTHMB).
