The relevant provision is s 7 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2010 (Cap 178A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“MHCTA”). Upon apprehension, the person must be taken without delay either directly to a designated medical practitioner at a psychiatric institution or first to any medical practitioner who may refer the person onward to a designated medical practitioner at a psychiatric institution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Police officers are not themselves required to have medical or psychiatric training. Thus, their belief that a person has a mental disorder and for that reason is a danger is necessarily a lay one. It relies only on common understanding, experience as a police officer and any general training received to better equip police officers to make such assessments. It must be an honest belief, held on grounds that are reasonable judged in terms of general lay and not specialised medical understanding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The police officer enforcing this provision is additionally protected from liability to civil or criminal proceedings “unless he has acted in bad faith or without reasonable care”: see s 25(1) of the MHCTA. Indeed, before any such proceedings can be brought, leave must be sought from the court, and “leave shall not be granted unless the court is satisfied that there is substantial ground for the contention that the person, against whom it is sought to bring the proceedings, has acted in bad faith or without reasonable care”: see s 25(2) of the MHCTA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 These proceedings, brought by the plaintiff, Mah Kiat Seng (“Mah”), concern two distinct claims. The first is that he was wrongly apprehended and hence falsely imprisoned as a result of the apprehending officer’s lies that Mah had been mumbling or speaking to himself, told the officer he had obsessive-compulsive disorder (“OCD”) and spat into a plastic bag. The second is that he suffered injury at the hands of a different officer at the lock up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 When leave was sought to bring these proceedings, it was refused at first instance: see <span class="font-italic">Mah Kiat Seng </span><span class="font-italic">v Attorney-General and others</span> [2020] 3 SLR 918 (“<span class="font-italic">Mah No</span><span class="font-italic">. 1</span>”). The learned Judge refused leave in respect of the first claim because there was no basis to suggest that the apprehending officer had lied. On the contrary, it was corroborated by the notes of the medical practitioner at the lock up: <span class="font-italic">Mah No. </span><span class="font-italic">1</span> at [70]. In respect of the second claim, she refused leave because that officer said he had had no verbal or physical contact with Mah on the night in question, and this was confirmed by the investigating officer: <span class="font-italic">Mah No. 1 </span>at [81].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Mah appealed, and when the Attorney-General’s Chambers upon review of certain video evidence discovered that in relation to the second claim, the officer concerned, contrary to what was represented to the Judge at first instance, had had occasion to escort Mah at the lock up on that night, they consented to the appeal being allowed and leave being granted for these proceedings to be brought, including on the first claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 During the course of these proceedings, I dealt with the video evidence, including whether it was privileged: see <span class="font-italic">Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney-General and others</span> [2022] 3 SLR 890 (“<span class="font-italic">Mah No. </span><span class="font-italic">2</span>”)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Further viewing of relevant video evidence by the apprehending officer led him to note an error concerning the contents of the affidavit he had affirmed for the purpose of the leave application, namely his assertion that Mah had been “mumbling to himself at times”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The construction of s 7 of the MHCTA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 From parties’ submissions, there are four aspects of the section that arise for potential decision, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether and when the police must inform the person apprehended of the grounds of apprehension.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether there must first be a report by someone else to the police officer to the effect that the person is or appears to be mentally disordered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Whether the belief that a danger is posed must be held on reasonable grounds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) How imminent the believed danger must be.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Grounds of apprehension</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The AG accepts that the person apprehended must be informed of the grounds of his apprehension but contends that this need only be done as soon as reasonably practicable. The AG further accepts by analogy with the law concerning arrest in relation to criminal offences that if the person is not informed, in substance, of the reason why restraints have been imposed on his freedom, the apprehending officer may be liable for false imprisonment. The AG cites the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Christie v Leachinsky</span> [1947] AC 573.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I hold that a police officer who apprehends an individual under s 7 of the MHCTA must inform him of the broad grounds of apprehension but need only do so as soon as reasonably practicable. I add that as part of explaining the purpose of apprehension, the police officer should also explain to him the next steps, including that the person will be brought for assessment by a medical practitioner. The rationale for this is not merely the practical one that it will calm and reassure the person apprehended to know clearly that he is proceeding to see a doctor and is not under arrest for a criminal offence but also the point of principle that by virtue of Art 9 of the Constitution a person is entitled not to be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law. The individual’s right to refuse to submit to such deprivation of liberty changes to a duty to submit upon lawful arrest. The person involved must be told of his arrest and in substance why he is being arrested so that he then understands he must submit to the arrest. Thus, Art 9(4) of the Constitution requires that where a person is arrested, they be informed “as soon as may be” of the grounds of arrest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I do not accept Mah’s submission that the grounds of apprehension must be immediately informed to the person apprehended. This would impose a more onerous requirement than that of Art 9(4) of the Constitution. It may simply not be practical to do so immediately. When is as soon as reasonably practicable depends on the circumstances of the case, including the present mental state of the person apprehended.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Prior report</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The phrase “reported to be mentally disordered” used in s 7 of the MHCTA could in my view bear two interpretations. One is the narrow sense of “reported” where someone would have had to report to the police officer that the person was mentally disordered. The second is the broader sense of “reported” which merely connotes that something appears to be the case but it has not been proven to be so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the latter, broader meaning furthers the legislative purpose while the former narrower one does not. One purpose of s 7 of the MHCTA is public safety. It serves to protect the public from danger potentially posed by mentally disordered persons. The other purpose is to protect mentally disordered persons themselves through the prompt intervention of a police officer. There is no logic in requiring a police officer to act where a mentally disordered person is about to harm others if he hears a report of this from someone else but not where he merely observes and perceives it himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Support for not imposing a distinct condition of there being a prior report may be found in how a similar phrase in the UK Lunacy Act 1890 was construed by Devlin LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Buxton v Jayne</span> [1960] 1 WLR 783. The phrase used there was “alleged to be of unsound mind”. The existence of the allegation was, on the face of the section, a requirement additional to the officer’s belief that the person was of unsound mind. Devlin LJ suggested that “it would be pedantic to investigate as a distinct matter whether the person was alleged to be in that condition” (at 793).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 My reading of the section is further supported by its legislative history and by a subsequent amendment to it. In terms of legislative history, prior to 1973, the position was as reflected in the original s 32 of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act 1965 (“MDTA 1965”), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that police officers had the duty to apprehend two classes of persons: “all persons found wandering at large who are reported to be of unsound mind <span class="font-italic">and</span> all persons believed to be dangerous to themselves or other persons by reason of unsoundness of mind” [emphasis added]. As explained by Mr Chua Sian Chin (then Minister for Health and Home Affairs) during the Second Reading of the Mental Disorders and Treatment (Amendment) Bill (No 32 of 1973) (“1973 Bill”), the provisions introduced by the 1973 Bill were intended to “bring the law up-to-date in regard to the admission and detention … of persons of unsound mind in a mental hospital”. Hence, while “the emphasis in 1934 was on the compulsory detention of persons of unsound mind … to prevent such persons from causing harm to the community”, “[t]he modern trend is to regard mental illness in much the same light as physical illness and disability” and “towards community care” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (28 August 1973) vol 32 at col 1274).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The two categories were folded into one so that only persons posing a danger would be subject to apprehension. The first point is that in the first of the earlier categories of “persons found wandering at large who are reported to be of unsound mind”, the word “reported” is quite obviously used in its broader sense. The second point is that folding the two categories into one eliminated any duty on the part of police officers to apprehend mentally disordered persons in the community who posed <span class="font-italic">no</span> danger to themselves and others. The purpose of the amendment was not to limit the previous duty of apprehending all mentally disordered persons who did pose such a danger by an additional requirement of some form of prior report to the officer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I note that after the events with which these proceedings are concerned, s 7 of the MHCTA was, from 1 January 2020, amended by s 180 of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (Act 15 of 2019) to state as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Apprehension of mentally disordered person</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span>––(1)   It shall be the duty of every police officer or special police officer to apprehend any person believed to be dangerous to himself or such other persons and such danger is reasonably suspected to be attributable to a mental disorder and take the person together with a report of the facts of the case without delay to ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">any medical practitioner for an examination and the medical practitioner may thereafter act in accordance with section 9; or</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any designated medical practitioner at a psychiatric institution and the designated medical practitioner may thereafter act in accordance with section 10.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)   For the purposes of and without limiting subsection (1) ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a police officer’s or special police officer’s reasonable belief that a person is doing or about to do an act which is dangerous to himself is sufficient basis for the police officer’s or special police officer’s reasonable suspicion that the danger to that person is attributable to a mental disorder; and</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) “special police officer” has the same meaning as in section 2 of the Police Force Act (Cap. 235).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44  This amendment entailed two changes. First, the element of a report was removed. Secondly, the element of belief that the danger existed by reason of mental disorder was changed to its being reasonably suspected to be attributable to a mental disorder. While the relevant purpose or Parliamentary intention is to be found at the time the law was enacted (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [35]), a later amendment may sometimes shed light on how the earlier version should be construed. This amendment was largely clarificatory. Its removal of the phrase “reported to be” simply showed that it was not a separate or distinct element, but an unneeded phrase that meant nothing more than “apparent”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Belief held on reasonable grounds</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Turning to whether the police officer’s belief must be held on reasonable grounds, I agree, as the AG has accepted, that he must not only subjectively and honestly believe that the person apprehended poses a danger to himself or others because of his mental disorder but must also have reasonable grounds for that belief. Those reasonable grounds are to be assessed in terms of a lay person’s general understanding. Further, the fact that the section is phrased in terms of a “duty” and not a “power” underlines the legislative concern with public safety, and enjoins a court to give considerable latitude to the police officer’s consideration of reasonable grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I return to the legislative history to note one further point. A change took place in 1985. Section 7 of the MHCTA broadened the category of persons to whom it might potentially apply. Where s 32 of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act 1985 (Cap 178, 1985 Rev Ed) (“MDTA 1985”) and its predecessors used the phrase “unsoundness of mind”, s 7 uses the phrase “mental disorder”. Where “unsound mind” was not defined in the MDTA 1985 (or the earlier provisions), the introduction of “mental disorder” in s 7 of the MHCTA was accompanied by a broad definition of “mental disorder” in s 2 of the MHCTA (see [27] above).  During the Second Reading of the 2008 Bill, then Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan (“Minister Khaw”), explained the change. He noted that the MHCTA defined mental disorder “very widely” because “mental disorder covers a very wide range of mental illnesses” and “the objective of [the] Bill is to ensure that those mentally ill patients who require institutionalised psychiatric care are accorded prompt treatment” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 September 2008) vol 85 at cols 93–94). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Danger </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The AG has contended that it is sufficient if there is danger to property. I do not agree. The provision makes no mention of property damage. Thus, the danger apprehended must be to person. Danger to others however extends beyond the risk of actual physical harm to behaviour that is threatening or grossly invasive of personal space. This would include running at people or moving into close proximity with another person and then shouting. Indeed, if any actual damage to property occurs this may reasonably be perceived in the circumstances as a precursor to violence against persons and so found a belief that the person who has damaged property is a danger to others. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I also consider that the use of the word “danger” implies a degree of imminence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that without the police officer’s intervention such behaviour is likely to occur within a short time, which I would consider to be a matter of hours rather than days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The legislative history to s 7 of the MHCTA supports my reading that the word “dangerous” in the provision conveys an imminent risk of physical harm to persons. The Mental Disorders Ordinance 1935 was “probably modelled on the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act, 1930, of England and Wales” (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (28 August 1973) vol 32 at col 1274), which in turn amended several provisions of the Lunacy Acts 1890 to 1922 and the Mental Deficiency Acts 1913 to 1927 that do not presently concern us. Pertinently, s 32 of the Mental Disorders Ordinance 1935 marked a departure from s 15 of the Lunacy Act 1890, which I reproduce below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Lunacy Act, 1890</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Lunatic wandering at large to be brought before a justice.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15.</span>––(1.)  Every constable and relieving officer and every overseer of a parish who has knowledge that any person (whether a pauper or not) wandering at large within the district or parish of the constable, relieving officer, or overseer is deemed to be a lunatic, shall immediately apprehend and take the alleged lunatic, or cause him to be apprehended and taken, before a justice. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2.) Any justice, upon the information upon oath of any person that a person wandering at large within the limits of his jurisdiction is deemed to be a lunatic, may by order require a constable, relieving officer, or overseer of the district or parish where the alleged lunatic is, to apprehend him, and bring him before the justice making the order, or any justice having jurisdiction where the alleged lunatic is.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Thus, s 15 of the Lunacy Act 1890 did not stipulate that the person apprehended must be believed to be dangerous but merely that a constable (among specified others) might apprehend a lunatic, defined as “an idiot or person of unsound mind”, if he is “wandering at large”. The requirement that the person apprehended be believed to be dangerous in s 32 of the Mental Disorders Ordinance 1935 was only introduced in that Ordinance. To this extent, the English jurisprudence surrounding the Lunacy Act 1890 is of limited utility. Of much greater import are the parliamentary debates on the local Ordinances and Acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Of such parliamentary debates, those on the 2008 Bill are particularly instructive concerning what is meant by the word “danger”. Then Member of Parliament for Jurong Group Representation Constituency, Mdm Halimah Yacob, sought clarification on what constitutes dangerous behaviour for the purpose of s 7 of the MHCTA. In response, Minister Khaw stated that “[d]angerous behaviour may include arming oneself with a knife or other sharp object, threatening others, or putting oneself in a precarious position, for example, climbing out of the window to stand on the parapet”. At the same time, “[s]ome of [the] social nuisance does not equate to dangerous behaviour [but] simply means that the person is unwell” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (15 September 2008) vol 85 at cols 68, 104–105). It is noteworthy that Minister Khaw cited instances where an individual poses a risk of imminent physical harm to himself or others as examples of dangerous behaviour and contrasted this with “social nuisance”. This supports the natural meaning of “danger” which connotes something more than socially odd or eccentric behaviour that makes others feel uncomfortable. There must be a reasonably imminent risk of physical harm to the person apprehended or others.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Mah was informed of the grounds of his apprehension</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It is undisputed that Ong informed Mah of the grounds of his apprehension twice: first in the police car from Suntec City to the RLU and after Mah arrived at the carpark of the RLU.

</div> Importantly, this case note made the day after shows not only that Rosli had asserted that Mah was “mumbling to himself” but that this fact was considered by IO Tan to be relevant to the assessment whether Mah had any mental disorder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 My conclusion is supported by common sense. Being agitated, defensive or inconsistent may well be the responses of a person of perfectly sound mind who is questioned by the police. It was the element of mumbling to himself that indicated to persons untrained in psychiatric disorder that Mah might be suffering from a mental disorder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I find that Rosli made up the observation that Mah was “mumbling to himself” and made it on the night of the apprehension. This was not his only embellishment. Rosli also claimed that Mah spat into a plastic bag but this was not captured on the BWC footage nor was any plastic bag containing spit found later. I do not accept the AG’s submission that such a despoiled bag might have been in Mah’s bag but was overlooked by the police when they searched it at the lock up. Rosli further claimed that Mah described himself as “OCD”. Mah has denied doing so. No such description was captured on the BWC footage although there were some interactions that were not captured because the battery apparently ran out. However, on this point I again accept Mah’s account. Having heard Mah both as witness and litigant-in-person, this is not the sort of description Mah is likely to have applied to himself. Moreover, it is hard to see how a person describing themselves as OCD would fortify even a lay person’s belief that that person was dangerous by reason of mental disorder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I conclude that Rosli did not have an honest belief that Mah was a danger to other persons by reason of mental disorder. I find that Mah’s behaviour as shown in the BWC footage did not suggest that he was dangerous to others, and as far as soundness of mind is concerned only showed a degree of eccentricity falling far short of appearing mentally disordered. Such eccentric mannerisms however can come across as disrespectful to someone lacking experience or perspective. I find on a balance of probabilities that Rosli, knowing that he had no power to arrest Mah for the matter complained of because it was not an arrestable offence, took a dislike to Mah for his apparently disrespectful conduct, including not handing his identity card directly to him. This is what motivated him to come up with the assertions that Mah was mumbling to himself and spat into a plastic bag.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Rosli is nonetheless entitled to rely on s 25(1) of the MHCTA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Mah’s position is that Rosli is not entitled to rely on s 25(1) of the MHCTA as he had acted in bad faith. In particular, Mah contends that Rosli made up the claim that Mah was mumbling to himself as a pretext to apprehend Mah. There was no evidence that Mah was mumbling to himself.
