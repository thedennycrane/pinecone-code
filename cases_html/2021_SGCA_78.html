Whereas the respondent is seeking to have the issue determined in Singapore, the appellants seek to have it determined in Malaysia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 As part of the appellants’ efforts to halt the Singapore proceedings, they applied to the Singapore High Court for recognition of certain Malaysian proceedings under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (30 May 1997) (“the Model Law”), given the force of law in Singapore via s 252 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (Act 40 of 2018) (“IRDA”). For convenience, we shall refer to the Model Law as enacted in Singapore as “the SG Model Law”. The appellants contended that upon recognition of the Malaysian Proceedings as either a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding” pursuant to the SG Model Law there should be a stay of the Singapore proceeding. In his oral grounds of decision rendered on 12 January 2021, the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) recognised one of the Malaysian proceedings as being a “foreign main proceeding” covered by the SG Model Law, but nevertheless declined to grant a stay of the Singapore proceeding. Dissatisfied, the appellants appealed against the Judge’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 We heard and dismissed the appeal on 7 May 2021. As the principles applicable to recognition of foreign proceedings under the SG Model Law and the effects of such recognition have not been fully explored in local jurisprudence, this appeal afforded us an opportunity to consider such principles, having regard to the UNCITRAL authorities, textbooks, as well as foreign case law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Before we go on to discuss the facts and issues in this appeal, it may be helpful to make some brief comments on the Model Law. The account that follows is a paraphrase of the account in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: The Judicial Perspective</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>UN Doc A/CN.9/732 and Add 1–3 (2014) as updated in 2013 (see<span class="font-italic"> UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency: The Judicial Perspective: Note by the Secretariat</span>, UN Doc A/CN.9/778 (2013))<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">The Judicial Perspective</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Model Law was developed by UNCITRAL and endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1997. The Model Law does not lay down any substantive principles of insolvency law; those are governed by the domestic laws of the individual jurisdictions. Instead, it provides procedural<span class="font-underline"> </span>mechanisms to facilitate more efficient disposition of cases in which the insolvent debtor has assets or debts in more than one jurisdiction. The SG Model Law therefore gives effect to four principles:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the “access principle” which sets out the circumstances in which a “foreign representative” of an insolvent debtor has rights of access to the Singapore courts in order to seek recognition and relief;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the “recognition” principle which deals with the Singapore courts’ recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings as either a foreign “main” or “non-main” proceeding;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the “relief” principle which deals with both interim and permanent relief that the Singapore court may provide after it recognises foreign proceedings as “main” or “non-main”; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the cooperation and coordination principle which obliges courts and insolvency representatives in different jurisdictions to communicate with each other and cooperate to ensure the fair administration of the debtor’s estate.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Most relevant for present purposes are the recognition principle and the relief principle. These prescribe the circumstances in which insolvency proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction should be recognised by Singapore courts and be given effect to by the imposition of a stay of local proceedings against the debtor in question. Such recognition is only given to those proceedings which qualify as a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding”. The definitions of these terms as set out in Art 2 of the SG Model Law are set out below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Article 2. Definitions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the purposes of this Law —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) ‘foreign main proceeding’ means a foreign proceeding taking place in the State where the debtor has its centre of main interests;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) ‘foreign non-main proceeding’ means a foreign proceeding, other than a foreign main proceeding, taking place in a State where the debtor has an establishment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) ‘foreign proceeding’ means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign State, including an interim proceeding, under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment or debt in which proceeding the property and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Once the court holds that the relevant foreign proceeding meets either of these definitions, then the provisions of Arts 20 and 21 of the SG Model Law come into play. Articles 20 and 21 read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Article 20.

The second appellant is Robert Teo Keng Tuan, USSB’s liquidator. USSB is the beneficial owner of all the issued shares in City Centre Sdn Bhd (in liquidation) (“CCSB”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USSB which had been wound up by the Malaysian court on 25 April 2000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The respondent is United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”), a Singapore bank. USSB is indebted to UOB and that debt is purportedly secured by a charge over USSB’s shares in CCSB (“the CCSB Shares”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Loan Agreement and the Debenture</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 17 December 1982, Overseas Union Bank Ltd (“OUB”) and USSB entered into a loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) for OUB to provide USSB with certain credit facilities. On the same date, USSB executed a deed of debenture (“the Debenture”) which created a fixed charge (“the Charge”) in OUB’s favour over all of the CCSB Shares. The following clauses of the Loan Agreement are pertinent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 25.1 provided that the Loan Agreement and the Debenture “shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of Singapore”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 25.2 provided that USSB “irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceedings against it with respect to [the Loan] Agreement and the Debenture may be brought in the courts of Singapore” and that USSB “irrevocably submits … to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the [Singapore] courts”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 25.6 provided that USSB “irrevocably waives any objection … to the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to [the Loan] Agreement … selected by [UOB] and … further irrevocably waives any claim that the venue so selected is not a convenient forum for any such suit, action or proceeding”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 27 December 1982, the CCSB Shares which were then registered in the name of USSB were transferred to and registered in the sole name of OUB Nominees (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd pursuant to the Debenture. OUB Nominees (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd subsequently changed its name to UOB Nominees 2006 (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd (“UOB Nominees”). At the time of the appeal before us, UOB Nominees remained the registered holder of the CCSB Shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 19 December 1983, USSB defaulted on the loan granted by OUB. In May 1985, pursuant to the Loan Agreement and the Debenture, receivers were appointed over the properties and assets of USSB charged to OUB. In 2002, following OUB’s merger with UOB, UOB took over all of OUB’s interest in the Loan Agreement and the Debenture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The winding up of CCSB and USSB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 A winding-up order against CCSB was made in Malaysia on 25 April 2000. Several years later, on 30 January 2007, a similar order was made against USSB in Companies Winding Up No D5286182005 (“the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 12 May 2017, 16 parcels of land belonging to CCSB were sold as part of its winding up. After CCSB’s debts were paid, a sum of money remained from the proceeds of sale – this formed CCSB’s liquidation surplus (“the Surplus Funds”). For the purposes of distributing the Surplus Funds, CCSB’s liquidators filed an application on 18 September 2017 in the High Court in Malaya, seeking directions as to whether UOB Nominees was the sole and rightful contributory of CCSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 12 February 2018, the Malayan High Court held that UOB Nominees was the sole and rightful contributory of CCSB and that the Surplus Funds should be distributed to it. However, this decision was set aside by the Malaysian Court of Appeal on 7 August 2019, on the basis that the form of the application had not been appropriate for the determination of the ownership of the CCSB Shares. UOB Nominees’ application for leave to appeal against the Malaysian Court of Appeal’s decision was subsequently dismissed by the Malaysian Federal Court. The Malaysian Federal Court then imposed an undertaking on CCSB’s liquidators not to distribute the Surplus Funds pending the determination of the rights and obligations of the parties. Hence, at the time of the appeal before us, the Surplus Funds remained with CCSB.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parallel proceedings in Malaysia and Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Subsequently, parallel proceedings were commenced in Malaysia and Singapore concerning the issue of UOB’s and USSB’s rights and obligations under the Loan Agreement and the Debenture. In Malaysia, this took the form of a writ action commenced in the High Court in Malaya on 9 December 2019 by USSB against UOB, UOB Nominees, CCSB and CCSB’s liquidators (“the Malaysian Writ Action”). In the Malaysian Writ Action, USSB sought, among other things, the following relief:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration that the Surplus Funds and any interest or benefit earned thereon did not form part of the assets or property or undertaking of CCSB subject to the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A declaration that UOB and/or UOB Nominees had not established a legal entitlement to the Surplus Funds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A declaration that all such interest in the property and assets subject to the Charge as had been vested in UOB by virtue of the Charge had been extinguished, and that UOB and/or UOB Nominees had no interest in the property and assets subject to the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In Singapore, UOB commenced HC/OS 414/2020 (“OS 414”) on 21 April 2020. In OS 414, UOB sought, among other things, the following relief:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration that UOB’s rights under the Debenture were valid and exercisable, including UOB’s security over all the rights attached to the CCSB Shares and UOB’s entitlement to all the benefits derived from those rights to the extent of the outstanding debt owed by USSB to UOB.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A declaration that UOB’s security over all the rights attached to the CCSB Shares pursuant to the Debenture included the right to the Surplus Funds.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A declaration that UOB was not prevented by time-bar from exercising its rights under the Debenture and taking all necessary steps to realise its security in the CCSB Shares and all the rights attached to the CCSB Shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A declaration as to the quantum of the outstanding debt owed by USSB to UOB under the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Following the commencement of OS 414, UOB applied to the High Court in Malaya on 27 May 2020 for a stay of the Malaysian Writ Action. UOB argued that having regard to the jurisdiction clause in the Loan Agreement, Malaysia was not the appropriate forum in which to determine the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Meanwhile, back in Singapore, USSB filed HC/SUM 2635/2020 (“SUM 2635”) in OS 414 on 3 July 2020. In SUM 2635, USSB sought to challenge the validity of the service of OS 414 on USSB as well as the Singapore court’s jurisdiction over USSB. Alternatively, USSB sought a stay of OS 414 on the basis that Singapore was not the appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 SUM 2635 was dismissed on 12 August 2020 and USSB appealed against this decision in HC/RA 211/2020 (“RA 211”). Immediately thereafter, the appellants commenced HC/OS 780/2020 (“OS 780”) seeking the court’s recognition of the Malaysian Winding up Proceeding and the Malaysian Writ Action as “foreign main proceedings” or “foreign non-main proceedings” under the SG Model Law. Consequent to such recognition, the appellants further sought a stay of OS 414 pursuant to Arts 20 and/or 21 of the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Before the hearing of OS 780 and RA 211 in Singapore, further developments took place in Malaysia. UOB’s application for a stay of the Malaysian Writ Action was dismissed on 1 October 2020 by the High Court in Malaya which held that Malaysia was the appropriate forum. UOB appealed against this decision to the Malaysian Court of Appeal on 13 October 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In Singapore, on 12 January 2021, the Judge dismissed OS 780 and RA 211. USSB was refused leave to appeal against the decision in RA 211 (the stay application). As such, a notice of appeal was filed only in respect of OS 780.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On 26 April 2021, shortly before this appeal was heard by this court, the Malaysian Court of Appeal delivered its decision allowing UOB’s appeal in respect of the appropriate forum. The Malaysian Court of Appeal held that Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the dispute. As a result, the Malaysian Writ Action was stayed. On 4 May 2021, the appellants applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Malaysia against the Malaysian Court of Appeal’s decision. This application for leave to appeal was still pending at the time of the hearing before us.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 We turn now to the reasons for the Judge’s dismissal of OS 780. In the proceedings below, the Judge held that the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding had to be recognised as a “foreign main proceeding” under the SG Model Law but that the Malaysian Writ Action was not entitled to recognition as such or even as a “foreign non-main proceeding”. The Judge found that the Malaysian Writ Action was not a foreign proceeding within the meaning of the SG Model Law as it “lack[ed] the collective nature required and [was] not sufficiently connected to an insolvency or reorganization”. In this regard, the Judge observed that the Malaysian Writ Action was concerned with UOB’s rights to the Surplus Funds under the Loan Agreement and the Debenture. It would be determined, if at all, on the contract or agreement between the parties. The Malaysian Writ Action was not a collective proceeding under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt, in which the debtor company was under the control of a foreign court for the purposes of reorganisation or liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Furthermore, in relation to the stay of OS 414 sought by the appellants, the Judge observed that “[w]hether or not UOB has any right in respect of [CCSB] and the related matters should be determined in the ordinary course of civil litigation, and does not impinge on the winding up in Malaysia”. The Judge thus held that no stay under Art 20 of the SG Model Law operated in respect of OS 414, and declined to grant any discretionary stay under Art 21 of the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Before setting out our decision proper, we make two preliminary points. First, at the hearing before us, the appellants’ counsel, Mr Abraham Vergis SC (“Mr Vergis”), requested that the court hold over the hearing of the appeal until the Malaysian Federal Court delivered its decision on the appropriate forum issue. In our view, this was not feasible. Although it appeared that the appellants intended to apply to expedite the proceedings in Malaysia, there was no indication as to when those proceedings would eventually be concluded. Indeed, the appellants had yet to obtain <span class="font-italic">leave </span>to pursue the appeal to the Federal Court, much less have the actual appeal heard and then determined. Furthermore, it had already been finally determined in RA 211 that Singapore was the appropriate forum<span class="font-italic">.</span> As such, a stay of OS 414 could only be granted on the basis that the issues therein were properly to be decided by USSB’s liquidators rather than by the Singapore court. This inquiry was independent of whether the Malaysian Writ Action would be stayed or would be allowed to proceed by the Malaysian Federal Court. In other words, the appellants were asking this court to delay the hearing of the appeal, and in turn the hearing of OS 414, for an indeterminate period of time to await an uncertain outcome that was unlikely to affect the appeal in any event. We saw no reason to do so and thus declined to hold over the hearing of the appeal as requested by Mr Vergis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, it ought to be observed that in interpreting the various provisions of the SG Model Law, we took into consideration the texts and guides developed by UNCITRAL as well as the case law from other jurisdictions. We were cognisant of Art 8 of the SG Model Law, which provides that “regard is to be had to its international origin and to the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith”. As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet Pte Ltd and others (Asia Aviation Holdings Pte Ltd, intervener) </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1343 at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I bear in mind the preamble to the Singapore Model Law, emphasising co-operation and efficiency between the courts of States involved in cross-border insolvency, and Art 8 of the Singapore Model Law, which requires regard to be paid to the Singapore Model Law’s international origin and the promotion of uniformity in its application. I am of the view that the Singapore courts should attempt to tack as closely as possible to the general interpretive trends taken in other jurisdictions that apply the Model Law in its various enactments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Having addressed the preliminary issues, we now turn to our decision in the appeal proper.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stay of OS 414</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In our view, the single critical issue on appeal was whether a stay of OS 414 ought to be granted under the SG Model Law in the light of the Judge’s holding that the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding was a foreign main proceeding. By reason of the decision of the Malaysian Court of Appeal, the Malaysian Writ Action no longer needed to be considered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As UOB had conceded from the beginning that the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding was a foreign main proceeding and did not appeal against its recognition as such, the appellants could rely on that recognition to seek a stay of OS 414 under the SG Model Law, regardless of whether the Malaysian Writ Action was also recognised as a foreign proceeding. Accordingly, whether a stay of OS 414 ought to be granted due to the recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding was the dispositive issue and the appeal was decided on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 20 of the SG Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 We turn first to the relevant provisions under Art 20 of the SG Model Law. These have been set out in full in [7] above. The starting point is Art 20(1), which provides that upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, the following consequences arise:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the debtor’s property, rights, obligations or liabilities is stayed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) execution against the debtor’s property is stayed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any property of the debtor is suspended.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The above effects arise only upon the recognition of foreign <span class="font-italic">main </span>proceedings, which may explain their automatic nature and wider scope relative to the relief afforded under other provisions of the SG Model Law. The purpose of the automatic stay and suspension arising under Art 20(1) is explained in <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with Guide to Enactment </span><span class="font-italic">and Interpretation</span>, UN Doc A/CN.9/442 (1997) as updated in 2013 (see <span class="font-italic">Revision of the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and part four of the Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law</span>, GA Res 68/107, 68th Sess<span class="font-italic"> </span>(2013)) (the “<span class="font-italic">Guide</span>”) at para 37, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Such stay and suspension are ‘mandatory’ (or ‘automatic’) in the sense that either they flow automatically from the recognition of a foreign main proceeding or, in the States where a court order is needed for the stay or suspension, the court is bound to issue the appropriate order. The stay of actions or of enforcement proceedings is necessary to provide ‘breathing space’ until appropriate measures are taken for reorganization or liquidation of the assets of the debtor. The suspension of transfers is necessary because in a modern, globalized economic system it is possible for a multinational debtor to move money and property across boundaries quickly. The mandatory moratorium triggered by the recognition of the foreign main proceeding provides a rapid ‘freeze’ essential to prevent fraud and to protect the legitimate interests of the parties involved until the court has an opportunity to notify all concerned and to assess the situation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, the stay and suspension arising under Art 20(1) are subject to Art 20(2) of the SG Model Law, which provides that they are “the same in scope and effect as if the debtor had been made the subject of a winding up order” under the IRDA and “subject to the same powers of the Court and the same prohibitions, limitations, exceptions and conditions as would apply under the law of Singapore in such a case”. This qualification is explained in the  <span class="font-italic">Guide</span> at para 183 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notwithstanding the ‘automatic’ or ‘mandatory’ nature of the effects under article 20, it is expressly provided that the scope of those effects depends on exceptions or limitations that may exist in the law of the enacting State. Those exceptions may be, for example, the enforcement of claims by secured creditors, payments by the debtor in the ordinary course of business, initiation of court action for claims that have arisen after the commencement of the insolvency proceeding (or after recognition of a foreign main proceeding) or completion of open financial-market transactions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Thus, Art 20(2) delineates the ambit of any stay or suspension arising under Art 20(1) by making such stay or suspension the same as what would have been available under Singapore law had the debtor been wound up in Singapore. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Digest of Case Law on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency </span>(2021) at p 16, Art 20(2) “grant[s] protection to those classes of people who would normally receive protection in insolvency proceedings commenced in the enacting State”. In this way, recognition of a foreign proceeding “has its own effects rather than importing the consequences of the foreign law into the insolvency system of the enacting State” (see the <span class="font-italic">Guide</span> at para 178). This is in line with the basic approach of the Model Law, which is not to “attempt a substantive unification of insolvency law” but to provide a procedural “framework for cooperation between jurisdictions” in order to “facilitate and promote a uniform approach to cross-border insolvency” (see the <span class="font-italic">Guide</span> at para 3; <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Judicial Perspective </span>at paras 9 and 27).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In addition to the qualification contained in Art 20(2), Art 20(3) of the SG Model Law provides certain exceptions to the stay and suspension arising under Art 20(1). Specifically, Art 20(3) stipulates that the stay and suspension do not affect the following rights, provided that such rights would have been exercisable if the debtor had been made the subject of a winding up order under the IRDA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) any right to take any steps to enforce security over the debtor’s property;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) any right to take any steps to repossess goods in the debtor’s possession under a hire-purchase agreement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) any right exercisable under or by virtue of or in connection with the statutes set out in Arts 1(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–1(3)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) any right of a creditor to set off its claim against a claim of the debtor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Article 20(1)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Applying the above provisions to the present case, the first question was whether OS 414 fell within the ambit of proceedings stayed or suspended pursuant to Art 20(1). As Arts 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) were clearly inapplicable, the only issue was whether OS 414 was an individual action or individual proceeding “concerning the debtor’s property, rights, obligations or liabilities” within the meaning of Art 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). It was not seriously disputed that it was – OS 414 concerned the determination of UOB’s and USSB’s respective rights, obligations and liabilities under the Loan Agreement and Debenture. Therefore, OS 414 fell within the scope of the automatic stay arising under Art 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Article 20(2)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 That was not the end of the matter, however. As we observed above, the automatic stay is the same in scope and effect as if the debtor had been wound up in Singapore. It is also subject to the same powers of the court and the same prohibitions, limitations, exceptions and conditions as would apply under Singapore law in such a situation. The next question therefore was what the position would have been if USSB had been wound up under the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this regard, it is well established that leave will readily be granted to secured creditors to proceed with enforcing their security, notwithstanding any stay of proceedings that arises upon the winding up of the debtor. This was explained by this court in <span class="font-italic">SCK Serijadi Sdn Bhd v Artison Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 680 (“<span class="font-italic">Artison</span>”) at [11] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [<span class="font-italic">T</span>]<span class="font-italic">here is in some sense an ‘exception’ carved out for secured creditors</span> … <span class="font-italic">In general, the court will more readily grant leave to secured creditors to proceed with enforcing their security, notwithstanding the stay</span> … because their security is regarded as standing apart from the pool of assets available for <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>distribution amongst unsecured creditors. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 671 (‘<span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management</span>’) at [49], V K Rajah JC observed that leave to proceed would readily be given to an applicant who was ‘merely attempting to claim from the company, property which <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>belongs to the applicant’, and this expressed the law’s recognition ‘that the rights of a secured creditor or <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>rights should not be fettered as a matter of course by the initiation of insolvency proceedings’ (see also <span class="font-italic">Power Knight Pte Ltd v Natural Fuel Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 82 (‘<span class="font-italic">Power Knight</span>’) at [27]). … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Furthermore, as V K Rajah JC (as he then was) observed in <span class="font-italic">Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 671 at [41], an applicant purporting to be a creditor and seeking the court’s leave to proceed with its action need only show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case. This refers to a case that “is brought <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, underpinned by credible facts and is, even without a serious investigation of the factual matrix, capable of succeeding if and when heard”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The above sets out the principles that would have applied had USSB been wound up in Singapore. In transposing these principles to the SG Model Law context via Art 20(2), we had regard to the decision of the High Court of New Zealand in <span class="font-italic">Kim and Yu v ST</span><span class="font-italic">X Pan Ocean Co Ltd </span>[2014] NZHC 845 (“<span class="font-italic">STX</span><span class="font-italic">  Pan Ocean</span>”). In that case, the respondent was the subject of an administration proceeding in Korea. The Korean administration proceeding was recognised in New Zealand as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to the Insolvency (Cross-border) Act 2006 (New Zealand), which enacted the Model Law. Nevertheless, the claimants sought the leave of the High Court of New Zealand to continue their statutory claims <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>against a ship that had been demise chartered by the respondent. Gilbert J held that notwithstanding the automatic stay that arose upon recognition, the court had a discretion under Art 20(2) to allow a person to commence or continue proceedings. Art 20(2) of the Model Law as enacted in New Zealand provided as follows (see <span class="font-italic">STX Pan Ocean </span>at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Paragraph (1) of this article does not prevent the Court, on the application of any creditor or person, from making an order, subject to such conditions as the Court thinks fit, that the stay or suspension does not apply in respect of any particular action or proceeding, execution, or disposal of assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In construing this provision, Gilbert J observed at [23] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The Law Commission considered that each of the consequences that flow from art 20 would occur as a result of most formal insolvency regimes in New Zealand and that the discretion reserved under art 20(2) should enable the High Court to exercise the same type of discretion to override the consequences of stay or suspension as it has under other insolvency provisions. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Gilbert J found on the facts that the claimants had obtained security against the ship immediately upon issue of the admiralty proceedings, which took place prior to the commencement of the Korean administration proceeding. The respondent’s rights to the ship were therefore subject to the claimants’ “secured claims”. Thus, “[c]onsistent with usual practice … where leave would normally be given for secured creditors to commence or continue proceedings to establish their security”, the claimants were granted leave to continue their claims against the ship (see <span class="font-italic">STX Pan Ocean </span>at [29]–[30], [43]). In other words, the ordinary principles and practice that applied under New Zealand insolvency law applied virtually identically to the stay or suspension arising under Art 20(1) of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this case, it was clear that UOB was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a secured creditor. On the face of the evidence, the Debenture created the Charge over the CCSB Shares as security for any sums disbursed under the Loan Agreement. The Malaysian companies’ register also reflected UOB as being a registered chargee of USSB, with the charge status stated as “unsatisfied”. Furthermore, OS 414 was directed at allowing UOB to establish its purported rights as a secured creditor against USSB. The fact that the appellants were disputing UOB’s security interest was insufficient to displace this <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>conclusion. Therefore, notwithstanding the recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding and the automatic stay arising therefrom, we granted leave to UOB to proceed with OS 414.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 21 of the SG Model Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For completeness, we consider whether, alternatively, a stay of OS 414 ought to have been granted under Art 21 of the SG Model Law. Although this point was not pursued by the appellants on appeal, it had been argued in the proceedings below and was addressed by the Judge in his oral grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The relevant provision was Art 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SG Model Law:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, whether a foreign main proceeding or a foreign non-main proceeding, where necessary to protect the property of the debtor or the interests of the creditors, the Court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief, including —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the debtor’s property, rights, obligations or liabilities, to the extent that they have not been stayed under Article 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>);</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In our judgment, there was no reason to grant a discretionary stay of OS 414 under Art 21 of the SG Model Law. As we concluded at [44] above, UOB was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a secured creditor and OS 414 was directed towards enabling UOB to establish its purported security rights against USSB. Given that a secured creditor’s “security is regarded as standing apart from the pool of assets available for <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>distribution amongst unsecured creditors” (see <span class="font-italic">Artison </span>at [11], cited at [39] above), the grant of a discretionary stay of proceedings was not necessary to protect the property of the debtor or the interests of the creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For these reasons, notwithstanding the recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding, we did not order a stay of OS 414 either under Art 20 or Art 21 of the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Recognition of the Malaysian Writ Action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As we observed at [30] above, the appeal was decided on the basis of whether OS 414 ought to be stayed following the recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding. There was therefore no need for us to determine the issue of recognition of the Malaysian Writ Action.

Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) defines a “foreign proceeding” as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign State, including an interim proceeding, under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment or debt in which proceeding the property and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganisation or liquidation;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This definition is explained in the <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>at para 66 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The attributes required for a foreign proceeding to fall within the scope of the Model Law include the following: basis in insolvency-related law of the originating State; involvement of creditors collectively; control or supervision of the assets and affairs of the debtor by a court or another official body; and reorganization or liquidation of the debtor as the purpose of the proceeding …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 There are, therefore, at least four attributes required for a proceeding to constitute a “foreign proceeding” under the SG Model Law, which “are cumulative” and “should be considered as a whole” (see the <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>at para 68). These attributes are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The proceeding must involve creditors collectively.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The proceeding must have its basis in a law relating to insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court must exercise control or supervision of the property and affairs of the debtor in the proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The purpose of the proceeding must be the debtor’s reorganisation or liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In our view, the Malaysian Writ Action bore none of these attributes.

Richard Fisher and Adam Al-Attar in Richard Fisher and Adam Al-Attar, “The UNCITRAL Model Law” in <span class="font-italic">Cross-Border Insolvency </span>(Richard Sheldon QC gen ed) (Bloomsbury Professional, 4th Ed, 2015) provide examples of proceedings that are collective in nature – winding up or bankruptcy proceedings, and even certain forms of reorganisation proceedings (see paras 3.39, 3.42 and 3.43). At para 3.36, they explain that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The basic notion of a collective proceeding is aimed at identifying those cases where there is a single insolvency representative able to control the realisation or assets for the purpose of <span class="font-italic">pro rata </span>distribution among all creditors, as opposed to a proceeding designed to assist a particular creditor to obtain payment or a process designed for some purpose other than to address the insolvency of the debtor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Other jurisdictions have adopted similar positions. In <span class="font-italic">Williams v Simpsons (No 5) </span>[2010] NZHC 1786, the High Court of New Zealand held at [5] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The term ‘collective’ distinguishes a formal insolvency regime (under which the debtor’s assets are realised for the benefit of all creditors) from private proceedings against a debtor, in which a single creditor seeks judgment for its own benefit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Re Betcorp </span>400 BR 266 (“<span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>”), the US Bankruptcy Court observed at 281 that “[a] collective proceeding is one that considers the rights and obligations of all creditors”. Applying that principle, the US Bankruptcy Court held that a voluntary liquidation commenced under Australian law was a foreign proceeding falling within the scope of chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code, which implemented the Model Law (see <span class="font-italic">Betcorp </span>at 285).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 <span class="font-italic">Betcorp </span>was cited and applied in <span class="font-italic">In Re Gold &amp; Honey, Ltd </span>410 BR 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Gold &amp; Honey</span>”), where the US Bankruptcy Court declined to recognise an Israeli receivership proceeding as a foreign proceeding under chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. The US Bankruptcy Court held that the Israeli receivership proceeding was not a collective proceeding, observing that the receivership proceeding did not require the receivers to consider the rights and obligations of all creditors. Instead, it was more akin to an individual creditor’s replevin or repossession action. It was primarily designed to allow the creditor to collect its debts, rather than a proceeding instituted by a debtor for the purposes of paying off all creditors with court supervision (see <span class="font-italic">Gold &amp; Honey </span>at 370). It is notable that although the Israeli receivership proceeding concerned all of the debtor’s assets present in Israel (see <span class="font-italic">Gold &amp; Honey </span>at 371), this was not sufficient to ground a finding that it was collective in nature. As <span class="font-italic">Look Chan</span> <span class="font-italic">Ho</span> observes at p 159, citing <span class="font-italic">Gold &amp; Honey</span>, “[r]eceivership in consequence of enforcement of security is naturally not collective, even where the receivership covers most of the debtor’s assets”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 A similar distinction was drawn in <span class="font-italic">In re ABC Learning Centres Ltd </span>445 BR 318 (“<span class="font-italic">ABC Learning Centres</span>”) between receivership proceedings concerned only with the secured creditors’ interests and insolvency proceedings falling within the scope of the Model Law. In <span class="font-italic">ABC Learning Centres</span>, the US Bankruptcy Court was faced with an application for recognition of certain Australian liquidation proceedings. At the time, the debtor was also under a set of receivership proceedings commenced by several of the debtor’s secured creditors. It was agreed that the receivership proceedings were not collective in nature as they were, by design, for the benefit of the secured creditors. The US Bankruptcy Court commented on the distinction between the liquidation proceedings and the receivership proceedings in <span class="font-italic">ABC Learning Centres </span>at 330, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Liquidators and Receivers have clearly delineated roles under the Corporations Act. Liquidators are appointed by the creditors as a whole and are responsible for winding up the affairs of a company and ultimately dissolving it; specific duties include: collecting assets; establishing deadlines for proving claims; distributing assets per the priorities set forth in the Corporations Act; convening required meetings; maintaining records; creating and distributing required reports to various parties … and conducting investigations into possibly voidable transactions. … Receivers, on the other hand, are appointed by a secured creditor and their primary role is to recover secured assets for the benefit of the secured creditor and return any surplus to the company. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 <span class="font-italic">Betcorp </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gold &amp; Honey </span>were cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">In Re British American Insurance Company Limited </span>425 BR 884, where the US Bankruptcy Court held<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 902 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For a proceeding to be collective … <span class="font-italic">it must be instituted for the benefit of creditors generally rather than for a single creditor or class of creditors</span>. … The Guide to Enactment suggests that a foreign proceeding must <span class="font-italic">contemplate the ‘involvement of creditors collectively.’</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">From the foregoing, the Court concludes that the word ‘collective’ … <span class="font-italic">contemplates both the consideration and eventual treatment of claims of various types of creditors, as well as the possibility that creditors may take part in the foreign action</span>.

It did not contemplate the consideration and eventual treatment of the rights, obligations and claims of USSB’s creditors generally. Nor did it concern substantially all of USSB’s assets and liabilities. Instead, it focused on <span class="font-italic">one particular aspect</span> of USSB’s assets, specifically, USSB’s purported entitlement to the Surplus Funds. If determined, it would address USSB’s legal rights and obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>only <span class="font-italic">one </span>of its creditors, namely, UOB. Furthermore, the Malaysian Writ Action was a civil action between USSB as the plaintiff, and UOB, UOB Nominees, CCSB, and CCSB’s liquidators as the defendants. Out of all these parties, only UOB was USSB’s creditor. Although UOB’s receiver and one of USSB’s creditors had been granted leave by the Malayan High Court to intervene in the Malaysian Writ Action, it bears emphasis that these parties had to seek the court’s leave to intervene in the first place and had no automatic right to participate in the proceedings. Furthermore, on appeal by UOB, the Malaysian Court of Appeal eventually set aside the Malayan High Court’s order allowing USSB’s creditor to intervene in the Malaysian Writ Action. All of these points indicated that the Malaysian Writ Action was not collective in nature.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Basis in a law relating to insolvency</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The second attribute concerns whether the proceeding has its basis in a law relating to insolvency. The <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>explains this attribute at para 73 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This formulation is used in the Model Law to acknowledge the fact that liquidation and reorganization might be conducted under law that is not labelled as insolvency law (e.g. company law), but which nevertheless deals with or addresses insolvency or severe financial distress. The purpose was to find a description that was sufficiently broad to encompass a range of insolvency rules irrespective of the type of statute or law in which they might be contained and irrespective of whether the law that contained the rules related exclusively to insolvency. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 <span class="font-italic">Look Chan Ho</span> opines at pp 162–163 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As ‘law relating to insolvency’ is not a defined term, the … court ought to rely on the plain meaning of the term and its general connotation consistent with ordinary English usage:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Insolvency law can be described as the prevention, regulation, or supervision of discontinuity in the legal relations of a person (legal entity) that is in financial difficulties, including the discontinuity of that person itself.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It was apparent that the phrase “under a law relating to insolvency” had been deliberately framed in a broad manner so as to cater to the wide range of laws that were intended to fall within the scope of the Model Law. The <span class="font-italic">Guide</span> explains this approach<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 65 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The definitions of proceedings or persons emanating from foreign jurisdictions avoid the use of expressions that may have different technical meanings in different legal systems and instead describe their purpose or function. This technique is used to avoid inadvertently narrowing the range of possible foreign proceedings that might obtain recognition and to avoid unnecessary conflict with terminology used in the laws of the enacting State. … [T]he expression ‘insolvency proceedings’ may have a technical meaning in some legal systems, but is intended in subparagraph <span class="font-italic">(a)</span> to refer broadly to proceedings involving debtors that are in severe financial distress or insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In light of the above, the court in determining whether a proceeding is conducted “under a law relating to insolvency” should adopt a commonsense approach which focuses on the <span class="font-italic">substance </span>of the relevant law. Specifically, whether the relevant law “deals with or addresses insolvency or severe financial distress”. Here, although the Malaysian Writ Action, <span class="font-italic">factually speaking</span>, concerned insolvent companies and surplus funds arising out of a liquidation, the <span class="font-italic">law </span>on which the Malaysian Writ Action was based did not relate to insolvency. Rather, it was an ordinary civil action commenced under the Malayan High Court’s civil jurisdiction, to be determined based on a number of different types of law, none of which dealt with insolvency or severe financial distress. We were therefore of the view that the Malaysian Writ Action did not have its basis in a law relating to insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Control or supervision by the court of the debtor’s property and affairs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The third attribute concerns whether the proceeding involves the court’s exercise of control or supervision of the debtor’s property and affairs. Such control or supervision must be “formal in nature”, although they “may be potential rather than actual” and may be exercised directly by the court or indirectly through an insolvency representative (see the <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>at para 74). It is notable that “both assets <span class="font-italic">and</span> affairs of the debtor should be subject to control or supervision; it is not sufficient if only one or the other are covered by the foreign proceeding” [emphasis added] (see the <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>at para 76).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 A straightforward example of a proceeding that involves the court’s control or supervision of the debtor’s property and affairs is a liquidation proceeding. In <span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span>, the US Bankruptcy Court found that an Australian voluntary liquidation proceeding was subject to the supervision of the Australian court. In reaching this decision, the US Bankruptcy Court considered that the liquidators and creditors could request the Australian court to determine any question arising in the winding up of a company, and that the Australian court had a broad mandate to review the actions of liquidators (see <span class="font-italic">Betcorp</span> at 22). Similarly, the US Bankruptcy Court found in <span class="font-italic">ABC Learning Centres </span>at 331–332 that the Australian court had control of and played a supervisory role in the Australian liquidation proceedings, as provided for by numerous sections of the Corporations Act 2001 (Australia).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Further examples of proceedings that involve the requisite control and supervision by the court are provided in the <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>at paras 74–75: a debtor-in-possession; expedited proceedings in which the court exercises control or supervision at a late stage of the insolvency process; and proceedings in which the court has exercised control or supervision, but at the time of the application for recognition is no longer required to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In this case, it was clear that the Malaysian Writ Action did not involve the Malayan High Court’s control or supervision of USSB’s property and affairs. The court’s role in the Malaysian Writ Action was simply to determine the issues disputed between the parties, as it would do in any ordinary civil action. Although USSB’s property and affairs <span class="font-italic">were </span>subject to the control and supervision of the Malaysian courts, this was by virtue of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding, rather than the Malaysian Writ Action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Purpose of reorganisation or liquidation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The fourth and final attribute concerns whether the purpose of the proceeding is the reorganisation or liquidation of the debtor. The <span class="font-italic">Guide </span>provides several examples of proceedings that <span class="font-italic">do</span> <span class="font-italic">not</span> satisfy this requirement at paras 77–78:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) proceedings that are designed to prevent dissipation and waste, rather than to liquidate or reorganise the insolvent estate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) proceedings designed to prevent detriment to investors rather than to all creditors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) proceedings in which the powers conferred and the duties imposed upon the foreign representative are more limited than the powers or duties typically associated with liquidation or reorganisation (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the power to do no more than preserve assets); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) financial adjustment measures or arrangements undertaken between the debtor and some of its creditors on a purely contractual basis concerning some debt, where the negotiations do not lead to the commencement of an insolvency proceeding conducted under the insolvency law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At this juncture, we address the appellants’ reliance on the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rubin and another v Eurofinance SA and others </span>[2011] 2 WLR 121 (“<span class="font-italic">Rubin</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Rubin</span>, the English Court of Appeal held that adversary proceedings – the equivalent of undervalue transaction and preference claims – formed “part and parcel” of the insolvency proceedings and thus could be given the same recognition under the Model Law as set out in the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No 1030) (UK). This was because such adversary proceedings were “part of collecting the bankrupt’s assets with a view to distributing them to creditors”, as well as “part of the plan which the bankruptcy court approved” and “an integral part” of the insolvency proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Rubin </span>at [25] and [60]). By analogy to such adversary proceedings, the appellants sought to argue that the Malaysian Writ Action should similarly be recognised under the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In our view, however, the appellants’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Rubin </span>was misplaced. Even if <span class="font-italic">Rubin </span>was correct in concluding that adversary proceedings may be recognised as foreign proceedings under the Model Law, the Malaysian Writ Action was clearly distinguishable from adversary proceedings. The proceedings recognised in <span class="font-italic">Rubin </span>arose from the use of mechanisms specially available in the insolvency regime to allow the debtor’s legal representative to bring actions against third parties for the collective benefit of all creditors. Such proceedings were therefore central to the collective nature of bankruptcy (see <span class="font-italic">Rubin </span>at [61]). In contrast, the Malaysian Writ Action was not part of any insolvency plan approved by the Malaysian court nor an integral part of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding. Nor did the Malaysian Writ Action arise from any mechanism specially available in the insolvency regime. In this regard, we agreed with Judge’s observations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) I was referred to the example of adversary proceedings in US cases, but these were, in contrast, quite different. I note most adversary proceedings are similar to unfair preference or clawback proceedings under Commonwealth insolvency law: they are actions by the estate to recover assets or proceeds of the estate which were unlawfully taken away to avoid being caught by the insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In contrast, the Malaysian [W]rit [A]ction was the determination of issues of property or ownership rights and obligations that are no different from any that could arise in any civil proceeding. The only thing possibly colouring it with the nature of an insolvency or collective claim was that it involved the foreign insolvency representative. It is true that the determination by the Malaysian courts would affect the size of the estate in the end, but it does so through the operation not of insolvency or reorganization law. Extending the operation of Model Law recognition to this extent could effectively extend recognition to all manner of foreign civil judgments, beyond the ambit of the [IRDA].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For completeness, we note that <span class="font-italic">Rubin</span> was subsequently overturned on appeal by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Rubin and another v Eurofinance SA and others (Picard and others intervening); In re New Cap Reinsurance Corpn Ltd (in liquidation; New Cap Reinsurance Corpn Ltd and another v Grant and others</span> [2012] 3 WLR 1019, although on a different point of law. On appeal, as it was no longer disputed that the adversary proceedings should be recognised under the Model Law, the point was not specifically considered by the UK Supreme Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The purpose of the Malaysian Writ Action was <span class="font-italic">not </span>USSB’s reorganisation or liquidation. Instead, it was to determine the parties’ rights, obligations and liabilities under the Loan Agreement and Debenture, which would in turn affect the parties’ entitlement to the Surplus Funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In light of the above analysis, we took the view that the Malaysian Writ Action did not possess any of the cumulative attributes required for it to constitute a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SG Model Law.

USSB is the beneficial owner of all the issued shares in City Centre Sdn Bhd (in liquidation) (“CCSB”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of USSB. The respondent is United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”), a Singapore bank. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 On 17 December 1982, USSB entered into a loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) with Overseas Union Bank Ltd (“OUB”) for OUB to provide USSB with credit facilities. OUB and USSB also entered into a deed of debenture (“the Debenture”), which created a fixed charge in OUB’s favour over all of USSB’s shares in CCSB (“the CCSB Shares”). Pursuant to the Debenture, the CCSB Shares which were then registered in the name of USSB were subsequently transferred to and registered in the sole name of OUB Nominees (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (subsequently renamed UOB Nominees 2006 (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd (“UOB Nominees”)).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The Loan Agreement and the Debenture were governed by Singapore law, and provided that any legal action or proceeding against USSB with respect to the Loan Agreement and the Debenture may be brought in the Singapore courts. The Loan Agreement also stated that USSB submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore court, and waived any objection to the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Loan Agreement selected by OUB. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 On 19 December 1983, USSB defaulted on the loan granted by OUB. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement and Debenture, receivers were appointed over the properties and assets of USSB charged to OUB. In 2002, following OUB’s merger with UOB, UOB took over all of OUB’s interest in the Loan Agreement and the Debenture. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 A winding-up order against CCSB was made in Malaysia on 25 April 2000. On 30 January 2007, a winding-up order was also made against USSB in Malaysia (“the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding”). Subsequently, 16 parcels of land belonging to CCSB were sold as part of its winding up, and the remainder of the proceeds of sale after CCSB’s debts were paid formed CCSB’s liquidation surplus (“the Surplus Funds”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 For the purposes of distributing the Surplus Funds, CCSB’s liquidators applied for directions as to whether UOB Nominees was the sole and rightful contributory of CCSB. The Malayan High Court answered this question in the affirmative, but its decision was set aside by the Malaysian Court of Appeal, on the basis that the form of the application had not been appropriate for the determination of the ownership of the CCSB Shares. UOB Nominees’ application for leave to appeal to the Malaysian Federal Court was dismissed. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Subsequently, parallel proceedings were commenced in Malaysia and Singapore concerning the issue of UOB’s and USSB’s rights and obligations under the Loan Agreement and the Debenture. In Malaysia, this took the form of a writ action commenced in the High Court in Malaya by USSB against UOB, UOB Nominees, CCSB and CCSB’s liquidators (“the Malaysian Writ Action”). In Singapore, UOB commenced HC/OS 414/2020 (“OS 414”). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Following the commencement of OS 414, UOB applied to the High Court in Malaya for a stay of the Malaysian Writ Action, on the basis that Malaysia was not the appropriate forum. Meanwhile, in Singapore, the appellants filed, among other applications, HC/OS 780/2020 (“OS 780”) seeking the court’s recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding and the Malaysian Writ Action as “foreign main proceedings” or “foreign non-main proceedings” under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (30 May 1997) (“the Model Law”), given the force of law in Singapore via s 252 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (Act 40 of 2018). Consequent to such recognition, the appellants further sought a stay of OS 414 pursuant to Arts 20 and/or 21 of the Model Law as enacted in Singapore (“the SG Model Law”). Prior to the hearing of OS 780, UOB’s application for a stay of the Malaysian Writ Action was dismissed by the High Court in Malaya which held that Malaysia was the appropriate forum. UOB appealed against this decision to the Malaysian Court of Appeal.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) dismissed OS 780. The Judge held that the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding had to be recognised as a “foreign main proceeding” under the SG Model Law, but that the Malaysian Writ Action was not entitled to recognition as such or as a “foreign non-main proceeding”. Furthermore, the Judge held that no stay under Art 20 of the SG Model Law operated in respect of OS 414, and declined to grant any discretionary stay under Art 21 of the SG Model Law. Dissatisfied, the appellants appealed against the Judge’s decision. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Shortly before the hearing of the appeal against the Judge’s decision, the Malaysian Court of Appeal allowed UOB’s appeal in respect of the appropriate forum, holding that Singapore was the more appropriate forum. As a result, the Malaysian Writ Action was stayed. The appellants applied for leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Malaysia, which was still pending at the time of the hearing of the present appeal. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court of Appeal’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The Court of Appeal (“the Court”) held that it was not feasible to hold over the hearing of the appeal until the Malaysian Federal Court delivered its decision on the appropriate forum issue. The appellants were asking the Court to delay the hearing of the appeal, and in turn the hearing of OS 414, for an indeterminate period of time to await an uncertain outcome that was unlikely to affect the appeal in any event. There was no reason to do so: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">27]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 Article 20(1) of the SG Model Law provided that upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, an automatic stay and suspension arose in respect of certain actions, proceedings and rights. However, Art 20(2) delineated the ambit of any such stay or suspension by making it the same as would have been available under Singapore law had the debtor been wound up in Singapore. Furthermore, Art 20(3) of the SG Model Law provided certain exceptions to the stay and suspension arising under Art 20(1): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[32], [3</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]–[36]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 Given the Judge’s holding that the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding was a foreign main proceeding, the single critical issue on appeal was whether a stay of OS 414 ought to be granted under the SG Model Law. In this regard, OS 414 fell within the scope of the automatic stay arising under Art 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SG Model Law, as it was a proceeding “concerning the debtor’s property, rights, obligations or liabilities”. However, if USSB had been wound up in Singapore, leave would readily be granted to secured creditors to proceed with enforcing their security, notwithstanding any stay of proceedings that arose upon its winding up. In this case, as UOB was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a secured creditor, the Court granted leave to UOB to proceed with OS 414 notwithstanding the recognition of the Malaysian Winding Up Proceeding and the automatic stay arising therefrom: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">30]–[31], [37]–[39], [44]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 There was no reason to grant a discretionary stay of OS 414 under Art 21 of the SG Model Law. Given that UOB was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>a secured creditor, so that its security was regarded as standing apart from the pool of assets available for <span class="font-italic">pari passu </span>distribution amongst unsecured creditors, the grant of a discretionary stay was not necessary to protect the property of USSB or the interests of the creditors: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 There were at least four cumulative attributes required for a proceeding to constitute a “foreign proceeding” under the SG Model Law: (a) the proceeding must involve creditors collectively; (b) the proceeding must have its basis in a law relating to insolvency; (c) the court must exercise control or supervision of the property and affairs of the debtor in the proceeding; and (d) the purpose of the proceeding must be the debtor’s reorganisation or liquidation: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">3]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The Malaysian Writ Action bore none of these attributes. First, it was not a collective proceeding. It did not contemplate the consideration and eventual treatment of the rights, obligations and claims of USSB’s creditors generally, and did not concern substantially all of USSB’s assets and liabilities. Second, the law on which the Malaysian Writ Action was based did not relate to insolvency. Third, the Malaysian Writ Action did not involve the Malayan High Court’s control or supervision of USSB’s property and affairs. The court’s role was simply to determine the issues disputed between the parties. Finally, the purpose of the Malaysian Writ Action was not USSB’s reorganisation or liquidation, but to determine the parties’ rights, obligations and liabilities under the Loan Agreement and Debenture, and consequently, the parties’ entitlement to the Surplus Funds. Therefore, the Court of Appeal affirmed the Judge’s decision not to recognise the Malaysian Writ Action as a foreign proceeding under Art 17 of the SG Model Law, whether as a foreign main proceeding or a foreign non-main proceeding: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4], [62], [66], [70], [75]–[76]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
