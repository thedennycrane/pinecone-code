The respondent’s proposed interpretation – that s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA only provides a deadline for the submission of a payment response as opposed to a period of time within which a payment response must be served (see above at [12]) – is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the word “within”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Where the Parliament intended to only stipulate an end date, this is made clear in the language of the SOPA.

Strict compliance with the timelines laid out by the SOPA is as much part of the driving force behind the SOPA as promoting cashflow efficiency. This is because adherence to the SOPA timelines is what facilitates the legislative intent of cashflow efficiency. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Asia Grand </span>at [1]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[SOPA] was enacted to introduce a regime for interim payments and a procedure to resolve payment disputes that facilitate cash flow in the construction industry.

The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Asia Grand </span>is particularly apposite (at [42]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the context of a contract like the present one, wherein the parties do not stipulate timelines for the service of payment claims or payment responses, it is reasonable for the respondent's deadline for payment response to be fixed to run only from the last day of the calendar month. <span class="font-italic">This provides certainty for the respondent and helps to facilitate the timely service of payment responses. A payment process that keeps to regular timelines that run from a consistent day in each month keeps the SOPA mechanism running smoothly, prevents the missing of deadlines due to inadvertence, and minimises disputes.</span> As a corollary, this also relieves a respondent from the need to constantly keep track of payment claims that are not served according to any stipulated contractual timelines. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Adopting the applicant’s reading of the SOPA, I agreed that the Payment Response submitted on 27 July 2023 predated the deemed date of service of the Payment Claim and was hence defective within the meaning of s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 For completeness, I noted the applicant’s argument that the Payment Response was merely a “purported” or draft payment response and should not have been taken by the respondent as a payment response at all.

</div> I agreed with the Adjudicator and found that the Payment Response <span class="font-italic">was</span> intended to be a payment response. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: The applicant was estopped from challenging the invalid Payment Response </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The entire Determination was not tainted by the invalid Payment Response and/or the Adjudicator’s flawed ruling on its validity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Before addressing estoppel, two further preliminary points had to be addressed: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, whether the invalid Payment Response invalidated the entire Determination; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, whether the Adjudicator’s flawed ruling on the validity of the Payment Response tainted the entire Determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I answered both in the negative, as elaborated below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I concluded that the invalid Payment Response did not taint the entire Adjudication. This defect only interfered with the Adjudicator’s substantive jurisdiction, but not his threshold jurisdiction. The latter would render the Adjudication invalid <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span>. As the Adjudicator’s threshold jurisdiction remained intact, the estoppel doctrine was free to operate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1011 (“<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span>”) at [49], there are certain procedural defects that are so fundamental that they go towards an adjudicator’s threshold jurisdiction. These render the adjudication determination null and void from the outset:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[A]n adjudicator </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">would not have been validly appointed</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if there was in fact no payment </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">claim or no service of a payment claim</span>. In such a case, there would be no basis at all to appoint an adjudicator, and any such appointment would be void and without effect in law. This is a consideration of the adjudicator’s jurisdiction at the <span class="font-italic">threshold </span>because <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without a payment claim or service of such a claim, there is no basis at all for an adjudicator to be appointed in the first place</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Other than a situation where there was no payment claim or no service of a payment claim, an adjudicator may also be found to have no threshold jurisdiction if a payment claim fell outside the purview of the SOPA from the outset (<span class="font-italic">Far East Square Pte Ltd v Yau Lee Construction (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2019] 2 SLR 189 (“<span class="font-italic">Far </span><span class="font-italic">East</span>”) at [67]). Examples of such payment claims include those made pursuant to contracts that are excluded from the scope of SOPA under s 4 (<span class="font-italic">Far East</span> at [60]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 By contrast, where a purported payment claim <span class="font-italic">has</span> been served but is defective by reason of non-compliance with the SOPA, “it would go to the adjudicator’s <span class="font-italic">substantive </span>jurisdiction” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [49]). However, the appointment of the adjudicator remains valid, and the adjudicator’s threshold jurisdiction remains unaffected. Nonetheless, the adjudication determination may be liable to be set aside if there has been a breach of the SOPA that would warrant the invalidation of the entire adjudication (<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span> at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, the invalid Payment Response would fall under the category of cases where only the substantive jurisdiction of the adjudicator is impugned. In <span class="font-italic">Far </span><span class="font-italic">East</span> at [57], the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between “(a) an invalid and/or invalidly served payment claim; and (b) a payment claim that is outside the ambit of the SOPA from the outset”. Similarly, the Payment Response which did not satisfy s 11(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA would amount to an invalid payment response, but one which still fell within the scope of the SOPA. This procedural defect would only go towards the Adjudicator’s substantive jurisdiction, with his threshold jurisdiction still intact. That being the case, even though I disagreed with the Adjudicator’s reasoning on the validity of the Payment Response, the estoppel doctrine could still operate to prevent the applicant from making submissions on the defects of the Payment Response.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As to the second preliminary issue, I found that the Adjudicator’s erroneous decision on the validity of the Payment Response did not taint the entirety of the Determination. Under s 27(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, the court in a proceeding to set aside an adjudication determination may set it aside “in whole or in part”. In the present case, the parts of the Determination that address the early service of the Payment Response are confined to specific paragraphs that are isolated from the other issues.

This was based on s 11(4) of the SOPA which provides that a submitted payment response may be varied, provided that the varied payment response is submitted by the date or within the period that a payment response is to be served under s 11(1) of the SOPA, or within the dispute settlement period under s 12(5) of the SOPA. In other words, despite having served the Payment Response, the applicant was still entitled to serve another payment response prior to the stipulated deadline. Hence, contrary to the respondent’s argument, the Payment Response was not an unequivocal representation that the applicant would “forbear to exercise its right not to serve a payment response until after a payment claim was deemed served”.

</div> The applicant received the Tax Invoice without raising any objection and allowed the time within which it had to properly submit a payment response to lapse. Such silence and inaction amounted to an unequivocal representation by the applicant that it would not insist on its legal right to serve its payment response later (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, within 14 days after the deemed date of service of the payment claim) and thus would not seek to invalidate any adjudication on the basis of an invalid payment response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The respondent relied on that representation to its detriment, making it inequitable for the applicant to go back on its representation.

The claimant, in turn, may in reliance on that communication omit to re-file a payment claim which rectifies the filed payment claim’s defect, if any. If the respondent later attempts to impugn the validity of the filed payment claim, the claimant may by then, to his detriment, have missed the opportunity to re-file a rectified payment claim. Indeed, the claimant may have decided not to re-file because the respondent had acted consistently with the position that the payment claim was valid. In such a case, the respondent may in principle be estopped from raising that objection … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 By analogy, the above analysis on an invalid payment claim would also apply to the invalid Payment Response. Here, in reliance on the applicant’s representation, the respondent missed the deadline to file an adjudication application on the basis that the applicant “fail[ed] to provide a payment response” (s 12(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SOPA).

The early and erroneous submission of the Payment Response was of the applicant’s own doing. The applicant had ample opportunity to raise its objection in a timely way. By having chosen not to do so, the applicant should not be able to subsequently raise this issue to invalidate the Determination purely on technical grounds. It was estopped from doing so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: The Adjudicator was acting </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ultra vires</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in awarding a higher amount than that stated in the Payment Response</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn to the final issue on jurisdiction. I concluded that the Adjudicator had acted <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> in awarding the Adjudicated Amount of S$17,019.19, which was higher than the amount of S$16,861.60 stated in the Payment Response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Both parties relied on <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> to advance their positions. In that case, the adjudicator was found to have exceeded its jurisdiction in deciding on a retention sum claim which was not included in the applicant’s payment claim (<span class="font-italic">Rong Shun </span>at [103]). The respondent sought to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Rong</span> <span class="font-italic">Shun</span> on the basis that the present case does not involve a new head of claim, but only an arithmetic correction which the Adjudicator was permitted to do per ss 17(4)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), 17(4)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) and 17(4)(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SOPA. To reproduce the relevant parts, s 17(4) of the SOPA provides that an adjudicator “may only have regard to the following matters”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the payment claim to which the adjudication application relates, the adjudication application, and the accompanying documents thereto;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the payment response to which the adjudication application relates (if any), the adjudication response (if any), and the accompanying documents thereto;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h)  any other matter that the adjudicator reasonably considers to be relevant to the adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I found that the respondent’s reliance on s 17(4) of the SOPA did not assist its case.

</div>
</div> In that regard, I considered the principle of fair notice as explained in <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun </span>applicable to the present case. <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun</span> highlighted the importance of a payment claim in “fix[ing] the parameters of the substantive content of an adjudication application” (at [101]), the rationale being one of fairness to the respondent in an adjudication (at [102]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A respondent must be able to ascertain from the payment claim with completeness and certainty – at the time it receives the payment claim – each claim which it will have to address in its payment response if it chooses not to satisfy that claim … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Transposing this to the present context, the documents listed above at [45] similarly fixed the parameters of the Adjudication. There was absolutely no notice given to the applicant that it had to meet a claim for a higher amount than S$16,861.61 in the Adjudication. I concluded that the Adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction in awarding the Adjudicated Amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, this did not warrant setting aside the entirety of the Determination, as the court has the power to sever an adjudication determination for jurisdictional errors. In particular, it was noted in <span class="font-italic">Rong Sh</span><span class="font-italic">un </span>at [155(e)] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court may modify the text of the adjudicator’s determination in order to achieve severance if the court is satisfied that it is effecting no change in the substantial effect of the adjudication determination after accounting for the jurisdictional error and its necessary editorial consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case where only the excess amount of S$157.59 (S$17,019.19 – S$16,861.60) required severance, modification of the Determination would achieve this purpose without affecting the substantive content of the Determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In conclusion, the setting aside application was allowed in part with the Adjudicated Amount in the Determination reduced from S$17,019.19 to S$16,861.60. The excess amount of S$157.59 was ordered to be released, from the payment into court, to the applicant.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I made no order as to costs. Though the respondent had succeeded in the application in substance, most of the arguments surrounded the issue on the validity of the Payment Response. This issue and the jurisdictional issue arising from the Adjudicated Amount were both raised by the applicant’s counsel in its letter to the respondent’s counsel prior to the filing of this application to set aside the Determination.
