<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></p>
</u>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs, Lee

Hiok Tng (‘Tng’) and Lee Hiok Woon (‘Woon’) are Executors and Trustees

respectively of the Estate of Lee Wee Nam (‘Nam’) deceased.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Defendant, who is also the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff is

sued in his personal capacity.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>

Interveners, Liew Siew Choon, Lee Siew Hong and Lee Siew Ngug are three of several

beneficiaries of the Estate of Nam.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. By their Originating Summons, the Plaintiffs sought

determinations by the Court of the following questions:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The determination of the rights of the parties with

  respect of the gift of the 27 Overseas Union Bank ("OUB") shares of $100/- each

  from Nam to Tng on or about 30<sup>th</sup> April 1962 and more particularly the portion

  of the gift that Nam held as beneficial interest through a partnership known as Wee Kee

  Kongsi (‘Wee Kee Kongsi’) and Sze Teck Tng Chye Kee (‘STTCK’).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The determination whether Tng is entitled to an

  indemnity and/or contribution in respect of all costs and expenses incurred by him

  pertaining to the said 27 OUB shares from the Estate of Nam.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The Interveners opposed the application of the

Plaintiffs claiming it as an abuse of the process of court as the issue concerning the 27

OUB shares and related matters had already been fully and conclusively decided by Chao J

in another set of proceedings to which I shall allude later. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Background</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. The brief background to the present proceedings is that

in 1918 one Lee Hum Chye having come from China to seek his fortune gave all his monies to

his three sons Lee Wee Kheng (‘Kheng’), Lee Wee Kiat (‘Kiat’) and Nam

and founded the family fund STTCK with the monies.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. In 1927 the three brothers formed a partnership in Wee

Kee Kongsi pursuant to a written agreement. STTCK was also given a share in Wee Kee

Kongsi. Later that year, Kiat passed away. Much later, in 1940 the Estate of Kiat executed

a Deed of Release with Kheng and Nam the surviving partners whereby the Estate of Kiat

relinquished all interest in Wee Kee Kongsi and the assets of Wee Kee Kongsi were

re-distributed into 21 shares with Kheng obtaining a <i>9/21</i> share, Nam a <i>8/21</i>

share and STTCK a <i>4/21</i> share.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. In 1950 Kheng and Nam incorporated Lee Brothers (Wee

Kee) Ltd (‘Lee Brothers’) and the <i>immovable</i> property of Wee Kee Kongsi

and STTCK was transferred to Lee Brothers. Kheng, Nam together with their family members

and STTCK held shares in Lee Brothers. Kheng and his family held <i>9,350</i> shares, Nam

and his family <i>10,250</i> and Kheng and Nam held for STTCK <i>2,400</i> shares. Kheng

and Nam also incorporated or formed other business ventures. Kheng in his earlier years

spent much of his time managing the Sze Hai Tong Bank Ltd which later became the Four Seas

Communications Bank (‘FSC Bank’). He later went to Bangkok to form and head the

bank’s branch there. Nam took over management of the FSC Bank in Singapore.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. Kheng passed away in July 1962. His sons Lee Hiok Ker

(‘Ker’) and Lee Hiok Kwee (‘Kwee’) obtained probate of his Will. The

business of WKK, Lee Brothers and STTCK continued and were all controlled by Nam.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. On 15 March 1963 Nam incorporated a new company Lee

Hiok Kee Pte Ltd (‘LHKPL’) whose shares were held entirely by Nam’s sons

and grandsons.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.1 On 30 July 1963 the shares of Nam’s descendants

in Lee Brothers were transferred to LHKPL and in October 1963 LHKPL’s paid up capital

was increased to $3.05 million from $3,000/-.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.2 Nam also incorporated on 4 April 1963 another company

Lee Investments Pte Ltd (‘L. Inv.’). The shares in the company were held

entirely by Nam’s male descendants.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.3 Soon afterwards on 23 January 1964 Nam passed away

leaving a Will.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9.4 His two sons Tng and Woon were granted probate of his

Will on 30 April 1964 and both of them thereafter managed the business of LHKPL, Lee

Brothers, WKK and STTCK with Tng being the main controlling person.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. Thereafter sometime in the early seventies there began

a series of legal proceedings. It is sufficient to mention here three legal proceedings in

addition to the present proceedings. Two of the proceedings were:-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Firstly</u>, Suit No. 1401 of 1973 and Suit No. 2457 of

  1981 which were consolidated (‘the Consolidated Suit’) and heard before Chao J. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Suit No. 1401 of 1973 the Plaintiffs were sons and

  grandsons of Kheng and the beneficiaries of his estate. They sued their half brothers (or

  uncles) Lee Hiok Kwee and Lee Hiok Kher as Executors and Trustees and in their individual

  capacities for failing to realise and account for assets of the estate of Kheng in various

  companies. They asked for inquiries, accounts and declarations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Suit No. 2457 of 1991 the Plaintiffs sued Tng and Woon

  (the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs in the present case and the Defendant

  who is also the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff) as Executors and Trustees of the Estate of Nam

  as well as in their personal capacities alleging that when Kheng and Nam were alive, they

  were business partners in WKK and STTCK and shareholdings in Lee Brothers, FSC Bank and

  its predecessor and other companies. In the Suit, the Plaintiffs claimed that Tng and Woon

  jointly invested shares in public companies all of which shares were registered in the

  names of Nam or his nominees and that Nam was in breach of his fiduciary duties in not

  winding up WKK and had retained or converted partnership assets for his own benefit and

  transferred partnership assets to his descendants and to LHKPL and Lee Investments and had

  thereby failed to render an account to the Estate of Kheng. The Plaintiffs also alleged

  that Woon had assisted Nam in commission of these breaches of trust.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Both Suits being the Consolidated Suit were heard and

  disposed of by Chao J. Chao J made a number of orders as contained in his judgment dated

  24 January 1992 after the conclusion of the trial before him. The Respondents appealed to

  the Court of Appeal against Chao J’s decision and subsequently again to the Privy

  Council when the Respondents’ appeals were finally dismissed on 27 March 1996 and the

  matter concluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The orders made by Chao J included orders touching and

  concerning the 27 OUB shares which these proceedings are concerned with. The relevant part

  of the orders were:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. A declaration that the parnership subsisting between

  Lee Wee Kheng, Lee Wee Nam and Sze Teck Tng Chye Kee and known as Wee Kee Kongsi was

  dissolved on the death of Lee Wee Kheng on 18 July 1962.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. An order that the said partnership may be wound up by

  this Court.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. A declaration that all the shares in the following

  banks and insurance companies, registered in the name of Lee Wee Nam, as on 18 July 1962

  were beneficially owned by the Partners in the Wee Kee Kongsi in the proportions of 9/21

  to Lee Wee Kheng, 8/12 [sic] to Lee Wee Nam, and 4/12 [sic] to the trust of Sze Teck Tng

  Chye Kee.</font></p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<u><p><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly</font></p></u>, there was Originating Summons No. 194 of

  1982 in which another 3 of the several beneficiaries of the Estate of Nam who are also the

  Interveners herein had similarly sued Tng and Woon (the Plaintiffs herein) for <i>inter

  alia</i> accounts and enquiries as to:

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(1) An inquiry as to what properties belonging to the

  and whether any property so received possessed or vested as aforesaid was paid or

  transferred to or into the name of any other person and if so whom, at what time or times

  and under what circumstances and what changes of investment of the said properties were

<p><font face="Times New Roman">(11) An inquiry whether there is any debt of the Testator

</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The above O.S. No. 194 of 1982 is now subject of

interlocutory applications and is pending hearing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The Executors and Trustees of Nam’s estate have

sold assets of the estate and made distributions a number of times to all beneficiaries in

the last few years but the Plaintiffs aver that Tng and Woon have not made a full and fair

disclosure of all the assets belonging to Nam and his estate and are now demanding a Deed

of Release from the Plaintiffs unconditionally releasing them consequent upon an intended

final distribution of the assets of Nam’s Estate which they have refused to sign.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Present Suit</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. Having briefly alluded to the above background

concerning the parties and the proceedings they brought, I now proceed to deal with the

Plaintiffs’ present Suit and the declaratory orders sought by the Plaintiffs and the

Defendant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. At the hearing, Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs submitted that the issues to be decided were:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Whether the gift from Nam to Tng of shares belonging

  to Wee Kee Kongsi were effective to convey to Tng the portion of shares owned by Nam

  through his interest in Wee Kee Kongsi;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Whether the transfer of shares by Nam to Tng raises

  the presumption of advancement;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Whether Nam’s estate is estopped from claiming

  from Tng the portion of shares attributable to it through its interest in Wee Kee Kongsi.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">These issues, Counsel stated, were not litigated in the

Consolidated Suits as:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) they never arose there;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) the Consolidated Suit was an adjudication of the

  rights between the Estate of Nam (on the one hand), Wee Kee Kongsi and the Estate of Kheng

  (on the other hand);</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) neither the Court nor the parties addressed their

  minds to the rights inter se between the Estate of Nam and Tng;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) the issue that the Consolidated Suit decided was that

  the shares belonged to Wee Kee Kongsi;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) the Defendant does not in any way challenge or

  contradict this finding in the framing of his case.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.1 Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff had clearly conceded that the 27 shares formed part of the assets of Wee Kee

Kongsi (pg 3 of Notes of Evidence) as decided by Chao J. Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs effectively in the end wanted a clarification and orders as

to:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) what shares Tng would have to restore to the estate of

  Nam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) whether Tng was entitled to an indemnity and

  contribution of all costs from the estate of Nam in claiming his entitlement to the shares

  and defending his position as it had been decided that Nam had given the shares to him in

  breach of the trust, a matter of which he was not aware of as he believed the shares were

  a bona fide gift to him. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14.2 I might add for clarification that the 27 OUB shares

of $100/- each are equivalent to 125,564 such shares currently. The total dividends

declared amount to $188,159.63cts since the death of Nam.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. The Defendant in his Affidavit dated 13 April 2000 and

by his Counsel representing him in his personal capacity, claimed the 27 OUB shares as

belonging to him stating that his late father had made a gift of the said shares to him in

1963 although no formal documents were signed to record that fact. His claim surprisingly

conflicted with his position as put forward by Counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs, he being the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff as well. He explained that his late

father had subscribed to the 27 shares as <i>excess rights</i> given to him over and above

his entitlement to other rights given to him in respect of his shareholding in the said

counter. He referred to paragraph 5 of the Plaintiffs’ Joint Affidavit and <i>Exhibit

LHT2 </i>filed therein showing the excess of 27 shares under Nam’s name in the OUB

share register and their transfer to himself on or about 8 August 1963. He had offered his

father $2,700/- at the material time for 27 OUB shares but his father had declined the

offer repeating it was a gift to him. He believed his father gave him the shares as an

appreciation for the assistance he gave him in his business over the past thirty plus

years. He had subsequently taken up other rights issued on the said shares paying for

them. The shares had multiplied manifold. The Defendant provided a history of accumulation

of the subsequent rights issue and their cost which he paid till 1994. On 11 August 1983

he had transferred about 96,588 OUB shares which were attributable to the original 27

shares. Of this total 68,120 were either rights shares which he paid for or were bonus

shares. The Defendant specifically prayed for an order that he be entitled to retain the

27 shares attributable to the Estate of Nam with all the accrued benefits to-date declared

on the share.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. The Interveners’ Counsel submitted that the

application made herein by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs as Executors

and Trustees for the orders sought was not a <i>bona fide</i> application in view of the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiff and the Defendant being actually one and the same person though acting in

different capacities. The application was not even served on the Interveners as

beneficiaries and they only had learned of it much later. The application was facilitated

by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff by allowing the proceedings to be filed essentially by the

1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs in an attempt to mainly vest the 27 shares in OUB in the

Defendant notwithstanding that in the prior proceedings in the Consolidated Suit in which

both Tng and Woon were Defendants in their capacity as Executors, as well as in their

personal capacities it had been decided by Chao J that the 27 OUB shares belonged to Wee

Kee Kongsi and that Nam had been holding them as a trustee for Wee Kee Kongsi. Counsel

also submitted that the Defendant had seriously contradicted his position in claiming the

27 OUB shares belonged to him when he was a signatory to the making of an Estate Duty

Affidavit after the death of Nam in which the 27 OUB shares were included amongst other

shares as belonging to Wee Kee Kongsi. There was no dispute as to this point. Also in 1984

the Plaintiffs had made an agreement to settle the question of the 152 OUB shares which

included the 27 OUB shares with the beneficiaries (1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>

Plaintiffs in the Consolidated Suit). Counsel also brought to the attention of the Court

which fact was not disputed by the Defendant’ Counsel that although Tng had filed a

defence in the Consolidated Suits he had failed to turn up and testify at the hearing to

claim the 27 OUB shares. Similarly Woon had also not testified and both had therefore also

not subjected themselves to cross-examination. Counsel contended that Chao J had further

fully given his reasons in holding that Nam held the shares as a trustee for Wee Kee

Kongsi and had committed a breach of trust in transferring them to Tng. Tng was in the

circumstances abusing the process of the court and attempting to re-litigate the matter

and the doctrine of res judicata and estoppel operated against him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. Having considered the Affidavit evidence and all the

submissions and the Counsel of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs having

conceded by agreeing that the 27 OUB shares formed part of the assets of Wee Kee Kongsi

and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs having accepted the decision of Chao

J on the issue of the ownership of the 27 OUB shares, there was no doubt in my mind that

the Defendant (in his personal capacity but the alter ego of the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff)

was attempting to re-litigate the matter to the entitlement of the 27 OUB shares. The

Defendant had failed to pursue his claim in the trial before Chao J after filing his

defence by testifying and subjecting himself to cross-examination concerning his claim or

claims which Plaintiffs’ Counsel was now articulating. Moreover, Chao J in his

judgment gave detailed reasons why the 27 OUB shares belonged to Wee Kee Kongsi in his

judgment (unreported) at pg 21E to pg 24E. All the relevant exhibits including the

extracts of the relevant share register was before the learned Judge. These reasons

amongst other matters, were scrutinised by both the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council

where the Defendant was one of the appellants. The appeals had been dismissed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.1 In its judgment in the Court of Appeal, Rajendran J

delivering the judgment of the Court, confirming Chao J’s finding, stated:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"(3) The 152 OUB shares (125 + 27) were entered by

  the appellants in the schedule to the estate duty affidavit for Wee Nam’s estate. On

  17 April 1982, the appellants’ then solicitors wrote to the Commissioner of Estate

  Duty and informed him that the 152 shares were held by Wee Nam in trust for the Kongsi.

  Although it is said that this was a mistake, no evidence was called to substantiate that

  submission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">(4) In April 1984, the appellants agreed to settle with

  the first to fourth respondents in respect of these shares. Again no explanation was given

  in evidence by the appellants as to why they did this if the shares did not belong to the

  Kongsi. "</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17.2 The Privy Council upholding the Court of

Appeal’s decision concerning the 27 OUB shares and other shares had this to add about

the conduct of Woon, Tng and Nam:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">"The fact is that, while the totality of information

  put before the court by Woon and Tng with reference to the circumstances of the

  acquisition and ownership of the disputed shares left those circumstances unclear, and

  with no explanation as to why they were unclear, the plain probability is that the shares

  were Kongsi property. Nam treated the shares as his separate property for a period of

  time. If he had survived, he could no doubt have carried out the consequential accounting

  either to demonstrate his separate ownership, if that in truth were the position, or to

  make due allowance for the transfers out to his newly formed company in favour of his

  section of the family."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. In my opinion therefore, the Defendant could not

reassert his claim to the 27 OUB shares or say that the several issues defined by the 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs’ Counsel as set out earlier had not arisen in the

Consolidated Suit and claim that there was as such no re-litigation of the issues here.

The truth is the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff (the Defendant) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff

could and should have raised the issue there as they were Defendants to the Suit. They

chose not to. The judgment of Chao J upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council

touching on the issue of the 27 OUB shares therefore operated both as an estoppel by

record and as an issue estoppel against the Defendant. Such judgment prevented both the 1<sup>st</sup>

Plaintiff who is also the Defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff from denying or

re-agitating the facts on which it is based. The only exception when a judgment does not

operate as such is when it is obtained by fraud or collusion which is plainly not the case

here. The proceeding by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs and the claim by

the Defendant was an abusive of the process of court.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. In the circumstances, I dismissed the Defendant’s

claim that the 27 OUB shares were a gift to him by Nam. The shares were the property of

Wee Kee Kongsi.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. The secondary question posed by the Plaintiffs’

Counsel as to what shares Tng would have to restore to the estate of Nam in respect of the

27 OUB shares does not arise in view of my decision that the said shares were not given to

the Defendant as gift or advancement and did not vest in him. Nam’s estate would,

according to Chao J’s judgment, get a 8/21 share of the 27 OUB shares (with all

accretions) which was declared to be owned by Wee Kee Kongsi as that was the proportion of

Nam’s interest in Wee Kee Kongsi. Tng’s interest in the said shares was only as

one of the beneficiaries of Nam’s estate whatever that might be.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20.1 As to the question of entitlement to indemnity or

contribution and costs for Tng for the reason that Tng was not aware that the shares were

given to him in breach of trust and he had only defended his position on the shares

believing it to be a <i>bona fide</i> gift to him or had personally expended monies on the

rights in respect of the shares, the Defendant must also fail on this issue. Tng and Woon

had not appeared in the Consolidated Suit to put forward this view. The Privy Council

succinctly observed in the appeal in the Consolidated Suits that Tng and Woon had left the

circumstances of the acquisition and ownership of the shares unclear with no explanation

as to why they were unclear. The 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs and the

Defendant who is also the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff must abide by all of Chao J’s

orders touching and concerning the 27 OUB shares.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. In the circumstances, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs’ application and the claim of the Defendant (the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff)

was dismissed with costs. I ordered that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs

bear the Interveners’ costs herein personally and that the Estate of Nam should not

be burdened with these costs as these proceedings were an abuse of the process of the

court. I further made no order as to costs between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiffs and the Defendant for obvious reasons.</font></p>
