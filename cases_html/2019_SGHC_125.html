Jocelyn commenced this action against Richard alleging a breach of a declaration of trust executed on 17 April 2012 (“DOT”) in which it was declared that Richard held two properties at Jalan Ampang (“the Ampang Property”) and Jalan Wajek (“the Wajek Property”) (collectively, “the Properties”) on trust for Jocelyn. She alleged that Richard failed to rent out the Properties and failed to execute an option to purchase (“OTP”) for the Ampang Property when she had found a buyer for it. She thus claimed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for loss of rental income for the Properties and damages as a result of the diminution in value of the Ampang Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The parties were married in 1965.

Subsequently they decided to purchase the Wajek Property to live in and to rent out the Ampang Property. As Jocelyn did not receive approval from the authorities to rent out the Ampang Property, and the parties could not jointly purchase the Wajek Property, she transferred her interest in the Ampang Property to Richard in July 1998. In September 1999, the Wajek Property was purchased in Richard’s name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In early 2012, the parties’ relationship took a turn for the worse. It was during this time that the DOT was executed and signed by the both of them on 17 April 2012. I set out the material terms of the DOT below:

</div>
</div> Throughout their marriage, they had agreed to leave the family’s wealth to their children and grandchildren. Worried that in the event of a divorce, Richard would get a share of the matrimonial assets and spend it rather than preserve it for future generations, she wanted him to transfer his beneficial interest in the Properties to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Hence in early April 2012, Jocelyn instructed Gabriel Law Corporation (“Gabriel Law”) to prepare a draft trust deed for Richard to transfer the beneficial interest in the Properties to her. Richard refused to sign this trust deed as it did not stipulate that he was to receive any rental income from the Ampang Property. Jocelyn then instructed Mr Jeffrey Beh (“Beh”), a family friend and lawyer from Lee Bon Leong &amp; Co, to prepare another trust deed to transfer the beneficial interest in the Properties to her and to provide for rental income from the Properties to be deposited into a joint bank account.

</div>
</div> On 16 April 2012, Beh went to the matrimonial home (then the Wajek Property) and spoke to Richard about the trust deed. The next day Beh returned with the DOT which Richard signed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 24 October 2012, Richard moved out of the Wajek Property to stay with the parties’ daughter Shona.

Richard failed in his duties to rent out the Properties after he moved out from the Wajek Property, and Jocelyn thus claimed for loss of rental from the Properties. Further, in July 2013, Jocelyn found a buyer for the Ampang Property for $8.8m but Richard refused to sign the OTP for the intended sale. Consequently, the intended sale did not materialise and the Ampang Property has since diminished in value.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Richard claimed that he signed the DOT under duress. He denied that he was having an affair but Jocelyn repeatedly harassed, nagged and ranted at him regarding the alleged affair. In early April 2012 (before the DOT was executed), he was also suffering from poor health. To obtain respite from Jocelyn’s behaviour, he moved out to stay with Shona for three nights before moving back to the Wajek Property again.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Richard confirmed that he was initially given a document prepared by Gabriel Law that Jocelyn wanted him to sign. He refused to sign the document as he disagreed with its terms, which stated that the Properties were acquired using Jocelyn’s moneys. Richard denied that Beh, a mutual friend, had met him on 16 April 2012. However, he did sign the DOT on 17 April 2012 when Beh went to the matrimonial home with it. Richard was surprised by Beh’s visit that day as he did not know that Jocelyn had asked Beh to prepare a trust deed. When Richard saw that the DOT stated that the Properties were purchased with Jocelyn’s moneys and that he was all along a trustee of the Properties for her, he told Beh that he disagreed with the terms of the DOT as the Ampang Property was paid for partly with his CPF moneys. Nevertheless, because of the unpleasant situation at home, he felt compelled to sign the DOT in the hope that some peace and normalcy would return to his life. On 24 October 2012, Richard left the matrimonial home permanently to stay with Shona as Jocelyn continued to harass him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Richard also claimed that the trust arrangement under the DOT was illegal, null, void and unenforceable under ss 3 and 23 of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the RPA”).

</div> Even if the DOT was valid, Richard denied being in breach of his duties as a trustee under the DOT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Richard also called Shona and Kelvin (the parties’ son) to testify, and I will refer to their evidence in my findings below where necessary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The main issues for consideration are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the DOT was vitiated by duress or illegality due to contravention of the RPA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the DOT is valid and enforceable, whether Jocelyn can succeed in her claims for lost rental in respect of the Properties, and diminution in value due to the aborted sale of the Ampang Property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issue – Application for hearing </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in camera</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 At the outset, Richard’s counsel (Mr Chiok) applied for the matter to be heard <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> pursuant to s 8(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”), and relying on <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2017] SGHC 316 (“<span class="font-italic">BOK</span>”). This was a private dispute between family members and that the defendant’s witnesses were the parties’ children who were “prominent professionals”. Also, there were ancillary matters in separate divorce proceedings between the parties. Finally, a hearing <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> would decrease the acrimony between the parties. Jocelyn objected to the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I disallowed the application because there was no reason to depart from the position that a civil matter is to be heard in open court under s 8(1) of the SCJA, and I was not satisfied that there was any sufficient reason to order the hearing to be <span class="font-italic">in camera</span>. In <span class="font-italic">BOK</span>, one of the defendants, who was a party to the suit, was an infant. Unlike in <span class="font-italic">BOK</span>, there were no minor children involved and the witnesses who Richard intended to call were adults. Moreover, the mere fact that the action concerned a dispute between family members was unexceptional and did not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> justify a hearing <span class="font-italic">in camera</span>, even if the same parties were embroiled in a pending matrimonial case. That the witnesses were professionals or family members did not mean that they should be afforded privacy from open court proceedings. Many civil proceedings involve disputes between family members, in which family members are called as witnesses. Finally, I was not convinced that a hearing <span class="font-italic">in camera</span> would decrease the acrimony between parties. It might even have had the converse effect of encouraging parties to vent their frustrations liberally and freely make allegations against each other under the cover of a private hearing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Duress</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I turn then to the issue on duress. A party alleging duress must show that there was pressure amounting to compulsion of his will and that the pressure exerted was illegitimate (<span class="font-italic">Tam Tak Chuen v Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 240 at [22]; <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another</span><span class="font-italic"> (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 at [51]). I find that Richard has not been able to show that there was duress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It is questionable whether Jocelyn’s conduct rose to the level that constituted duress let alone whether any pressure exerted was illegitimate. I accept that Jocelyn did confront and badger Richard somewhat regarding his alleged affair with another woman (“the third party”) and that Jocelyn and Richard quarrelled over this. There were messages between Richard and the third party. Jocelyn was upset and had showed the messages that she discovered on Richard’s phone to him and spoke to him on numerous occasions to get his reassurance that there was nothing going on.

A party’s conduct following the entry into an agreement allegedly vitiated by duress can be material to shed light on whether there actually was duress (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Pao On v Lau Yiu Lon </span>[1980] AC 614 at 635; <span class="font-italic">Third World Development Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Atang Latief </span>[1990] 1 SLR(R) 96 at [15]).

</div> and so that was the case Jocelyn had to meet. The parties’ closing submissions were also framed in terms of duress.

In any case, the possibility of subsuming duress under the umbrella of unconscionability arises only under a broad doctrine of unconscionability, which the court rejected (at [175]). Hence, Richard’s reliance on the abovementioned test for duress was misplaced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Regardless, even assuming that Mr Chiok had sought to rely on the doctrine of unconscionability, the facts he cited in support of a finding of unconscionability are the same as those I considered in coming to my finding that there was no duress, and I would have found that unconscionability was not made out. At the time of executing the DOT, Richard was neither poor nor ignorant, he was not suffering from infirmities that were grave enough to affect his ability to conserve his own interests, and he did not lack opportunity to seek independent legal advice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Illegality </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I turn next to Richard’s argument that the DOT is illegal under the RPA.

</div> This does not change my finding that a fresh trust was created when the DOT was signed. The issue of whether a property is matrimonial property would become relevant in the division of assets in the divorce proceedings, and this remains the case regardless of who beneficially owned the property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Third, it could not have been either party’s intent for the DOT to merely evidence a prior trust dating back to the time the Properties were purchased, as they knew that this would have made no sense and would have defeated the point of executing the DOT. Richard knew that Jocelyn devised the trust to prevent the Properties from falling into the hands of the third party and to ensure that the Properties remained in the family for the benefit of their descendants.

</div> At that time, her main concern was to ensure that the Properties remained within the family. Both parties also knew that Jocelyn could not claim any beneficial interest in the Properties while she was not a Singapore citizen (which was why the Properties were held in Richard’s sole name). It would be self-defeating to execute a DOT that merely evidenced a prior illegal trust arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Fourth, the quantum of stamp duty paid is objective evidence that sheds light on the parties’ intention in entering into the DOT. I accept Mr Yeo’s argument that the stamp duty payable would be only $10 and not $261,600 (excluding late payment penalty) as was actually paid, had the DOT merely evidenced a pre-existing trust rather than creating a fresh trust (which would have involved a transfer of beneficial interest and attracted <span class="font-italic">ad valorem </span>stamp duty). No doubt, the stamp duty was paid only sometime after the DOT was signed and paid by Jocelyn.

Even if the parties had originally intended for Jocelyn and Richard to share in the beneficial interest or treated the Properties as “theirs” (or Jocelyn claimed, hers), my conclusion would not change. While that would have been an illegal arrangement prohibited under s 23 of the RPA when Jocelyn was not a Singapore citizen, the upshot of the illegality is that Richard would be treated as the full beneficial (and legal) owner of the Properties. However, this would not have prevented a <span class="font-italic">fresh </span>trust (uninfected by the original illegality) from being declared over the Properties when the DOT was executed between them, and when Jocelyn was already a Singapore citizen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 At the end of the day, I find that the operative part of the DOT should prevail because it is clear, whilst the recital of the DOT is ambiguous.

Further, I find that when the DOT was executed the parties had intended to create a fresh trust over the Properties in Jocelyn’s favour, because they knew that Jocelyn could not stake a claim on the Properties at the time when she was not a Singapore citizen and they both perceived that the DOT (which arose only after Jocelyn had become a Singapore citizen, the alleged affair had taken place and Richard had filed for a divorce) would be the best way to achieve the objective of preserving the Properties for their descendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Accordingly, the DOT does not contravene the RPA and is valid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Claim for rental </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Preliminarily, there is a difference between a claim that Richard breached his duty to let the Properties under the trust created by the DOT, and a claim that he breached the (express or implied) covenants or terms of a contract embodied in the DOT. This was not made clear in the pleadings and submissions. Jocelyn appeared to allude to this distinction in her pleadings where she claimed that Richard “[i]n breach of the said covenant and his duties as a trustee … failed and/or neglected to rent out any of the Properties and/or to pay for any outgoings of the Properties”

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 It is a question of interpretation whether the words of the DOT are capable of embodying a contract alongside creating a trust. This could potentially be the case as the clause creating a trust of the Properties is presented separately from the express covenants. Moreover, the covenants create bilateral obligations between the parties to them, whilst the typical duties of a trustee are owed by the trustee to the beneficiary. But I say no more about the possibility of obligations in contract because parties ultimately advanced their cases on the basis of trust law, and my eventual decision on Jocelyn’s claims regarding the loss of rental in respect of the Properties and the diminution in value of the Ampang Property would be no different. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Express trustee’s duty </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The facts here involve an express trust.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 That a duty to let property (particularly land) is one owed by trustees of express trusts generally is supported by <span class="font-italic">Byrnes</span><span class="font-italic"> v Kendle </span>(2011) 243 CLR 253 (“<span class="font-italic">Byrnes</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Byrnes</span>, the respondent was the registered proprietor of a residential property. He was married to the second appellant. The respondent signed an acknowledgment of trust, declaring that he held one undivided half interest in the property as tenant in common upon trust for the second appellant. Subsequently, the respondent and second appellant separated. The second appellant then assigned her interest in the property to her son (the first appellant). The appellants later sued the respondent alleging breach of trust. They claimed that the respondent allowed his son to live in the property between 2002 and 2007 and took no steps to collect rent from him after the first fortnight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The High Court of Australia held that the respondent was under a duty to let the property and collect rent. The rationale was that absent such a duty, the beneficiary would derive no benefit from the interest conferred upon her under the trust, and the trustee with the legal title was the only one who had the power to grant a lease of the property to another and thus derive income for the beneficiary (at [22]). The High Court held at [67] and [119] that “[a]s a general proposition, where the trust estate includes land, it is the duty of the trustee to render the land productive by leasing it, and this is so even if the trust instrument does not expressly so provide” and “[e]ven if there is no direction in the trust instrument that the trust property be invested”. The duty to invest the trust property is subject to the limits permitted by statute and to any limits stated in the trust document. French CJ added that in any event, the nature of the trust in that case did not lend itself easily to characterisation as a bare trust. Heydon and Crennan JJ also held (at [119]) that the duty to let the property arose when the respondent and second appellant were no longer living in the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The English decision of <span class="font-italic">Brudenell-Bruce v Moore </span>[2014] EWHC 3679 (Ch) (at [88]) cited <span class="font-italic">Byrnes</span> for the proposition that trustees may be obliged to seek to generate income from land comprised in the trust, in the context of exercising the power of investment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2015) at para [1-040], the learner authors stated thus: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are two potential explanations why a trustee holding property for a beneficiary absolutely entitled might have no duties other than a duty to transfer the property to the beneficiary or as he directs. The first explanation is that the position of such a trustee is so supine, being a mere repository, that he need do nothing whatever, save to effect the transfer. The other position is that, pending transfer, he has powers and hence with it, responsibility, of his own, and the exercise of the powers is up to him, not the beneficiary. The second explanation, to the extent that this is correct, militates against the view that a trustee for a beneficiary absolutely entitled has a passive role.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The learned authors further stated that “[a] trustee holding land on trust for an absolute beneficiary is not a mere cypher and has the powers of a beneficial owner in relation to the land. His role is therefore an active one”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I agree with <span class="font-italic">Byrnes</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic"> </span>A trustee of an express trust who holds land on trust for an absolute beneficiary is under a duty to let the property and generate income from it. This duty arises: (a) subject to any limits imposed by statute or the trust instrument; or (b) unless the facts and circumstances otherwise indicate that parties intended the trustee to be a mere repository for the trust property. Absent such a duty, the beneficiary would derive no benefit from the interest conferred on her under the trust. Such a duty may be held in abeyance if, for instance, the beneficiary is occupying the property – in such a case, the beneficiary would have derived a benefit from her interest in the land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In this case, Richard is thus under a duty to let the property and generate income from it, and that such a duty has not been limited or negated on the facts. To the contrary, the terms of the DOT and the facts and context support the imposition of such a duty and, for this same reason, I find that Richard would have been under a duty to let the Properties that arose <span class="font-italic">on the facts of the</span><span class="font-italic"> case</span>, even if a duty did not exist generally. The parties had consistently treated the Properties either as the matrimonial home or for letting to generate income. The Ampang Property was first purchased to live in, and rented out when the Wajek Property was purchased as the matrimonial home. It is undisputed that the last tenant of the Ampang Property vacated it around 13 July 2013. Shortly thereafter in August 2013, Jocelyn (who was then residing at the Wajek Property) moved to the Ampang Property and the Wajek Property became vacant as Richard was staying with Shona permanently. Consistent with the parties’ intent, Jocelyn’s lawyers had on 22 July 2014 informed Richard’s lawyers of Jocelyn’s wish to let the Wajek Property, as construction works next door to it (which began in May 2013) had been completed. Even the letter of 6 August 2014 from Richard’s lawyers to Jocelyn’s lawyers stated <span class="font-italic">Richard’s</span> position that it made no sense for one of the Properties to be vacant and not rented out.

</div> First, the existence of a covenant or an agreement in the DOT on how to treat income or rental cannot did not necessarily imply a duty on Richard to let the Properties. But the absence of an express provision in the DOT imposing a duty was also not dispositive of the question whether there was an implied duty because that begs the question. Second, the impetus for the DOT to preserve the family’s assets is not inconsistent with imposing a duty on the trustee (Richard) to generate income from the Properties. Third, I did not place weight on Richard’s view that the DOT would have “no effect” if the marriage stayed intact. There is no evidence that this would have been the case and his duties as a trustee are not dependent on the state of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Richard was in breach of his duty to let the Properties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Having found that Richard, as trustee, had a duty to let the Properties, I turn to whether he was in breach of such a duty.

</div> He therefore could not rely on the parties’ failure to agree on the application of the rental income as a reason for failing or refusing to let the Wajek Property. Jocelyn, being the beneficial owner of the property pursuant to the DOT, could not be said to be unreasonable in not agreeing to share the rental proceeds with Richard. She was entitled to refuse to allow him to touch these funds, save for expenses relating to the upkeep of the property (the latter also being consistent with the DOT terms).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fourth, Richard’s financial means or lack thereof afford him no excuse. His assertion that he lacked the financial means to take steps to let the Wajek Property is at odds with his acceptance during cross-examination (albeit in the context of why he did not take steps to set aside the DOT) that he had the means to commence divorce proceedings. In fairness though, I note Jocelyn’s acceptance that “just day-to-day survival” was an issue for Richard and that he would have had no means to make repairs to the Wajek Property.

Hence she should “[i]n mitigation of her loss” have accepted the sale and then worked out the distribution of proceeds with Richard or reserved her rights.
