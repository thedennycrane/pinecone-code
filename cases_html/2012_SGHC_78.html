        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant is a 39-year old taxi driver. He
                    pleaded guilty in the District Court on 2 November 2011 to two charges. The
                    first was under s 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)
                    (“Road Traffic Act”) for driving without a valid licence
                    (“the first charge”). This offence was committed along the Irwell
                    Bank Road and River Valley Road junction on 5 October 2010. The second
                    charge was for an offence under s 65(a) of the Road Traffic Act for driving
                    without due care and attention resulting in his taxi knocking down a pedestrian
                    at the Kim Seng Road and Irwell Bank Road junction on the same date and time
                    (“the second charge”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant admitted to the statement of facts
                    and that his act had caused injury to the pedestrian, one Eika Chaturvedi
                    Banerjee (“Eika”), at a pedestrian crossing. Eika was taken to
                    hospital by an ambulance. The appellant also agreed to have seven other charges
                    taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. Four of those seven charges
                    were for offences committed on a different date and place (“the first set
                    of offences”). In that other incident, the appellant committed a speeding
                    offence along Nicoll Highway. He was also driving without a valid licence and
                    insurance coverage at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first set of offences was committed on
                    30 September 2010 at Nicoll Highway, barely a week before the offences
                    involved in the present appeal (“the Irwell Bank offences”) were
                    committed. The appellant’s conviction under the first charge in this
                    appeal carries a fine of not more than $1,000 or an imprisonment term of not
                    more than three months for a first-time offender, and a fine of not more than
                    $2,000 or an imprisonment term of not more than six months for a subsequent
                    offence under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act. Since the appellant had
                    agreed to have the first set of offences taken into account for the purposes of
                    sentencing, the Irwell Bank offences do not count as subsequent offences. The
                    judge below sentenced him to a fine of $800, and disqualification from holding
                    or obtaining a driving licence for twelve months for all classes of vehicles
                    under s 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act. In respect of the second charge, he
                    was sentenced to a fine of $600. The appellant could have been fined up to
                    $1,000 or jailed up to six months for the second charge under s 65 of the
                    Road Traffic Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant initially maintained that he was
                    not aware that he was driving without a valid licence when he committed the
                    Irwell Bank offences. (By way of background, the appellant’s driving
                    licence was revoked on 16 September 2010 after he failed to attend a
                    hearing at the District Court for a parking offence.) This led the Public
                    Prosecutor to apply to admit further evidence to show that the appellant was
                    aware of this. At the appeal before me, counsel for the appellant, Mr Paul,
                    conceded that the appellant was so aware and thus the Public Prosecutor’s
                    application for further evidence to be admitted became
                unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Paul submitted that the appellant should
                    not be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence because
                    s 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act should not apply to an offence under
                    s 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act. Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection
                        with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise
                        expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act,
                        order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for
                        life or for such period as the court deems fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Paul argued that the disqualification was imposed under the
                    first (and not the second) charge which was only for driving without a valid
                    licence. Mr Paul submitted that since an offence under s 35(1) of the
                    Road Traffic Act was not in connection with driving, a disqualification order
                    should not be made. He argued that s 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act
                    “is more concerned with having a licence than driving”. I do not
                    accept that there is any merit in this argument in the light of the clear and
                    express wording of ss 35(1) and 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act.
                    Section 42(1) has been set out above. Section 35(1) of the Road
                    Traffic Act provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person shall drive a motor
                        vehicle of any class or description on a road unless he is the holder of a
                        driving licence authorising him to drive a motor vehicle of that class or
                        description.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The words “any offence in connection with
                    the driving of a motor vehicle” in s 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act
                    are clear enough to include the circumstances under s 35(1) of the Road
                    Traffic Act. A person cannot commit the offence of driving without a valid
                    licence unless he is driving a motor vehicle. If he is driving a motor vehicle,
                    then his offence is “in connection with the driving of a motor
                    vehicle”. Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act clearly applies to
                    s 35(1) of the Road Traffic Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The only consideration remaining was whether the
                    disqualification was correctly imposed. In view of the circumstances outlined
                    above, I am of the view that the appellant’s sentence was lenient. He
                    committed two sets of serious Road Traffic Act violations within seven days.
                    This fact alone should warrant a higher sentence than was imposed but the
                    prosecutor did not appeal. In my view, the appellant’s sentence and
                    disqualification were not excessive, and were in fact a little lenient. Taxi
                    drivers as professional drivers ought to be setting the standard for courteous
                    and safe driving. The taxi companies have the responsibility of encouraging that
                    attitude in positive ways such as through education, training and reminders.
                    While the courts are not concerned with those methods of inculcating safe
                    driving, they will ensure that irresponsible drivers are sufficiently punished
                    especially where damage or injury is caused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For the reasons above the appeal was
                    dismissed.</p>
