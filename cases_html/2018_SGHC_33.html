The Project was to be completed by 19 May 2018. This 24-month contract period included a four-month mobilisation period in which Milan was to obtain various permits to commence work from the Building and Construction Authority (“the BCA”) and the Land Transport Authority (“the LTA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 As things panned out, the permit applications were substantially delayed and were only made between November 2016 and January 2017, some two to four months after the expiry of the mobilisation period. Eventually, Cluny discovered that the application for a permit to commence work in respect of permanent structural works was rejected by the BCA because Milan’s particulars were irregular. Specifically, Milan’s General Builder Class 1 Licence (“GB1 Licence”) had expired on 8 October 2016, which meant that Milan was not authorised to carry out any building works. Cluny terminated Milan’s employment on 22 February 2017, relying on Milan’s failure to renew its GB1 Licence, failure to proceed with diligence and failure to maintain the contractually-stipulated minimum sum in its project account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 29 May 2017, Cluny made a demand on a performance guarantee dated 22 November 2016 (“the PG”) furnished by Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (“Etiqa”) in relation to Milan’s performance in this Project. On 7 June 2017, Milan applied for an injunction to restrain Cluny from receiving the sum of $991,883.60 from Etiqa based on the call on the PG. Milan also applied for an interim injunction of the same nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I heard both matters and dismissed the applications on 4 October 2017. In my view, Milan failed to establish a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of fraud and/or unconscionability on Cluny’s part. In fact, the documentary evidence contradicted Milan’s position in material ways. Milan has appealed against my decision and I now set out my full grounds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Contract and the PG</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As mentioned, the Project was for the construction of six units of strata detached houses. On 9 April 2015, Cluny obtained written permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the URA”) for the proposed development. On 25 April 2016, the BCA approved Cluny’s building plans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 By way of a letter of award dated 20 May 2016 (“the Contract”), Cluny engaged Milan as its main contractor for the Project for the lump sum price of $9,918,836 (“the Contract Sum”).

Therefore, Cluny did not honestly believe that it had grounds to terminate the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, Cluny has not suffered any damages and the figures stated in the Cost of Termination Certificate are unsubstantiated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In response, Cluny argued that Milan’s failure to commence works at the site was due to Milan’s own delay in applying for the BCA-ERSS Permit and LTA-Rail Permit and Milan’s poor financial standing. Milan’s permit applications were not hampered or stalled by Cluny. Second, Cluny refuted the allegation that it was in repudiation for offering a supplementary agreement for a lower contract price. As for the validity of the termination, Cluny relied on Milan’s failure to proceed with due diligence, the lapsing of Milan’s GB1 Licence, and Milan’s failure to maintain the requisite sum in the project account as grounds for termination under cl 32 of the SIA Conditions and/or the common law. Cluny claimed to have satisfied the procedural requirements for termination under cl 32 of the SIA Conditions. Lastly, Cluny asserted that it had a valid claim against Milan in excess of the sum guaranteed in the PG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At the hearing, Cluny’s counsel, Mr Raymond Chan, sought to impress upon me that the most material factor in the round was the lapse of Milan’s GB1 Licence on 8 October 2016, for which Milan had no good explanation. The lapse of the GB1 Licence was a fundamental breach entitling Cluny to terminate the Contract and would have caused all permit applications to be rejected in any event. Mr Chan also clarified that Cluny was relying upon Milan’s failure to obtain only the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits, and not any other permits. Therefore, I considered only Cluny’s allegations that Milan failed to obtain those two permits and Milan’s rebuttals in that regard in support of its case for an injunction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The applicable legal principles were not disputed. The parties did not dispute that the PG was in the nature of an on-demand performance bond, and I agreed that this was so based on the construction of the PG. Thus, in calling upon the PG, Cluny was not required to establish or prove any breach by Milan before Etiqa was obliged to pay under the PG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 To obtain an injunction to restrain Cluny from calling on the PG, Milan must establish a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Cluny has engaged in fraudulent or unconscionable conduct (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 3 SLR 352 (“<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]–[21]). This is a high threshold, and calls on performance bonds will be restrained only in a narrow class of cases (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [24] and [31]). A high threshold is required because the courts have recognised a perennial tension in determining if a call on a performance bond should be restrained. On the one hand, calls made in bad faith would result in the beneficiary receiving something he is not entitled to and would damage the liquidity of the obligor who must compensate the bond issuer (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [27]). On the other hand, depriving the beneficiary of its right to call on the performance bond could be detrimental to its liquidity and its prospects pending the resolution of the substantive dispute (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [29]). Since the parties must abide by the bargain they have struck and the allocation of risk they have decided upon for themselves, the burden lies on the obligor to show why the beneficiary should be restrained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It is well established that unconscionability and fraud are separate and independent grounds for restraining a call on a performance bond under Singapore law. Since Milan has alleged both grounds, and unconscionability is the lower standard of the two, Milan’s case turns on showing strong <span class="font-italic">prima fac</span><span class="font-italic">ie </span>proof of unconscionability. What amounts to unconscionable conduct depends on the facts of each case. Unconscionability has been described as involving abuse, unfairness or dishonesty (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span> at [19]), or “conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith that a court of conscience would either restrain the party or refuse to assist the party” (<span class="font-italic">Raymond Construction Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Low Yang Tong </span>[1996] SGHC 136 at [5]). The existence of genuine disputes and mere breaches of contract do not amount to unconscionable conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 To put the principle in more concrete terms, where it can be said that the beneficiary under the performance bond did not honestly believe that the obligor whose performance is guaranteed by the bond has failed or refused to perform his obligations, the court may find that a demand was made dishonestly and in bad faith. Similarly, if the beneficiary has made a call for payment of a sum well in excess of the quantum of his actual or potential loss and could not have justified the demand for that amount, the beneficiary may be found to be acting unconscionably and in bad faith (see <span class="font-italic">JBE Properties Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Gammon Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 47 (“<span class="font-italic">JBE</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]). This is because a performance bond is merely security for the secondary obligation of the obligor to pay damages if the obligor breaches its primary contractual obligations to the beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">JBE </span>at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Lastly, it should be borne in mind that in hearing such an application, the court is not required to decide on the substantive entitlements of the parties and or to engage in a protracted consideration of the merits of the substantive disputes between the parties (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia</span> at [40]). In other words, the court is not concerned with whether Milan was in fact in default or not. This makes it important that the overall tenor and entire context of the parties’ conduct leading up to the call on the PG supports a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Having reviewed the affidavits filed by the parties, the chronology of events and the documents produced – particularly the minutes of the site meetings and the correspondence between the parties – I am of the view that Milan had not established a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of fraud and/or unconscionability on Cluny’s part. In fact, I find that the documentary evidence contradicted Milan’s position in various ways. I shall analyse each of Milan’s grounds for asserting fraud and/or unconscionability (set out at [24] above) in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Cluny had prevented Milan from commencing works</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I begin with Milan’s allegation that Cluny had prevented Milan from commencing works through their own delays in providing Milan with documentation required for the permit applications and in obtaining other permits that were also necessary to commence work. Specifically, Milan alleged that Cluny was responsible for delays in the Project in the following ways:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Milan’s initial position was that it was not responsible for applying for and obtaining the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits.

</div> Subsequently, Milan appeared to accept that it was responsible, and claimed instead that Cluny hampered the BCA-ERSS submission and LTA-Rail Permit submission in two ways. First, the Structural Engineer only obtained approval for the sub-structure scheme on 24 November 2016. Milan claimed the sub-structural plans were required for Milan’s PE to prepare the submissions for the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits because the proposals for ERSS or excavation works had to mirror and make calculations based on the sub-structural plans.

</div> In my view, it is not unconscionable for Cluny to attribute the substantial delay in the BCA-ERSS submission to Milan. Cluny’s signature did not affect the substance of the BCA-ERSS submission and Milan’s preparation of the supporting documents. If Milan had prepared the application in all other respects without delay, Cluny’s endorsement could have been promptly obtained. It was a fair inference from the evidence that the real delay was because Milan had not prepared the application expeditiously.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As for the “Request for Consent for Access” forms, Cluny did not endorse them because it had been advised by the BCA that these forms were not required.

Cluny appointed the new Architect a month later on 1 November 2016 and notified Milan on 10 November 2016. Milan’s PE was present at the site meeting with the Architect on 10 November 2016 and could have begun working with the Architect.

</div> In my view, this did not show that Cluny or the Architect was responsible for the delay because the Architect had acted promptly. Further, the Architect had informed Milan on 12 December 2016 that the Architect had spoken to the LTA. The LTA had noted the change in QP and it was possible for Milan to re-submit the LTA-Rail Permit application concurrently whilst the Architect’s notice was pending the LTA’s acceptance.

Milan’s position was that neither the Architect’s Direction No 1 nor the 21 Dec 2016 Letter could constitute the notice under cl 32(3)(d). This was because, after the receipt of Architect’s Direction No 1, Milan had taken steps to comply with the Contract by completing the construction of hoarding, submitting the master programme and performance bond, showing proof of a minimum operational sum in its project account, and applying for electrical, water and sanitary facilities.

</div> It is, however, clear that <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the steps outlined in Architect’s Direction No 1 were accomplished, if not by the contractually-stipulated time, then at least by 21 February 2017 when the Termination Certificate was issued.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, there is some merit in both sides’ contentions. In Milan’s favour, the Architect’s Direction No 1 did not give notice of a breach under cl 32(3)(d) specifically or give notice that termination would follow if the lapses were not rectified within a month. The 21 Dec 2016 Letter did not particularise the failure to obtain the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits but instead cited the failure to furnish the PG and the master programme, both of which were subsequently furnished before February 2017. On the other hand, Milan does not deny that Architect’s Direction No 1 was a notice of non-compliance with the Contract. The Architect’s Direction No 1 is, on its face, a notice that Milan was behind schedule in relation to the specified tasks, at least some of which remained outstanding on the date of the Termination Certificate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On balance, I find that Milan failed to prove a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case that Cluny terminated Milan without the prior written notice required under cl 32(3)(d). The correspondence also showed that the deadline for commencement of works was postponed multiple times and Milan was reminded at numerous junctures that the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permit applications were late and had to be expedited. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cluny’s substantive grounds for termination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn to the allegation that Cluny had no valid basis for termination. I deal first with the ground under cl 32(3)(d) of the SIA Conditions. I was of the view that whether and to what extent Milan had complied with Architect’s Direction No 1 in substance – and thus whether Cluny had grounds for termination under cl 32(3)(d) of the SIA Conditions – was a matter of genuine dispute between the parties. This is borne out by my summary of the parties’ positions at [52] above. Further, it follows from my earlier examination of the delay in the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permit applications (at [35]–[42] above) that Cluny’s claim that Milan failed to obtain the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits with diligence and due expedition was not a baseless one. Thus, Milan has not shown that Cluny did not honestly believe that it had grounds to terminate the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Besides cl 32(3)(d) of the SIA Conditions, Cluny also claimed that it was entitled to terminate the Contract under the common law on the basis of fundamental breaches by Milan, namely: (a) Milan’s failure to carry out works and obtain permits to commence work; (b) Milan’s failure to renew its GB1 Licence which expired on 8 October 2016; and (c) Milan’s failure to maintain a minimum stipulated sum in its project account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I was of the view that Milan failed to demonstrate a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that Cluny had no grounds to assert these fundamental breaches against Milan. I deal briefly with each ground in turn:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As regards Milan’s failure to carry out works and obtain permits, I have addressed Milan’s failure to obtain the BCA-ERSS and LTA-Rail Permits at [35]–[42] above. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As regards the GB1 Licence, Milan did not dispute that as at the date of termination, it had not had a valid GB1 Licence since 8 October 2016. Milan claimed that the licence could have been easily renewed within two weeks if it had been notified. However, the evidence showed that Milan had in fact been notified of this lapse. The BCA had informed Milan by way of letter dated 1 July 2016 that its GB1 Licence would be expiring on 8 October 2016 and expressly stated that there would be no subsequent reminder.

</div> Since a new builder has been engaged for a higher price and the completion of the Contract has indeed been delayed, there is no sign of unconscionability in Cluny asserting these sums as damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For the reasons explained above, I dismissed both applications for an interim and final injunction. Bearing in mind that the court’s role in such an application is not to decide on the parties’ substantive entitlements but to assess the overall tenor and entire context of the parties’ conduct leading up to the call on the PG (<span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia </span>at [40]), I was not satisfied that a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case was shown that Cluny acted unconscionably or fraudulently. Not only were there matters of genuine dispute between the parties, I found that the evidence materially supported Cluny’s position, at least on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> review. Having dismissed the applications, I awarded costs of $10,000 (all inclusive) to be paid by Milan to Cluny. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Poonaam Bai d/o Ramakrishnan Gnanasekaran, Lawrence Tan Shien Loon and Ho Shao Hsien (Eldan Law LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Raymond Chan and Soh Wan Cheng Denise (Chan Neo LLP) for the first respondent;<br/>The second respondent unrepresented.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
