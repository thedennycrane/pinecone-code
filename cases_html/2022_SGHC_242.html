</div>  This was for various reasons, but chiefly, the AR found that the fact that the plaintiff had permitted the discharge of the cargo against the LOI did not indicate, without more, that the plaintiff had given up its rights to demand delivery of the cargo upon presentation of the Bills of Lading.  According to the AR, this was because payment under the LC, upon the presentation of WOT’s commercial invoice and the LOI, was permitted only if the Bills of Lading were not available.  Further, the LC required that the Bills of Lading be indorsed “to the order of [the plaintiff]”.  In short, the AR accepted the submission by counsel for the plaintiff that the latter never intended to abandon its rights under the Bills of Lading to demand delivery of the Gasoil Cargo from the defendant.

One reason for the AR’s decision in this regard was that, while it was common ground that the value of the Gasoil Cargo should be determined as at 19 November 2020 (the date of the plaintiff’s demand for delivery of the Gasoil Cargo from the defendant (see [13] above)), neither of the parties produced evidence of the value of the Gasoil Cargo as at that date.

To obtain summary judgment, the plaintiff first has to show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment.  If the plaintiff succeeds in doing so, the burden shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain leave to defend, must establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence: <span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko</span> [2015] 1 SLR 325 (“<span class="font-italic">M2B</span>”) at [17].

Disputes of fact, the resolution of which will have an impact on the defendant’s liability, will ordinarily suffice to show that there are triable issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 That does not mean, of course, that bare denials or bare assertions made by the defendant are all that is needed: <span class="font-italic">M2B</span> at [19].  The court must examine the defences raised to determine if <span class="font-italic">any</span> one of them raises a fair or reasonable probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.  If so, unconditional leave to defend will be granted.  In some limited circumstances, the court may decide to grant conditional leave to defend, with the condition usually being in the form of the defendant having to furnish security for the plaintiff’s claim (see generally <span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam </span><span class="font-italic">Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 at [44]–[46]; <span class="font-italic">Ling</span><span class="font-italic"> Yew Kong v Teo Vin Li Richard</span> [2014] 2 SLR 123 at [36]).

The tactical burden has thus shifted to the defendant to show that there are some triable issues which would merit a grant of leave to defend.  In this regard, I should point out that the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment has been confined to its cause of action for misdelivery, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, breach of the contract of carriage, and the plaintiff has not relied on its alternative claim for conversion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In his arguments before me at the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the defendant focused mainly on one aspect of the plaintiff’s claim for misdelivery as raising specific triable issues.

In fact, the LC issued by the plaintiff stated that delivery would take place by ship at UT, with the latest delivery date being 29 February 2020 (see [8] above).  According to the defendant, this must mean that, when HLT made its application for the LC on 3 March 2020 and the plaintiff issued the LC on 4 March 2020, the plaintiff knew that the Gasoil Cargo for which HLT was seeking financing had already been delivered into HLT’s tanks at UT, without the presentation of the Bills of Lading.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The parties cited a host of authorities in relation to claims by bill of lading holders for misdelivery by defendant carriers.  I find three of them to be particularly relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Fimbank</span><span class="font-italic"> Plc v Discover Investment Corporation (The “Nika”)</span> [2021] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 109 (“<span class="font-italic">The N</span><span class="font-italic">ika</span>”), the claimant was a bank that had financed the purchase by its customer (“AD”) of a cargo of wheat carried on board the vessel, “Nika”.  The cargo of wheat was discharged and delivered to AD’s agent at Alexandria, Egypt without production of the bills of lading.  The wheat was then stored at a bonded warehouse, but later removed from there against production of forged bills of lading.  The claimant bank was never paid, and it brought proceedings against the owner of the vessel for damages for misdelivery.  The issue before the court was whether the claimant could establish a “good arguable case” that it would be entitled to substantial damages from the defendant so as to justify the grant of a freezing order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Andrew Baker J (“Baker J”) in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Nika</span> examined the financing arrangements between the claimant and the defendant shipowner.  He found that it was always intended between the claimant and AD that the wheat would be discharged by the carrier without production of the bills of lading, and stored at the bonded warehouse until payment was made by AD’s end-buyers, who could then collect the wheat from the warehouse by presenting the bills of lading (see <span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [20]–[22]).  There was no evidence that these arrangements were communicated to the defendant shipowner, who had simply discharged and delivered the cargo pursuant to a letter of indemnity (see <span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [23]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Baker J held that the claimant bank did not have a good arguable case that the defendant was liable to it for substantial damages (<span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [32]).  He found that the claimant bank had no claim for misdelivery because AD and its agent were authorised by the claimant bank to take delivery from the vessel without production of the bills of lading, and that it was immaterial that the defendant was not told that AD and its agent were so authorised (<span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [26]–[28]).  He also found that, even if AD’s agent had not been authorised by the claimant to collect the cargo from the vessel, the claimant would face “formidable difficulties of causation” (<span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [29]–[30]).  This was because the wheat was discharged and stored in the warehouse pursuant to the arrangements agreed between the claimant and AD.  As such, the “only effective cause of loss [was] not the shipowner’s discharge of the cargo otherwise than against bills of lading that the claimant had no intention of presenting to the ship or allowing the shipowner to take, but rather the breakdown in the arrangements ashore by way of the claimant becoming the victim of a fraud that had nothing to do with the shipowner” (<span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [34]).  In short, the claimant’s loss was not caused by the misdelivery by the shipowner, and the claimant would not be entitled to any substantial damages even if there was a valid claim for breach of the contract of carriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">UniCredit Bank AG v </span><span class="font-italic">Euronav NV</span> [2022] EWHC 957 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">The S</span><span class="font-italic">ienna</span>”), the claimant bank brought a claim for damages for breach by the defendant shipowner of the bill of lading contract by delivering a cargo of low sulphur fuel oil to a third party without production of the bill of lading.  On 1 April 2020, the claimant had financed the purchase by its customer, Gulf Petrochem FZC (“Gulf”), of part of the cargo of fuel oil from BP Oil International Ltd (the “financed cargo”), shipped on the vessel, “Sienna”.  The bill of lading provided that the financed cargo would be delivered at Fujairah, United Arab Emirates.  However, between around 26 April 2020 and 2 May 2020, the defendant discharged the financed cargo by ship to ship transfer to two other vessels at Sohar, Oman, without requiring production of the bill of lading: see <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [1]–[10].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The claimant’s representative gave evidence at the trial that she did not approve, or even know of, the discharge of the financed cargo by ship to ship transfer at Sohar, and that, if she had been asked by Gulf to authorise discharge in that manner so that delivery could be made to Gulf’s end-buyers, she would not have agreed to do so (see <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [58]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The financing arrangements between the claimant bank and Gulf were that the financed cargo would be re-sold to end-buyers on terms that required those end-buyers to pay the claimant directly (see <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [8]).  After examining in some detail the correspondence that had passed during the material time between the claimant’s representative and Gulf, Moulder J made certain critical findings:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was inherent in the financing arrangements between the claimant bank and Gulf that the financed cargo would be discharged by the defendant shipowner without production of the bill of lading.  In fact, the claimant bank had accepted that the bill of lading would not be available until discharge had taken place: <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [89]–[90].  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the claimant bank had implicitly, if not expressly, approved of discharge without production of the bill of lading, and the claimant had no concerns at that time about Gulf defaulting on its repayment obligations: <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [92] and [120].  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, if the claimant had been aware of, or told that, discharge would be made to the end-buyers by ship to ship transfer at Sohar, the claimant bank would not have objected to this course of action: <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [121].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the result, Moulder J dismissed the claimant bank’s claims on the basis that any breach by the defendant shipowner of the bill of lading contract by discharging the financed cargo, without production of the bill of lading, did not cause the loss suffered by the claimant (<span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [122]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 HC/ADM 16/2021 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">STI Orchard</span>”) is a recent case concerning a claim for misdelivery of cargo that also arises from the collapse of HLT.  The plaintiff in that case, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”), financed HLT’s purchase of a cargo of gasoil shipped on board the defendant’s vessel, “STI Orchard”.  HLT’s financial position subsequently deteriorated, and it defaulted on its obligation to repay OCBC.  HLT was eventually ordered to indorse the bills of lading in favour of OCBC, and OCBC then commenced proceedings against the defendant shipowner for delivering the cargo of gasoil to HLT without presentation of the bills of lading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 OCBC applied for summary judgment on its claim.  AR Navin Anand (“AR Navin”) granted the defendant shipowner unconditional leave to defend the action in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “STI Orchard” (Winson Oil Trading Pte Ltd, intervener)</span> [2022] SGHCR 6 (“<span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span> (HCR)”), and OCBC’s appeal against that decision was dismissed by Kwek Mean Luck J (“Kwek J”) in HC/RA 174/2022.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Both AR Navin and Kwek J were of the view that there were several triable issues.  One of those issues was whether the financing and security arrangements between OCBC and HLT were such that OCBC actually regarded the bills of lading as its security for financing the purchase of the gasoil.  Several facts led to the courts’ decision.  First, the letter of credit issued by OCBC provided that the bills of lading were to be issued or indorsed to HLT’s order, not OCBC’s (see <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span> (HCR) at [55]).

</div>  Second, OCBC had entered into a trust receipt loan with HLT for the sums due under the letter of credit, after the delivery of the cargo had taken place.  OCBC did not impose a requirement that HLT had to indorse the bills of lading, or hand them over, to OCBC (see <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span> (HCR) at [56(a)]–[56(b)]).

</div>
</div>  There was also some evidence which showed that OCBC knew, or was put on notice, that the gasoil would be blended and on-sold by HLT to PT Pertamina (Persero) (“Pertamina”), and that OCBC was looking to those sale proceeds to be held on trust by HLT for OCBC under the trust receipt arrangements as security (see <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span> (HCR) at [56(c)]).

Again, this was because of the evidence that OCBC knew, or was put on notice, of the arrangements by HLT to blend the gasoil into a different product and on-sell that to Pertamina, and that OCBC was looking to those sale proceeds as collateral to secure HLT’s indebtedness (see <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span> (HCR) at [68]–[76]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I find myself in agreement with the defendant that it has raised some triable issues in relation to the issue of causation, and that it should be granted leave to defend the action.  Specifically, there is a triable issue as to whether the defendant’s misdelivery <span class="font-italic">caused</span> the plaintiff’s loss, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the plaintiff has suffered a recoverable loss from the defendant’s breach of the contract of carriage.  In that regard, it is then relevant to consider whether the plaintiff looked to the Bills of Lading as security for its financing of HLT’s purchase of the Gasoil Cargo.  In my view, this is an issue which ought to be fully explored at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I pause to note that the position at law is unclear as to <span class="font-italic">how</span> the test of causation should be applied.  The approach taken in <span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> and <span class="font-italic">The Si</span><span class="font-italic">enna</span> appears to suggest that the court should consider whether the misdelivery is the effective or proximate cause of the claimant’s loss.

</div>  For example, it was clearly a material fact in <span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> that the claimant bank and its customer, AD, had entered into an agreement for the warehousing of the cargo upon its discharge without the need for presentation of the bills of lading (see <span class="font-italic">The Nika</span> at [21]).  In <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span>, Moulder J regarded as relevant the facts that (i) Gulf was insured for 90% of the receivables under the contracts with the end-buyers of the financed cargo, and the claimant bank had the benefit of an assignment of that insurance policy (which excluded related parties as end-buyers from coverage); and (ii) the claimant bank’s representative had been informed of the identities of the end-buyers of the financed cargo and had confirmed that those end-buyers were acceptable (see <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [108] and [120]).  That suggested that the claimant bank might have been prepared to take the credit risk of those end-buyers, and would have permitted discharge of the financed cargo without production of the bill of lading (see <span class="font-italic">The Sienna</span> at [121]).  In <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard</span>, it was significant that there was evidence that OCBC knew that the cargo of gasoil would be blended into a different product for on-sale to Pertamina (see <span class="font-italic">The STI Orchard </span>(HCR) at [74]).

</div>  That act would have rendered the bills of lading in respect of the gasoil worthless.

In turn, at least two triable issues of fact arise, which are material to the question of whether the plaintiff looked to the Bills of Lading as security: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the plaintiff had knowledge that the Gasoil Cargo had already been discharged into HLT’s tanks at UT, at the time it accepted HLT’s LC application; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) what the specific financial arrangements between the plaintiff and HLT were.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the plaintiff had knowledge that the Gasoil Cargo had already been discharged into HLT’s tanks at UT </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The facts of this case are rather peculiar in that this is not a typical situation where it is immediately obvious that a bank has financed the purchase of goods, and finds itself having to look to the goods as security when its customer has failed to make payment of the loan.  Rather, it is certainly arguable that, by the time the plaintiff agreed to finance the purchase of the Gasoil Cargo from WOT, it knew, or at least ought to have known, that the Gasoil Cargo was already in the custody of HLT.  The plaintiff disputes that it had such knowledge, and points out that the reference to 29 February 2020 being the “latest delivery date” in HLT’s application form is far from clear (see [30] above).  I accept that the wording used by HLT is not entirely clear, but this gives rise to a dispute of fact pertaining to the state of the plaintiff’s knowledge as to the whereabouts of the Gasoil Cargo as of 3 to 4 March 2020 (when HLT applied for the LC and when the plaintiff issued the LC).  It may be that discovery or interrogatories in these proceedings will shed light on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I am unable to agree with the plaintiff’s contention that its knowledge, or otherwise, about the Gasoil Cargo being already discharged into HLT’s tanks at UT is not a triable issue.

</div>  The plaintiff submits that its level of knowledge is irrelevant to whether it can still maintain a claim against the defendant for misdelivery.  However, if it is the case that the plaintiff knew that the cargo was already in HLT’s custody at UT <span class="font-italic">before</span> the plaintiff proceeded to finance the purchase and issue the LC, then that could arguably indicate that the plaintiff did not regard the Bills of Lading as security.  Put another way, if the plaintiff was aware that the Gasoil Cargo had already been delivered to HLT at UT, the plaintiff could not expect that the Bills of Lading would remain as the ‘keys to the warehouse’, and that the defendant would deliver up the Gasoil Cargo upon presentation of the Bills of Lading.  Viewed from the prism of a causation of loss analysis, that would mean that, while there was a breach of the contract of carriage because the defendant misdelivered the Gasoil Cargo to HLT, that breach was arguably not the proximate or effective cause of the plaintiff’s loss.  Instead, the plaintiff’s loss would have been caused by HLT’s financial collapse in April 2020, which rendered HLT unable to repay its loan owed to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The financial arrangements between the plaintiff and HLT </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The plaintiff’s position is that the LC which it issued in the present case was provided pursuant to facilities it had granted to HLT in 2017.

</div>   This effectively extended the time for HLT to make payment to the plaintiff by 31 days.  The plaintiff did not ask for any security for this “Import Loan”, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by way of a trust receipt arrangement.  This suggests that the plaintiff might have been aware that the Gasoil Cargo was unsold, and that HLT was requesting for time to sell the Gasoil Cargo before it could repay the loan to the plaintiff.

</div>  I agree that this raises questions that can only be properly answered after a trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I should add that the LOI also requires WOT to undertake to send the Bills of Lading, once those have come into its possession, to<span class="font-italic"> HLT</span>, whereupon WOT’s obligation to indemnify HLT would cease.  That again might suggest that, for this particular transaction, it was not intended that the Bills of Lading would “pass through the Bank”, and that the bank would not look to the Bills of Lading as security.  The defendant argues that the fact that the Bills of Lading were subsequently indorsed by WOT to the plaintiff in August 2020 was simply because, by then, HLT had suffered its financial collapse and the plaintiff was seeking all means to try to recover its losses, and hence wanted the Bills of Lading indorsed to it.  It contends that the plaintiff’s demand for the Bills of Lading was “contrived, coming only after HLT was in financial difficulties and where the prospects of recovery had been preliminarily assessed at 18%”, and that the plaintiff “never had any intention to call on or demand for the [Gasoil Cargo] and was now effectively looking to lay its losses at [the defendant’s] feet when it did not look to the Bills of Lading as security at the time it financed HLT’s purchase of the [Gasoil Cargo] or when it further extended the loan to HLT”.

</div>  In my view, a trial is needed in order for the court to determine whether this is the case.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendant also points out that, in any event, the plaintiff was arguably not entitled to enforce the LOI issued by WOT to obtain the Bills of Lading.  As mentioned above at [9]–[10], the form of the letter of indemnity provided that it was to be issued by WOT to HLT (and not the plaintiff).  Moreover, the form contained a clause expressly excluding any benefit or remedy from being conferred under the letter of indemnity on any party other than the named buyer (HLT).  The defendant contends that, under the LOI, the plaintiff thus does not have any benefit or remedy.  According to the defendant, this suggests that the plaintiff did not intend for the Bills of Lading to be security.  This is because the plaintiff agreed that payment under the LC would be made against the presentation of an LOI which did not give it any rights to obtain the Bills of Lading, effectively “disclaim[ing] any interest in the Bills of Lading and [leaving] any disposal of the Bills of Lading to be a matter between HLT and WOT”.

</div>  In my judgment, whether the plaintiff had relinquished its rights to the Bills of Lading, and whether this suggests that the plaintiff did not regard the Bills of Lading as security, are triable issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I should also add that the issue is further complicated by the fact that HLT was a long-standing customer of the plaintiff, and the issue of what the plaintiff knew about HLT’s intentions regarding the Gasoil Cargo must also be investigated.  As HLT’s business model meant that it would probably store this unsold Gasoil Cargo in its tanks at UT, the plaintiff might well have been aware that the cargo had already been delivered to HLT for its storage at UT by the time it issued the LC to finance the cargo’s purchase.  That might possibly explain why the plaintiff did not appear to be concerned by the wording of HLT’s application for financing on 3 March 2020, which suggested that the cargo might have already been delivered to HLT.  As already explained (see [51] above), if the plaintiff had knowledge that the Gasoil Cargo was already in HLT’s possession, the question that presents itself is whether one can describe the plaintiff’s loss, which arises from the financing which it granted to HLT after the defendant misdelivered the Gasoil Cargo, as being effectively caused by the prior act of misdelivery by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the above reasons, I find that the defendant has raised triable issues, and I therefore grant the defendant unconditional leave to defend the action.  I am unconvinced that the defences raised in relation to the issue of causation are “wholly unsustainable”, as a matter of fact and law (see above at [22]).  Let me be clear though, that I have not determined in any way the various contentions of the parties on the merits of the claim, including those that were dealt with by the AR below concerning whether the plaintiff is a lawful holder of the Bills of Lading, whether the Bills of Lading were spent, and whether there was consent and/or ratification of the delivery of the cargo.  In this judgment, I have only considered the defendant’s arguments in relation to causation, and in this regard, I have only focused my mind on whether the defendant has managed to raise triable issues as to whether the plaintiff has suffered any recoverable loss from the misdelivery of the Gasoil Cargo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I therefore allow the appeal and set aside the orders made by the AR below.
