<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font size="3" xmlns="">1        The

two Originating Motions before me concern applications by two Queen’s Counsel for ad

hoc admission to practise as advocates and solicitors in the High Court. The applicant in

O.M. 600028/2002 is Mr. Martin Lee Chu Ming, Q.C. and in O.M. 600029/2002, Mr. William

Henric Nicholas, Q.C. They apply to be admitted to represent the defendant, Dr. Chee Soon

Juan, in two actions in the High Court, viz. Suit No 1459/2001 in which the plaintiff is

Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and Suit No 1460/2001 in which the plaintiff is Mr. Goh Chok Tong. Dr.

Chee appeared before me to make the applications on behalf of Mr. Martin Lee and Mr.

William Nicholas.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2        The

applications are made under s 21 of the Legal Profession Act ("the Act") which

provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote align="justify">
<p><font size="3">(1)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

    Act, the court may, for the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it

    is of sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the

    case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="3">(a)    holds Her Majesty`s Patent as Queen`s Counsel;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">(b)    does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or

      Malaysia but who has come or intends  to come to Singapore for the purpose of

      appearing in the case; and</font></p>
<p><font size="3">(c)    has special qualifications or experience for the

      purpose of the case.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3        The law

relating to admission under this provision is settled. The Court of Appeal held in <i>Price

Arthur Leolin v A-G</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 972</nobr> that there is a three-stage test. This was

elaborated in <i>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael (No 2)</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 440</nobr>, where the Court

said at  11:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">11.    The requirements of [s 21(1)] were

    considered at length by the Court of Appeal in <i>Price Arthur Leolin v A-G &amp; Ors</i>
<nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 972</nobr>. In its judgment, the court articulated a three-stage test for admission

    under s 21(1). At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which

    he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and

    complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen`s Counsel. Such difficulty or

    complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to admit is still a

    matter for the court`s discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must

    persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court

    exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to satisfy the court

    of his suitability for admission.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">These stages can be summarised as: (i) whether the case

is of sufficient difficulty and complexity; (ii) whether the circumstances of the case

warrant admission; and (iii) whether the applicant is a suitable person for admission.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4        The present

applications are the second by both applicants for admission in the two suits. They first

applied in O.M. 600021/2002 and O.M. 600023/2002. Their applications were dismissed by Tay

Yong Kwang J.C. on 18 April 2002 on two grounds:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(i)    the suits in question were not of

    sufficient difficulty and complexity to warrant admission of Queen’s Counsel; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(ii)    there was no evidence of anything

    in the circumstances of the case that warranted the court to exercise its discretion

    in      favour of admission of Queen’s Counsel.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5        In respect

of the first ground, that of difficulty and complexity, Tay Yong Kwang J.C. said as

follows at  39 to  41:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">39.    The affidavits in support of the

    two applications merely assert that these cases are extremely complex defamation matters

    without explaining how they are so. The issues listed are general in nature and case law

    and legal writing on such issues must abound both here and in other common law

    jurisdictions. It seems to me that the cases here only require the application of

    established principles to the facts. As Chan Sek Keong J said in <i>Re Oliver David

    Keightley Rideal Q.C.</i> (at page 402G – H):</font></p>
<blockquote align="justify">
<p><font size="3">"With reference to the first requirement, it is the judge, and not

      the parties, or their counsel, or other interested parties, who has to be satisfied that a

      case is of sufficient difficulty and complexity. The considered views of instructing

      solicitors on the issues raised are relevant and should be given their proper weight, but

      mere assertions that cases or issues are difficult and complex are of no assistance to the

      court in discharging its duty. It is therefore incumbent on counsel to identify the issues

      to the judge hearing the application and his views on the applicable law. A case may be

      difficult and complex in relation to the facts as well as the law."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">40.    The fact that there is a

    Counterclaim in one of the actions here and that there are Third Party proceedings in both

    cases is certainly not novel. These are essentially procedural matters and even if they

    add to the number of parties and causes of action, they do not necessarily increase the

    complexity of the case. It has not been shown to me how the Counterclaim and the Third

    Party proceedings have raised the issues to such level of difficulty and complexity that

    the admission of one Q.C. is warranted, let alone two Q.C.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">41.    In the circumstances, I am not

    satisfied that the two cases are of sufficient difficulty and complexity to warrant the

    admission of Q.C.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6        In respect

of the second ground, Tay Yong Kwang J.C. said at  42 to  43 of his Grounds of

Decision:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">42.    The other factor mentioned in the

    affidavits is "the identity and positions of the Plaintiffs are further powerful

    reasons why it is proper and necessary for me to engage the services of leading Counsel

    from outside of Singapore". By this, Dr Chee appears to be implying that no local

    lawyer is able and willing to act for him. There are presently more than 3000 practising

    advocates and solicitors and more than 20 of these are Senior Counsel. While I need not be

    convinced of the absolute absence of any local counsel capable of taking on or willing to

    take on the cases here (see <i>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael Q.C. (No 2)</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 440</nobr>), no evidence has been proffered on this point to assist me in the balancing exercise.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">43.    The applications for admission

    therefore also fail at the "second stage".</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7        The two

motions before me are made by the same applicants for admission under the same provision

in the Act to represent the same defendant in the same suits as the two motions before Tay

Yong Kwang J.C. The only difference is that Dr. Chee had filed different affidavits in the

present applications. In the new affidavits, he set out in more detail his reasons for

saying that the suits were of sufficient difficulty and complexity. Additionally he had

also deposed that he had approached a few lawyers but they were unable to represent him

because they did not have the experience or resources or they could not afford to act for

him for free.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8        The

applicants have not appealed against the dismissal by Tay Yong Kwang J.C. of their

previous applications. In the premises, they are bound by the findings of the judge that

the suits in question are not of sufficient difficulty and complexity and that there was

no evidence that the circumstances of the case warranted admission of Queen’s

Counsel. They are therefore estopped from contending otherwise in this application. The

doctrine of issue estoppel is summarised in the following manner in <i>Halsbury’s

Laws of England (4 Ed. Reissue) Vol. 16</i> at 977:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">A party is precluded from contending the contrary of any

    precise point which having once been distinctly put in issue, has been solemnly and with

    certainty determined against him. Even if the objects of the first and second actions are

    different, the finding on a matter which came directly (not collaterally or incidentally)

    in issue in the first action, provided it is embodied in a judicial decision that is

    final, is conclusive in a second action between the same parties and their privies. This

    principle applies whether the point involved in the earlier decision, and as to which the

    parties are estopped, is one of fact or one of law, or one of mixed fact and law. The

    conditions for the application of the doctrine have been stated as being that:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(1)    the same question was decided in

      both proceedings;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(2)    the judicial decision said to

      create the estoppel was final; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(3)    the parties to the judicial

      decision or their privies were the same persons as the     parties to

      the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9        In the

present applications the parties are the same, the issues to be decided by the court are

the same as those in the previous applications. The decision is clearly set out by Tay

Yong Kwang J.C. in his written grounds of decision and it is final, save that the

applicants have a right to appeal against it to the Court of Appeal. If the applicants are

not satisfied with the decisions of Tay Yong Kwang J.C., the proper course of action would

have been to file an appeal. If they have fresh evidence, the correct procedure would be

to apply to the Court of Appeal for leave to adduce such evidence. For me to entertain

this second set of applications would tantamount hearing an appeal against the

judge’s decision in respect of the first set of hearings. I have no jurisdiction to

do that. It would also mean that an applicant who is not satisfied with the dismissal by a

judge of his application can make a new one to another judge and keep doing so until he

obtains an outcome that he is satisfied with. Clearly this cannot be the case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10        In view of

the foregoing, I dismissed the applications.</font></p>
