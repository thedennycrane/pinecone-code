        Hoo Sheau Peng JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The first accused, Fauziya Mohammed (“the
                    first accused”), is a 35-year-old Ghanaian national. She claimed trial to
                    a charge of trafficking in not less than 1,871.6g of methamphetamine
                    (“the methamphetamine”), a controlled drug, without any
                    authorisation, an offence under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The charge
                    averred that on 21 February 2012, at about 5.47pm, the first accused gave a
                    luggage bag (“the luggage bag”) containing the methamphetamine to
                    the second accused, Komal Rihan Nand Kumar (“the second accused”),
                    in Room 315 of the Golden Royal Hotel, 51 Desker Road, Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The second accused is a 32-year-old Malaysian
                    national. She claimed trial to a charge of attempting to export the
                    methamphetamine from Singapore, without any authorisation, an offence under ss 7
                    and 12 of the MDA. The charge averred that on 21 February 2012, at about 7.10pm,
                    the second accused attempted to export the luggage bag containing the
                    methamphetamine from Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the joint trial, I
                    convicted the first and second accused persons of the respective charge against
                    each of them. Further, I found that each of them had satisfied the requirements
                    under s 33B(2) of the MDA. Instead of the death penalty provided for under s
                    33(1), pursuant to s 33B(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA, I
                    imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on each of them, to commence on 23
                    February 2012 which is the date they were first charged in court. These are the
                    reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s case </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Trafficking by the first accused </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I begin with the evidence led by the
                    prosecution, which was largely undisputed. On 20 February 2012, the first
                    accused arrived at Changi Airport, Singapore, with the luggage bag which was an
                    ordinary-looking black trolley suitcase. The first accused brought it to
                    Singapore from the Republic of Niger (“Niger”), after travelling
                    via Morocco and Doha, Qatar. Upon her arrival in Singapore, she checked into
                    Room 315 of the Golden Royal Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As captured on closed circuit television
                    footages obtained from the Golden Royal Hotel, on 21 February 2012, around
                    5.40pm, the second accused met the first accused at the lobby area of the hotel.
                    The second accused was carrying her baby daughter (“the baby”) in
                    her arms. They proceeded to take the lift to Room 315. At about 5.47pm, the
                    parties left Room 315, with the second accused pulling the luggage bag towards
                    the lift. When they emerged from the lift at the lobby area, the first accused
                    pulled the luggage bag out of the lift, and passed it to the second
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Attempt to export by the second accused </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Thereafter, the second accused left the Golden
                    Royal Hotel with the luggage bag. She proceeded to the taxi stand at Queen
                    Street, so as to queue for a Malaysia-registered taxi to go to Malaysia. At
                    about 6pm, she boarded a taxi driven by Abu Talip bin A Latip (“Mr Abu
                    Talip”), sharing the ride with two other female Chinese passengers who
                    were also waiting in the queue. Before departing, Mr Abu Talip helped her put
                    the luggage bag in the boot of his taxi as she was carrying the
                baby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From Queen Street, Mr Abu Talip drove the taxi
                    to the Woodlands Checkpoint. At about 7.10pm, the taxi was stopped for checks at
                    the Woodlands Checkpoint. A party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau
                    (“CNB”) questioned Mr Abu Talip and his passengers. The second
                    accused informed Woman Sergeant Palan Hemmamalani (“W/Sgt Hemma”)
                    and Staff Sergeant Abdul Hafiz bin Roslan (“SSgt Hafiz”) that she
                    had a luggage bag in the boot of the taxi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The taxi was diverted to a garage for further
                    checks. W/Sgt Hemma instructed the second accused to retrieve the luggage bag
                    from the boot, and she started to search the luggage bag. The second accused
                    became hysterical. She started to cry aloud, saying that the luggage bag did not
                    belong to her. She also protested that whatever was in the luggage bag was not
                    hers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As she was observed to be unsteady on her feet,
                    the second accused was asked to sit on a chair with the baby. Then, she started
                    to have breathing difficulties. W/Sgt Hemma took the baby from the second
                    accused, and handed the baby to another officer. As the second accused attempted
                    to bite her tongue, W/Sgt Hemma and another female officer tried to calm her
                    down.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arrest of the two accused persons </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Meanwhile, SSgt Hafiz continued with the
                    search of the luggage bag. At about 7.45pm, SSgt Hafiz slit open one side of the
                    luggage bag, and uncovered some white crystalline substance believed to be a
                    controlled drug. The second accused was placed under arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     That same night, another party of CNB officers
                    conducted a search in the vicinity of the Golden Royal Hotel for the first
                    accused. At about 10.50pm, the CNB officers spotted the first accused and
                    arrested her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Recovery and analysis of the methamphetamine </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the main compartment of the luggage bag,
                    there were 11 sets of African attire of different colours and styles for women
                    (“the clothes”). On 22 February 2012, at about 2am, under the
                    instructions of the then investigating officer, Assistant Superintendent
                    Nathaniel Sim Junqing (“ASP Sim”), Staff Sergeant Matthew Tan Chun
                    Kiat (“SSgt Tan”) cut out the two sides of the luggage bag. From
                    one side, two hidden pieces of boards labelled “A1A” were
                    uncovered, with white crystalline substance sandwiched in between. From the
                    other side of the luggage bag, another two hidden pieces of boards labelled
                    “A1B”, which concealed white crystalline substance in between,
                    were uncovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     SSgt Tan poured out the crystalline substance
                    from the pieces of boards “A1A” and “A1B” into two
                    plastic bags which were then sealed, and marked as “A1A-D” and
                    “A1B-D”. He sent them to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the
                    Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Meanwhile, ASP Sim
                    sent the pieces of boards “A1A” and “A1B” to the DNA
                    Profiling Laboratory of the HSA for DNA analysis by Christopher Syn Kiu Choong
                    (“Mr Syn”). There was still some crystalline substance adhering to
                    the inner surfaces of “A1A” and “A1B”. After Mr Syn
                    completed his examination, he collected the remaining crystalline substance on
                    “A1A” and “A1B”, and packed them into two plastic
                    bags which were sealed. He marked the two plastic bags as “A1A-E2”
                    and “A1B-E3” and sent them to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory for
                    analysis. Upon analysis by Yu Lijie of the Illicit Drugs Laboratory, the four
                    bags were found to contain 2,381.29g of crystalline substance with not less than
                    1,871.6g of methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statements by the first accused </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The prosecution relied on five statements made
                    by the first accused including the statement recorded pursuant to s 23 of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) on 22
                    February 2012 (“the cautioned statement, Exh P47”); a statement
                    recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 25 February 2012 (“the second
                    long statement, Exh P50”); and another statement recorded pursuant to s
                    22 of the CPC on 28 February 2012 (“the third long statement, Exh
                    51”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The first accused did not challenge the
                    voluntariness of the statements. However, she disputed the accuracy of a few
                    matters. In due course, I shall deal with the contents of the statements in more
                    detail. For now, it suffices to say that in the statements, the first accused
                    explained how she came to be in possession of the luggage bag, brought it to
                    Singapore, and handed it to the second accused. Crucially, she stated that she
                    thought the luggage bag contained only the clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statements by the second accused </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Eight statements of the second accused were
                    adduced by the prosecution including the statement recorded pursuant to s 23 of
                    the CPC on 25 February 2012 (“the cautioned statement, Exh P49”);
                    three statements recorded pursuant to s 22 of the CPC on 28 February 2012
                    (“the first long statement, Exh P52”), 29 February 2012
                    (“the second long statement, Exh P53”) and 19 December 2012
                    (“the third long statement, Exh P54”); and her accounts given to
                    the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), as contained in the IMH
                    reports dated 29 March 2012 and 26 June 2013 (“the two IMH
                    reports”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The second accused did not challenge the
                    voluntariness of the eight statements. In the statements, the second accused
                    sought to deny that the luggage bag was in her possession. She came to Singapore
                    to collect clothes which she had agreed to purchase from the first accused. At
                    the Golden Royal Hotel, she did not take the luggage bag as she was worried
                    about its contents. In the course of the different statements, she gave
                    different accounts of how the first accused put the luggage bag in the boot of
                    the taxi. In any case, the second accused thought the luggage bag contained
                    clothes. I shall return to the contents of the statements shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Close of the prosecution’s case </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At the close of the prosecution’s case,
                    there was evidence to show that on 21 February 2012, the first accused gave the
                    luggage bag to the second accused, and the latter took it with her to the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint. As the two accused persons were in actual possession of
                    the luggage bag containing the methamphetamine, under s 18(1) of the MDA, they
                    were presumed to be in possession of the methamphetamine contained in the
                    luggage bag. In turn, under s 18(2) of the MDA, both the accused persons were
                    presumed to have known the nature of the drugs contained in the bag. As such, I
                    was satisfied that the prosecution has made out a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case on the respective charge against the first accused and
                    the second accused. I called for the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first accused’s defence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first accused elected to give evidence,
                    and I set out the main aspects of her evidence-in-chief. Married with three
                    children, the first accused used to live in Kumasi, Ghana. She sold clothes for
                    a living, but her business was not doing well. Prior to her arrest, she met a
                    friend named Nana, who offered to introduce her to someone named Young, who
                    could finance her in her business provided that she carried out a trip for
                    Young.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 14 February 2012, the first accused left
                    Kumasi, Ghana for Niger travelling by bus through Burkina Faso. It was a two day
                    journey. When she arrived at the Niger bus terminal on 16 February 2012, she was
                    met by Young and Nana. Young brought her to his house, where she stayed for one
                    night. Young took away her passport.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The next day, Young brought the luggage bag to
                    the house, and told her to pack her own clothes in the luggage bag. She did so.
                    After that, Young told the first accused to take a rest as she would be
                    travelling that night. He carried the luggage bag with him, and placed it in the
                    boot of his car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     That evening, Young came back to the house to
                    fetch the first accused to the airport. At the airport, Young checked in the
                    luggage bag. He handed her the passport, and also gave her the flight tickets,
                    some receipts and US$3,000 in cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     When she arrived in Singapore on 20 February
                    2012, she boarded a taxi, and went to the Golden Royal Hotel. In Room 315, she
                    opened the luggage bag to take her own clothes out. She saw the clothes in the
                    luggage bag. However, she was not sure what else was inside the luggage bag. She
                    informed Young of the hotel that she was staying in. In turn, he informed her
                    that someone would come to collect the luggage bag from her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 21 February 2012, the first accused called
                    Young again to ask about the arrangements. He told her someone wearing a green
                    T-shirt and carrying a baby would collect the luggage bag from her at the hotel.
                    She informed Young what she was wearing that day. Young instructed her to call
                    him before handing over the luggage bag to the person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Sometime in the evening, as the first accused
                    was waiting in the lobby, the second accused arrived, and called out
                    “Fauziya from Africa”. Both of them went into the lift, so as to
                    go up to Room 315. In Room 315, the first accused called Young. At Young’s
                    request, the first accused passed the phone to the second accused. After they
                    had spoken, the second accused passed the phone back to the first accused. Young
                    confirmed that the luggage bag was to be given to the second accused. The second
                    accused then took the luggage bag. Both the accused persons took the lift down
                    to the lobby. The second accused left with the luggage bag, and the first
                    accused went back to her room.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Later that night, she was arrested. Consistent
                    with the position in her statements, the first accused’s defence was that
                    she thought the luggage bag contained only the clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second accused’s defence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Electing to give evidence, the second accused
                    gave this account in her evidence-in-chief. A kindergarten teacher, she is
                    married to one Emman Bishop Engkuww, a Nigerian national. He played football
                    with a Malaysian club. At the time of her arrest, their baby was barely seven
                    months old. After her arrest, her husband could not be located. The baby has
                    been placed in a children’s home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The second accused said that her husband asked
                    for her help to go to Singapore with the baby, to collect a luggage bag and to
                    bring it to Malaysia on behalf of one of his male friends. She had to make the
                    trip as she was the only one with a passport. Her husband assured her that there
                    would only be clothes in the luggage bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 21 February 2012, the second accused left
                    Kuala Lumpur in the morning, and took a bus to Singapore. When she arrived, her
                    husband told her via text messages that she was to collect the luggage bag from
                    the first accused at the Golden Royal Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     When she arrived at the Golden Royal Hotel,
                    the first accused looked at her as if she knew her. Subsequently, they entered
                    the lift, and went into Room 315. Someone called the first accused on the
                    telephone. The first accused passed the telephone to the second accused to speak
                    to Young. Young told the second accused to take the luggage bag and pass it to
                    someone in Malaysia. She asked Young what was inside the luggage bag, and he
                    told her there were clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     After that, the second accused saw the first
                    accused open the luggage bag, take out all her clothes from the luggage bag and
                    then close it. The first accused told the second accused that there were only
                    clothes in the luggage bag. The second accused did not look into the luggage
                    bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Subsequently, the second accused left the
                    Golden Royal Hotel, and took a taxi to Queen Street. She boarded the taxi driven
                    by Mr Abu Talip, together with the baby. Mr Abu Talip helped her put the luggage
                    bag into the boot of the taxi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     When the taxi was stopped at Woodlands
                    Checkpoint, she saw SSgt Hafiz search the luggage bag, and take out all the
                    clothes. It was the first time she saw the clothes. When SSgt Hafiz cut one side
                    of the luggage bag, she saw some white crystalline substance coming out of the
                    luggage bag. She then realised there was illegal substance in the luggage
                    bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second accused admitted that substantial
                    portions of her statements concerning the role of the first accused were not
                    true. She made up the contents to protect her husband. She did not inform anyone
                    of her husband’s involvement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The second accused also gave evidence about a
                    trip she made to Cambodia on or around 1 February 2012, she made a trip to
                    Cambodia. She did so as instructed by her husband to collect a sports bag from a
                    Thai lady. From Cambodia, she sent an text message to her husband which
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Babe the thing is coming out pls help me im scard here</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>She was afraid when she noticed a “white powder”
                        coming out of the side of the sports bag. Although she did not know what the
                        “white powder” was, she thought it was harmful and could be
                        heroin. She thought her life and that of the baby had been put at risk. The
                        sports bag was meant to be collected by her husband’s
                        “brother”, who did not turn up. She returned to Malaysia
                        without the sports bag, as the sports bag was taken away by the Thai
                        lady.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Upon her return to Malaysia, the second
                    accused quarrelled with her husband. She felt that her husband was
                    “play[ing] with [her] life”. She told him about the “white
                    powder” in the sports bag, and asked whether it was illegal. However, he
                    assured her that there were only clothes in the sports bag, and there was
                    nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The second accused made a trip to Singapore on
                    11 February 2012. She said that the purpose was to meet a lady who wanted to
                    stay with her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It was the second accused’s position
                    that notwithstanding her previous experience in Cambodia, she agreed to travel
                    to Singapore on 21 February 2012 to help her husband collect the luggage bag
                    because she thought that the luggage bag contained only clothes. She trusted her
                    husband. They had been married for three years by then and she did not have
                    anyone else she could rely on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The charge against the first accused was under
                    s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Trafficking in controlled drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.—(1) Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for
                        a person, on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, whether or not
                        that other person is in Singapore —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) to traffic in a controlled drug; …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>By s 2 of the MDA, “traffic” means to
                        “sell, <em>give</em>, administer, transport,
                        send, deliver or distribute”, or offer to do any of the
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The charge against the second accused was one
                    under s 7 read with s 12 of the MDA which provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Import and export of controlled drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>7.</b> Except as authorised by this Act, it
                        shall be an offence for a person to import into or export from Singapore a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Abetments and attempts punishable as

                        on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While “export” is not defined in the MDA, it is
                        defined in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1985 Rev Ed) to mean
                        “to <em>take</em> or cause to be taken out of
                        Singapore by land, sea or air”, and I adopted the meaning
                        accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Essentially, the first accused admitted that
                    she <em>gave</em> the luggage bag with the methamphetamine
                    to the second accused, constituting the <em>actus reus</em>
                    of the charge against her. The second accused conceded that she attempted to
                        <em>take</em> the luggage bag with the methamphetamine
                    from Singapore to Malaysia, constituting the <em>actus
                        reus</em> of the charge against her. However, they denied any
                    knowledge of the methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In this regard, s 18 of the MDA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled
                            drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18. —(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or
                        custody or under his control —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) anything containing a controlled
                        drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in
                        his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
                        his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have
                        known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As set out in [18] above, both the accused
                    persons did not dispute physical possession of the luggage bag, triggering the
                    presumption that they were in possession of the methamphetamine contained in the
                    luggage bag under s 18(1) of the MDA. In turn, they were presumed to have
                    knowledge of the nature of the drugs in their possession under s 18(2) of the
                    MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In order to rebut the presumption of
                    knowledge, each of the accused persons had to show on a balance of probabilities
                    that she did not know the nature of the controlled drug referred to in the
                    respective charge or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature
                    of the controlled drug: see <em>Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v
                        Public Prosecutor and other matters</em> [2014] 3 SLR 721 at [75],
                    where the Court of Appeal endorsed its earlier decision in <em>Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 2 SLR
                    903. The Court of Appeal continued, at [75], to explain that an accused is not
                    able to rebut the presumption “by a mere assertion of his lack of
                    knowledge had he been wilfully blind as to the nature of the drugs”. In
                        <em>Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1156, the Court of Appeal stated at
                    [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Wilful blindness is not negligence or an inadvertent failure to make
                        inquiries. It refers to the blindness of a person to facts, which, in the
                        relevant context, he <em>deliberately refuses</em> to
                        inquire into. Such failure to inquire may sustain an inference of knowledge
                        of the actual or likely existence of the relevant drug. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Closing submissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The law, as set out above, is well settled.
                    The sole issue before me was whether the presumption of knowledge had been
                    rebutted. According to the prosecution, the first and second accused persons had
                    failed to do so. For the first accused, there were many suspicious circumstances
                    surrounding the delivery of the luggage bag to the second accused, and the first
                    accused deliberately closed her eyes to them. She was evasive in court in key
                    aspects, including the sum of US$3,000 given to her. As for the second accused,
                    it was submitted that she was not a credible witness. Again, there were many
                    suspicious circumstances surrounding her trip to take the luggage bag back to
                    Malaysia with her, and the second accused deliberately closed her eyes to them.
                    Also, it was telling that she was hysterical even before the methamphetamine was
                    recovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Defence counsel for the first accused
                    submitted that there was nothing suspicious about the circumstances surrounding
                    the delivery of the luggage bag. There was no real opportunity for the first
                    accused to search the luggage bag. In any case, the methamphetamine was well
                    hidden, and it was difficult even for the CNB officers to retrieve the drugs. He
                    submitted that therefore, the first accused had rebutted the presumption of
                    knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For the second accused, her defence counsel
                    submitted that her extreme reaction at Woodlands Checkpoint was brought about by
                    the stressful situation she found herself in. Her conduct during the Cambodia
                    trip showed that she refused to have anything to do with anything illicit. The
                    reason why the second accused gave the false statements was to protect her
                    husband. She trusted the husband, as he was the father of the baby. Gullible and
                    naïve, she was obedient to him. She accepted his assurances, and did not check
                    on the luggage bag. It was also submitted that she had rebutted the presumption
                    of knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings in respect of the first accused </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Journey from Ghana to Niger </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With that, I turn to evaluate the evidence,
                    beginning with the first accused’s evidence why she made the trip from
                    Kumasi, Ghana to Niger. In her evidence-in-chief, the first accused stated that
                    she was informed by Nana that someone was willing to finance her in her business
                    if she were to carry out a trip for him. Nana did not tell her how much she
                    would be paid, where she would be travelling to, or what kind of business her
                    friend was doing. It was highly unusual that for a mere delivery, a stranger
                    would be prepared to finance the first accused for her business. With the
                    limited information, and without attempting to find out more, the first accused
                    claimed she made the two day journey. Such evidence was troubling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In cross-examination, the first accused
                    continued to deny that Nana told her how much she was going to earn. This
                    directly contradicted paragraph 8 of the second long statement, Exh P50, where
                    the first accused stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… About a week before 14<sup>th</sup> February,
                        Nana told me that there was a man who would give me $3000 US dollars to
                        travel with a luggage bag. As this is a large amount of money, I decided to
                        take up the offer. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>To my mind, this was a material inconsistency. As will be
                        discussed at [57] to [62] below, the first accused was very evasive as to
                        whether the sum of US$3,000 seized from her was meant to be her payment.
                        What was contained in paragraph 8 of the second long statement, Exh P50,
                        appeared to be the real reason why the first accused embarked on the
                        journey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In cross-examination, the first accused then
                    claimed that Nana told her that Young would give her some clothes to travel
                    with, and that the clothes are to be sold at the place where she would deliver
                    them. This was not previously mentioned by the first accused in any of the five
                    statements adduced or in her evidence-in-chief. In my view, this was an
                    afterthought to shore up the defence that she thought she was delivering
                    clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dealings with Young and others in Niger </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I move on to her dealings with Young. In her
                    evidence-in-chief, the first accused said that upon meeting Young, the first
                    accused did not ask Young for details of the trip. Again, she did not ask where
                    she was going, how much she would be paid, and what she would be delivering.
                    That night, there were other persons who stayed over at Young’s house.
                    Apart from Nana, there were two women named “Rita” and
                    “Comfort”, and Young’s brother named “Obina”.
                    The first accused took photographs with them, and the photographs showed other
                    luggage bags in the house. However, she did not ask them about Young or the
                    trip. In fact, Young told her she was travelling to Singapore only on the day
                    they went to the airport.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Given these unusual circumstances including
                    those set out at [48] above, the first accused’s complete lack of
                    curiosity and interest about the trip was surprising, and suggested she knew
                    more about the trip then she claimed. What was contained in paragraph 8 of the
                    second long statement, Exh P50, appeared to be the truth, which is that she was
                    interested in making US$3,000 from the trip.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Handling of the luggage bag</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Next, in terms of the handling of the luggage
                    bag, there were various significant inconsistencies. In her evidence-in-chief,
                    the first accused stated that when Young brought the luggage bag into the house,
                    he asked her to pack her clothes on top of what was already in the bag. She did
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In cross-examination, she shifted her
                    position, and stated that Young packed her clothes into the luggage bag. She
                    then said that she did not look at the items in the luggage bag before or after
                    her clothes were put in. She did not ask Young whether she could check the
                    luggage bag herself. She first saw the contents of the luggage bag in Room 315
                    when she was unpacking her clothes from the luggage bag. However, she did not
                    touch or go through the contents. When she handed over the luggage bag to the
                    second accused, they did not open the luggage bag to verify the clothes in
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In contrast, in the cautioned statement, Exh
                    P47, she mentioned:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… This person in Niger’s condition was that I must delive[r]
                        the luggage to Singapore. I inspected the luggage and only found it to
                        contain clothing. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Then, in her second long statement, Exh P50, she said at
                        [11]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I woke up in the morning and found that Nana had left. Young told
                        me she was travelling. Young gave me a luggage bag with clothes inside, and
                        … I checked through the bag and saw only traditional clothing inside.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was clear to me that the first accused
                    vacillated between adopting the position that she had checked the luggage bag
                    and saying that she had not, as she was not certain which would be more
                    advantageous for her defence. Taken together with her strong denial that she
                    knew the true worth of US$3,000, and that the clothes were worth only about
                    US$100, discussed below at [60], I was of the view that she was trying to avoid
                    having to explain why upon seeing the clothes, she did not query why she should
                    be paid such a large sum for the delivery of 11 sets of African wear for women.
                    Further, given that this was supposedly a normal delivery of the clothes, it was
                    baffling that parties did not seek to ascertain the goods being handed
                    over.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Money matters </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The first accused’s evidence regarding
                    the US$3,000 was also inconsistent, unsatisfactory and illogical. First, as
                    stated at [49], her evidence that she did not know how much she was going to be
                    paid directly contradicted paragraph 8 of the second long statement, Exh
                    P50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Secondly, in cross-examination, she said that
                    when she was given the sum of US$3,000 at the airport by Young, she did not know
                    what the sum was for, and whether it would be enough for to stay in Singapore
                    for seven to eight days as planned. Young only told her that she could make
                    purchases with the money, and that she could earn profits after reselling the
                    items back home. She did not know if the money was meant to be given to her or
                    for her to buy items to resell. In my view, it did not make any sense for the
                    first accused to commence the trip to deliver the luggage bag without knowing
                    what sum she would be paid and without knowing whether the cash given to her was
                    enough to last the stay in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Next, in cross-examination, when asked how
                    much she thought the clothes in the luggage bag would be worth, the first
                    accused said she could not tell. She agreed though that she would see such
                    clothes in the market or shopping areas in Ghana. It was pointed out that at
                    paragraph 12 of the second long statement, Exh P50, she said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The clothes in the bag are worth about 1.5 million cedis, which I think is
                        worth about $100 US dollars. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>She explained that she told ASP Sim that she did not know, and
                        could not guess the value of the clothes in the luggage bag. However, the
                        interpreter, one Bill Yeboah Kyeremeh (“Bill”) pressured her
                        to give a figure. This was flatly denied by Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Further, the first accused stated that she did
                    not know how much US$3,000 was actually worth. However, when informed that
                    US$3,000 was the equivalent of “98 million old Cedis”, she
                    conceded that it was a large sum of money. Her earnings from selling clothes
                    were approximately 600,000 to 700,000 old Cedis (or approximately US$18 to
                    US$20).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In this regard, I note that the first accused
                    was not unfamiliar with transactions in US dollars. At paragraphs 41 to 43 of
                    the third long statement, Exh P51, it was recorded that the first accused was
                    shown three Western Union money transfer receipts dated 23 December 2011, the
                    first two for US$1,000 and the third for US$3,000. In the first and third
                    receipts, the first accused was listed as the recipient. She claimed that she
                    received the monies on behalf of her mother, who was a businesswoman. As for the
                    second receipt, the first accused was listed as the sender, and she claimed that
                    she was acting on her mother’s instructions to send the money to her
                    sister.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     It appeared obvious to me that the first
                    accused was trying to feign ignorance of the value of the US dollar, the worth
                    of the clothes and the amount she would be paid. She was being evasive so that
                    she would not be asked why she was being paid such a substantial sum for the
                    mere delivery of the clothes. I accepted the evidence of Bill that the words in
                    paragraph 12 of the second long statement, Exh P50, came from the first
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On key aspects of her defence, the first
                    accused had been inconsistent in her evidence in court. There were also material
                    discrepancies between her evidence in court and the contents of the statements.
                    It was evident that she was not forthright about what she knew of the trip. I
                    found that the first accused knew that she was to be paid US$3,000 by Young to
                    make the delivery, and knew the value of US$3,000. It was highly suspicious that
                    she should be asked to deliver merely clothes, particularly the 11 sets of
                    African attire in the luggage bag, for such a large sum of money by a stranger.
                    Despite the suspicious circumstances surrounding the trip, the first accused did
                    not ask Young, Nana or any others in the house for more information. She also
                    did not try to search or inspect the luggage bag. It seemed to me that the first
                    accused deliberately failed to inquire, and shut her eyes to the obvious, which
                    was that she was delivering more than just the clothes. She had not shown on a
                    balance of probabilities that she did not know, or could not reasonably be
                    expected to have known, the nature of the methamphetamine. She failed to rebut
                    the presumption within s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Findings in respect of the second accused </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Trip to Singapore </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Turning to the second accused, in her
                    evidence-in-chief, she claimed that the luggage bag was intended for her
                    husband’s friend. In cross-examination, she changed her evidence and
                    stated that it was for her “husband’s brother”. Upon being
                    pressed further on this issue, she reverted to saying that it was for her
                    husband's friend and explained that he has the same name as her
                    “husband’s brother”. Significantly, none of the eight
                    statements mentioned that the luggage bag was for her husband, his friend or
                    brother. While she explained that she did not wish to implicate her husband, she
                    could not provide any reason why she did not mention the husband’s brother
                    or his friend. She agreed that she had no reason to protect her husband’s
                    friend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Secondly, the second accused said that she
                    made the trip to Singapore, instead of her husband or his friend because she was
                    the one with a passport. She then explained at length what happened when the
                    husband misplaced his passport. For a while, the husband only had a
                    “paper” document of some sort. However, she then agreed that by 21
                    February 2012, her husband had received a new Nigerian passport to replace the
                    one he misplaced, completely undermining the reason she gave for having to
                    travel on behalf of her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Both in evidence-in-chief and in
                    cross-examination, the second accused said that on 21 February 2012, before
                    leaving her house, her husband asked her where she was going. She answered that
                    she was going to Singapore. This was somewhat illogical, given that it was also
                    her evidence that her husband was the one who had instructed her to go to
                    Singapore on 21 February 2012. Taken together, the second accused’s
                    evidence that she came to Singapore on behalf of the husband was extremely
                    unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Handling of the luggage bag </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I move on to the handling of the luggage bag.
                    Initially, in evidence-in-chief, the second accused stated that she saw the
                    first accused open the luggage bag, remove her clothes from the luggage bag
                    before closing it. However, in cross-examination by defence counsel for the
                    first accused, she changed her evidence to say that the first accused had
                    already removed her clothes from the luggage bag. Thereafter, she wavered
                    between saying that the first accused had opened the luggage bag to show her the
                    clothes inside and that the first accused had not opened the luggage bag but
                    told her it was clothes inside. Subsequently, in cross-examination by the
                    prosecution, she stated that the luggage bag was closed at all times in Room
                    315. The first time she saw the clothes was at Woodlands
                Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     These material inconsistencies demonstrated
                    that the second accused was not a candid witness. She shifted her position to
                    disassociate herself with the contents in the luggage bag, but was simply
                    unclear which position would be better for her defence. However, what was
                    telling was that she did not bother to check the contents of the luggage bag
                    herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Trust in her husband and assurances by Young and the first accused </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The second accused explained that she trusted
                    her husband, and believed him when he said that the luggage bag contained
                    clothes. Young and the first accused also informed her that the luggage bag
                    contained clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     However, in her evidence-in-chief, the second
                    accused described her harrowing trip to Cambodia on 1 February 2012 to collect a
                    bag for her husband. She admitted that she feared for her life because she
                    thought she was involved with illegal drugs. For the Cambodian trip, the husband
                    also used the excuse that there were only clothes in the sports bag, which was
                    the same reason he gave to ask her to make the trip to Singapore on 21 February
                    2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As for the trip to Singapore on 11 February
                    2012, in her evidence-in-chief, she said it had nothing to do with collecting
                    anything for her husband. However, in cross-examination, she said that on her
                    husband’s instructions, she went to Mustafa Centre, Singapore, to meet an
                    unknown person who was supposed to pass a bag to her. She was afraid during this
                    trip. However, no one turned up. Again, she felt her husband had “played
                    with [her] life”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Relying on ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), the prosecution submitted that the evidence in relation
                    to the previous trips is relevant to show the second accused’s state of
                    mind at the material time. There was no objection by defence counsel. In my
                    view, after these experiences, there seemed to be no reasonable basis for her
                    blind trust in her husband. As for the assurances given by Young over the
                    telephone that the luggage bag contained clothes, the second accused admitted
                    that she did not know Young, and had no reason to trust Young. Similarly, given
                    that she did not know the first accused, I did not see why she would rely on any
                    assurances given by the first accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Behaviour at the Woodlands Checkpoint </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Turning to her behaviour at the Woodlands
                    Checkpoint, the second accused explained that she was scared at the time because
                    “[s]he was not ready to face this thing”. From the second
                    accused’s extreme reaction at the Woodlands Checkpoint, I was persuaded
                    that she was fearful because she knew that she was carrying something other than
                    clothes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contents of statements </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It was also quite evident that the second
                    accused had not been truthful in the statements. The second accused admitted
                    that these portions were false:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     Her assertion that prior to 21
                        February 2012, she had met the first accused in Kuala Lumpur, and that she
                        had come to Singapore to collect the clothes that she had agreed to purchase
                        from the first accused. Such contents were found in paragraphs 4 to 6 of the
                        first long statement, Exh P52, and the two IMH reports. In actual fact, they
                        had never met until 21 February 2012 at the Golden Royal
                    Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     Her
                        assertion that on 21 February 2012, the first accused had opened the luggage
                        bag in the lobby, and touched the sides of the luggage bag. The second
                        accused told her “Don’t play with me, I have a daughter with
                        me.” The second accused then left the hotel without taking the
                        luggage bag. She did not go to the room (see paragraph 8 of the first long
                        statement, Exh P52). The above was not true.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     Her assertion that, continuing from (b) above,
                        the second accused proceeded to Queen Street without the luggage bag. While
                        talking to the two Chinese passengers in the taxi, she saw the first accused
                        appear with the luggage bag. A mentally disabled boy pulled the luggage bag
                        to the boot of the taxi (paragraph 9 of the second long statement, Exh P53).
                        She did not think too much about it, and boarded the taxi. The first accused
                        was in another taxi which was behind her taxi. The first accused ran out of
                        her taxi just before reaching the Woodlands Checkpoint. The second accused
                        was surprised to see the luggage bag in the taxi (see paragraphs 10 to 12 of
                        the second long statement, Exh P53). All the above was not
                    true.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_d"></a>(d)     In another
                        variation, the second accused said that the first accused had boarded the
                        taxi with her, with the luggage bag, and had run away as they were reaching
                        the Woodlands Checkpoint (last paragraph of the cautioned statement, Exh
                        P49). Again, this was contrary to what was established in
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The second accused explained that she made the
                    false statements to protect her husband and because she was afraid. She did not
                    mean to incriminate the first accused. As discussed at [64] above, even if her
                    explanation were to be accepted, there was no reason for her not to mention her
                    husband’s friend or his brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The second accused maintained that what she
                    told ASP Sim in her third long statement, Exh P54, was true. She stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In court, around October, I heard Fauziya say that she knew that
                        there [sic] drugs inside the luggage bag, and that her friend gave her the
                        bag with the drugs inside. Fauziya was talking to the other prisoners in the
                        court at that time and I heard her saying all this. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In cross-examination, the second accused then added that she
                        heard only parts of the conversation, but a friend known as
                        “Sayeedah” also told her about this. She did not tell ASP Sim
                        about “Sayeedah”. As the statement was recorded on 19 December
                        2012, she was asked about the two month delay before informing ASP Sim what
                        she knew. She explained that she took some time to find out if what the
                        first accused said was really true. The first accused flatly denied what the
                        second accused said. Given the second accused’s attempts to
                        incriminate the first accused in her statements, and her embellishments of
                        what purportedly happened in the lock-up, I rejected her
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     On material aspects, the second accused had
                    been inconsistent in her evidence in court. She also blatantly lied in her
                    statements. Her explanation that she did so to protect her husband cannot be
                    believed. When cornered to explain the difficulties with her evidence in court,
                    she was quick to change her stance. She was not a credible witness. The
                    circumstances surrounding the collection of the luggage bag were suspicious. Her
                    husband had a passport, and there was no convincing reason why she had to be the
                    one travelling to Singapore to pick up a bag of clothes for his friend. She did
                    not inquire further from her husband, or check the luggage bag. Given the
                    previous trips, she had no reasonable basis to trust her husband that the
                    luggage bag contained only clothes. She had no reason to rely on assurances by
                    Young or the first accused. By deliberately failing to inquire, she had not
                    shown, on a balance of probabilities, that she did not know, or could not
                    reasonably be expected to have known, the nature of the methamphetamine. She had
                    not rebutted the presumption within s 18(2) of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conviction and sentence </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I found that the prosecution had proved beyond
                    reasonable doubt the charge against the first accused and that against the
                    second accused, and convicted them accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Pursuant to s 33B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the MDA, the Public Prosecutor certified that the two
                    accused persons have substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug
                    trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. I also found, on a balance
                    of probabilities, that the two accused persons were mere couriers in that their
                    respective involvement in the offences was restricted to transporting and
                    delivering the drugs within s 33B(2)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Having satisfied both limbs of s 33B(2)
                    of the MDA, the two accused persons could be sentenced under
                        s 33B(1)(<em>a</em>) of the MDA which provides
                    that the court may, instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence an accused
                    to imprisonment for life and, if the accused is sentenced to life imprisonment,
                    the court shall also sentence him to caning of not less than 15
                strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     No submissions were made for the imposition of
                    death penalty on the two accused persons. I imposed the sentences of
                    imprisonment for life on the two accused persons, and ordered the sentences to
                    commence on 23 February 2012, that being the date they were first produced in
                    court. By s 325(1)(<em>a</em>) of the CPC, being women, the
                    two accused persons were not liable to be punished with caning. Therefore, I did
                    not impose any caning. By s 325(2) of the CPC, the court may, in lieu of caning,
                    impose an imprisonment term of not more than 12 months. Given the life
                    imprisonment terms, I did not do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     On 30 March 2015, the two accused persons
                    appealed against only the sentences, on the ground that the sentences are
                    excessive. As explained, I have imposed the minimum punishment provided by the
                    law. The life imprisonment terms have also been backdated to the date they were
                    first produced in court.</p>
