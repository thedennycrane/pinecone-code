</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Finally, in the further alternative, it is also clear that the transaction is a transaction at an undervalue under s 361(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA because [B] received no consideration at all in return for his transfer of beneficial interest in the Property. This must mean that the value of the consideration that [B] received in exchange (of which there was none) must necessarily be, in money or money’s worth, significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by [B] (see the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Rothstar</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Ltd v Leow Quek Shiong and other appeals </span>[2022] 2 SLR 158 at [25]–[26], [29], and [34]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The transaction was made within the relevant time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Second, I am satisfied that the transaction was made within the relevant time. [B]’s transfer of the beneficial interest in the Property to the first defendant on 30 September 2020, which was pursuant to the Trust Deed, occurred within three years before the bankruptcy application was filed on 12 July 2022. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">[B] was insolvent when he transferred the beneficial interest in the Property to the first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Third, I am satisfied that [B] was insolvent when he transferred the beneficial interest in the Property to the first defendant. In this regard, under s 363(3) of the IRDA, because the first defendant is an associate of [B], [B] is presumed to have been insolvent at the time of the transaction. Section 363(3) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where a transaction is entered into at an undervalue by an individual with a person who is an associate of the individual (otherwise than by reason only of being the individual’s employee), the requirements under subsection (2) are presumed to be satisfied unless the contrary is shown.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For clarity, s 363(2), which is referred to in s 363(3), pertains to the requirement that the individual who enters into a transaction at an undervalue is insolvent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In this regard, it is clear that an “associate” for the purposes of s 363(3) includes a “relative”, which is in turn defined in s 364(7) of the IRDA as a “lineal ancestor or lineal descendant”. The first defendant, being [B]’s son, is his “associate” for the purposes of s 363(3). Therefore, the presumption of insolvency in s 363(3) operates against [B]. The burden thus lies on the first defendant, as the transferee of the beneficial interest in the Property, to disprove [B]’s insolvency at the time of the transaction (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Sim Guan Seng and others v One Organisation Ltd and others </span>[2023] 3 SLR 590 at [156]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 However, the first defendant has not adduced any evidence to disprove [B]’s insolvency at the time of the transaction. Accordingly, for the purposes of s 361 read with s 363(2) of the IRDA, [B] was insolvent at the time when he transferred beneficial interest in the Property to the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No good reason not to make the order under s 361(2) of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the circumstances, I am of the view that it is appropriate to make an order under s 361(2) of the IRDA. However, it is clear that the court has a discretion <span class="font-italic">not </span>to make the order restoring the position to what it would have been had the bankrupt individual not entered into the transaction (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Christie, Hamish Alexander (as private trustee in bankruptcy of Tan Boon Kian) v Tan Boon Kian and others </span>[2021] 4 SLR 809 (“<span class="font-italic">Christie, Hamish Alexander</span>”) at [79]). That said, the court will usually make the order if all the statutory requirements are satisfied (see <span class="font-italic">Christie, Hamish Alexander</span> at [89]). Since the first defendant has not advanced any reason for me to exercise my discretion not to make the order under s 361(2), I accordingly do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Some observations on s 438 of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The claimants further prayed for an alternative order that the Transfer was made with the intent to defraud the creditors of [B] within the meaning of s 438 of the IRDA. As mentioned above (at [3]), I make no order as to this prayer because I have not had the benefit of full arguments from both sides on the application of s 438(4) of the IRDA, which has not been fully interpreted and applied in Singapore before. However, since the claimants have made submissions on the application of this section, I take the opportunity to make some observations on its application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As a preliminary point, it bears mentioning that reg 15 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Saving and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2020 provides that s 73B of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (the “CLPA 1994”) continues to apply to any conveyance of property before 30 July 2020. In the present case, the Trust Deed entered into on 3 July 2020 merely expressed [B]’s intention to purchase the Property. It was only on 30 September 2020 that the legal title in the Property was passed to [B] by way of the registration of the Transfer Instrument on that date. As such, the beneficial ownership of the Property was transferred to the first defendant only on 30 September 2020. On the basis of these facts, the “conveyance” of the Property for the purposes of reg 15 should be 30 September 2020. Therefore, s 438 of the IRDA, and not s 73B of the CLPA, applies to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The generally applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 With the above in mind, s 438 of the IRDA provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Transactions defrauding creditors </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">438.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">—(1)  This section relates to any transaction entered into by a person (called in this section and section 439 the debtor) with another person at an undervalue</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(2) </span>For the purposes of subsection (1), a debtor enters into a transaction with another person at an undervalue if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the debtor makes a gift to the other person or the debtor otherwise enters into a transaction with the other person on terms that provide for the debtor to receive no consideration;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the debtor enters into a transaction with the other person in consideration of marriage; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the debtor enters into a transaction with the other person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by the debtor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where a debtor enters into a transaction at an undervalue, the Court may, if satisfied under subsection (4), make such order as the Court thinks fit for —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) restoring the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) protecting the interests of any person who is, or is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction (called in this section a victim).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) An order under subsection (3) may only be made if the Court is satisfied that a transaction at an undervalue was entered into by a debtor for the purpose —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may at some time make, a claim against the debtor; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of otherwise prejudicing the interests of any person in relation to a claim which the person is making or may make against the debtor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Accordingly, under s 438 of the IRDA, the court can set aside a transaction at an undervalue that a debtor entered into with another person, if the transaction was entered into for the purposes set out in s 438(4). Under s 438(2), a transaction at an “undervalue” is defined in identical terms with s 361(3) of the IRDA. Where these requirements are met, the court has the discretion to make an order under the terms of s 438(3). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is relevant to highlight that s 438 was introduced into the IRDA to replace s 73B of the CLPA 1994. The following observations made by the Law Reform Committee in 2013 are instructive (see Singapore, Ministry of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Insolvency Law Review Committee: Final Report </span>(2013) (Chairperson: Lee Eng Beng SC) (the “Report”) at pp 184–185).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 73B of the CLPA 1994 mirrors the language of s 172 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK), the latter having since been repealed and replaced with s 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (the “UK IA”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There are three main differences between s 73B of the CLPA 1994 and s 423 of the UK IA. First, s 423 focuses on transactions at an undervalue, which is a narrower category than s 73B that applies to “every conveyance of property”. Second, s 423 eschews the requirement of having to prove an “intention to defraud creditors” in favour of a subjective inquiry into the purpose of the transaction. Third, s 423 provides prescriptive remedies, while s 73B simply provides that a successfully impugned transaction is voidable. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Given that claims under s 73B of the CLPA 1994 are closely intertwined with insolvency proceedings, s 73B should be shifted to the IRDA and amended to mirror s 423 of the UK IA. This has the advantage of, among others, ensuring that the scope of the provision coincides with its underlying policy rationale, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, preserving the net asset value of the company for distribution amongst its creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, these observations are instructive as to how s 438 of the IRDA is to be interpreted. It is clear from these observations that s 438 of the IRDA is not meant to be an exact replica of s 73B of the CLPA 1994. Therefore, the cases interpreting s 73B may be of limited value in the interpretation of s 438. Conversely, as noted in the Report, the new s 438 of the IRDA is meant to mirror s 423 of the UK IA. This must mean that the cases interpreting s 423 of the UK IA are highly persuasive in the interpretation of s 438 of the IRDA. Of course, s 438 is to be interpreted with its underlying policy rationale in mind, which is to preserve the net asset value of the company concerned so as to maximise the possible distribution to the creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The requirements under s 438 of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I come now to the requirements under s 438 of the IRDA, which can be applied in three steps: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, pursuant to s 438(1) of the IRDA, the court must be satisfied that the transaction concerned was entered into at an undervalue, as defined by s 438(2); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) second, the court must then be satisfied that the transaction at an undervalue was entered into by the debtor for the purposes spelt out in s 438(4) of the IRDA, which broadly relate to the transaction being entered into with the intent to defraud or prejudice creditors;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) third, the court can then make an order under s 438(3) of the IRDA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">First step: the transaction concerned must be one entered into at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 To begin, since s 438(2) defines a transaction at an undervalue in identical terms as s 361(3) of the IRDA, it follows that the same principles used to determine whether a transfer was a transaction at an undervalue for the purposes of s 361(3) must apply equally to s 438(2). There is therefore an established body of case law to guide the courts’ application of s 438(2), in satisfaction of the requirement under s 439(1) that the transaction concerned being one that was entered into at an undervalue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Second step: the court must be satisfied that the transaction at an undervalue was entered into by the debtor for the purposes spelt out in s 438(4) of the IRDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I come now to s 438(4) of the IRDA, which requires a court to be satisfied that the transaction at an undervalue was entered into by a debtor for the purpose of either: (a) putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may at some time make, a claim against the debtor; or (b) otherwise prejudicing the interests of any person in relation to a claim which the person is making or may make against the debtor. Since there is no Singapore decision that has interpreted s 438(4) of the IRDA, for the reasons that I have set out above in relation to the Report, I am of the view that the English Court of Appeal’s interpretation of s 423 of the UK IA, which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 438, would be instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I turn first to the relevant sub provisions of s 423 of the UK IA, which are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">423 Transactions defrauding creditors.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) This section relates to transactions entered into at an undervalue; and a person enters into such a transaction with another person if—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) he makes a gift to the other person or he otherwise enters into a transaction with the other on terms that provide for him to receive no consideration;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) he enters into a transaction with the other in consideration of marriage; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) he enters into a transaction with the other for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration provided by himself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where a person has entered into such a transaction, the court may, if satisfied under the next subsection, make such order as it thinks fit for—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) restoring the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into, and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) protecting the interests of persons who are victims of the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) In the case of a person entering into such a transaction, an order shall only be made if the court is satisfied that it was entered into by him for the purpose—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may at some time make, a claim against him, or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which he is making or may make.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">BAT Industries plc</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v</span> <span class="font-italic">Sequana</span><span class="font-italic"> SA </span>[2019] Bus LR 2178, the English Court of Appeal held (at [66]) that it is sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor, who entered into the transaction at an undervalue sought to be set aside, subjectively intended to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential creditors. This therefore eschews the requirement of having to prove an “intention to defraud creditors”, which was found in s 73B of the CLPA 1994.

The debtor had purchased a property and on the same day executed a trust deed to transfer his beneficial interest therein to his son, in consideration of natural love and affection. The son claimed there were two purposes in making the trust deed: (a) the primary purpose of providing for the son; and (b) a secondary purpose of transferring the property to the son at an undervalue. However, the court found that the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a potential creditor did not have to be the dominant purpose for the transaction to be caught under s 423, and it sufficed if it was a substantial purpose.

The learned judge laid down the following principles (at [13]–[14]), which I respectfully think could apply in the Singapore context:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The nature of any order and the extent of the relief granted by the court should take into account the mental state of the transferee, and the degree of their involvement in the fraudulent scheme of the debtor/transferor to put assets out of the reach of his creditors.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where an asset has been transferred to a transferee who has no knowledge that the transferor acted with a relevant purpose in making the transfer, and the transferee has simply held the asset, ordinarily the appropriate order should be an order for the transfer of the asset to the transferor or to the creditors directly.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, if the transferee has changed his position on the basis of the receipt in a way that would make it unfair to him to repay the money, it would not be appropriate for the court to make an order requiring the transferee to pay back a sum equivalent to the amount he received. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Subsequently, the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Fowlds (A Bankrupt) Bucknall and another v</span> <span class="font-italic">Wilson </span>[2022] 1 WLR 61 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> Fowlds</span>”) added a gloss to the analysis in <span class="font-italic">4Eng Ltd</span> by drawing a distinction between the court’s exercise of its discretion under s 423 of the UK IA, and statutory clawback claims under ss 339 and 340 of the UK IA. Trower J found (at [69]) that it may be more appropriate to carry out a balancing exercise in s 423 cases, which is between the interests of the creditors or victims of the transferor on the one hand and the transferee on the other. This is because s 423 contemplates single victim or limited victim cases, in which it is more likely to be possible to strike a balance between the victim of the transferor and an innocent transferee (at [71]). On the other hand, in statutory clawback claims, the balancing exercise is between the interests of the transferee and all of those interested in the statutory scheme, which “will rarely be an exercise on which it is <span class="font-italic">appropriate</span> for the court to embark or even <span class="font-italic">practical </span>if it were to attempt to do so” (at [71]) [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Returning to the present case, while I have endeavoured to suggest how s 438 of the IRDA could be applied, I make no order as to prayer (b) of the present application in the absence of full arguments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For all of these reasons, I make an order in terms of prayers (a), (c), (d), and (e), as set out at [1] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Unless the parties are able to agree on costs, they are to tender written submissions on the appropriate costs order within 14 days of this decision, limited to seven pages each.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lin Weiwen Moses and Manvindar Kaur Sethi d/o Sarwan Singh (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the claimants;<br/>Loo Chieh Ling Kate and Jerelyn Tay Yee Ying (Ling Law Corporation) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
