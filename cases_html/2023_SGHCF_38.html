They have appealed against parts of my decision. The Wife appeals against the valuation of the pool of matrimonial assets (“MAs”) at $31,259.918.62. The Husband appeals against my decision to award the Wife 50% of the MAs, to transfer the property at Coronation Road (the “Coronation Property”) to the Wife, and on the number of shares in [B] Pte Ltd (“[B]”) held in the Husband’s sole name to be transferred to the Wife in partial satisfaction of her share of the award of MAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 My full grounds of decision in relation to these issues are set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Parties are Singapore citizens. The Wife was a housewife for the majority of the marriage. The Husband was the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of [C] Pte Ltd (“[C]”), a Singapore-incorporated fintech startup. The Parties were married on 1 August 1988. They have two children, born in 1995 and 2000 (collectively, the “Children”). The Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband on 29 December 2017. Interim judgment (the “IJ”) was granted on 28 January 2019 (the “IJ Date”). As of the IJ Date, the Parties had been married for over 30 years. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable dates for ascertaining matrimonial assets and their value</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Parties agreed that the IJ Date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 28 January 2019) would serve as the cut-off date for ascertaining the pool of MAs, and for determining their bank accounts and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account balances. Other assets would be valued as at 30 September 2021 (the “Valuation Date”). The Valuation Date was provided to the Wife’s valuer, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">M/s </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">KordaMentha</span> (“KM”), and the Husband’s valuer, M/s Strix Strategies Pte Ltd (“Strix”), as the cut-off date for determining the valuations in their reports. I accepted and applied the IJ Date and Valuation Date as agreed upon by the Parties.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Parties had agreed, in their Joint Summary, on the exchange rates to be applied in relation to the valuation of the MAs. However, these rates were not applied by KM and Strix in their valuation. To determine the value of the MAs to include in the pool, I have considered the Parties’ respective submissions based on the values they have submitted in Singapore Dollars, without applying the exchange rate in the Joint Summary. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Parties were largely in agreement over the assets to be included into the pool of MAs for division pursuant to s 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”). What they disputed was the inclusion of certain motor vehicles. The Wife also submitted that the Husband had received money that had not been accounted for and/or was wrongfully dissipated, which should be included in the pool of MAs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assets which the Parties agreed to include in the pool of matrimonial assets during the hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Initially, there were several other assets whose inclusion into the pool of MAs was disputed by the Parties. However, the Parties later came to an agreement to include these assets into the pool. For completeness, I have summarised these MAs below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Husband’s United Overseas Bank Account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Husband had a “Flexi Mortgage” bank account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”). The Wife valued this account at S$142.34 and submitted that this value should be included in the pool of MAs. Although this UOB account was not included in the Husband’s table of assets, he included it in the Joint Summary.

</div>
</div> I hence added S$265,565 for the Husband’s legal expenses and S$57,043.49 for the Wife’s legal expenses back into the pool of MAs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Husband’s Porsche</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Husband purchased a Porsche in July 2018 for S$225,000, after the commencement of these divorce proceedings in December 2017. He sold it shortly after. The Wife did not consent to the purchase or the sale and submitted that it should be included in the pool of MAs. She relied on <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”). There, the Court of Appeal held at [24] that where “<span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">” to the pool of MAs if the other spouse has at least a putative interest in it and “has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time”. On this basis, the</span> Husband’s Porsche should hence be included in the pool of MAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In response, the Husband submitted that the Porsche’s purchase price was not “substantial” in comparison to the size of the pool of MAs. Hence, <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>should not apply. The Husband also submitted that he only expended S$115,000 to acquire the Porsche, as he received S$110,000 in credit for the trade-in of his previous car.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Husband’s previous car was purchased during the course of the marriage and is hence a quintessential MA. Even though the previous car was traded-in, its monetary value remains a MA. The value of the previous car could be traced to the Porsche. Thus, while the actual sum that the Husband paid in cash was only a portion of its purchase price, the entire value of the Porsche is relevant for determining the value of that MA. The Wife valued the Porsche at its purchase price of S$225,000. I adopted this value for considering whether it should be included in the pool of MAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I did not accept the Husband’s interpretation of <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> that whether the value of the MA is “substantial” should be determined with reference to the size of the pool of the MAs. In my view, whether the value of an MA is “substantial” may be determined independent of the pool of MAs. Objectively, it cannot be said that S$225,000 is not a “substantial” sum. Hence, on the basis of <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, I added S$225,000 into the pool of MAs for the Husband’s Porsche.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Wife’s Mercedes Benz</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Husband submitted that the Wife’s car, a Mercedes Benz, was a MA. The Wife highlighted that the Mercedes Benz was purchased after the IJ Date. As the Parties had agreed for the IJ Date to be the cut-off date for ascertaining the pool of MAs, the Mercedes Benz should be excluded from the pool of MAs. Notwithstanding, part of the purchase price of the Mercedes Benz was funded by the trade-in value of the Wife’s previous car, a Lexus. The Lexus was purchased prior to the IJ Date. Consequently, the Wife submitted that the trade-in value of the Lexus, amounting to S$55,555, should be included in the pool of MAs. I agreed with the Wife’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">533 shares in [D] owned by the Husband </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Husband owned shares in [D] Limited (“[D]”), a private equity company. He submitted that 533 of such shares were held on trust for one Mr Richard Koh (“Mr Koh”), based on an oral arrangement between them that was made while they were working together at [B]. These shares were valued at S$325,508. The Wife submitted that this value should be added into the pool of MAs, as there was no documentary evidence of the alleged trust arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In response, the Husband referred to a Whatsapp (“WA”) exchange between him and Mr Koh on 7 January 2019.

Notwithstanding, the Husband had informed Mr Koh by WA on 7 January 2019 that he owed him US$533 for the dividends paid out on the [D] shares. On this basis, I found that there was evidence that Mr Koh was the beneficial owner of 533 [D] shares as at the IJ Date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Wife then submitted that the S$161,000 paid by Mr Koh to the Husband for the 533 [D] shares should be added into the pool of MAs.

Of this sum, the Wife submitted that S$1,650,000 was not accounted for and should be added back into the pool of MAs.

To obtain the highpoint valuation, KM applied a 25% uplift to the lowpoint valuation figure and derived a highpoint of S$1,870,000. KM justified this 25% uplift with reference to VVP’s internal rate of return (“IRR”). VVP’s website stated that its IRR for the first quarter ranged from 2 to 19%, with a total IRR of 10%. As two and a half years had passed since the first transaction of [D] shares at US$400 per<span class="font-italic"> </span>share (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in October 2019), coupled with KM’s view that it appeared reasonable to assume that the share value would have increased over time, KM multiplied the IRR of 10% by 2.5 to obtain its 25% uplift. KM then averaged its lowpoint and highpoint valuations to obtain the midpoint valuation of S$1,683,000. The Wife submitted that KM’s midpoint valuation of the Husband’s [D] shares should be adopted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On balance, I accepted Strix’s observation that KM’s highpoint valuation lacked a robust basis.

This injection would be “akin to a share sale after a lock-up period”, the effect of which would be accentuated by the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies (and in particular the cryptocurrency tokens held by [F]), and further compounded by the lack of liquidity of [F]’s cryptocurrency tokens.

He submitted that his shares in [C], based on Strix’s valuation, were valued at S$5,696,226. This valuation was based on the average transaction price for the 11,385,694 shares that the Husband sold in December 2019 (the “December 2019 Sale”) and the relevant price during a round of fundraising in May 2020. This gave the Husband’s [C] shares a value of US$0.2872351 per share, or a total of US$3,890,295 (or S$5,279,908). Strix added S$416,318 to this figure to account for the sale proceeds received by the Husband from the December 2019 Sale. In total, Strix valued the Husband’s [C] shares at S$5,696,226.

Strix pointed out that at the end of the financial year ending 2021, despite revenue growth of 16.7% that year, [C]’s losses almost doubled to some S$9m from 2020’s S$4.3m. Further, [C] derived S$3.4m from other sources of income in 2020, but this declined to S$50,500 in 2021. [C]’s net assets also declined by 27% from S$16,324,932 in 2020 to just S$11,900,050 in 2021 (largely due to the decline in cash and cash equivalents from S$15,364,275 to S$11,029,150). KM offered no explanation for why these reasons should not negate its proposed 15% uplift.

</div> Also, since the 1,413,722 options were granted to the Husband on 30 June 2020 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the IJ Date), the value of these share options should not be included. The Husband submitted that the 15% growth uplift applied by KM was wrong for the same reasons as that relating to the valuation of [C] shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Clearly, the actual value of the 1,413,722 share options granted after the IJ Date should not be included in the pool of MAs. That there was an increase in the strike price for the options granted to the Husband on 30 June 2020 (after the IJ Date but before the Valuation Date of 30 September 2021), could suggest that the value of [C]’s share options may have increased since they were granted on 31 October 2018. If so, the question would be of the extent of such increase. Notably, KM’s highpoint valuation was not anchored on a specific increase in the strike price of the options. Instead, it was underpinned by its application of a 15% growth uplift to the [C] shares. However, as set out above, this was roundly critiqued by Strix, who highlighted the financial difficulties faced by [C] from 2020 to 2021. KM had thus not provided a reasonable basis to adopt its highpoint valuation. In addition, KM also conceded that it could not estimate the value of the options with any greater accuracy than Strix. I hence found that on balance, Strix’s analysis was more logical and consistent. I thus adopted Strix’s valuation of S$206,628.19 (after application of the “time rule”) for the Husband’s 22m [C] share options. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Table of Matrimonial Assets </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 During the first and second AM hearings, I informed the Parties’ counsels of my decision as set out above regarding the assets to be included in the pool of MAs and the valuations that I have adopted.

</div> The Husband was the primary breadwinner while the Wife was the primary caregiver. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Wife submitted that the pool of MAs should be divided between the Parties according to<span class="font-italic"> </span>a 53:47 ratio in her favour. She relied on <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the Court of Appeal at [48] generally agreed with precedent cases which have tended towards an equal division of MAs in long single-income marriages. <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> also discussed at [52] the case of <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>, the Court of Appeal deviated from the trend of cases generally tending towards equal division in long single-income marriages and upheld the High Court’s distribution of the MAs according to a 65:35 ratio in favour of the husband. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>observed that <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin </span>was “a unique case” and a major factor which contributed to the decision to deviate from equal division was the “exceptionally large size of the asset pool” of S$69m. The Wife distinguished her case from <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin </span>on the basis that the pool of MAs here was not as large. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Wife also highlighted two other cases. The first was <span class="font-italic">UKA v UKB </span>[2018] 4 SLR 779 (“<span class="font-italic">UKA</span>”), which involved a long marriage of almost 28 years and a pool of MAs amounting to S$34,326,426. There, Debbie Ong J (as she then was) held at [82] that the “marriage was an equal partnership of different efforts and should be recognised as such in the division of assets.” Ong J found that a just and equitable division of the MAs, was “for the parties to share equally in the wealth of [that] marriage”. Second, the Wife highlighted the case of <span class="font-italic">TOF v TOE </span>[2021] 2 SLR 976 (“<span class="font-italic">TOF</span>”), which involved a long single-income marriage and a pool of MAs amounting to S$14,999,988.32. The High Court below had held that the applicable ratio for division was 36.5:63.5 in the husband’s favour. The Wife submitted that in the appeal, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TOF</span> indicated that they would have awarded the wife an equal share of the MAs but did not do so only because she did not file an appeal against the application ratio.

</div>
</div>
</div> First, she contributed 19% of the purchase price of the Coronation Property (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Parties’ matrimonial property). She submitted that S$500,000 from the sale proceeds of earlier properties along with her contribution of S$100,000 from her CPF account should be attributed to her. Second, the Wife claimed that the rental income from the Penang Property had been used in the acquisition of that property, and her direct contribution was around RM400,000. The wife submitted that this sum, which was approximately 11% of Penang Property’s purchase price, was her direct financial contribution to this MA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Wife submitted that she had also made indirect, albeit non-financial, contributions to the MAs outside the sphere of homemaking. These included helping to further the Husband’s career, management of the various properties purchased, and taking charge of renovation and construction works done during the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Husband submitted that the pool of MAs should be segregated into those acquired prior to and after 2010, and that different ratios should apply to the MAs in these two categories under the “classification methodology” as in <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC</span>”) (the “segregation approach”). He submitted that pre-2010 MAs should be distributed 35:65 in his favour while post-2010 assets should be distributed 20:80 in his favour. The basis for this segregation was the Husband’s claim that the marriage broke down in 2010, and that the Parties led largely separate lives thereafter. They remained together for the sake of their then teenage children and were waiting for them to go to the UK for their education before commencing divorce proceedings. Additionally, the massive increase in MAs after 2010 was due solely to the Husband’s efforts. In the alternative, the Husband submitted that in light of the size of the pool of assets and cases such as <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>, the court should not tend towards equal division. Instead, the MAs should be distributed 35:65 in his favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Wife submitted that there was no evidential or legal basis for the Husband’s segregation approach. She acknowledged that the Husband made the lion’s share of the financial contributions to the acquisition of MAs. However, she submitted that in 2010, when the Husband claimed the marriage had broken down, the Children were only 15 and 10 years’ old respectively. The Wife continued to be the primary caregiver to the two young Children for the next nine years until IJ was granted. It was these indirect, albeit non-financial, contributions that gave the Husband free rein to focus on his business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Wife highlighted that the classification methodology expounded on in <span class="font-italic">TNC</span> involved a dual-income marriage and that this methodology only applies where the “structured approach” is applicable. In <span class="font-italic">TND v TNC </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2017] SGCA 34 (“<span class="font-italic">TND</span>”), the Court of Appeal upheld Debbie Ong JC’s (as she then was) decision in <span class="font-italic">TNC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to award the husband a higher proportion of MAs from one group of MAs (“Group B”) as opposed to another. In so doing, the Court of Appeal at [96] specifically considered the wife’s negligible direct contributions to the acquisition of Group B assets. The Wife submitted that considering such direct contributions made sense in dual-income marriages where direct contributions should be differentiated between spouses. However, in a single-income marriages, the homemaker-spouse would be making negligible direct contributions towards the acquisition of all MAs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Wife submitted that in a single-income marriage, the working spouse would necessarily claim that any increase in the value of the pool of MAs was due to his/her sole efforts. The Husband’s proposal would mean that homemaker-spouses in long single-income marriages would be severely disadvantaged as the working spouse will be able to carve out portions of the MAs from the date that the marriage had broken down, instead of the date of IJ. This would be the unintended consequence of favouring direct contributions over indirect contributions. This would be contrary to the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [45] about ensuring mutual respect for spousal contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Wife submitted that, on the evidence, the marriage did not break down in 2010 as the Husband claimed. In <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon v Lee Siew Lin </span>[2014] 1 SLR 629 (“<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span>”), the Court of Appeal held at [12] that continued involvement and provision would suggest the existence of a “<span class="font-italic">continuous (albeit clearly attenuated) relationship</span> between the parties throughout” [emphasis in original]. The Wife submitted that the Husband had continued to financially support her even after 2010. This was evidenced by the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) up until November 2018, the Husband used to deposit his monthly salary into the Parties’ joint Citibank Account; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Wife had access to a number of supplementary credit cards which the Husband had provided to her with very high credit limit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$150,000); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) from December 2018 to January 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the IJ was granted), the Husband had been voluntarily paying S$8,300 to the Wife every month – comprising of S$5,300 in cash and a cap of S$3,000 on the Wife’s credit card; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Husband had deposited about half of the proceeds from the sale of his [B] shares in 2015 to the Citibank Account; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the Parties purchased a property in joint names (and were joint borrowers) around 2010. This was never addressed by the Husband. If the marriage had truly broken down in early 2010, there was no reason why the Husband would purchase a property jointly with the Wife. This was in contrast to the Husband’s assertion in relation to a Malaysian property which was purchased in his sole name on the basis that the marriage had broken down.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Further, the Husband remained involved in the Wife’s life after 2010, such as spending time together, with the Children, during special occasions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Finally, the Wife highlighted that the Husband did not claim to have made any contributions to the caregiving of the Children. His alleged contributions to the Children were limited to guiding them on their tertiary education/career pursuits, spending time with them on special occasions, and fetching them to school. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues for my determination </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Based on the Parties’ submissions, the following issues arose for my determination: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the marriage broke down in 2010; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the segregation approach was consistent with a just and equitable division of MAs; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the tendency to equal division should be adhered to. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the marriage broke down in 2010</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I found that the Husband failed to satisfy his evidential burden to prove his submission that the marriage had broken down in 2010. As the Wife highlighted, there was continued contact between the Parties and the Husband continued to provide for the Wife even after 2010. As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>continued involvement and provision is suggestive of the existence of a “continuous (albeit clearly attenuated) relationship between the parties throughout”. There was also evidence that the Husband continued to be involved in the Wife and children’s lives after 2010, including in family holidays and family events.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s 3rd Ancillary Matters Affidavit dated 23 February 2022 at pp 52–66.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Husband did not rebut any of the Wife’s aforementioned claims during the hearing. Instead, his main contention was that the marriage ended in 2010 as evidenced by the cessation of conjugal relations between the Parties around 2010. The Wife submitted that conjugal relations between them ended around 2013. Regardless of when such relations actually ended, this is not a determinative factor as to when a marriage broke down. After taking into account the evidence of their family life after 2010, I found that the Husband had not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate his claim that the marriage had broken down in 2010. Consequently, he failed to provide the evidential basis for his proposed segregation approach. The Husband’s submission to apply the segregation approach, which distinguished between assets acquired pre-2010 and post-2010, would have been dismissed for this reason alone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Nevertheless, I added that even if the marriage had broken down in 2010, the Wife’s non-financial contributions to the family after 2010 and prior to the IJ Date should not be disregarded. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan </span>[2012] 4 SLR 785 at [88], the Court of Appeal held that this is especially so where the wife’s contributions to the family remained largely the same as before the marriage broke down or allowed her husband to focus on his career. Indeed, this was the case on the facts before me. To apply the segregation approach as submitted by the Husband would be to minimise the Wife’s continued indirect contributions to the family in favour of the Husband’s financial contributions, which were facilitated by the Wife’s indirect contributions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consistency of the segregation approach with just and equitable division</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As the Husband relied on <span class="font-italic">TNC</span> to support his submission for a segregation approach, it is useful to examine this case in greater detail. In deciding to award the husband a higher proportion of the MAs in Group B, Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) observed that the increase in the value of the MAs in Group B after the marriage had broken down was due to the redevelopment of the properties therein by the husband. The wife was not involved in this redevelopment and hence, the value of the MAs in Group B was “mainly attributable to the [h]usband’s efforts” (at [60]). On the facts of that case, Ong JC found that the direct contributions to the MAs in Group B should command greater weight compared to indirect contributions. Accordingly, the average ratio applicable to division of this group of MAs shifted in favour of the husband, who made most of the direct contributions (at [62]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The division in <span class="font-italic">TNC </span>took place pursuant to the “structured approach” as set out in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>subsequently<span class="font-italic"> </span>reconsidered the “structured approach” for long single-income marriages, observing at [44] that it tends to “unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”. An application of the “structured approach” would mean that the non-working spouse is “doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”, which is “[in]consistent with the courts’ philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership” (at [44] and [45]). The court reiterated the rationale it had expounded on in <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>at [17] that “mutual respect must be accorded for spousal contributions, <span class="font-italic">whether in the economic or homemaking spheres</span>, as both roles are <span class="font-italic">equally fundamenta</span>l to the well-being of a marital partnership” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics] (at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Consequently, the Court of Appeal opined in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> at [46] that the “structured approach” “should <span class="font-italic">not </span>be applied to Single-Income marriages” [emphasis in original]. This position was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in its more recent decision of <span class="font-italic">TOF</span>. As mentioned above, <span class="font-italic">TOF</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>involved a long single-income marriage with a pool of MAs amounting to S$14m. The court emphasised at [138] that the appropriate approach to adopt for asset division in long single-income marriages was to tend towards equal division, as adopted in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, as opposed to the “structured approach” set out in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Husband’s segregation approach effectively relied on the “structured approach” and was hence in conflict with the principles set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">TOF</span>, as set out above at [98]–[99]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 At the first step of the “structured approach”, when examining the Parties’ direct financial contributions to the acquisition of MAs, the Husband, being the sole breadwinner, would be accorded 100%, or a proportion close to 100%. The second step of the “structured approach” is to consider the parties’ indirect contributions of <span class="font-italic">both </span><span class="font-italic">financial</span> and <span class="font-italic">non-financial</span> natures. As the Husband was the sole breadwinner, he would be accorded a sizeable proportion of indirect contributions to the marriage for his indirect financial contributions. In contrast, the Wife’s contributions would be limited to primarily indirect non-financial contributions. Consequently, the Wife would be greatly disadvantaged in the process of division. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [45], to rectify this disadvantage would “almost inevitably result in some degree of artificiality [as] the court would either have to award the non-working spouse a very high percentage [when determining indirect contributions] (which may appear to disregard the working spouse’s indirect financial contributions), [and/]or accord a very high weightage to [indirect contributions]”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 For the above reasons, I found that in addition to failing to establish the evidential basis, the Husband had also failed to show that there was a proper legal basis for his proposed segregation approach. On the contrary, adopting this approach would go against the general tendency to equal division as expressed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> for long single-income marriages. Furthermore, it was in conflict with the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> on giving mutual respect to spousal contributions in the homemaking and economic spheres.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the pool of matrimonial assets should be divided equally </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 While the general position for division in long single-income marriages is to tend towards equal division (see [83]–[84] above), this is not the same as a presumption of equal division, a norm of equal division, or a strict regime that each party shall be entitled to half of the MAs (see <span class="font-italic">UYP v UYQ </span>[2020] 3 SLR 683 at [52]). Thus, the applicable ratio for division of MAs should still be determined pursuant to the facts of each case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 It was not disputed in the present case that the Husband made most of the financial contributions to the acquisition of MAs. As for indirect contributions, while the Husband submitted that the Wife’s account of her indirect contributions was embellished, he did not dispute that the Wife contributed not just to caregiving, but also oversaw the renovation of their Penang Property, the construction of their property in New Zealand, and organised events for his investors and business partners. On his own account, the Husband’s indirect non-financial contributions were mainly in navigating the Children’s educational and career path and ferrying them to school during their pre-school to secondary school years.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Considering the evidence on the whole, I found that the Wife made most of the non-financial contributions to the family. Adopting a broad-brush approach and according equal weightage to the Parties’ direct and indirect contributions, I found that equal division of the pool of MAs would be just and equitable, in light of their respective contributions to the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The question that next arose was whether to deviate from equal division of the MAs on the basis that the Husband’s sole efforts and financial contributions led to the present size of the pool of MAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Husband submitted that the MAs should not be divided equally. He submitted that the present case may be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">UKA</span>. <span class="font-italic">UKA</span> involved a long single-income marriage and a large pool of MAs amounting to approximately S$34.3m. The majority of the pool of MAs (approximately S$24.4m) could be attributed to a company which was jointly owned by the parties. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">UKA</span>, the court ordered equal division of the MAs between the parties. The Husband submitted that the present case is unlike <span class="font-italic">UKA</span> as the wife there made far greater direct financial contributions than the Wife here. The court in <span class="font-italic">UKA</span> observed that if the structured approach was applied, the wife would have been accorded 20% for her direct financial contributions to the acquisition of MAs. Here, the Husband submitted that taking the Wife’s case at its highest, she had contributed 19% to the acquisition of the Coronation Property and 11% to the Penang Property. Averaging these percentages, the Wife contributed only around 15% to properties with a total value of approximately S$10.7m (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, only about one-third of the pool of MAs). In addition, the wife in <span class="font-italic">UKA </span>raised four children while the Wife raised only two children. In response, the Wife submitted that the court’s observations in <span class="font-italic">UKA</span> on how the “structured approach” may have been applied were strictly <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. Further, she highlighted that the court there nevertheless proceeded with equal division of the pool of MAs, without application of the “structured approach”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Examining <span class="font-italic">UKA</span>, I noted that while both parties there played a part in the jointly owned company, the court found that the husband spent long hours building up the company. On the other hand, the wife was the main caregiver of four children and would have had less time for doing work for the company. In other words, the respective contributions of the parties in <span class="font-italic">UKA</span> were broadly similar to that often found in single-income marriages, such as that in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, the Court of Appeal considered the case of <span class="font-italic">Yeo Ch</span><span class="font-italic">eong Lin</span>, where the exceptionally large pool of MAs amounting to S$69m contributed to a deviation from the tendency to equal division. In my view, the pool of MAs here of around S$31.3m was large but remained distinguishable from that in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Cheong Lin</span>. In other words, the size of the pool of MAs here did not provide a sufficient basis to derogate from the general tendency towards equal division.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In addition, the Husband’s submission that the Parties’ direct financial contributions justified deviating from equal deviation was tantamount to applying the “structured approach”. This would be a direct contradiction of the clear guidance in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> that the structured approach should not be applied for long single-income marriages and the emphasis made there on according mutual respect for the homemaking and economic contributions of spouses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In view of the above, I found at the third AM hearing that there should be equal division of the pool of MAs between the Parties. The Wife was consequently entitled to a share of the MAs amounting to S$15,629,959.46. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Spousal maintenance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Wife also submitted for a lump sum spousal maintenance of S$360,000 (S$15,000 per<span class="font-italic"> </span>month for 24 months) in addition to her award of the MAs. The Husband submitted that there should be no spousal maintenance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The courts have declined to award maintenance where a spouse has been awarded a substantial amount of the MAs. For example, in <span class="font-italic">TQU v TQT</span> [2020] SGCA 8 (“<span class="font-italic">TQU</span>”), the wife was found to be entitled to 25% of S$13,667,860.72, amounting to S$3,416,965.18. The court in <span class="font-italic">TQU</span> held at [147] that “even though we have varied the [w]ife’s portion to 25%, this still leaves her a substantial amount of the matrimonial assets and we see no reason to award her any maintenance.” This was similarly the case in <span class="font-italic">UBM</span><span class="font-italic"> v UBN </span>[2017] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">UB</span><span class="font-italic">M</span>”). There, the court noted at [74] that with S$3.65m in assets under the division order, the wife had sufficient financial resources to meet her reasonable needs. Furthermore, the children to that marriage had grown up such that the wife needed to focus only on her own needs.

Accordingly, she was not in a position to obtain a loan or other financing required for the acquisition of a new property. Additionally, she submitted that she would have to expend a substantial amount of moneys on the renovation of a new property. The sale of the Coronation Property would also entail a very high degree of uncertainty for a single mother with no income. This was especially so for the Wife, who was a breast cancer survivor, suffered from a brain tumour, and was generally not in the best of health. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 On the other hand, the Husband sought the sale of the Coronation Property with the sale proceeds distributed following<span class="font-italic"> </span>a 75:25 ratio in favour of the Wife.

</div> Amongst other things, the sale of the Coronation Property, as opposed to its transfer, would allow the Husband to come into cash which he could use to buy a property and save on the monthly rental of S$5,400 that he was incurring on his rental property at the time of the last AM hearing.

</div> Taking the above into account, the Husband was in a better position to secure financing for any permanent accommodation that he may have wished to acquire. The Husband would also be receiving half of the sale proceeds from the Penang Property. I considered that these factors militated against the Husband’s submission that a transfer of the Coronation Property would be financially debilitating for him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 On the other hand, a transfer would allow the Wife and the Children to continue living in the Coronation Property, as they have been living, without the need to look for another property, which they would likely have needed to renovate and then move into. I recognised that it was uncertain on the evidence before me whether the Wife would need to secure financing to acquire and renovate a new property. However, in the event that she did, she would face difficulties in doing so as she was not working at the time of the last AM hearing and had not worked for many years. Instead, a transfer would have allowed the Wife and the Children to move on more swiftly and securely with their lives, in their existing home, without incurring unnecessary change. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Taking into consideration both Parties’ positions and interests, I found that on balance, the Wife should be given the first option to retain the Coronation Property. The Wife was to communicate her decision to exercise this option within six months from the date of my order and the transfer was to be completed within 12 months from the date of the order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether an updated valuation of the Coronation Property should be used</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The next issue in relation to the Coronation Property, was whether its transfer should have taken place on the basis of the valuation that was used for the division of MAs, or an updated joint valuation carried out by CKS Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“CKS”). The valuation of the Coronation Property that was used for determining the pool of MAs was S$11m, with a net value of S$9,155,151.93, as at 21 September 2021. On the other hand, CKS carried out a valuation and obtained an updated figure of S$14.5m as of 23 June 2023

</div> <span class="font-italic">– </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about 31.8% more than the valuation used in the determination of the pool of MAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Wife submitted that the updated value of the property was not relevant where the Coronation Property would be transferred to her. She relied on <span class="font-italic">VOW v VOV</span> [2023] SGHCF 9 (“<span class="font-italic">VOW</span>”) at [72], where the court rejected a submission for a valuation to be revisited on appeal and instead adopted the valuation as agreed for use at the AM hearing. Although <span class="font-italic">VOW</span> dealt with an appeal, the Wife submitted that the principles in <span class="font-italic">VOW </span>at [72] were apposite as the Parties had already agreed on the value of the Coronation Property in their Joint Summary. In the alternative, the Wife submitted that if the court was inclined to use the updated value, her share of the MAs must also be adjusted as the pool of MAs would correspondingly have increased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The Husband submitted that the transfer of his share in the Coronation Property to the Wife should be based on the more recent and higher valuation. He distinguished the present case from <span class="font-italic">VOW</span> on the basis that <span class="font-italic">VOW</span> was a case dealing with a situation where a spouse who had agreed to an asset’s value for the purpose of ascertaining of the pool of assets at the AM hearing sought to have the asset revalued on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Husband submitted that in a transfer scenario, the relevant authority was <span class="font-italic">CYH</span>. There, the valuation of the relevant asset was outdated by more than two years (at [56]). In this case, the valuation of the Coronation Property used for the division of MAs was assessed about 1.75 years ago (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 30 September 2021). The Husband relied on <span class="font-italic">CYH</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]–[28], which held that when one party is going to buy over the other party’s share of a jointly owned non-cash MA, the fair market value of that asset as at the time of the AM hearing becomes relevant and must be established. The market price of a house may have risen significantly due to changes in market conditions and the long passage of time that elapsed between the date the IJ was granted and the date of the AM hearing. This may cause significant changes between the valuations at these dates. As such, it is only fair that a party is ordered to purchase the other’s share at a valuation ascertained as close as possible to the date of the AM hearing when the order to purchase is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I noted that the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> cited by the Wife from <span class="font-italic">VOW </span>was made in the context of a submission to have the valuation revisited at the appeal. This was clear from [71] and [72] of <span class="font-italic">VOW</span>. In contrast, the revaluation here took place as part of the process of dealing with AMs at first instance. The question here was whether a valuation determined at a date closer to when the actual transfer was to take place, should be used where: (a) a substantial period of time had passed from the date of the initial valuation for the purposes of division of MAs, to the date of the actual transfer of the MA between the Parties; and (b) the value of the MA has changed significantly. In light of the substantial passage of time (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 1.75 years) and the significant increase in valuation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, about 31.8%), I found that it would not be fair and equitable for the Wife to have the property transferred to her at the earlier, lower valuation. This was particularly so as applying that valuation would deny the Husband the benefit of the increase in value of the jointly-owned property. Instead, the Wife would be the sole beneficiary of this increase, as opposed to being a joint-beneficiary given her joint-ownership of the Coronation Property and my decision for equal division. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 With this in mind, I adopted the updated valuation of S$14.5m in determining the value of the Parties’ individual shares of the Coronation Property. This represented an increase of S$3.5m above the earlier valuation. 50% of this increase is the Wife’s entitlement. Accordingly, the value of a transfer of Coronation Property from the Husband to the Wife (using the updated valuation) would be increased by S$1.75m.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[B] shares</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Taking into account the Wife’s Sole Assets, the sale proceeds from the Penang Property, and the value of the transfer of the Coronation Property at the updated valuation, there remained an estimated S$3.8m in value that the Husband had to transfer to the Wife. This transfer was to be satisfied out of the Husband’s Sole Assets. However, the Parties disagreed over which specific assets should be transferred to the Wife. The Husband submitted that the shortfall be satisfied by a transfer of some of his shares in [B]. The Wife disagreed and submitted that it should be satisfied by cash transfers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Wife submitted that one of the Husband’s cars, a Mercedes Benz SLS Class (AMG) (the “Mercedes SLS”) valued at S$400,000, should be sold, and the sale proceeds should be applied in part satisfaction of the amount due to her. The shortfall which remained should be met by cash transfers from the Husband to her. In response, the Husband submitted that he was asset-rich but cash-poor. As such, he was unable to satisfy the amount due to the Wife with cash payments. Notwithstanding, he asked that the court not order him to sell his Mercedes SLS as it was of tremendous sentimental value to him. Further, he also asked to retain his cryptocurrencies. These cryptocurrencies were valued at S$263,890.50 and the Husband submitted that this value was far lower than that in 2021. As someone in the fintech industry, the Husband believed that there was potential for the value of the cryptocurrencies to increase. Instead, the Husband submitted that the shortfall be settled by way of transfer of the requisite number of [B] shares to the Wife. Alternatively, if the Court was not minded to order the Wife to take the [B] shares in full settlement, there should be a partial settlement by this mode.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I did not consider it fair to the Wife for the entire shortfall to be met by way of a transfer of [B] shares. Notably, in submitting that he was asset rich but cash poor, the Husband himself considered the [B] shares to be illiquid. Moreover, the Wife was likely to have greater difficulties in selling the [B] shares than the Husband, who was in the fintech industry. In addition, while I declined to order the sale of the Mercedes SLS and the cryptocurrencies, this was merely to allow the Husband some room to manage his own finances in meeting the Court orders for the cash transfers. It was not a basis to increase the amount of [B] shares to be transferred to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 On the other hand, I considered (a) the Husband’s current liquidity constraints; and (b) that some transfer of [B] shares would be required so that the full settlement of the Wife’s share would not stretch inordinately into the future. In light of these factors, I found that there should be transfer of <span class="font-italic">some</span> [B] shares to the Wife as partial settlement of her share of the MAs. Keeping in mind the concerns highlighted at [130] above, I was of the view that it would not be fair to the Wife for the majority of the shortfall to be satisfied via [B] shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The shortfall that remained to be met by the Husband arose after the assets jointly held by the Parties and the Wife’s Sole Assets had been taken into account. I noted that out of the Husband’s Sole Assets, which were valued at $20,558,106.84, the [B] shares amounted to a substantial S$8,466,884, or about 41% of the Husband’s Sole Assets. Using this a reference point, I ordered that about 41% of the remaining amount that the Husband was due to transfer to the Wife, after taking into account the value of the sale/transfer from the Penang Property and the Coronation Property, be met by way of [B] shares. Counsels agreed that the transfer would take place on the basis of the valuation used in the division of the MAs. The Husband was to transfer the number of [B] shares, in whole number, rounded up, that would most closely approximate this figure. The exact figure was to be determined after the value from the transfer of the Coronation Property and sale of the Penang Property were known.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Cash Payments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife S$10,000 in cash each month, prior to any transfer of the Coronation Property, and after the transfer until full settlement has been made. The interim maintenance of S$9,853.84 would cease with the first cash payment of S$10,000. The remainder of the cash payments were to be made in one lump sum payment within 2.5 years after the transfer of the Coronation Property. This lengthy period was ordered in consideration of the Husband’s submissions on his current illiquidity, and would in my view, give sufficient time for him to manage his substantial assets to make the cash transfers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The Husband would continue to pay the mortgage for the Coronation Property, prior to its transfer. However, in line with <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">TIC v TID</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> [2018]</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> 1 SLR 180 at [9], the mortgage payments and property tax paid by the Husband during the period before the transfer would accrue as his share of transfer to the Wife, if the Coronation Property was eventually transferred to the Wife. The Wife informed the Court that she would make arrangements to discharge the mortgage, if she exercised the option to buy the Husband’s share of the Coronation Property.</span>
