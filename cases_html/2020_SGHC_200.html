In an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>against a ship, the answer to this question may also seem simple, but is at times deceptively so. In an admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ, the defendant is not named as such but is generically described. For example, Form 159 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) describes the defendant as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(The owners of the ship [X] or as may be)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By and large, this generic description does not pose much difficulties. The identity of the defendant in the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action can still be a fairly straightforward question and which can be answered easily. The defendant would, ordinarily, be the party that is the owner (or the demise charterer as the case may be) of the ship in question <span class="font-italic">on the day</span> the action is commenced by the filing of the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>writ in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 However, complications may arise if the ownership of the ship changes between the date the cause of action arises and the date the action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> is commenced. For certain admiralty claims, if an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ has not been issued before the ownership change has taken place, those claims may no longer be pursued by way of an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against that ship. This is because the prerequisites for the valid invocation of the court’s admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> jurisdiction under s 4(4) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) cannot be met by the prospective claimant (see the Court of Appeal’s summary in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [112]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The limitations described at [3] above do not, however, apply to a claim that gives rise to a maritime lien. It is a long established principle of maritime law that a claim which gives rise to a maritime lien (and by extension, any <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ issued to enforce such a claim) is <span class="font-italic">not</span> defeated by a subsequent change in the ownership of the ship in connection with which the claim arose (<span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle</span> [1979-1980] SLR (R) 538 (“<span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle</span>”) (the Privy Council on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Singapore) at [21]). It is an equally well-established principle of maritime law that a claim arising from damage caused by a ship (for example, as a result of a collision with another ship) gives rise to a maritime lien (see <span class="font-italic">The Bold </span><span class="font-italic">Buccleugh</span> (1851) 7 Moo PC 267 (<span class="font-italic">“The Bold </span><span class="font-italic">Buccleugh”</span>)). A collision damage claim would fall within s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Act, which confers admiralty jurisdiction on the High Court to hear and determine any “claim for damage done by a ship”. Section 4(3) of the Act recognises, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that for claims that give rise to a maritime lien on a ship, the High Court’s admiralty jurisdiction may be invoked by an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against that ship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 That having been said, when the “wrongdoing” ship involved in a collision with another ship undergoes a change in ownership and an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ is issued against the first ship <span class="font-italic">after</span> the change in ownership has taken place, which party should correctly enter an appearance in the action <span class="font-italic">as the defendant</span>? Is it the owner at the time of the collision or the owner at the time when the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ was issued? As elaborated below, the answer lies in (a) appreciating that a collision damage maritime lien is ultimately fault-based notwithstanding its maritime lien status and (b) understanding the effect of entry of appearance in an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action in relation to <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam </span>liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 These deceptively simple but important questions were at the heart of the appeal before me in Registrar’s Appeal No 106 of 2020 (“RA 106”). I was informed by counsel, during the hearing, that there is a dearth of caselaw on the questions set out at [5] above. As the present case afforded this court an opportunity to provide some clarity on these and other questions that arose for my consideration in the course of the appeal, I now provide the full written grounds for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The relevant key facts are largely undisputed and may be stated briefly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On or about 7 April 2019, the vessels, <span class="font-italic">Royal Arsenal</span> and <span class="font-italic">Echo Star</span> were involved in a collision in the Straits of Hormuz.

These invariably require previous owners to indemnify new owners in respect of claims arising from maritime liens that may have accrued under the vessel’s previous ownership. Such indemnities are “standard” in the maritime industry, and “implicitly acknowledge that the proper defendants in an admiralty action involving maritime liens will be the Owners as at the time a writ is issued, and not the previous Owners”. Given that an indemnity was provided by Sea Dolphin to Cepheus (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>as contained in cl 9 of the Norwegian Saleform 2012 used in the sale of the Ship), the latter had “accepted that [it] will first need to defend against the [plaintiff’s] claim and thereafter look to Sea Dolphin for an indemnity.”

However, as I elaborate below at [28(b)], this is not the case for a maritime lien. I therefore did not derive much assistance from the statutory lien cases in deciding the threshold issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Whilst the plaintiff also cited <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Father Thames</span> ([22(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in support of its argument, which was a case involving a damage lien,<span class="font-italic"> </span> the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of <span class="font-italic">The Father Thames</span> concerned the distinct question of whether a demise charterer could be deemed an “owner” for purposes of an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action. As I elaborate below at [37], the <span class="font-italic">obiter </span><span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Sheen J in <span class="font-italic">The Father Thames</span> that the plaintiff relied upon in fact supported Cepheus’ position rather than the plaintiff’s.  Given the dearth of authority, I found it necessary to fall back on first principles to decide this threshold issue. This in turn necessitated an examination of the core features of a maritime lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 A maritime lien is an encumbrance on a ship or other <span class="font-italic">res</span> which accrues simultaneously with the cause of action<span class="font-italic">. </span>It is not a claim <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but exists as a form of security for an underlying claim. The maritime lien is enforceable through an action <span class="font-italic">in rem, </span>and entitles the claimant to be paid out of the sale proceeds of the <span class="font-italic">res</span> in priority to other classes of creditors (<span class="font-italic">Precious Shipping Public Co Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v OW Bunker Far East (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others and other matters </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1229 at [51] citing <span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [10] and [21]). A maritime lien has, at its core, the following salient features: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a maritime lien travels secretively and unconditionally with the <span class="font-italic">res</span>. It survives changes of ownership (otherwise than via a judicial sale), even if the <span class="font-italic">res</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is transferred to a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purchaser without notice (<span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle </span>at [9] citing <span class="font-italic">The Bold </span><span class="font-italic">Buccleugh </span>([4] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)). Further, the offending ship may be validly arrested by an injured claimant to obtain security to enforce its claim despite the change in ownership, <span class="font-italic">and</span> to compel appearance by the wrongdoers (<span class="font-italic">The Father Thames </span>at 368 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Sheen J). The new owner would not be able to set aside the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>writ or the arrest simply on account of the change of ownership. I shall refer to this as the “Procedural Aspect” of the maritime lien. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the maritime lien accrues <span class="font-italic">simultaneously</span> with the cause of action but lies inchoate until it is carried into effect by an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>. When the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action is commenced, the maritime lien crystallises and <span class="font-italic">relates back to the period when it first </span><span class="font-italic">arose</span> (see <span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle </span>at [9] citing <span class="font-italic">The Bold </span><span class="font-italic">Buccleugh</span>). As was neatly summarised by Lord Diplock in <span class="font-italic">The Halcyon Isle</span> at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If and when a maritime lien is carried into effect by legal process, however, the charge dates back to the time that the claim on which it is founded arose. It is only in this retrospective consequence of his having been able to enforce the legal process in a court of law that enables a claimant, whose entitlement to a maritime lien is still inchoate and has not yet come into effect, to pursue his claim to lien, as it were proleptically, in a proceeding in rem against the ship at a time when it no longer belongs to the shipowner who was personally liable to satisfy the claim in respect of which the lien arose. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">I refer to this as the “Crystallisation Aspect” of the maritime lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Focusing on the <span class="font-weight-bold">damage lien</span>, it is well-established that the lien is based on, or arises as a result of the fault or negligence on the part of the servants of the offending ship, as attributable to its owner. In this regard, the description “owner” is wide enough to include a demise charterer, if any, at the time of the incident giving rise to the damage lien (<span class="font-italic">The Father Thames</span> at 368 col 2). In other words, the <span class="font-italic">personal</span> <span class="font-italic">liability</span> of the shipowner is a necessary requirement for the accrual of the damage lien. As succinctly described by Sir Francis Jeune, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council (on appeal from the Vice-Admiralty Court of Gibraltar) in <span class="font-italic">The Utopia </span>[1893] AC 492 (“<span class="font-italic">The Utopia</span>”) at 499: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the <span class="font-italic">foundation of the lien is the negligence of the owners</span> or their servants <span class="font-italic">at the time of the collision</span>, and if that be not proved no lien comes into existence, and the ship is no more liable than any other property which the owners at the time of the collision may have possessed. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I refer to this as the “Fault Aspect” of the damage lien. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the proper defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 When all three aspects as defined above (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Procedural, Crystallisation and Fault) are considered together, it was, in my view, logical that in the context of an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ issued in respect of a claim for collision damage, the action is in fact addressed to the owner (or the demise charterer as the case may be) of the ship <span class="font-italic">at the time of the collision</span>; this is the case even where the ownership of the offending ship has changed between the date of the collision and the issuance of the writ. Therefore, in this case, the proper party to enter an appearance in ADM 143 as <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">defendant</span> was <span class="font-italic">Sea Dolphin</span> and not Cepheus. I elaborate further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In relation to the Fault Aspect, it was in my view, intuitively wrong that  the damage lien could have the effect of making a subsequent <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of the wrongdoing ship, a defendant in the true sense of the word. If the plaintiff’s argument was upheld, it could theoretically render a subsequent owner personally liable <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> for a collision that was neither its fault, nor that of its servants. That did not seem logical, and as I explain below at [34], in fact exposed the key weakness in the plaintiff’s argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Cepheus’ position, on the other hand, was consistent with the well-established legal consequences of an entry of appearance. It is hornbook admiralty law that an action in <span class="font-italic">rem </span>commenced against a ship is an action against the ship itself. If the defendant does not enter an appearance and judgment is obtained, the judgment is enforceable only against the ship, to the extent of its realisable value via a judicial sale. In contrast, if the defendant enters an appearance, he submits himself personally to the jurisdiction of the court, and renders himself liable <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam </span>such that if judgment is obtained by the plaintiff, it may be enforced <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>against the ship and <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam </span>against the defendant (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Soeraya Emas </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 479 at [28]-[30]<span class="font-italic">;</span><span class="font-italic"> The Fierbinti </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 574 at [12]). This principle also applies to a claim subject to a damage lien<span class="font-italic"> mutatis mutandis</span>. I thus agreed with Cepheus’ submission that it would be “absurd” to insist that in order to protect its rights in respect of the Ship (and to secure its release from arrest), Cepheus had to enter appearance as “defendant” in ADM 143 and potentially render itself personally liable for a fault-based claim, in circumstances where it was a total stranger to the events giving rise to the collision.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 On the facts before me, Sea Dolphin (and not Cepheus) would be the party against whom “fault”, if any, would have to be established by the plaintiff in relation to the collision; it was Sea Dolphin’s servants or agents who were navigating the Ship at the material time. Sea Dolphin would thus be the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant to the action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, as explained at [28(a)] above, the essence of the Procedural Aspect allows the offending ship to be arrested by the injured party to obtain security for the damage suffered, <span class="font-italic">and</span> to compel the <span class="font-italic">wrongdoer</span> to appear to answer the claim, notwithstanding the subsequent change in ownership. In this context, the <span class="font-italic">wrongdoer</span> can only be the owner (or demise charterer) of the offending ship at the time of the collision. This demonstrates the neat confluence of the Procedural Aspect and the Fault Aspect. However, the plaintiff’s contentions seek to upset this neat confluence. If I were to find that the new owner, Cepheus, was the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant for the purposes of the action, then upon the arrest of the Ship, Cepheus would be compelled to enter appearance as defendant and potentially assume <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam </span>liability that originally accrued through no fault on its part. Such a result cannot be right. It is, with respect, not logical and goes against the very core of both the Procedural Aspect and the Fault Aspect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As for the plaintiff’s submission that the new owner may seek an indemnity under the ship sale and purchase agreement from the original owners in respect of any losses or costs incurred in defending the action, I was of the view that this was an entirely separate matter which was dependent primarily on the specific terms of the agreement between the old and new owners of the ship. It did not provide an answer to the threshold issue I had to decide. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Crystallisation Aspect further supported my conclusion that the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant is the owner of the ship at the time of the collision. As mentioned at [28(b)] above, the damage lien <span class="font-italic">arises</span> as soon as the incident by which the ship causes damage occurs. The damage lien <span class="font-italic">crystallises</span> upon the commencement of the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>proceedings and when it does, <span class="font-italic">relates back </span>to the moment in time when it was first created (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when the incident causing damage occurred). As the damage lien is also premised on fault, the only party that can bear personal liability in respect of the collision damage claim is the owner <span class="font-italic">at the time of the collision</span><span class="font-italic">, to which point in time the damage lien relates back when the in rem writ is issued</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Thus, when all three aspects of the damage lien are drawn together, it becomes clear that the relevant point in time for the identification of the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant is when the collision occurred; this is the case even when the offending ship changes ownership prior to the issuance of the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ against it. In this regard, I found the following passage from the judgment of Sheen J in <span class="font-italic">The Father Thames </span>([22(a)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (at 368)<span class="font-italic"> </span>instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a ship has been sold between the day of the collision and the time when the writ is issued, the writ will not be set aside on the grounds that the defendants, namely the owners of the ship, are not liable for the negligent navigation of the ship. There is plenty of authority for the proposition that a maritime lien remains attached to the ship and the Court will arrest and hold that ship until bail has been given. If necessary the ship will be sold and the proceeds used to meet any judgment. In such a case the former owners are likely to have every incentive to assist the new owners in defending the action because they have given the new owners an indemnity in the contract of sale. The new owners may put up bail to secure the release of the ship. <span class="font-italic">It would, however, be more realistic, and many difficulties would be removed if the defendants were described in the writ as “The Owners on the (date of collision) of the ship ‘Y’</span>.” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The italicised sentence in the passage above is pragmatic and sensible and reflects, in my view, the proper application of all three aspects of the damage lien as summarised at [28]-[29] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In cases involving a collision damage lien where the ship’s name has also changed following the collision, when describing the defendant in the admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ, “X” (see Form 159 of the ROC at [1] above) should reflect the name of the ship <span class="font-italic">on the date of the collision</span>. However, the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> writ should describe the action as being an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against the ship under its <span class="font-italic">current name</span> on the date the writ is filed (see <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Mawan</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 459 at 460 col.1).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Reverting to the plaintiff’s arguments summarised at [22], no authority was cited to me in which the new owners of a ship that had been involved in a collision under her previous ownership had entered appearance <span class="font-italic">as defendants</span> in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, and were also subsequently found liable <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> for the collision. Given the core features of the damage lien (see [28] – [29] above), the entry of appearance cannot create <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> liability on the new owner of the offending vessel in the absence of fault on the part of that new owner for the damage lien arising in the first place. I would be surprised if any such authority existed as it would be a decision contrary to the core of the Fault Aspect. Indeed, the Fault Aspect of the damage lien demonstrated, in my view, the fundamental fallacy in the plaintiff’s position.  If the plaintiff’s argument (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>that the new owner who is a stranger to the collision is the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant) is taken to its logical conclusion, the new owners in this case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Cepheus) could then potentially defend the action and have the plaintiff’s claim <span class="font-italic">dismissed</span> on the basis that there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> negligence or fault on Cepheus’ part or on the part of their servants or agents. Such a result would thereby render the damage lien which had accrued in the plaintiff’s favour impotent.

</div>
</div> From 13 February 2020 to 12 March 2020, parties were in negotiations. On 12 March 2020, Cepheus filed SUM 1187. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Based on the above timeline of events (which was not disputed by the plaintiff), there was no undue delay of four months. If there was any delay, it was, at best, slightly more than a month. Cepheus was only made aware of the mistake in the entry of appearance <span class="font-italic">after </span>the Vessel was released from arrest on 20 December 2019 and began taking concrete steps to rectify the error from 31 January 2020 onwards. The plaintiff’s assertion of undue delay on Cepheus’ part was, in my view, overstated.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Fourth, in respect of the claimed prejudice to the plaintiff in terms of a potential counterclaim from Sea Dolphin, that argument necessarily presupposed that Cepheus was the correct defendant in the first place. However, as I have concluded above, Cepheus was not the proper <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> defendant for the purposes of ADM 143. The claimed prejudice was therefore a non-starter as it was grounded on a premise that was wrong in law. It appeared to me that the plaintiff was essentially contending that it ought to be allowed to take advantage of Cepheus’ incorrect entry of appearance as defendant, and be allowed to prosecute its claim with no counterclaim. That did not seem right to me. In any case, as explained above, there was in fact no prejudice to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 An additional point to note was that Sea Dolphin had entered appearance as defendant and had taken steps in ADM 143 by, for example, filing its List of Electronic Track Data (see [13] above). If the plaintiff succeeded in proving its claim at trial, any judgment obtained by it could be enforced against <span class="font-italic">the security</span> furnished by Cepheus as the intervener and <span class="font-italic">personally</span> against Sea Dolphin as the defendant should the security furnished prove insufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Lastly, the presence of proceedings commenced by Sea Dolphin against the plaintiff in another jurisdiction was, in my view, irrelevant to the present application which was primarily concerned with whether Cepheus ought to be granted leave to withdraw its MOA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having considered the parties’ arguments, the circumstances of the case, and bearing in mind my conclusion on the threshold issue, this was, in my judgment, an appropriate case for the court’s discretion to be exercised in favour of allowing the appearance by Cepheus to be withdrawn.  In this regard, the AR did not err in allowing Cepheus’ application for leave to withdraw its appearance as defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Finally, as the current owners of the Ship and the party who had furnished security in respect of the plaintiff’s claim in order to secure the release of the Ship from arrest, Cepheus was plainly a party with an interest in the Ship as contemplated by O 70 r 16(1) of the ROC. I thus also agreed with the AR’s decision to grant Cepheus leave to intervene in ADM 143. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed RA 106. I also fixed costs of the appeal at $4,000 (including disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to Cepheus. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">S Mohan <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jude Philomen Benny, Mary-Anne Shu-Hui Chua (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vellayappan Balasubramaniyam, Dedi Affandi bin Ahmad, Dinesh Sabapathy (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendant and intervener. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
