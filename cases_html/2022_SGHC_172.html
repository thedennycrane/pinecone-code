The District Judge (“the DJ”) found the victim (“V1”)’s evidence to be cogent as well as internally and externally consistent. Following his conviction on the First Charge, the appellant pleaded guilty to a second charge of attempted aggravated outrage of modesty under s 354A(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 511(1) of the PC (“the Second Charge”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The DJ imposed a sentence of four years and six months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane in respect of the First Charge and three years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane in respect of the Second Charge.

The appellant submits that the DJ erred in finding that he had touched V1’s vagina over her underwear for three main reasons. First, during V1’s examination-in-chief, V1 pointed to different parts of her body when asked where she had been touched. Second, V1’s mother, PW7, provided inconsistent and untruthful testimony at trial. Finally, the evidence suggests that V1 had been coached as a witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In response, the Prosecution submits that the DJ rightly found that V1 had pointed to her vagina area when asked to identify where she had been touched. Any discrepancy between the two areas V1 identified during her evidence-in-chief and cross-examination can be attributed to the fact that the “camera placement in the video-link room during V1’s [examination-in-chief] had hindered” V1’s testimony.

</div> After the necessary adjustments were made to the camera angle, V1 pointed clearly to her vagina area. Further, V1’s evidence that the appellant had placed his hand under her skirt and touched her vagina over her underwear was unshaken under cross-examination and corroborated by her parents, whom she confided in immediately after the incident.

Pertinently, key aspects of V1’s testimony were materially corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses and by the appellant himself. Contrastingly, the appellant’s defence vacillated several times in the course of proceedings. Whereas the appellant initially claimed that he did not touch V1’s groin area, he later stated that he may have grabbed her on her uniform, before claiming that he may have touched V1 below her skirt but not on her underwear and finally admitting under cross-examination that it was possible that he had touched her on her vagina area over her underwear.

Appellate intervention is justified only when the trial judge’s findings of fact are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence (<span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 3 SLR 656 at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I find there to be insufficient grounds to overturn the appellant’s conviction on the First Charge. The DJ had assessed V1’s evidence to be internally and externally consistent. Whilst the appellant contends that V1 vacillated on which part of her body he had touched, I see no reason to disturb the DJ’s finding that – after initial technological difficulties with the video-link facility had been dealt with – V1 identified that the appellant had touched her vagina area over her underwear with certainty. In this regard, V1’s evidence was supported by the testimony of her father, PW5, and PW7 whom V1 had confided in immediately after the incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Moreover, V1’s testimony must be understood in the context of the following. First, the appellant’s shifting account of whether he had touched V1’s vagina. The appellant provided no explanation for his inability to maintain a straight story on whether he had come into contact with V1’s vagina and why his claim that he had accidentally touched V1’s vagina was only raised at trial. Second, the inherent improbability of the appellant accidentally touching V1’s vagina <span class="font-italic">under her skirt</span>. Third, that V1’s recollection of the incident was largely consistent with what the appellant admitted to in court and in his statements, including that the appellant had approached V1 with the intention of outraging her modesty. Set against this backdrop, the DJ’s acceptance of V1’s testimony that the appellant had touched her on her vagina area over her underwear could not be said to be against the weight of the evidence. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appellant’s attempt to retract his plea of guilt to the Second Charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Next, I consider whether the appellant’s plea of guilt to the Second Charge was voluntary. In his written submissions, the appellant contended that he “intended to contest both charges” and there was no reason for him to elect to plead guilty to the Second Charge whilst contesting the First Charge.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Appellant’s Submissions dated 26 May 2022 (“AS”) at [22].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Before me, the appellant stated that the foregoing expressed his intention to retract his plea of guilt to the Second Charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The court will only allow an accused person to retract his guilty plea at the post-sentence stage in exceptional cases, such as where the accused person did not have the genuine freedom to plead (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Dinesh s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Rajantheran </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1289 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh</span>”) at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 This high threshold is not met in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It must be noted that the appellant had the benefit of legal representation when he elected to plead guilty to the Second Charge. I am cognisant that the appellant alleged that his Former Counsel failed to advise him to claim trial to the Second Charge. However, the crux of the appellant’s contention in that regard is that his Former Counsel did not advise him that pleading guilty to the Second Charge would have an adverse effect on the cumulative sentence he eventually received or on the DJ’s finding that there was no contributory link between the appellant’s alleged psychiatric conditions and his commission of the offences. Even if the appellant’s allegations were true, they have no bearing on whether the appellant’s Former Counsel pressured him to plead guilty to the Second Charge, of which there is no evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On the contrary, the objective evidence shows that at the material time, the appellant confirmed his intention to admit to the Second Charge without qualification and that he understood the nature and consequences of his plea of guilt. The Notes of Evidence illustrates that the appellant expressed his intention to plead guilty to the Second Charge through both the Court Officer and his Former Counsel. It further illustrates that the Former Counsel specifically confirmed the appellant’s awareness of the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment and mandatory caning associated with the Second Charge. Likewise, the mitigation plea tendered on the appellant’s behalf stated that the appellant decided to plead guilty to the Second Charge “because he [did] not want to waste the Court’s resources and [did] not wish [for] the Prosecution[’s] witnesses” to relive the trauma associated with the appellant’s acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Indeed, in expressing dissatisfaction with the DJ’s decision to order the sentences for both the First and Second Charges to run consecutively, the more obvious inference to be drawn is that the appellant had simply come to regret his decision to plead guilty after the specific sentence had been imposed (<span class="font-italic">Dinesh</span> at [49]). Disappointment over a sentence different from one that was hoped for, however, is never an acceptable basis for allowing an accused person to seek belatedly to retract his plea of guilt (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Leng Khim v Public Prosecutor and another matter</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1219 at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Thus, I find that there is no merit to the appellant’s attempt to retract his plea of guilt to the Second Charge.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appellant’s allegations against his Former Counsel  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I now turn to an ancillary issue that the appellant raised in this appeal, namely that his Former Counsel acted negligently in failing to (a) call his psychiatrist, Dr Ang Yong Guan (“Dr Ang”) to testify at the trial; (b) adduce Dr Ang’s psychiatric report in evidence; (c) brief the appellant on what transpired in chambers (between the Trial Judge, the DPP and the Former Counsel) which “led to Dr Ang being absent in Court”; and (d) advise him to claim trial to the Second Charge.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 At this juncture, I should point out that this appeal is not the proper forum to determine whether the Former Counsel acted in breach of his professional duties. The only germane issue is whether the Former Counsel’s conduct of the matter casts doubt on the propriety of the appellant’s conviction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In this regard, an appellant seeking to overturn his conviction on the basis that he did not receive adequate legal assistance must first show that the trial counsel’s conduct of the case fell so clearly below an objective standard of what a reasonable counsel would or would not have done in the particular circumstances of the case that the conduct could be fairly described as flagrant or egregious incompetence or indifference. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 At this stage of the analysis, it will not be enough to show that some other counsel, especially eminent or experienced ones, would have taken a different approach. Counsel must be given the latitude in deciding how to conduct the case. If inadequate legal assistance from previous counsel is proved, the second step is to show that there is a nexus between the counsel’s conduct of the case and the court’s decision in the matter to demonstrate a case of miscarriage of justice. The appellant must show that there is a “real possibility” that any inadequate assistance has caused a miscarriage of justice (<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters</span> [2020] 1 SLR 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span>”) at [135]–[139]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Even if I assume that the appellant satisfies the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Farid</span> test – which, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not make any finding on – the appellant has failed to show how any alleged inadequate assistance on the Former Counsel’s part has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Pertinently, Dr Ang’s evidence – as expressed in two reports dated 20 July 2018 and 17 August 2020 respectively – was only relevant (if at all) to the appellant’s sentence. It had no bearing on the appellant’s conviction. Moreover, Dr Ang’s reports were, in fact, adduced in mitigation and considered by the DJ who stated that he was mindful of Dr Ang’s opinion but ultimately found that the appellant “was fully aware of what he was doing in the commission of the offences”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Likewise, even if the Former Counsel had advised the appellant to plead guilty to the Second Charge, there was no evidence that the appellant was <span class="font-italic">pressured</span> into doing so (see [9] to [13] above). Counsel has “not only a right, but a duty to advise an accused [person] as to the weakness of his case [and] as to the probable outcome of the trial” (<span class="font-italic">R v Lamoureux</span> (1984) 13 CCC (3d) 101 at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As such, I decline to overturn the appellant’s conviction on the basis that he received inadequate legal assistance. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Appeal against sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally, I consider the appellant’s appeal against his sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 At the outset, I highlight that both the First and Second Charges fall within the ambit of ss 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) and 337(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). There is therefore no scope for the court to impose a Mandatory Treatment Order. It is a legal impossibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 While the appellant contends that the DJ erred in finding that (a) the dominant sentencing principle in this case is deterrence (and not rehabilitation); and (b) there was no causal link between his alleged psychiatric conditions (set out in Dr Ang’s report dated 20 July 2018) and his commission of the offences, I find that there is no merit in either submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 There is no basis for the appellant’s suggestion that he was suffering from depression or anxiety or that these purported conditions materially contributed to his offending. Succinctly, I find that the DJ was amply justified in finding that “there was premeditation and the [appellant] was fully aware of what he was doing in the commission of the offences”.

</div>
</div>
</div> In respect of the First Charge, as I alluded to at [10] above, the appellant does not dispute that on the material date, he saw V1 and PW4 at the void deck, followed them into a lift, took the lift to the seventh floor to keep observation of V1 (who was on the sixth floor) and later approached V1 (when she was alone) with the intention of outraging her modesty (see GD at [12]). These actions evinced a high degree of volition fundamentally inconsistent with Dr Ang’s claim that the appellant committed the offences in a “dazed and dissociative state”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For completeness, I should add here that, for the same reasons, the DJ was correct to reject the Defence’s application for a Newton Hearing to determine if the appellant suffered from any psychiatric conditions which materially contributed to his offences.

</div> As Sundaresh Menon CJ explained in <span class="font-italic">Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 5 SLR 887, “the Court may decline to convene a Newton hearing if the case sought to be advanced is absurd or obviously untenable” (at [37]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Following from the above, there is no basis for the appellant’s submission that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing principle engaged on the facts of the present case. I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that rehabilitation recedes as a relevant sentencing principle given the serious nature of the offences committed. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the appellant had suffered from anxiety and depression at the material time (which, I reiterate, was unsupported by the objective evidence), the egregiousness and nature of the appellant’s offences would have rendered deterrence the foremost sentencing consideration (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Siow Kai Yuan Terence</span> [2020] 4 SLR 1412 at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Likewise, I see no basis to interfere with either the individual or the aggregate sentence(s) imposed by the DJ. It must be remembered that each charge attracted a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of three years and mandatory caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The DJ’s sentence on the First Charge gave adequate weight to several aggravating factors, including that V1 was significantly younger than 14 years of age and the premeditated nature of the offence. The sentence the DJ imposed in respect of the Second Charge – three years’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane – cannot, in view of the mandatory minimum sentence, be said to be manifestly excessive.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Finally, the DJ was justified in ordering both sentences to run consecutively; the underlying offences related to two separate victims and were committed on distinct occasions over a period of approximately four months. The aggregate sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane cannot be considered crushing in view of the egregious acts directed at young, vulnerable school-going children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For the above reasons, I dismiss the appeal against conviction and sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Vincent Hoong</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">The appellant in person and unrepresented;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Sruthi Boppana and Teo Pei Rong Grace</div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
