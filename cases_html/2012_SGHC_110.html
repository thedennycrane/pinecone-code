<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns an
                    agreement for the plaintiff to buy over from the defendants
                    a company which owns two compressed natural gas
                    (“CNG”) refueling stations in Singapore for
                    $25m. The defendants are the only shareholders of the said
                    company. A “good faith deposit” of $1m was
                    paid by the plaintiff to the defendants for this purpose.
                    However, the sale was not completed and the plaintiff wanted
                    a refund of the $1m. The issue for decision is whether or
                    not the “good faith deposit” is refundable in
                    the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the
                    parties’ submissions, I held that the plaintiff
                    succeeded its claim for the refund of the $1m and the
                    defendants failed in their counterclaim in respect of three
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of agreed facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On the first day of trial,
                    after some discussions, the parties decided that there was
                    no real factual dispute and agreed to proceed on a question
                    of interpretation of contract based on a set of agreed
                    facts. They produced a statement of agreed facts the next
                    day. The following facts emerged from that
                statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The defendants own Smart
                    Energy Pte Ltd (“the Company”), holding 100%
                    of the 6,000,001 shares of the Company. At all material
                    times, the plaintiff was represented by Teo Kiang Ang
                    (“Teo”), who is the majority shareholder of
                    the plaintiff and of Union Energy Corporation Pte Ltd
                    (“Union Energy”). The first defendant was
                    represented by Johnny Harjantho (“Harjantho”)
                    and the second defendant was represented by William Aw
                    (“Aw”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Part of Union Energy’s
                    business includes the retail of CNG in Singapore. Both Union
                    Energy and the Company are supplied CNG by Gas Supply Pte
                    Ltd (“GSPL”), a company owned by Temasek
                    Holdings (Private) Limited. Apart from Union Energy and the
                    Company, the only other company registered as a retailer of
                    CNG in Singapore is Sembcorp Gas Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Part of the
                    plaintiff’s taxi fleet runs on CNG supplied by Union
                    Energy while part of the first defendant’s taxi fleet
                    runs on CNG supplied mainly by the Company. Union Energy has
                    one CNG refueling station in Singapore (in Old Toh Tuck
                    Road) while the Company has two (one at Mandai Link and the
                    other at Serangoon North).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In early April 2010, Teo
                    asked Harjantho about the possibility of the plaintiff
                    buying over the two stations owned by the Company. Harjantho
                    and Aw discussed this matter and offered to sell the Company
                    to Teo for S$32 million. A counter offer of $25 million was
                    made by Teo, which the parties eventually agreed on, on the
                    basis that Teo would buy 100% of the issued and paid up
                    shares in the Company (“the Sale Shares”) and
                    consequently buy the two stations. This agreement
                    essentially allowed the plaintiff to acquire the Company
                    along with its assets and businesses as they were at that
                    point in time, excluding any receivables and deposits up to
                    the completion date of the acquisition (which would belong
                    to the defendants) as well as any debts of the Company up to
                    the date of completion (which the defendants would have to
                    settle).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Initially, the defendants
                    wanted the $1m deposit to be paid on a non-refundable basis.
                    After some discussions and four draft MOUs, the parties
                    executed the MOU on 16 April 2010, Clause 3 of which
                    reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was agreed that payment
                    would be made in two stages: S$1 million to be paid as a
                    refundable “good faith deposit” upon the
                    signing of the MOU and the balance of S$24 million to be
                    paid upon the completion of the transfer of all the Sale
                    Shares. Accordingly, the Plaintiff paid S$500,000 to each of
                    the two defendants (S$1 million in total) when the MOU was
                        signed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff
                    commenced the legal and financial due diligence exercise on
                    the Company on the day the MOU was signed. It asked for the
                    CNG supply agreement with GSPL, the JTC leases and valuation
                    of the defendants’ two stations and relevant licenses
                    and permits for the Company’s business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 22 April 2010, the
                    defendants informed the plaintiff that the documents asked
                    for would be sent after the share purchase agreement was
                    signed. On 23 April 2010, Aw sent an email to the
                    defendants’ then solicitors and the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors stating that the Company would need to request
                    GSPL officially for permission to release information on the
                    CNG supply agreement. On 26 April 2010, the defendants
                    sent an email to the plaintiffs attaching copies of the
                    Building Agreements between the Jurong Town Corporation and
                    the Company with respect to its two stations.
                    On27 April 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>,
                    the defendants wrote to GSPL to request permission to
                    release information to the plaintiff regarding their CNG
                    supply agreement with GSPL. On 17 May 2010, GSPL wrote
                    the Company objecting to the disclosure of the Terminated
                    GRA to any prospective buyers. However GSPL agreed to
                    disclose the letter dated 5 April 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> for the interim supply of
                    gas to the plaintiff, subject to the Plaintiff providing a
                    written confidentiality undertaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Share Purchase Agreement (SPA)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 21 April 2010, the
                    plaintiff sent an email to the defendants, attaching the
                    first draft of the Share Purchase Agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (“the SPA”)
                    for comment. On 30 April 2010, after some negotiations
                    on the terms, the SPA was executed by the parties with the
                    following key clauses:</p>

                    (wrongly dated as 2 August 2010) from the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors Lim Hua Yong to the
                    defendants’ then solicitors Lau &amp; Gur, the
                    plaintiff informed the defendants that it was not going
                    ahead with the completion of the sale and purchase of shares
                    on the basis that the defendants had failed to fulfill some
                    conditions precedent of the SPA. The plaintiff also asked
                    for the return of the S$1m deposit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On or about
                    15 October 2010, UOB debited $20,000 from the

                        fee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The $1m deposit is refundable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Following negotiations
                    leading to the MOU, it was agreed by the parties that the
                    $1m deposit would be refundable and this was eventually set
                    out in the MOU. The SPA, signed 14 days later, did not
                    change that, much less suggest that the plaintiff would have
                    to pay the huge amount of $1m to conduct a due diligence
                    exercise. After all, the due diligence exercise could have
                    proved to be wholly unsatisfactory, as was the case
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was apparent from
                    Clause 3.1 of the SPA that the $1m would form part of the
                    consideration for the shares. Hence, without the transfer of
                    the shares, there would be a total failure of consideration.
                    Moreover, it was also clear that the plaintiff was primarily
                    concerned with the continuity of CNG supply from GSPL. Given
                    the defendants’ failure to produce a GRA with GSPL to
                    ensure this continuity and with the Letter of Termination
                    and the Interim Arrangement by GSPL falling short of the
                    condition precedent in the SPA Clause 4.1 (h), (m) and (n),
                    the plaintiff submitted that it was entitled to rescind the
                    agreement and to receive the refund of the $1m deposit
                    because of total failure of consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Bad faith</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The bad faith on the part
                    of the defendants could be demonstrated from the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     Signing an MOU
                        without disclosing the termination of the GRA, while
                        knowing full well the importance of the continuity of
                        CNG supply to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Not getting a new
                        GRA and asking that the plaintiff negotiate directly
                        with GSPL for a new GRA when the MOU (at Clause 4.7) and
                        the SPA (at Condition 4(h)) both clearly imposed that
                        obligation on “the
                    Vendors”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Disclosing GSPL’s letters of
                        termination and the interim arrangement only after a
                        12-week delay from the signing of the MOU even though
                        these were critical documents. Had the plaintiff been
                        aware of the termination, the plaintiff would not have
                        signed the MOU, much less paid the $1m deposit directly
                        to the defendants (as opposed to paying their solicitors
                        as stakeholders); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     Asserting that the $1m good
                        faith deposit was “non-refundable” in
                        spite of the fact that such a term was never used in the
                        SPA and was contrary to the specific terms of the MOU as
                        well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Hence, the plaintiff
                    prayed for the $1m deposit to be returned with interest
                    thereon running from 23 August 2010, i.e. 7 days after
                    the letter dated 16 August 2010, together with costs
                    (including costs of the summary judgment
                    applications).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">There exists no clause in the SPA that allows for
                a refund</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendants submitted
                    that the plaintiff’s reliance on Clause 3.5 of the MOU
                    as a basis for the refund was incorrect. Clause 7.1 of the
                    MOU clearly stated that the MOU would only be valid for
                    fourteen days unless extended (which did not happen) and
                    that it would be superseded by any subsequent definitive
                    agreement. This would have taken place on 30 April 2010
                    when the parties signed the SPA. Moreover, considering
                    Clause 10.2 of the SPA which stated that the SPA
                    “supersedes any previous agreements or arrangements
                    between them relating to the subject matter hereof”,
                    quite clearly the SPA was the only contract that governed
                    the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The SPA itself did not
                    contain any provision for the refund of the S$1m at all. By
                    trying to read an entire paragraph from the MOU into the
                    SPA, the plaintiff was trying to “add” to or
                    to “vary” the SPA, an act clearly prohibited
                    by the presence of an ‘Entire Agreement Clause’.
                    Given that the SPA was first drafted by the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors, such a refund clause could
                    easily have been inserted by them. No amount of pre-MOU
                    negotiations could negate the fact that there was no
                    provision in the SPA for a refund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     To rely on some parts of
                    the superseded MOU and incorporate them into the SPA would
                    amount to cherry-picking on the plaintiff’s part, an
                    act contrary to the principle of having finality in
                    agreements. Relying on only one clause of the MOU regarding
                    the refund, the plaintiff ignored the rest of the MOU,
                    including parts like Recital (D) which expressly stated that
                    the MOU only governed the parties’ relationship prior
                    to the execution of the definitive documentation for the
                    sale and purchase. Clause 9 of the MOU also stated that all
                    disputes arising out of or in connection with the MOU should
                    be resolved by way of arbitration, yet the plaintiff chose
                    to commence this suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendants also argued
                    that even if the plaintiff could show its entitlement to
                    elect not to proceed with the completion of the purchase,
                    based on the conditions precedent listed in Clause 4.1 of
                    the SPA not being fulfilled, there was still nothing in the
                    SPA that provided for a refund of the $1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conditions Precedent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff based its
                    right to rescind the SPA on the fact that sometime in
                    February or March 2010, the Company had failed to make
                    payment in time for the supply of CNG from GSPL, which
                    eventually caused GSPL to terminate the existing GRA and
                    replace it with interim supply arrangements. In response the
                    defendants submitted that the 4 clauses relied on by the
                    plaintiff, namely Clause 4.1 (a), (h), (m) and (n), were not
                    triggered for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     Upon receiving
                        the letter dated 23 March 2010 from GSPL stating
                        that the GRA was going to be terminated, the Company
                        paid up all the outstanding sums owed within the
                        stipulated 7 days, further providing a US$200,000
                        deposit. Subsequently, the interim supply arrangements
                        were confirmed via a letter dated 5 April
                        2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Given that the MOU was only entered
                        on 16 April 2010, any terminated GRA prior to the
                        5 April 2010 letter should not be relevant to the
                        plaintiff under the SPA. Accordingly there was no
                        contractual obligation on the defendants’ part to
                        have in place terms of the old GRAs for the purpose of
                        completion contemplated by the SPA;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     The defendants were as open with the plaintiff as
                        they could be legally and had no intention of hiding
                        anything. GSPL objected to disclosing the letter of
                        termination of the previous GRA and subsequent court
                        applications by the plaintiff for its disclosure were
                        also disallowed. Further, the delay in disclosing the
                        5 April 2010 letter containing the interim supply
                        arrangements was due to GSPL’s instructions that a
                        written undertaking be procured from the plaintiff
                        first.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     In relation to the plaintiff’s
                        claim under Clause 4.1 (h) of the SPA, the existence of
                        the 5 April 2010 letter stating the interim
                        arrangements and the events which took place in July and
                        August 2010 were sufficient to show that all the
                        necessary consents and approvals from GSPL to ensure the
                        continuation of CNG supply to the Company were obtained
                        due to the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       Where
                            the plaintiff was buying 100% of the shares, legally
                            there would be no change of entity involved, as far
                            as the 5 April 2010 letter was concerned, since
                            the Company would still be a party to that letter
                            even after the plaintiff takes over. Hence no
                            consent or approval would be necessary from
                            GSPL;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       There were no prohibitions
                            in the 5 April 2010 letter to stop the
                            defendants from selling all the shares in the
                            Company and neither was there any mention of
                            termination or a contractual end date. Arguably the
                            arrangements were quite permanent despite the term
                            “interim” being
                        used;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Even if GSPL’s
                            consent was necessary, the parties’
                            correspondence from 15 July 2010 to
                            27 August 2010 showed such consent. Moreover,
                            the fact that GSPL wanted to meet the plaintiff to
                            work out a new GRA showed its consent to continue
                            supplying CNG after the ownership change of the
                            Company. Since the plaintiff refused to meet GSPL,
                            the blame could not fall on the
                        defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_d-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The SPA did not require the
                            defendants to procure a new GRA, much less one that
                            was on terms satisfactory to the plaintiff. The SPA
                            requirement for “continuation of CNG
                            supply” is different from
                            “continuity” which connotes a longer
                            and uninterrupted supply of gas;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       There was nothing in
                            evidence that would have caused the plaintiff to
                            think that GSPL would not consent to a continuation
                            of the gas supply till after the date of
                            completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_e"></a>(e)     In relation to the
                        plaintiff’s claim under Clause 4.1(a) that the
                        plaintiff must be satisfied with the results of the due
                        diligence, even though the defendants admitted that
                        there may be some ambiguity in reading Clauses 10 and 11
                        of the 5 April 2010 letter together, the plaintiff
                        failed to use the opportunity to clarify the meaning
                        directly with GSPL when it was offered the meeting. The
                        plaintiff’s refusal to meet GSPL was unreasonable
                        and hence it had no objective basis for taking the
                        position that it was not satisfied with the results of
                        the due diligence exercise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_f"></a>(f)     Since the interim
                        arrangements contained in the 5 April 2010 letter
                        were still subsisting and in full force at the date when
                        the MOU was executed and those arrangements were not
                        capable of being terminated by reason of the purchase of
                        the Sale Shares, arguably the plaintiff’s claim
                        under Clause 4.1 (m) must fail too;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_g"></a>(g)     Given the subsisting interim arrangements and the
                        absence of any further notice or other indication from
                        GSPL that those arrangements would be terminated or
                        modified, the plaintiff did not have a claim under
                        Clause 4.1 (n) either.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Not a case of total failure of
                consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Firstly, since the $1m was
                    paid as a “good faith deposit”, it must
                    necessarily have been capable of being forfeited once the
                    contract was terminated by the depositor’s breach.
                    This is due to the fact that deposits are inherently
                    forfeitable and whether there exists a right to its return
                    depends on the conditions of the contract (See <em>Howe v Smith</em> (1884) 27 Ch D 89 at
                    97-98). Merely calling the sum paid a
                    “deposit” did not entitle the plaintiff to an
                    automatic right of refund upon the failure to complete the
                    contract. Since the SPA did not expressly provide for a
                    refund, the plaintiff must show that it is entitled to such
                    a refund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Also, there was no total
                    failure of consideration as the defendants had performed
                    their contractual duties by, among other things, furnishing
                    voluminous documents, many of which were confidential and
                    sensitive in nature, in response to the plaintiff’s
                    due diligence exercise. Moreover, considering the fact that
                    the parties were rivals in the same business, the revelation
                    of internal management accounts and other confidential legal
                    documents meant that the plaintiff would now know how the
                    defendants ran their business and how much their cost
                    centres incurred. Such an advantage to the plaintiff and its
                    corresponding detriment to the defendants could not be
                    ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The real reason for the plaintiff’s
                election not to complete</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendants further
                    submitted that the real reason for the plaintiff’s
                    non-completion of the SPA was its inability to secure
                    sufficient financing<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In fact,
                    subsequent to the execution of the SPA, the plaintiff found
                    other means of expanding its CNG business and hence decided
                    not to proceed with the purchase of the Sale
                        Shares<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Confidentiality with regards to the
                Company’s tenant and Urban Redevelopment
                Authority(“URA”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendants submitted
                    that pursuant to Clause 8 of the SPA, there were
                    confidentiality obligations owed between the parties and
                    that such were breached by the plaintiff. The plaintiff
                    approached the Company’s tenant, Kar Engineering Pte
                    Ltd (“Kar Engineering”), at the gas refueling
                    station at Serangoon North Ave 5 and informed the tenant of
                    the impending sale and purchase of the Company, asking it to
                    move elsewhere. In so doing, the plaintiff caused loss and
                    damages to the defendants. Additionally, the defendants
                    submitted that the same confidentiality obligations in
                    Clause 8 of the SPA were breached by the plaintiff’s
                    exchange of letters with the URA as the correspondence had
                    nothing to do with the due diligence exercise. The URA
                    confirmed via letter that CWM Consulting Engineers had
                    submitted redevelopment plans for the station and that
                    clearly went beyond an exercise to test if the URA would
                    grant permission for redevelopment. It was a submission for
                    reconstruction and it took place long before the scheduled
                    completion date of 31 July 2010 without the approval of
                    the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff replied that
                    there had been a tripartite agreement between Kar
                    Engineering, the plaintiff and the defendants, under which
                    all parties were aware of the fact that the plaintiff was
                    going to buy over the Company. There could not therefore be
                    any breach of confidentiality. Further, the inquiry sent to
                    the URA was only about whether some alterations could be
                    made and that was part of the due diligence
                exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Refusal to consent to repair works and conversion
                of trailers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     After the SPA was
                    executed, the defendants wanted to carry out repairs to a
                    component of the Company’s CNG system called the
                    “HPU”. Pursuant to Clause 7 of the SPA, they
                    had to obtain the written consent of the plaintiff but the
                    plaintiff withheld such consent. As such, the repairs could
                    only take place after the plaintiff’s alleged
                    rescission of the SPA which resulted in more loss and
                    damages as it caused a loss in productivity in the CNG
                    supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Additionally, after the
                    SPA was executed, the defendants wanted to carry out a
                    conversion of two of the Company’s trailers to
                    facilitate working with the “NeoGas System” so
                    that it could go into 24-hour operation. Once again, the
                    plaintiff refused to give the written consent required
                    pursuant to Clause 7 of the SPA, resulting in loss and
                    damages to the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff replied that
                    the defendants were duty-bound under Clause 7.1 of the SPA
                    to carry on their business as per normal and carrying out
                    repairs to equipment was part of that business. There was
                    therefore no need for its consent to be
                obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">S$20,000 cancellation fee from United Overseas
                Bank (“UOB”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defendants were under
                    an obligation to redeem all their loans from the
                    Company’s bank, UOB, as part of the sale and purchase
                    exercise and the necessary notification for the redemption
                    of loan was given to UOB accordingly. The plaintiff’s
                    subsequent refusal to complete the sale and purchase
                    resulted in the defendants having to reinstate the bank
                    loans and having to pay a reinstatement fee of S$20,000 to
                    UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In deciding whether the
                    $1m deposit was refundable or not, it is important to first
                    determine whether the agreement set out in the MOU continued
                    to be binding upon the parties even after the SPA was
                    executed. Based on Clause 3.5 of the MOU, it was clear that
                    the deposit was refundable:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.5    If the Purchaser is allowed,
                            under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement,
                            not to complete the sale and purchase of shares and
                            elects not to complete, the Deposit shall be
                            refunded by thee Vendors to the Purchasers within
                            seven (7) days of such election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     While the MOU stated in
                    Clause 7 that it “shall be superseded to the extent
                    that any definitive agreement is made between the Vendors
                    and the Purchaser in relation to the subject matter
                    herein” and Recital (D) stated that “the
                    parties intend to enter into this MOU in order to govern
                    their relationship prior to the execution of the definitive
                    documentation for the sale and purchase of the
                    Shares”, the MOU was not the last word on this
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The SPA itself
                    contemplated other related agreements in Clause 10.2, the
                    ‘Entire Agreement Clause’, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.2  This Agreement (together with
                            any documents <em>referred to

                            by the Parties in connection herewith) <em>constitutes the whole

                            and supersedes any previous agreements or
                            arrangements between them relating to the subject

                            variations hereof shall be effective unless made in
                            writing signed by duly authorized representatives of
                            the Parties. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The SPA specifically
                    referred to the MOU at Recital D:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding dated
                            16<sup>th</sup> April 2010 entered
                        into between the Parties, the Purchaser has paid the
                        Vendors a good faith deposit of S$1,000,000 that will be
                        applied towards the purchase price for the Sale
                        Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was also mentioned in
                    Clause 3.1 of the SPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.1    The Consideration for the sale of the Sale Shares
                            shall be the sum of S$25,000,000 payable by the
                            Purchaser to the Vendors as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the sum of S$1,000,000
                                being the good faith deposit (the
                                “Deposit”) paid pursuant to the
                                terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated
                                16 April 2010 between the Parties;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Hence, on the face of
                    Clause 10.2 of the SPA, it was clear that the MOU, being one
                    of the documents referred to in the SPA, constituted part of
                    the whole agreement between the parties. This did not
                    contradict Clause 7 of the MOU, which simply meant that if
                    and when inconsistencies arose between the SPA and the MOU,
                    it would be the SPA that prevailed. Clause 7 should not be
                    read, as the defendants argued, to mean that the MOU would
                    be automatically and completely extinguished upon the
                    signing of the SPA. That would be an unreasonably
                    restrictive and narrow reading in the light of the SPA
                    itself mentioning the MOU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     This reading is consistent
                    with cases like <em>D’Oz International
                        Pte Ltd v PSB Corp Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 88,
                    where Chan Sek Keong CJ held that a term sheet and a
                    preliminary agreement which were referred to in a franchise
                    agreement formed part of the parties’ legal agreement
                    and that they should have been given legal effect. This was
                    so even though there was a similar “entire, full and
                    complete” agreement clause in the franchise
                    agreement. Also, in <em>Ng Giap Hon v
                        Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and other</em> [2009]
                    SGCA 19, the Court of Appeal stated that it was “not
                    prepared to state that an entire agreement clause can never
                    exclude the implication of terms into a contract”,
                    further adding that “for an entire agreement clause
                    to have this effect, it would need to express such effect in
                    clear and unambiguous language”. On that point, where
                    the SPA is silent on whether or not the deposit is
                    refundable, Clause 10.2 of the SPA cannot be read to exclude
                    the MOU entirely when the MOU spelt out the parties’
                    agreement on an issue not mentioned in the SPA and which
                    issue is still alive and not spent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior
                        Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGCA
                    27, a permissive stance was taken by the Court of Appeal
                    towards extrinsic evidence which can explain and illuminate
                    written words of an agreement so that the court can better
                    give effect to the intention of the parties. Similarly, in
                        <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor
                        </em><em>Peow Victor and
                        others</em> [2007] SGCA 22, it was held that
                    “the courts will strive to give effect to the
                    parties’ expressed intent and their legitimate
                    expectations. The courts seek to honour the legitimate
                    expectations that the parties hold when they enter into a
                    contract.” In the present case, the evidence of the
                    parties’ negotiations leading to the execution of the
                    MOU showed that the $1m was meant to be a refundable
                        deposit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and to decide
                    otherwise by excluding the MOU would certainly defeat the
                    parties’ legitimate expectations. It was therefore
                    from both the expressed intention and the negotiations that
                    the MOU was indeed still in force and binding upon the
                    parties at least in so far as the deposit was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Having decided the issue
                    of whether the MOU was in force or not, I now consider
                    “if the Purchaser (was) allowed, under the terms of
                    the Sale and Purchase Agreement, not to complete the sale
                    and purchase of shares” (Clause 3.5 of the MOU) in
                    order to determine if a refund should be made by the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The wording of Clause 4.1
                    (h) placed the onus on “the Vendors”, that is,
                    the defendants collectively, to “ensure the
                    continuation of the supply of compressed natural gas to the
                    CNG Stations after the Completion Date notwithstanding the
                    transaction contemplated herein”. It was plain that
                    the defendants had failed to do this and the plaintiff was
                    accordingly entitled to invoke Clause 4.3 and elect
                    non-completion. The fact that plaintiff had been given
                    opportunities to meet GSPL in order to negotiate further did
                    not detract from the defendants’ duty. There was no
                    doubt that the plaintiff had put a high premium on making
                    sure that the CNG supply would carry on after the takeover
                    and the defendants, despite being cognizant of that, did not
                    discharge the burden of producing a GRA with GSPL to ensure
                    the continuation of the supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The defendants’
                    contention that the interim arrangements put in place by the
                    5 April 2010 letter from GSPL were more than sufficient
                    to satisfy the continuation requirements was not acceptable.
                    Clause 11 of that letter shows why the interim arrangements
                    were cold comfort for the plaintiff. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Termination: Subject to
                            paragraph 10 hereinabove, GSPL may in its sole and
                            absolute discretion and for whatever reason,
                            terminate this Letter upon giving SMART at least
                            three (3) days’ notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With the very real
                    possibility of GSPL terminating the supply at will, the
                    interim arrangements fell far short of giving any assurance
                    of having a continuation of the supply of CNG. The inability
                    to have any confidence in the continuation of the supply of
                    CNG from the dominant CNG wholesaler in Singapore would
                    defeat the very purpose of buying the two CNG stations and
                    that would surely give the plaintiff the right not to
                    complete the sale. The defendants’ contention that the
                    fault lay with the plaintiff refusing to meet directly with
                    GSPL to clarify the meaning of ambiguous clauses and to
                    negotiate a new GRA shifted their obligation of ensuring the
                    continuation of supply of CNG to one of merely providing an
                    opportunity to the plaintiff of ensuring a continuation of
                    the supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The first two heads of the
                    defendants’ counterclaim can stand whether or not the
                    plaintiff succeeds in its claim whereas the third head of
                    the counterclaim would automatically fall if the
                    plaintiff’s claim succeeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The first head of the
                    counterclaim fails as the plaintiff’s actions were
                    within the scope of conducting a reasonable due diligence
                    exercise. The plaintiff therefore did not breach Clause 8.2
                    of the SPA. Given that Kar Engineering would eventually be
                    the plaintiff’s tenant if the agreement had been
                    completed, contacting Kar Engineering would certainly have
                    been a reasonable part of the plaintiff’s due
                    diligence exercise. The same conclusion applies to the
                    disclosure to the URA as the correspondence was nothing more
                    than part of the plaintiff’s due diligence in making
                    sure that their future plans for the stations would be
                    viable. In any event, I do not see what damages could have
                    been suffered by the defendants by the disclosure of an
                    impending sale to a public authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The second head of the
                    counterclaim concerns whether Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the SPA
                    required the plaintiff to obtain the defendants’
                    consent for repairs work to be done on the HPU and for the
                    conversion of trailers. While it was disputed by the parties
                    whether consent was even sought or not, I do not think that
                    consent was required if the work was indeed repair work,
                    that is, work that would be required in order for the
                    defendants to “carry out business only in the
                    ordinary course consistent with past practices” as
                    prescribed in Clause 7.1. Such a move would not “make
                    any change in the nature, scope or organization of its
                    business or dispose of the whole of its undertaking or
                    property…” (Clause 7.2 (b)) and hence would
                    not require the plaintiff’s written consent. Moreover,
                    in the light of the impending sale, it was hard to see why
                    the defendants would engage in anything more than repair and
                    maintenance works that would allow them to continue running
                    the business in the ordinary course. I therefore dismiss
                    this head of the counterclaim too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The last head of the
                    counterclaim regarding the $20,000 reinstatement fee charged
                    by UOB is contingent on my ruling on the plaintiff’s
                    claim. As the plaintiff has succeeded in its claim, this
                    last head of the counterclaim fails since the plaintiff was
                    not at fault in not completing the sale and
                purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In summary, the plaintiff
                    succeeds in its claim against the defendants for the refund
                    of the $1m good faith deposit paid pursuant to the MOU.
                    Notwithstanding the fact that the statement of claim pleaded
                    a claim of $500,000 against each defendant, the MOU and the
                    SPA treat both defendants collectively as
                    “vendors” and Clause 3.5 of the MOU provides
                    for the deposit of $1m to be refunded by the said
                    “vendors”, i.e. both defendants jointly. I
                    also award the plaintiff interest on the said $1m at 5.33%
                    per annum from the date of writ until judgment, as pleaded,
                    and thereafter interest at the same rate until payment. The
                    defendants’ counterclaim is dismissed in its entirety.
                    The defendants are to pay the plaintiff the costs of the
                    claim and the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Both defendants have
                    appealed against this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I thank counsel for both
                    parties for having agreed to proceed with the trial by way
                    of a statement of agreed facts. It was a sensible move which
                    saved time and costs for everyone involved.</p>
