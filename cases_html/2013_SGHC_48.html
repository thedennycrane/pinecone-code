<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The dispute arises out of the administration of
                    the estate of the parties’ deceased mother, the late Mdm Fock Poh Kum
                    (“Mdm Fock”). It concerns the beneficial ownership of a two-storey
                    linked house with a land area of approximately 5,712 square feet or
                    531 square metres at 7 Robin Walk Singapore 258152 (the
                    “Property”), which is the subject of a trust deed. The disputing
                    parties are family members. The Plaintiffs, who are the executrixes and trustees
                    of Mdm Fock’s estate, claim that the Property is held on trust for
                    Mdm Fock’s estate. The Defendant, who is the brother of the Plaintiffs and
                    the legal owner of the Property, alleges that the trust deed is a sham and does
                    not mean what it says. Mdm Fock’s estate therefore is not the beneficial
                    owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Although the trial was relatively short with
                    just five witnesses from both sides, the dispute revolves around events which
                    took place over the course of four decades. The determination of the key issues,
                    in my view, turns on one’s interpretation of the factual matrix,
                    particularly the intention of the key family members at the material time and
                    the nature of the relationships between the family members. I have therefore
                    endeavoured to illustrate as much of the context as is relevant to the
                    ascertainment of the intention and knowledge of the key
                protagonists.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The family</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mdm Fock married Mr Chng Gim Cheng (“Mr
                    Chng”) in 1944. They have six children. The Defendant is the second
                    eldest, while the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiffs are the fourth and sixth child
                    respectively. Mr Chng passed away on 3 September 1988, while Mdm Fock passed
                    away more recently on 23 November 2009. The other three children are Chng Bee
                    Suan (“Bee Suan”), the eldest; Chng Eng Hwee, the third eldest;
                    and Chng Bee Choo, the fifth eldest. The Defendant’s wife, Augustine Chng
                    (“Augustine”), moved in and stayed with the family at the Property
                    when she married the Defendant in 1977.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Property was purchased for $260,000 and was
                    paid for in various tranches, as evidenced by receipts signed off by Mr Robert
                    Hsieh of Boswell, Hsieh &amp; Lim (“Mr Hsieh”), who was the
                    solicitor acting for Mr Chng. The last tranche was paid on 21 February 1974. The
                    transfer of the Property was executed and lodged on 23 February 1974, though the
                    Property was only registered in the Defendant’s sole name on 11 March
                    1974. It is not clear why there was this lapse of time of 16 days between the
                    execution and lodgement of the transfer and the registration of the Defendant as
                    the owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There are a total of three receipts. The first
                    receipt dated 9 January 1974 shows that Mr Chng paid $26,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was
                    the 10% deposit for the Property. Although Mr Hsieh sought the balance of the
                    purchase price and his costs from Mr Chng,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> two receipts dated 21
                    February 1974 show that the second and third tranches of approximately $112,000
                    and $131,000 respectively were paid for not by Mr Chng directly, but by the
                    Defendant and Far Eastern Bank respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Far Eastern Bank disbursed
                    the sum pursuant to an overdraft facility account under the Defendant’s
                    name, but for which Mr Chng was the guarantor.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant clarified that the $112,000 paid by him in the second tranche was a
                    combination of drawings on the overdraft facility at Far Eastern Bank and monies
                    given to him by Mr Chng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This is a noteworthy clarification as
                    the Defendant was only 24 years old when the Property was purchased. He had just
                    completed his National Service and was starting work at Mr Chng’s
                    trading business, Sumber Trading Company (“Sumber Trading”),
                    earning a monthly income of $800. The overdraft facility at Far Eastern Bank was
                    eventually cleared and the account was closed on 19 March 1984.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant claimed that he cleared his overdraft facility using funds provided by
                    his parents-in-law and Mr Chng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The entire family of eight stayed in a flat at
                    33-B Tiong Poh Road (the “Tiong Poh flat”) before they moved into
                    the Property in 1974. The Tiong Poh flat was fully paid for by Mr Chng, but was
                    registered in Mdm Fock’s name to protect it from Mr Chng’s potential
                    business creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> At the Property, Mr Chng and Mdm Fock
                    occupied the master bedroom, while the six children shared the other three
                    rooms. After the Defendant got married in 1977, he and Augustine stayed in the
                    Defendant’s room. Except for the Defendant, Mr Chng’s other five
                    children moved out of the Property when they got married. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was the last to move out in 1987.
                    When Mr Chng passed away, Mdm Fock continued to occupy the master
                        bedroom.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Trust Deed </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A trust deed was executed by the Defendant as
                    trustee on 23 February 1974 (the “Trust Deed”), even though the
                    Defendant was only registered as the owner of the Property 16 days later on 11
                    March 1974. However, it is significant to note that the Trust Deed was executed
                    on the same day that the transfer of the Property was executed and lodged on 23
                    February 1974. The Trust Deed, which was drafted and witnessed by Mr Hsieh,
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">WHEREAS the Trustee is the registered proprietor of all that land and
                        premises known as No. 7 Robin Walk, Singapore (hereinafter called
                        “the said property”) but the consideration for the said
                        property was provided by FOCK POH KUM of No. 33-B Tiong Poh Road, Singapore
                        and the said property was transferred to the said Trustee as trustee for the
                        said FOCK POH KUM as the trustee hereby acknowledges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">NOW THIS DEED WITNESSETH that the said CHNG ENG CHYE declares that he
                        holds the said property in trust for the said FOCK POH KUM according to the
                        nature and tenure thereof and hereby agrees that he will at the request and
                        cost of the said FOCK POH KUM make application to the Land Titles Registry
                        or other appropriate authority and execute and do all such documents acts
                        and things as may be necessary to procure the said property to be
                        transferred to and registered in the name of such person or otherwise dealt
                        with at such time and in such manner as the said FOCK POH KUM shall direct
                        or appoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IN WITNESS WHEREOF the said CHNG ENG CHYE has hereunto set his hand and
                        seal the day and year first above written.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In essence, the Trust Deed states that:
                    (a) the purchase price of the Property was provided by Mdm Fock; and
                    (b) the Property was transferred to the Defendant to be held on trust for
                    Mdm Fock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mdm Fock was not present when the Trust Deed was
                    executed. Interestingly, although Mr Hsieh’s bill of costs for the
                    execution of the Trust Deed reflected the Defendant as the client, the cover
                    letter enclosing the bill of costs was addressed to Mdm Fock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>
                    It is undisputed that the Trust Deed was handed over to Mdm Fock after it was
                    executed and was in her possession till her death in November
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Trust Deed was discovered by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff when she opened Mdm Fock’s
                    safe deposit box at United Overseas Bank (“UOB safe deposit box”)
                    on 17 December 2009. In addition to the original Trust Deed, the UOB safe
                    deposit box also contained, <em>inter alia</em>, Mdm
                    Fock’s original will (the “Will”), which was executed on 18
                    November 2002, a copy of the certificate of title to the Property, the original
                    bill of costs from Mr Hsieh, several pieces of jewellery which were tagged with
                    the names of the persons they were to be given to, and a certificate for over 1
                    million shares in Sumber Holdings Private Limited (“Sumber

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Key events after Mdm Fock’s death</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The 31 January 2010 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 10 January 2010, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff distributed copies of the Will to
                    the family. On 31 January 2010, there was a meeting at the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff’s home to discuss the
                    administration of Mdm Fock’s estate. All six children were present. The
                    Plaintiffs informed everyone of the Trust Deed at this meeting. At this point,
                    there is a divergence of views as to what transpired. According to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, the Defendant said that he had
                    signed the Trust Deed and that it remained valid. When the
                        1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff stated that the Property had to be
                    included in the Schedule of Assets as part of Mdm Fock’s estate, the
                    Defendant purportedly replied that the Plaintiffs could “go
                        ahead”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant’s version, however, was that he had maintained that he was the
                    rightful owner of the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The 19 April 2010 letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 19 April 2010, the Defendant wrote a letter
                    to the Plaintiffs marked “Without Prejudice” (“the 19 April
                    2010 Letter”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    In the letter, he disagreed that he was holding the Property on trust for Mdm
                    Fock (or her estate). The Defendant also asserted that “the money to
                    purchase the Property came from [him]”, and that the Trust Deed was
                    executed “simply to give [Mdm Fock] peace of mind so that she could live
                    in the Property without fear of being evicted one day”. The Plaintiffs
                    responded with a letter on 4 May 2010 and proposed a meeting to “address
                    and resolve the issues at hand”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   The 24 May 2010 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A meeting took place on 24 May 2010 at the
                    Defendant’s office at Sumber Holdings (“the 24 May 2010
                    Meeting”). It was attended by Bee Suan, the Plaintiffs, the Defendant,
                    and the Defendant’s son, William Chng. The conversation at the meeting was
                    recorded on tape. From the transcript of the recording, the Defendant stated
                    that it was Mr Chng who had paid for the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Defendant also
                    repeated that the Trust Deed had been executed to give Mdm Fock the peace of
                    mind that she would not be evicted from the Property, and he said that it was
                    Mdm Fock who had wanted the Trust Deed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 8 July 2010, the Plaintiffs’
                    solicitors wrote to the Defendant for the return of the Property to Mdm
                    Fock’s estate. The Defendant did not comply and the Plaintiffs commenced
                    the present proceedings on 24 November 2011 seeking, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a declaration that the Property is held on trust by the
                    Defendant for the Plaintiffs as the executrixes and trustees of Mdm Fock’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As the Plaintiffs’ starting point is
                    premised simply on the existence of the Trust Deed and its terms, it will be
                    more useful in the present case to first set out the salient features of the
                    Defendant’s case as to why the Property belongs to the Defendant,
                    notwithstanding the Trust Deed, before turning to the Plaintiffs’
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendant’s case is multi-faceted.
                    The thrust of his case is that the Trust Deed was a sham and was not intended to
                    mean what it said (the “Sham Argument”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Cavinder Bull
                    SC (“Mr Bull”), conceded that if the Trust Deed was not a sham,
                    the Property would be held on trust by the Defendant for Mdm Fock’s
                    estate, subject to any estoppel which might operate to prevent Mdm Fock’s
                    estate from asserting beneficial ownership over the Property as Mdm Fock had
                    allowed the Defendant to expend considerable costs on the maintenance, upkeep
                    and renovation of the Property (the “Estoppel
                Argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The Sham Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In support of the Sham Argument, Mr Bull made
                    the following points.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The purpose of the Trust Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, the only purpose of the Trust Deed was
                    to protect the Property from creditors. The Defendant’s case on this
                    aspect is somewhat unclear. Initially, the focus appeared to be on Mr
                    Chng’s intention. Hence, Mr Bull argued that Mr Chng had to choose someone
                    whom both he and the Defendant could trust to repose the beneficial interest in
                    the Property in for the purposes of protecting the Property from creditors, and
                    Mdm Fock was that trustworthy someone.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It was this premise, coupled with Mr
                    Chng’s instruction to Mr Hsieh that the purchaser was the Defendant, which
                    prompted Mr Hsieh to suggest using the Trust Deed with the Defendant as the
                    legal owner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Mr Bull then posed the
                    following hypothesis. If Mr Chng had wanted Mdm Fock to have the Property, he
                    could easily have registered the Property in her name, just as he had registered
                    the Tiong Poh flat in her name to protect the latter property from creditors.
                    Thus, if Mr Chng had simply wanted to protect the Property from creditors
                    without at the same time giving the entire interest in the Property to the
                    Defendant, he could have similarly registered the Property in Mdm Fock’s
                    name. The fact that he had not done so, when he could easily have done so,
                    suggested that the purpose of the Trust Deed was <em>not</em> to gift the Property to Mdm Fock.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Up to this point, the focus was squarely on Mr
                    Chng’s intention and knowledge. Subsequently, however, Mr Bull asserted
                    that the Defendant was the sole settlor and trustee of the alleged trust, and
                    “therefore the only relevant intention is the Defendant’s
                    intention”. This argument is briefer: since the Defendant did not have
                    any intention to declare a trust in favour of Mdm Fock, the Trust Deed was a
                        sham.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Purchase price of the Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Second, Mr Bull pointed out an inconsistency
                    in the wording of the Trust Deed. Apart from the initial deposit of $26,000
                    which was paid for by Mr Chng, the remainder of the purchase price of the
                    Property came from the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    Thus, contrary to the express wording of the Trust Deed, no part of the purchase
                    price of the Property came from Mdm Fock. Mdm Fock also never paid for the
                    maintenance and upkeep of the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Mdm Fock’s subsequent conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Third, Mr Bull submitted that Mdm Fock’s
                    own conduct was consistent with the Defendant’s position that the Trust
                    Deed was a sham. First, the Property was not named as one of Mdm Fock’s
                    assets in her Will, even though it would have been her most valuable asset.
                    Second, Augustine stated that when Mdm Fock passed the certificate of title to
                    the Property to her in 2002, Mdm Fock told her that the Property belonged to the
                    Defendant and that the Defendant should therefore keep the
                        certificate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The Defendant was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Fourth, Mr Bull argued that Mr Chng favoured
                    the Defendant and wanted the latter to take over the family business. Thus, Mr
                    Chng gave the Defendant the Property – which was to be the
                    Defendant’s matrimonial home<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> –
                    in return for the Defendant agreeing not to pursue further studies and to stay
                    in Singapore and start learning the ropes of the family business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Alternatively, Mr Chng wanted to help the
                    Defendant purchase the Property simply as a parent helping his
                        child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Whatever funds Mr Chng provided
                    the Defendant with for the purchase of the Property were obviously Mr
                    Chng’s gifts to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Mr Bull submitted that there was no evidence
                    that Mr Chng wanted to make a gift of the Property to Mdm Fock, or to give Mdm
                    Fock the funds to purchase the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The Estoppel Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Defendant’s case for an estoppel is
                    that Mdm Fock had promised, represented or conducted herself in such a manner
                    that it led the Defendant to believe that he was the beneficial owner of the
                    Property. Consequently, the Defendant had detrimentally relied on Mdm
                    Fock’s promise, representation or conduct by paying for most of the
                    expenses relating to the upkeep of the Property, including fire insurance and
                    property tax, while none of the other children had contributed to any of the
                    household expenses. Mdm Fock, too, had not paid for any of the maintenance or
                    upkeep of the Property despite having had the means to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, the Defendant had spent a
                    substantial sum on renovations when Mdm Fock was alive, and after she passed
                    away. At no point did either Mdm Fock or the Plaintiffs (after they discovered
                    the Trust Deed) prevent the Defendant from spending money on the
                        renovations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Plaintiffs’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Plaintiffs’ positive case is simple.
                    It is founded on the existence of the Trust Deed and the words contained in it,
                    which, they claim, unambiguously provide that the Defendant holds the Property
                    on trust for Mdm Fock’s estate. Invariably, the crux of the
                    Plaintiffs’ case centred on the submission that the Trust Deed was not a
                    sham. According to the Plaintiffs, the Trust Deed was executed to enable Mdm
                    Fock to beneficially own the Property so that the family would be taken care of
                    and so that the creditors of the family business could not take the Property
                    should the business run into financial difficulties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Defendant therefore did not
                    beneficially own the Property. The Plaintiffs’ alternative argument is
                    that even if the Trust Deed was for a sham purpose, the Defendant cannot rely on
                    his sham purpose to invalidate the Trust Deed (the “Illegality
                    Argument”). Lastly, the Plaintiffs deny that they are estopped from
                    asserting beneficial interest in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The Sham Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Counsel for the Plaintiffs, Mr Alvin Yeo SC
                    (“Mr Yeo”), accepted that the Defendant was both the settlor and
                    the trustee. Consequently, he also accepted that it was the Defendant’s
                    intention behind the constitution of the trust that mattered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> In this respect, the
                    Plaintiffs’ and the Defendant’s respective cases are on common
                    ground. Mr Yeo, however, argued that Mr Chng’s intention was more
                    important from an “evidential point of view” as he was “the
                    soul and spirit behind the purchase of the Property (having paid the entire
                    purchase price) and the execution of the Trust Deed”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> It appears that the Plaintiffs’ case
                    is that both the intention of Mr Chng and that of the Defendant were identical
                    inasmuch as Mr Chng intended the Defendant to hold the Property on trust for Mdm
                    Fock and the Defendant intended likewise – whether out of filial piety,
                    obedience or some other reason – when he executed the Trust
                Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Mr Chng’s intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On Mr Chng’s intention, Mr Yeo argued
                    that Mr Chng could not have intended his 24-year-old son to beneficially own the
                    Property in 1974 when the Property was a substantial asset of the family,
                    especially when Mr Chng, Mdm Fock and the remaining five children who were
                    between 17 and 26 years old then were still staying with the family. First, the
                    Defendant had just completed National Service in 1974. Second, Mr Chng was not
                    the kind who favoured sons over daughters such that he would have intended to
                    reward the Defendant in 1974 with the Property over all his other
                        children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Third, Mr Chng also could not
                    have intended to compensate the Defendant for agreeing not to pursue further
                    studies overseas; the Defendant did not find studying easy and had done poorly
                    in his various school examinations and courses up till then.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Thus, Mr Yeo submitted that Mr Chng wanted Mdm
                    Fock to own the Property beneficially so that the family would be taken care of
                        <em>and</em> so that the creditors of Mr Chng’s
                    sole proprietorship could not take the Property should the business
                        fail.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> It is pertinent to note that the latter
                    purpose is incidentally also an integral aspect of the Defendant’s Sham
                    Argument. Mr Yeo suggested that it was for these reasons that Mr Chng had
                    previously registered the Tiong Poh flat in Mdm Fock’s name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Mr Yeo proffered that the reason why Mr
                    Chng had not simply registered Mdm Fock as the legal owner of the Property was
                    because Mr Chng had foreseen the need for the Defendant to sign guarantees on
                    behalf of the family business and it would have been easier for the Defendant to
                    provide a guarantee if he held the Property under his name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Defendant’s intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Yeo pointed out that the Defendant had
                    admitted that: (a) Mr Hsieh had explained to him the true effect of the
                    Trust Deed, <em>ie</em>, that the beneficial ownership of
                    the Property would vest in Mdm Fock; (b) he understood Mr Hsieh’s
                    explanation; and (c) he had signed the Trust Deed willingly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> At no time had Mr Hsieh said that the Trust
                    Deed would have no effect except when the Defendant chose to use it against his
                    creditors. Based on these circumstances, Mr Yeo argued that the Defendant had
                    intended the beneficial interest in the Property to vest in Mdm
                Fock.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Mdm Fock’s subsequent conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Although Mr Yeo stressed that Mdm Fock’s
                    conduct as a beneficiary of the trust was not determinative of the validity of
                    the Trust Deed, he submitted that her conduct was in any event consistent with
                    the Trust Deed as having created a trust. First, Mdm Fock was in possession of
                    the Trust Deed until after she passed away, when it was discovered in her UOB
                    safe deposit box in 2009. If the Trust Deed had merely been a sham to fend off
                    potential creditors, it would have been logical for the Defendant to hold on to
                    the Trust Deed. Second, when asked why he had not kept the Trust Deed, the
                    Defendant could only reply that he had not thought of it. Third, the Defendant
                    never asked for the Trust Deed back from Mdm Fock in the 1980s even though by
                    that time, the relationship between the Defendant and Mdm Fock had worsened.
                    Fourth, the Plaintiffs testified that Mdm Fock had told them on separate
                    occasions that she was the owner of the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The Illegality Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The substance of this argument is that the
                    Defendant cannot fashion a trust for the purpose of defrauding his potential
                    future creditors only to subsequently rely on that same fraudulent purpose to
                    revoke the trust. This is so whether the fraudulent purpose is ultimately
                    carried out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   The Estoppel Argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Lastly, Mr Yeo submitted that the Defendant
                    could not rely on any form of estoppel. First, the alleged promise,
                    representation or conduct of Mdm Fock relied upon by the Defendant to found an
                    estoppel was equivocal at best.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Second and more importantly,
                    the Defendant could not have been induced by any promise, representation or
                    conduct which Mdm Fock was alleged to have given. This was because the Estoppel
                    Argument was an alternative argument that was premised on the Trust Deed being
                    valid, <em>ie</em>, that the beneficial interest in the
                    Property belonged to Mdm Fock. The Defendant therefore would have known of Mdm
                    Fock’s beneficial interest and could not have been induced by Mdm
                    Fock’s representation, promise or conduct to the effect that he was the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The parties’ submissions reveal three
                    major issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Trust Deed was a sham,
                        and if so, what are the consequences of a sham trust;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the Trust Deed was a sham, whether
                        the Defendant can nevertheless rely on the sham purpose to invalidate the
                        Trust Deed; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     if the Trust Deed was not a sham, whether the Plaintiffs are estopped from
                        asserting that Mdm Fock’s estate is the beneficial owner of the
                        Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidential considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Witnesses’ testimonies</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Intention and knowledge of Mr Chng and Mdm Fock</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is common ground that how Mr Chng and Mdm
                    Fock acted, and what they intended or knew at the material time in 1974 (when
                    the Property was purchased and the Trust Deed executed) are key to the dispute.
                    However, I am somewhat handicapped in my assessment of the factual matrix with
                    respect to the intention and knowledge of the two key protagonists as both have
                    since passed away. While both sides’ witnesses – which include the
                    Defendant and the Plaintiffs – have given evidence on what Mr Chng and Mdm
                    Fock had apparently told or said to them, I am extremely cautious in treating
                    the generally self-serving evidence as proof of Mr Chng’s and Mdm
                    Fock’s intention and knowledge at the material time. A testimony by a
                    witness who claims to have firsthand knowledge of specific events and
                    conversations that took place only gives evidence of the fact that such events
                    did take place and of what was in fact said by various parties during those
                    conversations. A third party cannot purport to reveal the <em>actual</em> and <em>true</em> intention and
                    knowledge of Mr Chng or Mdm Fock. If Mr Chng and Mdm Fock during those
                    conversations had disclosed what was their intention or knowledge during a
                    particular conversation which was in fact heard by a witness, then the witness
                    can do no more than give evidence of what Mr Chng or Mdm Fock had in fact said
                    or disclosed (to the witness) as their intention or knowledge, and no more than
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Furthermore, the only surviving witness to the
                    various events and conversations in 1974 (assuming all of those did take place)
                    is the Defendant. Mr Chng, Mdm Fock and Mr Hsieh, who are the only other proper
                    contradictors or affirmers of some of the key events and conversations which are
                    said to have taken place in 1974, are no longer able to give evidence. In these
                    circumstances, the court should not simply accept the Defendant’s evidence
                    on what had transpired in 1974 at face value. This is not to say that the
                    Defendant should not be believed from the outset. Whatever evidence adduced by
                    the Defendant as to what was told or said to him by Mr Chng and Mdm Fock, which
                    might reveal what could have been the intention and knowledge of Mr Chng and Mdm
                    Fock, must be assessed in the light of and tested against all the circumstances
                    subsisting at the relevant time, including the available documentary evidence
                    and good common sense. As Lord Blackburn once said, “the weight of
                    evidence depends on rules of common sense”: <em>Lord
                        Advocate v Blantyre</em> (1879) 4 App Cas 770
                at 792.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The respective witnesses’ credibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As both sides have alleged that the other
                    party’s evidence is unreliable and untruthful, it is necessary for me to
                    clarify how I perceived the respective parties’ credibility in the course
                    of their oral testimonies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I found the Defendant to be generally evasive
                    and shifty in his evidence. Four instances stand out, although there are other
                    examples.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, at the 24 May 2010 Meeting, where,
                        <em>inter alios</em>, the Plaintiffs were present, the
                    Defendant said that it was Mdm Fock who wanted to have a trust deed, and the
                    Trust Deed was accordingly executed to give her the peace of mind that she would
                    not be evicted from the Property. This seems to suggest that the idea of having
                    a trust deed originated from Mdm Fock. However, in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief, the Defendant stated that it was Mr Chng who first suggested
                    that the Defendant “create a document which could be shown to any future
                    creditors who might be after my [the Defendant’s] assets. The document he
                    [Mr Chng] suggested was a trust deed in favour of my late mother [Mdm
                        Fock].”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Further, the Defendant gave evidence
                    during cross-examination that the first time that the concept of a trust was
                    brought to Mr Chng’s attention was in a meeting with Mr Hsieh where the
                    Defendant was also present.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> It was Mr Hsieh,
                        <em>not</em> Mr Chng or Mdm Fock, who suggested the
                    concept of a trust to hold the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Second, at the trial, the Defendant tendered
                    the 19 April 2010 Letter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In that letter, he stated that
                    “the money to purchase the Property came from me and did not come from
                    Mother [Mdm Fock]. The trust deed was simply to give Mother peace of mind
                    so that she could continue to live in the Property without fear of being
                    evicted.” Ostensibly, the purpose of the Trust Deed stated by the
                    Defendant in his letter is false, as the Defendant later admitted that he knew
                    that the Trust Deed was intended to protect the Property from his potential
                    future creditors (see [65]–[67] below). Indeed, that is now his case for
                    this suit. The Defendant’s sole explanation for misleading the Plaintiffs
                    in the 19 April 2010 Letter was that he was “not really ready to disclose
                    why the [T]rust [D]eed was made”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Third, the Defendant provided numerous varied
                    explanations for the sources of his funds for the payment of the Property. He
                    oscillated between claiming that the monies came from him,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    monies were provided by Mr Chng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> For instance, in the
                    19 April 2010 Letter, the Defendant stated that the money for the Property came
                    from him and not Mdm Fock. Yet, at the 24 May 2010 Meeting, the
                    Defendant admitted in the presence of the Plaintiffs and others that the money
                    for the Property came from Mr Chng. By the end of the trial, it was plainly
                    evident to me that most, if not all, of the funds used to pay for the Property
                    either came directly or indirectly from or were arranged by Mr Chng. In my view,
                    it is unlikely, even with the passage of time, that the Defendant could have
                    been unclear or confused at any time about where the funds to purchase the
                    Property actually came from. The Defendant was in 1974 only a young man of 24
                    years of age who did not have any savings or the means to purchase the Property,
                    a large and expensive house by any measure. Without Mr Chng acting as the
                    guarantor, I doubt that the Defendant could have obtained any bank loan or
                    overdraft facilities in his name to finance the balance of the purchase price of
                    the Property. In my view, the Defendant could not possibly have had the
                    financial capacity to buy the Property, nor could he possibly have serviced and
                    eventually repaid the loan from Far Eastern Bank (see [5] above) without Mr
                    Chng’s financial support. I do not believe that the Defendant could have
                    forgotten that he was never the source of any funding to finance the purchase of
                    the Property. This kind of discrepancy is not about a particular date or year in
                    which a particular event took place, where a person is likely to remember
                    wrongly or be confused in his recollection of the date or year with the passage
                    of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Fourth, I find the Defendant’s evidence
                    over how he came into possession of $100,000 apparently gifted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> to him by one Mr Chng Pik Cong
                    (“CPC”) – whom the Defendant initially purported to be
                    “a relative of [his] in Indonesia”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> –
                    to pay for the Property to be incredible. According to the Defendant, when CPC
                    heard that the Defendant wanted to buy a house, he, apparently as a generous
                    relative, offered to sponsor $100,000 towards the Defendant’s
                        purchase:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     These examples highlight the shifts and
                    inconsistencies in the positions taken by the Defendant on a spectrum of issues
                    from the time the dispute arose to the conclusion of the trial. Coupled with the
                    fact that the Defendant was visibly evasive at various points during the
                    cross-examination, I am of the view that his evidence must be treated with a
                    healthy dose of suspicion. I am therefore more sceptical of the
                    Defendant’s evidence, particularly where it relates to what the Defendant
                    recalls as having been told to him by Mr Chng and Mdm Fock, including what they
                    might have said or disclosed to him as to their knowledge and
                intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The Plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Mr Bull, too, submitted that the Plaintiffs
                    were unreliable and untruthful witnesses. He referred to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff’s evidence on two joint
                    accounts which Mdm Fock had opened with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Plaintiff. At the trial, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff was
                    confident that the accounts were opened before 1987.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> However, upon Mr Bull’s request,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff checked and found out from the bank
                    that the joint accounts were opened in 1996. Mr Bull therefore urged the court
                    to treat the 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff’s evidence with
                    circumspection. I accept that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Plaintiff’s memory may be somewhat patchy with regards to her recollection
                    of the year in which the accounts were opened. However, given that these events
                    took place many years ago, it is unrealistic to expect the witness to have
                    perfect memory in recalling the date or the year when those events took place.
                    In any event, I did not find the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    Plaintiff’s evidence to be of much direct assistance in helping me to
                    arrive at my conclusions on the various issues. The Plaintiffs’
                    credibility did not have any material impact on the factors which I have relied
                    on in arriving at my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Trust Deed was a sham</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Was there even a valid trust? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Before delving into the crux of the Sham
                    Argument, I shall briefly deal with an associated argument canvassed by Mr Bull.
                    He suggested that on a strict construction of the words of the Trust Deed, there
                    could not have been any valid declaration of trust on 23 February 1974. This was
                    because the Defendant was not the registered proprietor of the Property on that
                    date; he only became the registered proprietor on 11 March 1974. He could not
                    have constituted a valid trust without first being the legal owner of the
                    Property. Mr Bull’s explanation for the “erroneous” Trust
                    Deed was that it was all intended to be a sham. In other words, the accuracy and
                    wording of the Trust Deed were inconsequential since the Trust Deed was intended
                    to be a sham. Mr Bull cited <em>Yeong Ah Chee v Lee Chong
                        Hai &amp; Anor</em> [1994] 2 MLJ 614, a decision of the Malaysian
                    Supreme Court, for the proposition that in order for a trust to be valid, the
                    settlor must vest the trust property in the trustee completely, both in law and
                    equity. Mr Bull also brought to my attention a High Court of Kuching decision,
                        <em>Cheu Kuok King v Jurudaya Construction Sdn Bhd</em>
                    [2007] 4 MLJ 720, where the court found at [20] that there was no valid trust
                    because the defendant settlor of the trust was not the registered owner of the
                    property at the time the trust deed was executed on 1 November 1991. The
                    memorandum of transfer was dated 31 October 1991, but was only registered on 2
                    November 1991. Mr Bull further contended that on the Plaintiffs’ case, if
                    it was indeed Mr Chng who had paid the purchase price of the Property, he would
                    have been the beneficial owner, not the Defendant. As Mr Chng never executed any
                    written instrument of transfer to dispose of his equitable interest, as required
                    by the then equivalent of s 7(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev
                    Ed), he retained beneficial interest in the Property at all times. The Defendant
                    therefore could not have purported to declare that he held the beneficial
                    interest on trust for Mdm Fock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mr Yeo responded first by arguing that the
                    Defendant had consistently taken the position, both in his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief as well as in his closing submissions, that he was the sole
                    settlor and trustee of the Trust Deed. The argument that the Defendant could not
                    have settled the trust because he did not have legal interest in the Property
                    was therefore an afterthought that should not be entertained. On the point that
                    the beneficial interest resided in Mr Chng and not the Defendant, Mr Yeo
                    submitted that although Mr Chng had paid for the Property, he had not intended
                    to obtain any beneficial interest for himself and had, through the procurement
                    of the Trust Deed, intended that Mdm Fock should own the Property beneficially.
                    The Property was to be transferred from the previous registered proprietors to
                    the Defendant absolutely, and the Defendant was to vest the beneficial interest
                    of the Property in Mdm Fock, which he did through the Trust Deed. Mr Chng had
                    not disposed of any beneficial interest in the Property; it was the Defendant
                    who had disposed of his beneficial interest in the Property to Mdm Fock. This
                    disposition was effected by the Trust Deed, which was in writing and thus did
                    not offend the then equivalent of s 7(2) of the Civil Law
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     While Mr Bull’s argument may appear
                    tenable at first blush, I do not think that this was an avenue which the
                    Defendant could legitimately pursue while at <em>the same
                        time</em> maintaining that the Trust Deed was a sham. For the Sham
                    Argument to have any traction, it must be predicated on the assumption that in
                    principle, the Trust Deed was capable of giving rise to a trust in the first
                    place, albeit one which ought not to be recognised retrospectively because of
                    the sham (see [50]–[57] below). The Defendant’s case was not that he
                    could not have declared the trust; it was that <em>notwithstanding</em> that he had declared a trust, it should not be
                    given effect as it was a sham. It was, of course, open to Mr Bull to argue that
                    the Sham Argument would apply as an alternative argument if the court found that
                    the Trust Deed could have given rise to a trust. However, that was not the
                    position taken in the Defendant’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, as well
                    as in his closing submissions, as Mr Yeo correctly pointed out. More
                    importantly, the Defendant’s case was not framed as such. In his
                    pleadings, the Defendant averred:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The Defendant avers that the alleged trust deed dated 23 February 1974
                        (the alleged trust deed) is not valid as the Defendant, at <em>the time of execution of the alleged trust deed (or at any
                            point before or thereafter)</em>, did not have the intention to
                        hold the Property in trust for Fock Poh Kum nor the intention to cause the
                        Property, at any point in time, to be transferred to and registered in the
                        name of such persons as Fock Poh Kum may have directed or appointed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The above already seems to suggest that the
                    Defendant accepted that he had executed the Trust Deed, albeit he did not have
                    any intention at the material time to hold the Property on trust for Mdm Fock,
                        <em>ie</em>, the Sham Argument. This is markedly
                    different from Mr Bull’s submission now that the Defendant could not have
                    constituted a trust without holding legal interest in the Property. In his
                    particularisation of the defence that the Trust Deed was a sham and therefore
                    invalid, the Defendant stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The late Mr Chng ... decided to help the Defendant
                            financially to purchase the Property ... Both the late Mr Chng ... and
                            the Defendant intended ... that the Defendant would have the sole legal
                            and beneficial ownership of the Property.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(d)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">However, the late Mr Chng Gim Cheng was concerned
                            about having the Property registered in the Defendant’s name
                            because the Defendant was just about to be involved in the family
                            business. As such, the late Mr Chng Gim Cheng suggested that the
                            Defendant executed a trust deed in favour of Fock Poh Kum in order to
                            protect the Property from potential future creditors. As a young man and
                            a filial son, the Defendant followed his father’s
                        wishes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>On or about 23 February 1974,

                            ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, the entire substratum of the Defendant’s case is that
                    he had executed the Trust Deed, <em>but</em> the reason why
                    beneficial interest did not pass was because he never intended to pass it to Mdm
                    Fock. That was the sham. His case is not that he had no beneficial interest to
                    pass because he had no legal interest, and, <em>hence</em>,
                    no trust could be constituted under the Trust Deed. The Defendant finally
                    concluded in no uncertain terms (at paragraph 6 of the Defence):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Paragraph 4 of the Statement of Claim is denied. <em>The
                            alleged trust deed is not valid as the Defendant</em>, <b><em>being the sole settlor/testator of the alleged trust deed, had
                            never intended to hold the Property in trust for Fock Poh
                        Kum</em></b>. <em>Instead, the Defendant had always
                            intended that he would have the sole legal and beneficial ownership of
                            the Property, and so was the intention of the Defendant’s late
                            father, Mr Chng Gim Cheng</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In consequence of the Defendant’s unambiguous pleadings, I agree
                    with Mr Yeo that Mr Bull’s argument –
                    <em>viz</em>, that there was no valid trust because the
                    Defendant was not the registered proprietor of the Property at the point of
                    execution of the Trust Deed – should not be entertained at this
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In any case, even on the merits, I would have
                    concluded that Mr Bull’s clever but technical argument does not carry the
                    Defendant very far. Although it is unclear who the contracting parties to the
                    contract for the sale of the Property were, the instrument of transfer recorded
                    that the Property was transferred to the Defendant “in consideration of
                    ... [$260,000] paid ... by [the Defendant]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As
                    such, at least as of 23 February 1974 when the transfer was executed, the
                    Defendant had beneficial interest in the Property. At this juncture, it is
                    evident that Mr Bull’s point that Mr Chng retained the beneficial interest
                    falls away. The more important question is whether the Trust Deed was effective
                    to convey beneficial interest to Mdm Fock, given that at the time of its
                    creation, the Defendant only had the beneficial interest but not the legal
                    interest in the Property. In my view, the answer must be yes. A person can
                    establish an express trust even if he is not the absolute owner of the property.
                    Thus, a lease over land may be the subject matter of a trust: <em>Keech v Sandford</em> (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61.
                    Likewise, an equitable interest in a trust may itself be the subject matter of a
                    trust: Geraint Thomas &amp; Alastair Hudson, <em>The Law of
                        Trusts</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2010)
                    at para 1.02. The definition of what may constitute trust property is
                    expressed in even wider terms in another leading textbook, Philip H Pettit,
                        <em>Equity and the Law of Trusts</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 12th Ed, 2012) (“<em>Pettit</em>”). The learned author in <em>Pettit</em> commented (at p 51):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to establish a trust there must be identifiable trust property,
                            <em>but there is no restriction as to what kind of
                            property it may be</em>. There can be a trust of a chattel or of a
                        chose in action, or of a right or obligation under an ordinary legal
                        contract, just as much as a trust of land or money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This is not a case of a trust over some future
                    property which has not come into existence, which Mr Bull appeared to be
                    alluding to in his submissions. The Property existed at the time of the
                    execution of the Trust Deed; it was explicitly identified in the Trust Deed. The
                    prohibition against constituting trusts of future property covers, for instance,
                    property that a person may have or will take under the exercise of a special
                    power of appointment, future royalties, or proceeds of any future sale of
                    specific property. The commonality across these types of future property is the
                    fact that they do not exist at the material time and, for that reason, cannot be
                    assigned either at law or in equity or held on trust: <em>Pettit</em> at p 120. With respect, I am unable to agree with
                    the Malaysian decisions cited to me by Mr Bull. The fact that the Defendant only
                    held the beneficial interest but not the legal interest in the Property at the
                    time of the execution of the Trust Deed is not a bar to the constitution of a
                    trust to hold the Property beneficially for Mdm Fock. I would add, for
                    completeness, that in <em>Re Ralli’s WT</em> [1964] 1
                    Ch 288, the court held that a settlor who had a remainder interest under another
                    trust could create a valid trust over that remainder interest. With this out of
                    the way, I turn now to the main thrust of the Defendant’s case, <em>viz</em>, the Sham Argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Concept of a sham</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Generally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The basic idea of a sham can be found in Lord
                    Diplock’s statement in <em>Snook v London and West Riding
                        Investments Ltd</em> [1967] 2 QB 786 at 802:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards the contention of the plaintiff that the transactions between
                        himself, Auto Finance and the defendants were a “sham,” it is,
                        I think, necessary to consider what, if any, legal concept is involved in
                        the use of this popular and pejorative word. I apprehend that, if it has any
                        meaning in law, it means <b><em>acts done or documents executed
                            </em></b><em>by the parties to the “sham”
                            which are </em><b><em>intended by them</em></b> to
                        give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the
                        parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights
                        and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. But one thing,
                        I think, is clear in legal principle, morality and the authorities ... that
                        for acts or documents to be a “sham,” with whatever legal
                        consequences follow from this, <em>all the parties thereto
                            </em><b><em>must have a common intention that the
                            acts or documents are not to create the legal rights and obligations

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There are two important general points to note
                    in relation to the Sham Argument raised by the Defendant. First, the person
                    alleging that a document is a sham has the burden of proving that the parties
                    intended the document to be a pretence: <em>National Westminster
                        Bank plc v Rosemary Doreen Jones &amp; Ors</em> [2001] 1 BCLC 98
                        (“<em>National Westminster Bank</em>”) at
                    [68]. Second, there is a very strong presumption that parties intend to be bound
                    by the provisions of agreements which they enter into. As Neuberger J (as he
                    then was) explained in the same case (at [59]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Because a finding of sham carries with it a finding of dishonesty,
                        because innocent third parties may often rely upon the genuineness of a
                        provision or an agreement, and because the court places great weight on the
                        existence and provisions of a formally signed document, there is a <em>strong and natural presumption against holding a provision or
                            document a sham</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Need for common intention to mislead</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The crux of the sham concept is a common
                    intention to mislead: Matthew Conaglen, “Sham Trusts” (2008) 67(1)
                    CLJ 176 (“<em>Conaglen</em>”)
                    at pp 183–184. As Neuberger J explained in <em>National Westminster Bank at</em> [59], a sham is “a provision
                    or agreement which the parties do not really intend to be effective, but have
                    merely entered into for the purpose of leading the court or a third party to
                    believe that it is to be effective”. In the absence of a common intention
                    to mislead, the court will simply construe an agreement according to the actual
                    objective intention of the parties (<em>Yorkshire Railway Wagon
                        Company v Maclure</em> (1882) 21 Ch D 309 at 318):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If it were a mere cloak or screen for another transaction one could see
                        through it, but once come to the conclusion that it was the <em>bonâ</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>fide</em> real transaction between the parties, intended
                        by both sides to operate according to its tenor, there is no mode that I
                        know of holding it illegal unless you find it prohibited by some Act of
                        Parliament or void by reason of some principles of law.</p>

                        Whether the documents were intended to create legal relationships <em>and</em> whether the parties <em>did
                            actually act according to the apparent purpose</em> and tenor of
                        the documents.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Test of parties’ intention to enter into a sham
                agreement is “subjective”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It has been said that the test of whether the
                    parties intend their agreement to be a sham is subjective: <em>Hitch v Stone</em> [2001] STC 214 (“<em>Hitch</em>”) at [66]. Professor Conaglen explains
                        (<em>Conaglen at</em> p 186):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the intention must be subjective flows from the fact that
                        the very purpose of a sham transaction is to mislead third parties.
                            <em>To rely solely on the objective intention of the
                            parties, ascertained in the normal way, would give direct effect to the
                            sham: a sham can only work its mischief if its objective appearance is
                            treated as the reality</em>. ... <em>If it is
                            objectively clear that the parties did not intend a transaction of type
                            X and in fact, as a matter of law, intended rights and obligations which
                            constitute a type-Y transaction, then the courts are capable of treating
                            the transaction as one of type-Y without need of any sham doctrine: they
                            can simply categorise it as type-Y. </em><b><em>Only
                            where the objective appearance of the transaction is type-X do the
                            courts need a justification to look behind the objective appearance in
                            order to get at “the real truth of the matter”</em></b>.
                        In the case of an allegation that the transaction is a sham, it is the
                        parties’ subjective intention which provides that justification, on
                        the basis that the parties subjectively intended to mislead third parties.
                        It will, of course, often be the case that the “court is left with
                        little direct evidence and is therefore required to draw inferences from the
                        circumstances surrounding the relevant events”, but the important
                        point is that the touchstone of that inquiry is the parties’
                        subjective intention to mislead because it is that intention which justifies
                        the court in departing from the normal process and rules of
                        construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics; original footnotes
                        omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Because the inquiry is one into the subjective
                    intention of the parties, the court is not restricted to the usual rules
                    governing the interpretation of documents. It appears that the court may have
                    regard to a wider category of evidence, such as the parties’ subsequent
                    conduct: <em>Hitch at</em> [65]. Thus, in <em>AG Securities v Vaughan and others</em> [1988]
                    3 WLR 1205, Lord Jauncey stated (at 1227) that “although
                    the subsequent actings of the parties may not be prayed in aid for the purposes
                    of construing the agreements, they may be looked at for the purposes of
                    determining whether or not parts of the agreements are a sham in the sense that
                    they were intended merely as ‘dressing up’ and not as provisions to
                    which any effect would be given”. Both parties accepted this
                    approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Common intention must generally belong to <em>both</em> the settlor and the trustee </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The relevant common intention generally refers
                    to the intention of the settlor <em>and</em> the trustee:
                    see <em>In re Esteem Settlement</em>
                    (2003) JLR 188 at [53]–[54]; <em>Shalson and
                        others v Russo and others</em> [2003] EWHC 1637 at [188].
                    What is clear is that the beneficiary’s intention at the time of the
                    constitution of the trust is strictly irrelevant for the purpose of determining
                    or ascertaining if a trust is a sham when it was first created, save perhaps in
                    one circumstance (see [57] below). Mdm Fock’s knowledge or intention at
                    the time of the execution of the Trust Deed and, consequently, her conduct are
                    therefore inconsequential, unless they can count as supporting evidence of the
                    settlor’s and the trustee’s intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The one circumstance alluded to above where
                    the beneficiary’s intention may be relevant is this: a beneficiary’s
                    intention subsequent to the formation of a trust may transform what was a
                    properly constituted trust which was not <em>ab initio</em>
                    a sham into a sham. For that to occur, all the beneficiaries to the trust must
                    join together with the trustees in that sham purpose: <em>A v A
                        and St George Trustees Limited and others</em> [2007] EWHC 99
                        (“<em>A v A</em>”) at [44]. However, this
                    principle has no application here as the Defendant has not pleaded that the
                    Trust Deed became a sham only sometime <em>after</em> it
                    was executed, or that Mdm Fock had, through her conduct, displayed an intention
                    to collude with the trustee (<em>ie</em>, the Defendant) to
                    use the Trust Deed <em>subsequently</em> as a sham even
                    though it was not intended to be a sham when the Trust Deed was first made. The
                    Defendant’s case is that the Trust Deed was a sham from its very
                    inception. Thus, Mdm Fock’s intention <em>qua</em>
                    beneficiary does not inform whether the Trust Deed is a sham. The sole intention
                    that is determinative is the Defendant’s <em>qua</em>
                    settlor and trustee of the Trust Deed, albeit Mdm Fock’s conduct and
                    intention may be indicative of what the Defendant’s intention might have
                    been at the time of the execution of the Trust Deed (see [56] above and [67]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   The present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Before applying the applicable principles, it
                    is necessary to first establish the identity of the settlor of the trust under
                    the Trust Deed. If the settlor is a different person from the trustee, then both
                    the settlor and the trustee must have the common intention to perpetuate the
                    sham in order for the Trust Deed to be considered a sham. On this point, the
                    parties were in agreement that the Defendant was both the settlor and the
                    trustee (see [19] and [25] above). The Trust Deed amounts to a unilateral
                    declaration of trust. As stated in <em>Lewin on Trusts</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2000) at para 4-23, where a trust is
                    unilaterally declared, only the settlor’s intention is “conceivably
                    relevant”. Therefore, I find that the only intention that matters is the
                    Defendant’s, especially in the light of both parties’ starting
                    position that the Defendant was the sole settlor and trustee under the Trust
                    Deed. That said, as I will elucidate below, I accept that Mr Chng’s
                    intention is relevant in ascertaining what the Defendant intended in executing
                    the Trust Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In my view, the proper question to be answered
                    is: did the Defendant – whether in consequence of Mr Chng’s
                    instructions or not – intend the Trust Deed to be a sham at the time he
                    signed the Trust Deed? The answer is no. Applying the test formulated in
                        <em>TKM</em> and applied in <em>Koon
                        Seng</em>, I am unable to reach the conclusion that the Defendant
                    intended the Trust Deed to be a sham at the time it was made. I shall elaborate
                    now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The context in which the Property was
                    purchased is crucial. When the Property was purchased in 1974, the Defendant was
                    only 24 years old and had just completed National Service. He did not appear to
                    have fared well in school, and had just joined the family business as an office
                    boy. The Property was purchased to serve as the family home for a family of
                    eight persons. Notwithstanding that on paper, a large chunk of the purchase
                    price was paid by the Defendant in cash and through his overdraft facility with
                    Far Eastern Bank (albeit with Mr Chng as the guarantor), there is no denying
                    that the source of these funds was ultimately Mr Chng. There is no credible
                    evidence or explanation before me that suggested that an office boy with a
                    monthly salary of $800 could have financed the purchase of a $260,000 house. As
                    I have found earlier (see [40]–[42] above), I rejected the
                    Defendant’s evidence that he had, on his own, obtained substantial funding
                    from a supposed blood relative, CPC. On balance, I find that the Property was
                    purchased entirely with Mr Chng’s direct and indirect financial
                    assistance to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     More pertinently, Mr Chng was not simply the
                        <em>de facto</em> purchaser of the Property. He was
                    also the provider of the whole family at that time in 1974, and all his six
                    children were then staying with him and Mdm Fock in the Tiong Poh flat. I find
                    it extremely implausible that in the light of the above context and factors, Mr
                    Chng would have intended to simply allow the Defendant to register the Property
                    in his own name, <em>and</em> to retain the beneficial
                    interest completely. There is no evidence that Mr Chng had such an intention,
                    and I do not accept that that could have been his intention. I accept that Mr
                    Chng may have had some general desire to “compensate” or
                    “reward” the Defendant for helping out with the family business.
                    However, compensation or reward in the form of full legal and beneficial
                    ownership of the family home worth $260,000 in 1974 for the second eldest child
                    out of six children at a time when Mr Chng and Mdm Fock were 51 and 46
                        years<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> old respectively is, to put it
                    mildly, irrationally excessive and quite inconceivable. After all, three of Mr
                    Chng’s other children also did not attend university and helped out with
                    the family business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Defendant gave evidence that Mr Chng had
                    expressly told Mr Hsieh that he wanted the Defendant, and not Mdm Fock, to
                    own the Property:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I do not believe that this conversation, if it
                    did take place, was accurately depicted by the Defendant. In any event, this
                    purported conversation does not unequivocally evidence an intention by Mr Chng
                    that beneficial ownership of the Property should rest with the Defendant and not
                    with Mdm Fock. All that this purported conversation shows is that Mr Chng had an
                    intention to protect the Property from the Defendant’s potential future
                    creditors, a position which even Mr Yeo accepts. In fact – and this is the
                    crux of my decision – both sides’ arguments have the same premise,
                    namely, that the Trust Deed was intended to protect the Property from Mr
                    Chng’s and/or the Defendant’s potential future
                        creditors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> I agree that the Trust Deed was entered
                    into for that purpose and, on its face, does in fact achieve that purpose. That
                        <em>per se</em> is not a sham. The only point of
                    departure is whether Mr Chng intended the Defendant or Mdm Fock to ultimately
                    own the beneficial interest in the Property. As I have already explained (at
                    [60]–[61] above), I find it unlikely that Mr Chng intended, by this
                    arrangement, to confer on the Defendant the full legal and beneficial ownership
                    of the Property when, on the face of the Trust Deed, vesting the beneficial
                    ownership in Mdm Fock would eminently achieve Mr Chng’s objective of
                    protecting the Property from potential future creditors. After considering all
                    the surrounding facts and circumstances of this case, I prefer Mr Yeo’s
                    explanation that Mr Chng had intended Mdm Fock to beneficially own the Property
                    as that was how he wanted to protect the Property from potential future
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Nevertheless, it must be cautioned, once
                    again, that Mr Chng’s intention is <em>strictly</em>
                    speaking irrelevant except to the extent that it may shed light on what the
                        <em>Defendant</em> had intended in executing the Trust
                    Deed. Thus, even if Mr Chng had intended Mdm Fock to beneficially own the
                    Property, it is still necessary to establish that the Defendant had the same
                    intention, and not the contrary intention that he would be both the legal
                        <em>and</em> beneficial owner notwithstanding what was
                    stated on the face of the Trust Deed. This brings us back to the circumstances
                    surrounding the execution of the Trust Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I reiterate the parties’ common premise
                    that the Trust Deed’s purpose was to protect the Property from the
                    Defendant’s potential future creditors. This was the same reason,
                    according to the Defendant, why the Tiong Poh flat was registered in Mdm
                    Fock’s name even though Mr Chng paid for it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> I also accept
                    that Mr Chng wanted the Defendant to be the registered owner of the Property. As
                    to why Mr Chng wanted to have the Property registered in the Defendant’s
                    and not Mdm Fock’s name, I find Mr Yeo’s case theory that Mr Chng
                    foresaw that eventually, the Defendant would need to sign guarantees on behalf
                    of the family business<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> to be tenable. Therefore,
                    although Mr Chng wanted to help the Defendant appear more creditworthy, he was
                    at the same time afraid that the Defendant’s future potential creditors
                    might enforce the Defendant’s debts against the Property, which was, at
                    that time, functioning as the family home. This was why Mr Chng intimated to Mr
                    Hsieh that the Property should be owned in a manner which protected it from the
                    Defendant’s potential future creditors. Mr Hsieh then proposed the idea of
                    a trust to Mr Chng and the Defendant,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> and explained
                    the mechanism of the Trust Deed and its legal consequences to Mr Chng and the
                    Defendant. The Defendant’s own account of Mr Hsieh’s explanation is
                    telling as it shows what the Defendant understood the Trust Deed to mean and to
                    be its legal effect at <em>that time</em> before he signed
                        it:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The Defendant’s oral evidence speaks for
                    itself. At the time when the Trust Deed was signed, the Defendant was aware of
                    Mr Chng’s intention that the Property would be in the Defendant’s
                    name, but to protect it from his potential future creditors, Mdm Fock would
                    beneficially own the Property. Mr Hsieh (a) explained that the Property
                    would not be seized by creditors if it was held on trust for Mdm Fock;
                    (b) drafted the terms of the Trust Deed on that basis; and
                    (c) explained the effect of the Trust Deed to both Mr Chng and the
                    Defendant. The Defendant then signed the Trust Deed with the knowledge of how
                    the Trust Deed was to work as explained by Mr Hsieh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> The simple fact of the matter is
                    that at the time that the Defendant signed the Trust Deed, his understanding of
                    the document was that it was to have the precise effect that a trust would
                    ordinarily have. That makes perfect sense because the understanding and common
                    intention all along of Mr Chng and the Defendant, after the explanations given
                    to them by Mr Hsieh, was that the Trust Deed would secure the Property in the
                    family’s hands and keep it safe from creditors because the beneficial
                    ownership would truly vest in Mdm Fock. That was the basis upon which Mr Hsieh
                    drafted the Trust Deed for the Defendant to sign. None of the parties at that
                    time intended the Trust Deed to be a sham in the sense that beneficial ownership
                    of the Property was not to vest in Mdm Fock but was to remain with the Defendant
                    after the Trust Deed was signed. No one intended a situation contrary to what
                    was stated in the Trust Deed. I do not believe that Mr Hsieh was likely to have
                    prepared the Trust Deed for the purpose of implementing some sham. More likely
                    than not, Mr Hsieh would have prepared the Trust Deed to give effect to a
                    genuine trust, in accordance with the instructions of Mr Chng. The Defendant was
                    not likely to have given a different set of instructions to Mr Hsieh as the
                    Defendant was at that time entirely dependent on Mr Chng financially for the
                    purchase of the Property. I cannot see how the Defendant could have had some
                    other say in the matter that was different from Mr Chng’s. He simply would
                    have had to obey Mr Chng’s wishes and fall in line with what Mr Chng
                    intended. Further, the Defendant admitted on more than one occasion that at no
                    time right up to the signing of the Trust Deed did he have the understanding
                    that the Trust Deed would have no meaning or effect:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     On the basis of the above excerpt, there is
                    really no basis for me to find that the Defendant had any other conception of
                    the Trust Deed except that which was explained by Mr Hsieh, namely, that Mdm
                    Fock would own the beneficial interest in the Property and that was how the
                    Property would be protected from the Defendant’s potential future
                    creditors. On the whole, it is clear to my mind that the strong presumption
                        (<em>per</em> Neuberger J in <em>National Westminster Bank</em>) that the Trust Deed means what it
                    says has not been displaced. I reiterate that the mere fact that the Trust Deed
                    was intended by Mr Chng, Mr Hsieh and the Defendant as a means to protect the
                    Property from the Defendant’s potential future creditors does not make the
                    Trust Deed a sham. Indeed, as the Defendant conceded, the Trust Deed would serve
                    that very protective purpose <em>if</em> it were to operate
                    on its true and express terms without any qualification. To say that the Trust
                    Deed is a sham means that while the Trust Deed professed to accord beneficial
                    ownership to Mdm Fock, it in fact meant something different in that the true
                    beneficial owner of the Property was the Defendant and not the person stated on
                    the face of the Trust Deed (see <em>W T Ramsay Ltd v Inland
                        Revenue Commissioners</em> [1982] AC 300 at 323). In
                    other words, that something different, as Mr Bull has sought to argue, is that
                    the beneficial ownership resided with the Defendant notwithstanding the Trust
                    Deed. However, the Trust Deed was clearly part of the composite arrangement
                    which included the purchase of the Property, a decision which was undertaken and
                    financed by Mr Chng. As mentioned earlier, I find that it is extremely
                    implausible that Mr Chng had contemplated the composite transaction to
                    result in the Defendant having both legal and beneficial ownership of the
                    Property in the circumstances and context subsisting in 1974. To put it simply,
                    when the Property was purchased and the Trust Deed entered into, the Defendant
                    was an obedient son who was merely following his father’s instructions.
                    From the way the Property was to be owned legally and beneficially for the
                    purpose of protecting it from creditors to the way its purchase was to be
                    financed, Mr Chng was the mastermind and the Defendant was the pliant
                    executioner. A doubt raised by Mr Bull as to why the Trust Deed had stated that
                    the Property was “<em>transferred</em>”
                    [emphasis added] to the Defendant to hold on trust for Mdm Fock may be explained
                    on the basis that the Defendant received the Property from someone else –
                    ostensibly Mr Chng – and the Defendant was merely a conduit for a
                    collateral purpose. Indeed, the Defendant admitted in his Defence that
                    “as a young man and a filial son ... [he was following] his
                    father’s wishes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> He was carrying out Mr
                    Chng’s instructions (see the excerpt at [47] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> At 24 years of age and having been given
                    the opportunity to work in the family business, there is no reason to expect the
                    Defendant to have done otherwise. This inference is also consistent with the
                    fact that Mdm Fock kept the Trust Deed ever since it was executed till the time
                    she passed away. If the Trust Deed was truly intended by the Defendant to be a
                    sham in the sense of showing it to his potential future creditors and nothing
                    else, one would expect that he would be the one keeping the Trust Deed, not Mdm
                    Fock. It would appear that Mdm Fock also kept the certificate of title to the
                    Property for some 28 years from 1974 to 2002, demonstrating that from the
                    very beginning, she regarded the Property as beneficially owned by
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Therefore, in my judgment, there is no doubt
                    that the Defendant, in executing the Trust Deed, was obeying
                    Mr Chng’s instructions and wishes “down to a T”.
                    For all intents and purposes, Mr Chng’s intention was tantamount to
                    the Defendant’s intention. Given what Mr Chng’s intention was
                    and what Mr Hsieh explained to the Defendant prior to the signing of the Trust
                    Deed, I find it nigh implausible – beyond the realm of conceivability
                    – that the Defendant could have had a contrary intention, <em>viz</em>, that he was instead the beneficial owner because
                    the Trust Deed was not meant to have any real effect. For completeness, I also
                    reject the argument that the Defendant’s subsequent change of intention
                    rendered what was a valid trust a sham. As a matter of principle, a trust which
                    is not initially a sham cannot subsequently become a sham simply because the
                    settlor or trustee does not wish to recognise the trust deed after it has been
                    duly created. Once a trust has been properly constituted, the property which is
                    the subject matter of the trust cannot lose its character as trust property save
                    in accordance with the terms of the trust itself: <em>A v A at</em> [42].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Hence, unless the Plaintiffs are estopped from
                    asserting that Mdm Fock’s estate is the beneficial owner of the Property
                    (see [93]–[113] below), their claim must be allowed. However, before
                    considering the Estoppel Argument, in deference to the efforts of both
                    parties’ counsel and in the event that I am wrong on the Sham Argument, I
                    shall first address the Illegality Argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Defendant can rely on the sham purpose to invalidate the
                Trust Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     If I had found that the Trust Deed was
                    intended to be a sham, Mr Yeo argued that the Defendant could not rely on his
                    sham purpose to invalidate the Trust Deed to benefit himself. He cited a New
                    Zealand Court of Appeal decision, <em>Official Assignee v
                        Wilson</em> [2008] 3 NZLR 45, in support of this
                    proposition. There, the Official Assignee sought a declaration that the trust
                    which Mr Reynolds, the settlor-bankrupt, had set up was a sham. The Official
                    Assignee argued that the court, as a result of Mr Reynolds’
                    “improper, overbearing and perhaps unlawful activities, should treat the
                    legitimate rights of the discretionary beneficiaries as being
                    extinguished”. The court declined to grant the declaration, stating (at
                    [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is unsustainable to assert that Mr Reynolds could come before the Court
                        and ask to benefit as a result of his own slackness, informality or perhaps
                        even illegality. The [Official Assignee] does not, in these circumstances,
                        have a different stance from that of Mr Reynolds. No matter how condemnatory
                        the Court were to be in its assessment of the acts and omissions of the
                        relevant players, it could never reach the point where there could be
                        integrity or justification in allowing Mr Reynolds to seek relief which is
                        effectively for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Mr Yeo also cited an old decision of the
                    Supreme Court of the Federated Malay States, <em>Au Phin Yeang v
                        Kan Tak Fee, Ng Ah Hoe, Foo Lin Yin</em> [1934] FMSLR 5, which held
                    that the defence of fraud could only be pleaded by an innocent party. The
                    defendant there had accepted the transfer of ten pieces of land belonging to one
                    Mr Kan, who was the first plaintiff’s father and the second and third
                    plaintiffs’ husband, to defeat the creditors of Mr Kan. The court found
                    that the defendant’s subsequent declaration of trust over the ten pieces
                    of land for the plaintiffs was a further protection of the properties from Mr
                    Kan’s creditors. The plaintiffs did not know of either the original
                    transfer or the subsequent declaration of trust when those transactions were
                    made. When the plaintiffs commenced court proceedings for breach of trust with
                    respect to the defendant’s dealing with two of the pieces of land held on
                    trust, the defendant alleged that the trust was only a fictitious transaction
                    and he was never in fact a trustee for the plaintiffs. Rejecting the
                    defendant’s argument, the court held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the law is quite clear ... the defendant cannot be heard to say that
                        his own deed is to be avoided by his own fraud. His declaration of trust is
                        irrevocable even though the plaintiffs are volunteers [<em>Paul v. Paul</em> (20 Ch. D. 742.)] and it is not open to him to
                        say that it is a fiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Bull did not have a direct response to this
                    plank of the Plaintiffs’ case. He did not deny that the Defendant could
                    not invalidate the Trust Deed for his own benefit, given that on the
                    Defendant’s case, the Defendant was the perpetrator of the sham purpose.
                    Mr Bull, however, attacked the right of the Plaintiffs to rely on the Trust Deed
                    on two grounds. First, Mdm Fock herself was a party to the sham. Her estate,
                    therefore, could not rely upon the fraud to which she was a party to assert
                    title to the Property. Second, the sham purpose was never carried out. Mr Bull
                    argued that where the fraudulent or illegal purpose behind a transaction had not
                    been carried out, the rule that a party could not raise or rely on his own fraud
                    or illegality to found a claim did not attach. I shall consider these two
                    arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Was Mdm Fock a party to the sham?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Mr Bull’s indirect approach is
                    conceptually sound. The Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving their claim. Since
                    their claim is founded on the validity of the Trust Deed, if Mdm Fock was a
                    party to the sham, the very rule that Mr Yeo argued precludes the Defendant from
                    invalidating the Trust Deed will apply to preclude the Plaintiffs from relying
                    on the Trust Deed – what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
                    gander.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The question turns on what it means to be a
                    party to a sham. Obviously, if Mdm Fock shared the sham intention either at the
                    time of the execution of the Trust Deed or subsequent to it, she would be a
                    party to the sham. A party who displays reckless indifference to a sham will
                    also be considered to be a party to the sham: <em>Midland Bank
                        PLC v Wyatt</em> [1995] 1 FLR 696 at 699. It is apposite to reiterate
                    that the sham here is not that the Trust Deed would protect the Property from
                    the Defendant’s potential future creditors <em>per
                        se</em>, but that the beneficial ownership was to reside with the
                    Defendant notwithstanding the Trust Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   At the time the Trust Deed was executed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I am not persuaded that Mdm Fock even had
                    knowledge of the Trust Deed before or at the time that it was executed (although
                    she did have knowledge of it <em>after</em> it was executed
                    (see [9] above)), with the corollary being that she could not have had an
                    intention <em>qua</em> beneficiary to defraud the
                    Defendant’s potential future creditors into believing that she was the
                    beneficial owner when she knew that she was not. I have come to this conclusion
                    for two reasons. First, the Defendant had testified that the idea of the Trust
                    Deed was mooted by Mr Hsieh. It was not the case that Mr Chng had knowledge of
                    structuring trusts and then discussed with Mdm Fock first before seeing Mr Hsieh
                    together with the Defendant, and thereafter instructed Mr Hsieh to prepare the
                    Trust Deed. Second, the only evidence that Mdm Fock might have had an inkling of
                    the Trust Deed is from an inference made by the Defendant. He claimed that as
                    Mdm Fock did not look surprised when Mr Chng informed her of the Trust Deed
                        <em>after</em> it had been executed, he (the Defendant)
                    himself inferred that Mr Chng could have previously discussed the “issue
                    of the protection of the Property”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> with Mdm Fock without his
                presence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Even if I accept that such a conversation
                    between Mr Chng and Mdm Fock took place, I have difficulty accepting that Mdm
                    Fock did not display any discernible look of surprise, or that the absence of
                    any look of surprise on Mdm Fock’s face leads to the reasonable inference
                    that she must have discussed the Trust Deed with Mr Chng <em>prior</em> to its being executed. The Defendant’s evidence on
                    this particular conversation is contradictory:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Pausing here for a moment, there are two
                    points to be observed. First, according to the Defendant, immediately after the
                    Trust Deed was executed, it was brought back to be given to Mdm Fock. It was not
                    to be kept by the Defendant, which is what one would expect if the <em>sole</em> intention of executing the Trust Deed was for him
                    to show it to potential future creditors. Second, Mr Chng explained to Mdm Fock
                    that the Trust Deed stated that she was the one who had paid for the Property, a
                    point which Mdm Fock denied. If Mr Chng had already discussed the Trust Deed
                    with Mdm Fock, as the Defendant said he had inferred (see [75] above), Mr Chng
                    would not have had to tell Mdm Fock that piece of information, and, more
                    importantly, Mdm Fock would not have contradicted Mr Chng. Moving on with the
                    Defendant’s evidence on this point, after the Defendant and Mr Chng
                    left Mr Hsieh’s office with the Trust Deed, the following conversation
                    took place when they went home and saw Mdm Fock:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As I alluded to during the cross-examination
                    of the Defendant, Mdm Fock was unlikely to have understood what a trust
                    encompassed. It would be surprising that Mdm Fock was indeed not in the least
                    surprised when told of the Trust Deed and its terms. Even if Mdm Fock was not
                    surprised, she must have been confused at the very least. She was clearly
                    disagreeable insofar as the language of the Trust Deed, which provided that she
                    had paid for the Property, was concerned. Even if the Defendant’s
                    description of the way the conversation (or explanation) went is accepted, it
                    still does not justify the inference that Mr Chng and Mdm Fock had previously
                    discussed the “issue of the protection of the Property” such that
                    it can be said that Mdm Fock was a participant of the sham. Finally, even
                    if Mr Chng and Mdm Fock <em>might</em> have
                    discussed the creation of a trust over the Property with the Defendant as the
                    trustee and Mdm Fock as the beneficiary to protect the Property from the
                    Defendant’s potential future creditors, there is no basis to impute into
                    that discussion a <em>further</em> purpose that such a
                    trust arrangement was to be a sham in that the true beneficiary was to be the
                    Defendant in spite of what the Trust Deed said, with Mdm Fock being the
                    beneficiary in appearance only in the eyes of the Defendant’s potential
                    future creditors and in <em>no other circumstance</em>.
                    This inference requires a leap of logic which I am not prepared to take. The
                    Defendant’s inference is, as he admits, speculative.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> For these reasons, I find it unlikely
                    that Mdm Fock had any knowledge of the Trust Deed at the time that it was
                    executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Assuming <em>arguendo</em>, on the Defendant’s best case, that Mdm Fock
                    might have known of the purpose of the Trust Deed (<em>viz</em>, to protect the Property from the Defendant’s
                    potential future creditors) at the time when the Trust Deed was executed, such
                    knowledge does not make Mdm Fock a party to the sham <em>unless</em> she was aware that under the arrangement, the true
                    intention was for the Defendant, and not her, to have the beneficial ownership.
                    There is no indication that she had this knowledge or was recklessly indifferent
                    to this arrangement at the time the Trust Deed was executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   After the Trust Deed was executed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Mr Bull then argued that Mdm Fock knew of the
                    sham purpose <em>after</em> the Trust Deed was executed. He
                    referred again to the Defendant’s evidence of how Mr Chng had explained

                                            is like this. So my—again, as I said, my mother
                                            said, no, I didn’t pay for it. So my father said
                                            to her, well, it doesn’t matter. This trust deed,
                                                <em>we all understand, is
                                                </em><b><em>basically to protect
                                                the property, so you just keep it and, well, in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I am unable to accept that from this brief
                    explanation (even on the assumption that it took place), Mdm Fock knew of the
                    sham purpose and was a participant in the transaction. All that the Defendant
                    testified is that Mr Chng <em>told</em> Mdm Fock that:
                    (a) the Trust Deed was to protect the Property; (b) the Trust Deed
                    might be used in the future; and (c) if the Trust Deed was not used, it had
                    no effect. There is no indication that Mdm Fock understood the concept of a
                    trust and its prophylactic effect against the Defendant’s potential future
                    creditors. The requisite degree of assent in terms of knowledge of <em>and</em> participation in the sham purpose (see <em>Ashmore, Benson Pease &amp; Co Ltd v AV Dawson Ltd</em>
                    [1973] 1 WLR 828 at 836) which is necessary to preclude Mdm Fock and, by
                    extension, the Plaintiffs from relying on the Trust Deed is lacking. Apart from
                    her allegedly unsurprised look, Mdm Fock’s response, if any, upon hearing
                    what Mr Chng told her about the Trust Deed was not presented to the court. There
                    is therefore no evidence on whether Mdm Fock had expressly stated that she
                    understood and <em>agreed</em> with what was simply told to
                    her by Mr Chng, namely, that the Trust Deed was to have “no
                    effect”, other than “basically to protect” the Property.
                    For the avoidance of doubt, I am not saying that Mdm Fock must have been
                    educated on the legal nuances of a trust before she could qualify as a
                    participant of a sham trust. However, if Mdm Fock did not know of the alleged
                    sham purpose or effect of the Trust Deed in terms of how it affected the
                    beneficial ownership of the Property, there is no basis to hold that she had
                    become a participant to the sham even on the shaky assumption that the
                    conversation at [80] above had taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Mr Bull also raised three points on Mdm
                    Fock’s subsequent conduct to suggest that Mdm Fock was a party to the
                    sham. First, he submitted that the fact that Mdm Fock kept the Trust Deed at all
                    times suggested that she was part of the sham. I find this submission logically
                    deficient. Mdm Fock could have kept the Trust Deed precisely because she thought
                    that she was the beneficial owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Second, although Mdm Fock kept the Trust
                    Deed, she did not list the Property as one of her assets in her Will.
                    Mr Bull submitted that if Mdm Fock was not aware of the sham, she
                    should have considered herself the rightful owner of the Property and should
                    have listed it as one of her assets in her Will. This inference is undoubtedly
                    attractive at first blush. However, I am simply not in a position to speculate
                    why Mdm Fock did not include the Property in her Will despite having possession
                    of the Trust Deed at all times. One reason may indeed be due to her knowledge of
                    the sham, but there are, to my mind, other equally plausible reasons. For
                    instance, she could have simply forgotten about the Trust Deed in her UOB safe
                    deposit box; it could be that she remembered the Trust Deed, but was uncertain
                    about the ownership effect of the Trust Deed; or she might have thought that
                    there was no need to expressly provide for the Property in her Will. At the
                    bottom line, I am unconvinced that the mere fact that the Property was not
                    expressly provided for in Mdm Fock’s Will is sufficient evidence of her
                    knowledge of and participation in the sham purpose such that she and, by
                    extension, the Plaintiffs would not be able to rely on the Trust
                Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Third, Mr Bull submitted that Mdm Fock did not
                    at any point in time, despite her strained relationship with the Defendant,
                    enforce the Trust Deed against him. Again, it is difficult to second-guess why
                    Mdm Fock did not enforce the Trust Deed, but her non-enforcement cannot be
                    indicative of her knowledge that the Trust Deed was a sham and her participation
                    in the sham. Additionally, while there may have been tensions between Mdm Fock
                    and the Defendant, they were ultimately still one family in the end. Asserting
                    her beneficial ownership at the expense of the Defendant (and his family at
                    that) would have been a drastic recourse. In fact, using the Defendant’s
                    logic, since the Defendant too did not appear to have enforced what he now
                    purports to be the true ownership arrangement by, for example, reclaiming the
                    use of the master bedroom, evicting Mdm Fock or selling the Property against her
                        wishes,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> the court should infer that the
                    Trust Deed meant what it said, <em>viz</em>, that Mdm Fock
                    was the true beneficial owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I am therefore unable to agree that Mdm Fock
                    was, either before or after the Trust Deed was executed, even aware of the sham
                    purpose of the Trust Deed. <em>A fortiori</em>, it follows
                    that she could not have had a common intention to defraud the Defendant’s
                    potential future creditors into believing that the Defendant was not the true
                    beneficial owner. Mdm Fock was plainly not a party to the sham purpose of the
                    Trust Deed. One has to bear in mind that steps taken to protect property against
                    future creditors are not <em>per se</em> illegal and a
                    sham. Even if Mdm Fock understood that she was to be the actual beneficial owner
                    of the Property through the Trust Deed to protect the Property against
                    creditors, there could have been no sham. When protection was no longer needed
                        (<em>eg</em>, when the Defendant was no longer involved
                    with the family business as a director), it would then be up to Mdm Fock whether
                    she wanted to gift the Property subsequently to the Defendant, and if she was
                    minded to do so, she could properly execute another document to transfer her
                    beneficial ownership to the Defendant. But, Mdm Fock never did that before
                    her death and as such, the beneficial ownership must remain with
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Can the Defendant invalidate the Trust Deed if the sham was
                not carried out?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Turning to the second of his two responses
                    (see [72] above), Mr Bull argued that irrespective of whether Mdm Fock was a
                    party to the sham, the Defendant could invalidate the Trust Deed as long as the
                    sham had not been carried out. Mr Bull cited the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat</em> [1996] 1
                    SLR(R) 906 (“<em>Shi Fang</em>”) in support
                    of his argument. In <em>Shi Fang</em>, the Court of Appeal
                    endorsed (at [25]) the principle stated in <em>Tribe v
                        Tribe</em> [1996] 1 Ch 107 (“<em>Tribe</em>”) that a person who seeks to recover property
                    transferred by him for an illegal purpose can lead evidence of his dishonest
                    intention whenever it is necessary for him to do so provided that he has
                    withdrawn from the transaction before the illegal purpose was carried out. This
                    is known as the doctrine of <em>locus poenitentiae</em>,
                    which operates as an exception to the maxim that “he who comes to equity
                    must come with clean hands”: <em>Tribe at</em>
                    134.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Mr Bull pointed out that there was no dispute
                    that no creditors had been defrauded in the present case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> As such, the illegal purpose had not been
                    carried out and the Defendant could rely on the sham to invalidate the Trust
                    Deed. On the Plaintiffs’ part, Mr Yeo argued that <em>Shi
                        Fang</em> was distinguishable because it was not a case involving any
                    sham arrangements. According to Mr Yeo, the court in <em>Shi
                        Fang</em> was asked to decide whether the property in question was
                    owned by the father or the son, and this question depended on the applicability
                    of the presumption of resulting trust or advancement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> As <em>Shi Fang</em>
                    is a key authority on this issue, I shall examine the facts and holdings of that
                    case in greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The parties in <em>Shi
                        Fang</em> were a husband and his wife. They stayed in a semi-detached
                    house. At some point, the marriage came under severe strain and the wife
                    returned to China, where she was a national, for a visit. When she returned to
                    Singapore, she found that the lock to the house had been changed and that her
                    personal belongings had been removed. She was not allowed to move back to the
                    house. Instead, she stayed with the husband’s parents in their house
                    nearby. Upon the advice of solicitors, the wife later lodged a caveat on the
                    house claiming an interest as a beneficial co-owner on the ground that the house
                    was matrimonial property. Three separate proceedings were then commenced, one of
                    which was a proceeding commenced by the husband for a declaration that the
                    house, which was registered in his name, was held on trust for his
                    father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Khoo J in the High Court found that the father
                    had provided the purchase money for the house, and retained full control of the
                    house <em>like a true owner</em>. The house had been put in
                    the son’s name simply to make it appear that it was the son who owned it
                    when it was not so owned. The objective of this arrangement was to evade estate
                    duty payable on the death of the father. Khoo J held that the presumption of
                    advancement was not rebutted on the ground that in order to rebut the
                    presumption, the father had to rely on evidence of the illegal purpose. Thus, he
                    concluded that the house was a gift by the father to the son (the husband), and
                    it therefore remained the property of the husband: see <em>Shi
                        Fang at</em> [11].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Although the appeal was conducted on the basis
                    that the house belonged to the husband, the Court of Appeal made some
                    observations relating to the rebuttal of the presumption of advancement. First,
                    it noted (at [12]) that it saw no reason why the husband’s admission that
                    he held the house on trust for the father should not be accepted. In other
                    words, the husband did not rely on any illegality of his in admitting that he
                    held the house on trust for his father to rebut the presumption of advancement:
                        <em>Shi Fang at</em> [18]. Insofar as this is one of
                    the holdings of <em>Shi Fang</em>, I agree with Mr Yeo that
                    this authority is distinguishable from the present case. The mastermind of the
                    sham in <em>Shi Fang</em> was the father, not the husband.
                    Therefore, even if the basis for the trust in <em>Shi
                        Fang</em> was the father’s illegal intention to evade estate
                    duty, the husband could admit that he was holding the house on trust without
                    relying on any illegal purpose of <em>his
                own</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     However, referring to the line of authorities
                    leading to <em>Tribe</em>, the Court of Appeal further held
                    that there was another <em>separate</em> ground for holding
                    that the presumption of advancement had been rebutted. The Court of Appeal held
                    (at [25]) that the father’s purpose of transferring and registering the
                    house in the husband’s name had not been achieved or carried into effect
                    as the revenue authority was not deceived. The question of payment of estate
                    duty had not even arisen. Thus, even the <em>father</em>
                    could rely on evidence as to the illegal purpose of the transfer to rebut the
                    presumption of advancement. I am unable to agree with Mr Yeo’s assertion
                    that <em>Shi Fang</em> is distinguishable on this latter
                    ground. Other cases apart from <em>Shi Fang</em> point to
                    the same conclusion. For instance, the crucial feature in <em>Tribe</em> was that the transfer document had never been shown to the
                    landlord or any other creditor and, hence, no one had been deceived. The High
                    Court of Australia in <em>Perpetual Executors and Trustees
                        Association of Australia Ltd v Wright</em> (1917) 23 CLR 185 (cited
                    with approval in <em>Shi Fang at</em> [19]) too placed
                    emphasis on the fact that no creditors were deceived. As Barton CJ said (at
                    193), there were “no creditors to hoodwink, and the whole thing rested on
                    what might happen but never did happen.” So also in <em>Painter v Hutchinson and another</em> [2007] EWHC 758, the
                    plaintiff’s argument that her declaration of trust was a sham was allowed
                    by the court. One of the reasons for the court’s holding that the sham had
                    not been carried into effect was the fact that the declaration of trust was
                    never shown to the Inland Revenue: at [128(v)].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     There was no evidence before me that any of
                    the Defendant’s creditors or other third parties were hoodwinked by the
                    Trust Deed. Therefore, if I am wrong on the Sham Argument, and if the Defendant
                    had decided to defy Mr Chng’s unambiguous intention and had intended at
                    the time he signed the Trust Deed to retain beneficial interest in the Property,
                    with the Trust Deed being a mere sham vehicle to hide his beneficial interest
                    from creditors, the doctrine of <em>locus poenitentiae</em>
                    as accepted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Shi Fang</em> is
                    applicable. The Defendant is not precluded from relying on his own sham to
                    invalidate the Trust Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Plaintiffs are estopped</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I return to the Estoppel Argument, which is
                    more relevant because I have found that the Trust Deed was not a sham and,
                    therefore, was not invalid. Mr Bull submitted that Mdm Fock’s estate was
                    estopped from claiming ownership of the Property under the doctrine of estoppel
                    by convention or, alternatively, promissory estoppel. It is apposite to mention
                    that a defence of promissory estoppel cannot be found on a strict construction

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Nothing in the Defendant’s pleadings
                    refers to a promise by Mdm Fock. The most that can be said is that: (a) Mdm
                    Fock represented by conduct that the beneficial interest in the Property
                    belonged to the Defendant, and (b) the Defendant believed that the
                    beneficial interest in the Property belonged to him and Mdm Fock’s conduct
                    reflected her acquiescence in his belief. Even though Mr Yeo did not object to
                    this defect in pleading and proceeded to submit on the basis that the
                    Defendant’s case was founded on estoppel by representation, promissory
                    estoppel, proprietary estoppel and estoppel by convention,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> I am of the view that the Defendant
                    has to plead his case accurately. The different types of estoppel may have
                    similar undertones, but, as will be seen below, their constituent elements are
                    dissimilar, and the facts relevant to the elements would accordingly differ and
                    must be pleaded specifically. For instance, while Mr Bull argued that there was
                    promissory estoppel, he described the alleged “promises” as
                        “representations”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> There is a distinction
                    between the two as a representation refers to a representation of fact and is
                    not promissory in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     If the Defendant was approaching the Estoppel
                    Argument by way of some single unified test, which I accept is not completely
                    without some authority (see <em>Amalgamated Investment and
                        Property Co Ltd v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd</em> [1982] QB
                    84 at 122, but <em>cf</em> a critical view of this
                    proposition in Sean Wilken, <em>Wilken and Villiers on The Law of
                        Waiver, Variation and Estoppel</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed,
                    2006) (“<em>Wilken and Villiers</em>”) at
                    paras 10.04–10.07), he should have done so clearly. There was only a
                    single line in Mr Bull’s submissions suggesting that unconscionability is
                    the “overarching inquiry” in determining whether an estoppel ought
                    to be found.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> In my view, Mr Bull’s
                    supporting authority, <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v
                        United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 (“<em>Hong Leong</em>”) at [171] and [191], does not stand
                    for what he sought to argue. Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in that case
                    was explaining that in deciding whether a proprietary estoppel had arisen,
                    unconscionability was an overarching inquiry in the sense that the court would
                    grant the proprietary estoppel if it was satisfied that it would be
                    unconscionable to do otherwise, having regard to all the circumstances. This is
                    very different from saying that unconscionability is the only test when
                    considering whether to grant <em>any</em> form of
                    estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Thus, the Defendant’s pleadings and
                    submissions on the Estoppel Argument were, with respect, not too helpful.
                    Unfortunately, Mr Yeo also did not help to isolate the respective estoppels and
                    distil which estoppels were properly pleaded and argued before the court. In my
                    view, the Defendant’s pleadings lend themselves to the defence of:
                    (a) estoppel by representation by conduct; (b) estoppel by convention;
                    (c) proprietary estoppel; and (d) estoppel by acquiescence. As such,
                    notwithstanding Mr Bull’s submissions (at [23] above), I will address the
                    Defendant’s Estoppel Argument on the basis of these four
                estoppels.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Estoppel by representation by conduct</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     It is settled law that for a party to
                    successfully raise the defence of estoppel by representation, three elements
                    must be satisfied (<em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Bank of
                        China</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 57 at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     the respondent must have made a
                        representation of fact;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     which was relied on by the claimant;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     the claimant
                        suffered detriment as a result of the reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Mr Yeo argued that there could be no estoppel
                    by representation in the first place because the Estoppel Argument was relevant
                    only in the event that the Trust Deed was <em>not</em> a
                    sham, in which case the Defendant must be taken to have known that the
                    beneficial interest resided with Mdm Fock as per the Trust Deed. He thus could
                    not have been induced by any representation by Mdm Fock that he was the
                    beneficial owner of the Property. The conceptual difficulty for the Defendant
                    under Mr Yeo’s argument is that given my finding that the Trust Deed is
                    genuine, the Defendant must then be taken to have known that he was in fact not
                    the beneficial owner of the Property. It ought then to follow that the Defendant
                    could not be misled by representations from Mdm Fock that he was instead
                    factually the true beneficial owner. Paraphrased, the Defendant could not have
                    been misled or induced by a fact which he knew to be untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     While I appreciate the general tenor of Mr
                    Yeo’s argument, I would only go so far as to say that in such
                    circumstances, strong evidence is generally required before a recipient in the
                    shoes of the Defendant can prove that he relied on any representations of fact
                    which he <em>originally</em> knew to be untrue. As a matter
                    of logic, I can accept that such a recipient may, after being told of the wrong
                    facts, subsequently believe himself to have been mistaken (although what he
                    thought he knew originally was factually correct) and thereafter rely on the
                    representations of wrong facts to his detriment. Hence, it is possible that even
                    though the Defendant must be taken to have originally known that he was in fact
                    not the beneficial owner at the time of the execution of the Trust Deed as a
                    result of my finding on the Sham Argument, he <em>may</em>
                    subsequently believe himself to be mistaken about the true factual state of
                    affairs due to the passage of time or due to representations of erroneous facts
                    from others coupled with his failure of memory or for other reasons. This may
                    then trigger the operation of estoppel by convention (see [107] below).
                    Nevertheless, given my finding on the Sham Argument with the corollary that the
                    Defendant must be taken to have known that he was not the beneficial owner of
                    the Property, what is more relevant for the Defendant’s case is actually
                    whether there were any <em>promises</em> emanating from Mdm
                    Fock to the effect that she would not be exercising strictly her rights as the
                    beneficial owner such that the Defendant, as the legal owner, was subsequently
                    induced to act to his detriment in consequence of his believing and relying on
                    those promises of Mdm Fock not to exercise her legal rights. But, this would
                    amount to a case of promissory estoppel, which, as I have said, was not pleaded
                    by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Irrespective of the above, it is trite that
                    the representation of fact relied upon must be unequivocal for any estoppel to
                    attach. To that end, Mr Yeo contended that Mdm Fock’s conduct was
                    equivocal at best.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> The evidence relied
                    upon by Mr Bull of the purported representations of fact by Mdm Fock –
                    <em>viz</em>, that the Property belonged entirely to the
                    Defendant and he could do whatever he wanted with the Property – was given
                    by Augustine and the Defendant’s daughter. First, Mdm Fock had apparently
                    told the Defendant’s daughter on several occasions that the Property
                    belonged to “[the Defendant] and us and there was no point in spending
                    money on repairs to her bedroom.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> The
                    Defendant’s daughter stated in her affidavit that Mdm Fock never once
                    mentioned the Trust Deed and had instead always maintained that the Property
                    belonged to the Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> Second,
                    when Mdm Fock returned the certificate of title to the Property to Augustine in
                    2002, Mdm Fock apparently said to Augustine that the Property belonged to the
                        Defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Against their evidence is the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff’s evidence that Mdm Fock had
                    previously stated that she wanted to “<em>die in her own
                        house</em> [emphasis in original]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> Also, Mdm Fock had told the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff that she was worried about
                        “<em>signing the property away</em> [emphasis in
                    original]” whenever the Defendant requested her to sign documents when
                    she was still a director of the family companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> The
                        1<sup>st</sup><sup></sup>Plaintiff too attested that when Mdm Fock became ill, she declined
                    to move to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff’s house, saying
                        “<em>[t]his [the Property] is my house, why should I
                        move?</em> [emphasis in original]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    There is no gainsaying that the testimonies
                    of both parties’ witnesses are self-serving and must be viewed with some
                    circumspection. In the end, the burden is on the Defendant to prove that Mdm
                    Fock had conducted herself in a manner which suggests that she had <em>unequivocally</em> represented as a fact that the Property
                    belonged to the Defendant beneficially. I am unable to find in favour of the
                    Defendant on this count. Even if I accept (which I do not) that Mdm Fock may
                    have given Augustine and the Defendant’s daughter the impression that the
                    Defendant could renovate the Property as he wished, that falls short of an
                        <em>unequivocal</em> representation of fact to the
                    Defendant that the Trust Deed was a sham document and, therefore, the Defendant,
                    as the registered legal owner, was in fact the legal and beneficial owner of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Taking the Defendant’s case at its
                    highest, even if Mdm Fock had so conducted herself as to unequivocally represent
                    that the Property belonged to the Defendant beneficially, I find that the
                    Defendant did not rely on her conduct in contributing towards the various
                    expenses and renovations of the Property. This is quite apart from the point
                    made earlier that he could not have been induced into thinking that he was the
                    true beneficial owner of the Property because he must be taken to have known
                    that any such representation of fact was untrue. After 1987, the Property was
                    occupied by Mr Chng, Mdm Fock, the Defendant and his family. The
                    Defendant’s other siblings had already moved out. It was therefore not
                    abnormal that the Defendant would be responsible for the outgoings of the
                    household. The Defendant also admitted that as a filial son,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> he would still have paid for the renovations
                    even if the Property belonged to Mdm Fock beneficially.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> In other words, even if the beneficial interest
                    was vested in Mdm Fock and the Defendant knew and accepted this, there is no
                    reason to expect that the Defendant would not have paid for the household
                    expenses. I do not agree, therefore, that he paid for the expenses and
                    renovations of the Property in reliance on any representations of fact by Mdm
                    Fock that he was the beneficial owner of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Hence, I find that the Defendant was not
                    misled by any of Mdm Fock’s representation to the effect that the Trust
                    Deed was a sham and that factually, he was both the legal and beneficial owner
                    of the Property. The Defendant therefore cannot invoke any estoppel by
                    representation to resist the Plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Proprietary estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    A claim in proprietary estoppel will only
                    arise where (<em>Hong Leong at</em> [170]; <em>Wilken and Villiers at</em> para 11.02):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     the claimant detrimentally relies
                        on a belief or expectation that he has or will be granted rights over an
                        item of property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     in circumstances where the owner of the property acquiesces in or
                        encourages the claimant’s belief or expectation;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_c"></a>(c)     it would be
                        unconscionable in all the circumstances to deny the claimant the
                        remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    First, I have difficulty finding clear
                    evidence that Mdm Fock had conducted herself in such a manner that would
                    reasonably have allowed the Defendant to come to only one conclusion, <em>viz</em>, that Mdm Fock had chosen to forego her rights under
                    the genuine Trust Deed. It is an inescapable fact that Mdm Fock continued
                    to keep the genuine Trust Deed in her possession very carefully in her UOB safe
                    deposit box together with other important documents till her death in November
                    2009. This does not seem to me to be the behaviour of someone who was never
                    going to rely on the Trust Deed. Mdm Fock did not tear up or destroy the
                    Trust Deed or hand it over to the Defendant for him to do whatever he wanted
                    with it, including destroying it at any time that it was convenient for him to
                    do so. The Defendant must also have known that Mdm Fock never gave him the Trust
                    Deed, but continued to safeguard it. Yet, he did not do anything about it.
                    Second, while I accept that the Defendant had expended sizeable sums on the
                    maintenance, upkeep and renovation of the Property, it cannot be gainsaid that
                    the Defendant, Augustine and their children were the main occupants. That these
                    expenditures were borne by the Defendant was therefore, as Mr Yeo puts it,
                    unsurprising. I do not find a clear link showing that the Defendant’s
                    expenditure of these monies on the Property was to his detriment and was also
                    only because of his detrimental reliance on an unequivocal acquiescence or
                    encouragement given to him by Mdm Fock that she was not going to enforce her
                    rights under the genuine Trust Deed. Third, the major obstacle which the
                    Defendant faced, particularly in the context of seeking proprietary estoppel,
                    was in showing that Mdm Fock had acted so unconscionably that to deny the
                    Defendant the remedy of proprietary estoppel would be itself unconscionable. I
                    have not seen sufficient evidence which suggests that Mdm Fock even knew of the
                    Defendant’s belief or expectation that he was the beneficial owner of the
                    Property. <em>A fortiori</em>, if Mdm Fock did not know
                    that the Defendant had such a belief or expectation, she could not have
                    acquiesced in or encouraged him to act on his belief or expectation. It may well
                    be that the Defendant mistakenly thought that he was the beneficial owner, and
                    therefore expended all these sums towards improving the Property. But, unless
                    and until Mdm Fock also knew of his mistaken belief or expectation and
                    accordingly acted in a manner to encourage him to continue subscribing to that
                    mistaken belief or expectation, I cannot see how there can be any
                    unconscionability on the part of Mdm Fock and I cannot see how a proprietary
                    estoppel can arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Estoppel by convention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    For an estoppel by convention to operate,
                    the following elements must be present (see <em>Singapore
                        Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R)
                    195 at [28]; reaffirmed in <em>Travista Development Pte Ltd v Tan
                        Kim Swee Augustine and others</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at
                    [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_a"></a>(a)     the parties must have acted on
                        “an assumed and incorrect state of fact of law” in their
                        course of dealing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_b"></a>(b)     the assumption must be either shared by both parties pursuant to an
                        agreement or something akin to an agreement, or made by one party and
                        acquiesced to by the other; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_107-p2_c"></a>(c)     it must be unjust and unconscionable to allow the
                        parties (or one of them) to go back on that assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The assumed and incorrect state of facts
                    suggested by Mr Bull is that Mdm Fock and the Defendant had all along assumed
                    that the Defendant was the beneficial owner of the Property notwithstanding the
                    Trust Deed. This was a shared assumption because the Defendant had expended huge
                    sums of money on the household expenses and renovation costs throughout the
                    years. Mr Bull also relied on the same purported representations made by Mdm
                    Fock to Augustine and the Defendant’s daughter to show that there was such
                    an assumed state of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Mr Yeo had two responses. The first was
                    already canvassed in relation to estoppel by representation, namely, that an
                    estoppel by convention cannot arise as the Estoppel Argument based on a genuine
                    Trust Deed is an alternative to the Sham Argument based on a non-genuine Trust
                    Deed. If the Sham Argument is rejected and the Trust Deed is regarded as
                    genuine, then the Defendant could not have acted on a wrongly assumed state of
                    facts since he must be taken to have known that the beneficial ownership of the
                    Property was truly vested in Mdm Fock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> As I have already adverted
                    to, even though it is my finding that the Trust Deed was genuine and that the
                    Defendant must be taken to have known that the beneficial interest in the
                    Property vested in Mdm Fock at the time of the execution of the Trust Deed, it
                    is possible that both the Defendant and Mdm Fock genuinely forgot about the
                    Trust Deed subsequently. In that case, if both had a mistaken and wrong
                    apprehension as to the true beneficial owner of the Property arising from the
                    fact that the Defendant was the registered owner of the Property, and had
                    conducted themselves in a manner which suggested to the Defendant that he was
                    the beneficial owner (when in fact he was not), I do not see why, in principle,
                    an estoppel by convention cannot arise. Therefore, on this point, I am with Mr
                        Bull.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> The Defendant could, as a matter of
                    fact, have been honestly mistaken as to his rights in the Property, with the
                    corollary that an estoppel by convention might have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The question is whether, on the facts, there
                    was indeed such an assumed incorrect state of facts which was honestly shared by
                    both the Defendant and Mdm Fock such that it would be unconscionable to now
                    allow the Plaintiffs, on behalf of Mdm Fock’s estate, to resile from that
                    incorrectly assumed state of facts. For the reasons which I have given above (at
                    [100]–[102]), I agree with Mr Yeo’s other submission that the
                    representations relied upon by Mr Bull are equivocal and do not support the
                    assumed incorrect state of facts contended by the Defendant. Likewise, as I have
                    just explained (at [103] and [106] above), the Defendant’s expenditure on
                    the upkeep, maintenance and renovation of the Property also do not demonstrate
                    that there was an assumed incorrect state of facts that the Defendant was the
                    beneficial owner of the Property. The defence of estoppel by convention
                    therefore fails as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Estoppel by acquiescence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In <em>Nasaka Industries (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Aspac Aircargo Services Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 817,
                    Judith Prakash J held (at [70]) that to raise estoppel by acquiescence, five
                    circumstances must be present:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_a"></a>(a)     the party seeking the estoppel must
                        be mistaken as to his own legal rights;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_b"></a>(b)     the party seeking the estoppel must expend
                        money or do some act on the faith of his mistaken belief;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_c"></a>(c)     the party being estopped must know of
                        his own rights;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_d"></a>(d)     the party being estopped must know of the other party’s
                        mistaken belief; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_111-p2_e"></a>(e)     the party being estopped must encourage the other party in his
                        expenditure of money or other act, either directly or by abstaining from
                        asserting his legal right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The fourth limb of the test is not satisfied
                    in the present case. There is simply no evidence that Mdm Fock knew of the
                    Defendant’s mistaken belief that the beneficial interest in the Property
                    belonged to him (see [106] above). It is one thing to say that Mdm Fock herself
                    was mistaken (which I do not find was established to be the case). It is
                    another, and more onerous burden, to say that Mdm Fock knew that the Defendant
                    was mistaken as to his rights over the Property (which I also do not find to be
                    proved). Thus, I find that no estoppel by acquiescence arises on the
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Hence, none of the estoppels relied on by
                    the Defendant lie against the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    For the above reasons, I allow the
                    Plaintiffs’ claim. Subject to the parties writing to the court within
                    seven days to be heard on costs, I further order that the costs of the
                    Plaintiffs are to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
