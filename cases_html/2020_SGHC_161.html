Currently, according to the Company’s business profile on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) website, the only director of the Company is OTC: the ACRA profile shows that he was appointed as director on 30 December 2015.  It is not disputed that prior to OTC’s appointment on 30 December 2015, he was appointed as a director of the Company between 3 July 1984 and 14 April 2001.  In the present suit, OHC alleged that OTC also acted as a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> and/or shadow director of the Company in the period between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015

It is not disputed that for most of the period when OBC served as a director of the Company from the late 1990s to 30 December 2015, he was also running his own property development business, which was unrelated to the Tong Garden business.  In so far as the running of the Company was concerned, OHC alleged in the present suit that OBC was “accustomed to act[ing] on the directions and/or instructions and/or influence and/or wishes” of OTC in the period between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015

OHC sought an order for OTC and OBC to buy out his shares “without discount” and at a price which would factor in “appropriate adjustments to offset the effects of the oppressive conduct”; or in the alternative, an order for OTC to transfer to him shares (the number “to be determined”) in two Thai entities controlled by OTC (Tong Garden Co Ltd and NOI Food Industry Co Ltd) and in two other companies set up by OTC (Tong Garden Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Tong Garden Food (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the end of the trial, I dismissed OHC’s claims against OTC and OBC and ordered him to pay them costs.

The late Mr Ong set up a sole proprietorship, Tong Garden Product Services, in the 1960s, to sell snack food under the “Tong Garden” brand (“Tong Garden Business”).  In 1980, the Company – Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd – was incorporated.  It grew to become the ultimate holding company for a number of subsidiaries and associated companies (which the parties have referred to collectively as the “Tong Garden Group”) involved in the manufacture, marketing and sale of various snack products such as nuts, seeds and dried fruits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Over the years, several of the siblings joined the Tong Garden Business – including OHC, OTC, OBC, OSA, and their eldest brother Ong Leong Chuan (“OLC”).  It is not disputed that the late Mr Ong remained in sole control of the business until he became ill in early 1984.  He passed away on 24 July 1984.  OHC, OTC, OBC and OSA are currently the only four shareholders of the Company after multiple changes in shareholdings over the years, these changes having resulted from “a multitude of legal actions between the siblings” and from sales by siblings uninvolved in running the Company of their shares to other siblings

Where the parties differed was in their characterisation of the Company’s financial health at the time the allegedly oppressive acts were carried out – and, in that connection, their characterisation of the purpose and nature of these transactions.  Broadly speaking, OHC’s case was premised on the Company having been a financially viable – indeed, a “flourishing”

According to this narrative, OTC and OBC were the villains who “surreptitiously” engineered the diversion of the Company’s business and assets in order to benefit OTC and/or OBC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 According to OTC and OBC, however, the Company – and the wider Tong Garden Group – had long been mired in financial difficulties.  According to their narrative, things had gotten so dire that by 2007, none of the Ong siblings wanted anything more to do with the Tong Garden business as they saw it as a sinking ship.  It was in this context that OBC – then the majority shareholder and one of only two remaining directors of the Company – had approached OTC for help.  The transactions on which OHC relied in advancing his oppression claim were in fact part of a larger effort to wind down the entire Group’s business in an orderly manner, while preserving the reputation and standing of the brand started by their father.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Thirdly, OTC and OBC took the position that in any event, the acts which OHC complained of in the present suit – even if proven – were wrongs done to the Company and not to any individual shareholder of the Company.  In other words, OHC had suffered no loss or harm in his personal capacity other than an alleged diminution in the value of his shares; and his use of s 216 of the Companies Act in these circumstances constituted an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I will deal with the first set of transactions which – according to OHC – constituted oppressive acts carried out by OTC and OBC against him.

It was also agreed as part of these distributorship agreements that the profits from the sale and distribution of the products would be shared among the various entities in the following proportions: 60% to Tong Garden Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd or Tong Garden Marketing Sdn Bhd (as the case might be), and the remaining 40% to Food Products (S) or Snack Food (M) (as the case might be). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Aside from the allegations about the “misappropriation” of “extremely valuable intangible assets such as technical knowhow and distribution networks”, OHC also pointed to invoices showing, firstly, that Food Products (S) had seconded staff to Tong Garden Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd for the periods August to December 2008 and January to December 2009 (excluding November 2009); secondly, that Tong Garden Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd had rented motor vehicles and office premises from Food Products (S) between June and December 2008

As a holding company that had no manufacturing or trading activity of its own, the Company derived its revenue – and therefore its financial viability, indeed its very value – from its investments in the businesses of its subsidiaries and associated companies.  Financial trouble in those subsidiaries and associated companies could only spell trouble for the finances of the Tong Garden Group and of the Company itself – especially when the subsidiary in question was the Tong Garden Group’s main operating entity in Singapore.  It was precisely because of these very shaky finances that the siblings then running the Company (OHC, OSA, later OBC, at times OTC) were preoccupied with finding ways to raise funds.  In addition to bank borrowings, attempts were also made between the late 1990s and 2007 to raise funds by other means: for example, by means of rights issues (two in 1999), and by multiple loans advanced by OBC to the various subsidiaries

According to OTC, although no First Schedule was attached to the 2001 Thailand SPA, it was “understood by all parties that [he] was to purchase the Parent Company’s 39.99% shareholding in Tong Garden (T)”: the reason why the term “Territory” in clause 1 of the agreement was defined so as to include countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam was to “enable [him] to use the ‘Tong Garden’ and ‘NOI’ trademarks in these countries”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 OTC also gave evidence that the sale of shares stipulated in the two agreements was not formalised because of disagreement over an inter-company loan owing by Tong Garden (T) to the Company.

It was in this context that he entered into the Variation Agreement with the Company on 20 July 2009.  As far as he and OBC (who represented the Company) were concerned, the Variation Agreement did not change any of the material terms of the 2001 Thailand SPA.  In particular, no change was made to the provision in the 2001 Thailand SPA that the purchase consideration for the Tong Garden (T) shares was to be based on the NTA of Tong Garden (T) as at 31 December 2000.  This was because the parties themselves had always contemplated that they would be bound by the provisions in the 2001 Thailand SPA even though the NTA of Tong Garden (T) as at 31 December 2000 would not actually be determined until sometime after the execution of the agreement

</div>.  As for the valuation of the Tong Garden (T) shares, a firm of valuers (CC Koh &amp; Co) was engaged to prepare a valuation report on the fair market value of the shares based on Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 2000 – as per the provisions of the 2001 Thailand SPA.  It was the valuers’ opinion that the shares had negative value as at 31 December 2000 in light of Tong Garden (T)’s negative NTA at that date.  That Tong Garden (T)’s NTA was negative as at 31 December 2000 was also evident from the company’s audited accounts and other documents

</div>; and yet he had not raised any objections or expressed any consternation until the present litigation.  In the circumstances, there was no basis for OHC to complain about the CCK valuation and/or the Valuation Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of OTC’s and OBC’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 To sum up, therefore: OTC’s and OBC’s position was that the transactions impugned by OHC were genuine transactions for which there were valid commercial reasons.  Neither OTC nor OBC had committed any breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors of the Company.  Moreover, OHC had known of these transactions for years prior to the present litigation and had not raised any objections for years.  In particular, he had been contemporaneously aware of the 2008 restructuring exercise but had not protested then, nor for years afterwards.  His present claim for minority oppression had come about only after he realised that OTC had made a success of the 2008 restructuring and that the new companies set up by OTC were doing well.  That OHC’s claim of oppression was not genuine and was motivated by greed was seen, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, in his asking – by way of his prayer for “alternative” relief – to be given shares in OTC’s new companies.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In any event, OTC and OBC contended that even assuming the breaches of fiduciary duties alleged by OHC were made out, they constituted wrongs done to the Company: OHC himself could not claim to have suffered any loss other than a diminution in the value of his shares in the Company, which was purely reflective of the Company’s loss.  His claim, despite being cloaked in the rhetoric of minority oppression, was thus in reality a claim to vindicate corporate wrongs and recover reflective loss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law: The general principles applicable to claims of minority oppression</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Having summarised each side’s narrative as to the alleged acts of oppression, I set out below the general principles applicable to claims under s 216 of the Companies Act.  There is no real dispute as between the two sides about what these principles are.  In <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) agreed with the first-instance judge that there was “no meaningful distinction” between the four limbs of injustice to minorities countenanced in s 216: the “common thread” under s 216 is “some element of unfairness which would justify the invocation of the court’s jurisdiction under s 216” (at [77]).  In this connection, the CA cited the judgment of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Re Kong Thai Sawmill (Miri) Sdn Bhd</span> [1978] 2 MLJ 227, a case on appeal from the Federal Court of Malaysia concerning the application of the Malaysian equivalent of our s 216.  In that case, Lord Wilberforce held (at 229) – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [F]or the case to be brought within s 181(1)(a) [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Malaysian equivalent of our s 216] at all, the complaint must identify and prove “oppression” or “disregard”.  The mere fact that one or more of those managing the company possess a majority of the voting power and, in reliance upon that power, make policy or executive decisions, with which the complainant does not agree, is not enough.  Those who take interests in companies limited by shares have to accept majority rule.  It is only when majority rule passes over into rule oppressive of the minority, or in disregard of their interests, that the section can be invoked. … <span class="font-italic">there must be a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect before a case of oppression can be made</span> (<span class="font-italic">Elder v Elder &amp; Watson Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>1952 SC 49): <span class="font-italic">their Lordships would place the emphasis on </span><span class="font-italic">“visible”.  And similarly “disregard” involves something more than a failure to take account of the minority’s interest: there must be awareness of that interest and an evident decision to override it or brush it aside or to set at naught the proper company procedure</span> (per Lord Clyde in <span class="font-italic">Thompson v Drysdale</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>1925 SC 311, 315). … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen Holdings Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals</span> [2016] 1 SLR 373 (“<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span>”), the CA held (at [88]) that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the essence of a claim for relief on the ground of oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct lies in upholding the commercial agreement between the shareholders of a company.  This is irrespective of whether the agreement is found in the formal constitutional documents of the company, in less formal shareholders’ agreements or, in the case of quasi-partnerships, in the legitimate expectations of the shareholders … The role of [s 216] was, and still remains, that of remedying differences which sometimes inevitably arise as a consequence of persons associating for an economic purpose through the corporate form of a company.  Section 216 is concerned with protecting the commercial expectations of the parties to such an association. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The special treatment of quasi-partnerships was explained in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>.  There, the CA noted (at [78]) that while a court in deciding whether to grant relief under s 216 will usually consider the legal rights and the legitimate expectations of members as enshrined in the company’s constitution, a special class of quasi-partnership companies form an exception to this rule.  In such cases, shareholders may have enforceable expectations which do not emanate from any articles of association and which are not necessarily submerged in the company’s structure, but which arise from considerations of a personal character between one individual and another that may make it unjust or inequitable to insist on legal rights or to exercise them in a particular way (at [79]).  In the context of quasi-partnerships, the courts have “consistently applied a stricter yardstick of scrutiny because of the peculiar vulnerability of minority shareholders in such companies” (at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, however, OHC has been clear that he does <span class="font-italic">not</span> allege the Company to be a quasi-partnership.  He has been clear that his case is <span class="font-italic">not</span> based on equitable considerations arising from some personal relationship of mutual confidence between him, OTC and OBC.  While each of the four siblings has at one point or another during these proceedings referred to the business of the Company (and of the Tong Garden Group) as “the family business”, it was evident from the outset that such references to “the family business” meant no more than that the shareholders of the Company were members of the same family.  In this respect, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Leong Chee Kin</span><span class="font-italic"> (on behalf of himself and as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd) v Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd and others </span>[2017] SGHC 192 (“<span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span>”) has noted that it is not the case that a minority oppression claim can succeed only where equitable considerations are superimposed or where the court finds that the company is a quasi-partnership (at [51]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… s 216 of the [Companies] Act is wide enough to encompass companies of different types.  But a claim in minority oppression is often more difficult to establish where no equitable considerations are superimposed.  This is because in the absence of equitable considerations, the unfairness of a party’s conduct must be measured against legitimate expectations arising from the members’ legal rights and the company’s constitution … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In this connection, the wrong which a claimant in s 216 proceedings seeks to vindicate must be a wrong done to him in his personal capacity as a minority shareholder – as opposed to a wrong done to the company. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> pointed out (at [81]–[83]), this conceptual distinction between personal rights and corporate rights is the result of two rules.  The first is the proper plaintiff rule, which states that “only a company can sue for losses that it has suffered, because a company is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders”.  An important exception to this rule is the statutory derivative action provided under s 216A of the Companies Act, which allows a shareholder to obtain leave of court to bring an action on the company’s behalf for a wrong done to the company.  The other side of the proper plaintiff rule is the rule against recovery of reflective loss, which states that “a person may not initiate an action to recover a loss which he has suffered by virtue of a diminution in the value of his shares in a company which merely reflects the company’s own loss and for which the company can be made whole if it were to pursue its rights against the party responsible for that loss”.  As the court in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> noted (at [83]), the proper plaintiff rule and the reflective loss principle – taken together – require that a breach of a right vested in a shareholder be vindicated at the suit of the shareholder, whereas a breach of a right vested in the company ought to be vindicated at the suit of the company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 This delineation between personal wrongs and corporate wrongs – and the applicability (or not) of s 216 in each case – was considered at length by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>, Sakae Holdings Ltd (“Sakae”) was the minority shareholder in the company Griffin Real Estate Investment Holdings Pte Ltd (“Griffin”), while Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (“GREIC”) was the majority shareholder.  Sakae, GREIC and Griffin entered into a joint venture agreement (“JVA”) whereby Griffin was intended to be the vehicle through which the parties would invest in certain properties, redevelop them and sell them at a profit.  Sakae brought proceedings under s 216 against the shareholders of GREIC – Andy Ong, Ong Han Boon and Ho Yew Kong.  Sakae alleged that they had acted in a manner oppressive to its interests as a minority shareholder by engaging in transactions that caused a substantial amount of moneys to be diverted from Griffin to companies in the ERC Group which was owned and controlled by Andy Ong.  One of the issues in contention during the trial was whether Sakae’s oppression claims were properly brought under s 216 in that they pertained to personal wrongs committed against it, or whether this was really a case of corporate wrongs committed against Griffin which ought instead to be vindicated by way of a derivative action under s 216A of the Companies Act.  The trial judge held that Sakae’s oppression claims were properly brought under s 216.  In upholding her decision, the CA reaffirmed its decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>”) that s 216 should not be used to vindicate essentially corporate wrongs, for two broad reasons (at [85]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… First, an overly permissive interpretation of s 216 allowing it to be invoked to vindicate wrongs to a company would be contrary to the legislative scheme, which provided for the commencement of a statutory derivative action on behalf of the company (subject to its own built-in safeguards) under s 216A to remedy such wrongs.  Second, permitting an essentially corporate wrong to be pursued by way of an oppression action under s 216 would be an abuse of process as it improperly circumvented the proper plaintiff rule, and might result in the aggrieved shareholder who brought a s 216 action recovering damages at the expense of other similarly affected shareholders, who could otherwise have benefitted too if the action had properly been brought on behalf of the company under s 216A … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As it had done in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kek Wee</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> the CA acknowledged that “the distinction between personal complaints of oppression and complaints of wrongs against a company was not always clear, and this was compounded by the fact that under s 216, ‘the concept of commercial unfairness also appears to embrace wrongs done to the company’” (at [86]).  The CA held that where an oppression action features both personal wrongs and corporate wrongs – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115 … the key question to be addressed in [such] overlap cases may be framed in these terms: is a plaintiff who brings an oppression action under s 216, instead of seeking leave to commence a statutory derivative action under s 216A, abusing the process?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 … In our judgment, the appropriate analytical framework to ascertain whether a claim that is being pursued under s 216 is an abuse of process is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Injury</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">119 … In our judgment, an oppression action under s 216 should generally not be permitted where the essential (or, as the case may be, the sole) remedy sought is a remedy for <span class="font-italic">the company</span> (such as a restitutionary order in favour of the company).  Where that is the case, the presumptively appropriate remedy would be the statutory derivative action under s 216A.  In such a case, it will also be evident that the plaintiff’s primary purpose in bringing the action is not to obtain a remedy that brings to an end the situation by which it has been prejudiced or harmed as a shareholder.  In contrast, a plaintiff who seeks an essential remedy directed at bringing to an end the oppressive conduct which it has been subjected to as a shareholder will likely be permitted to pursue its claim by way of an oppression action under s 216 even if, as part of that essential remedy, it also seeks remedies in favour of the company such as restitutionary orders.  This will readily be seen to be the case where the remedies sought by the plaintiff, such as a share buyout or a winding-up order, will be impacted by suitable restitutionary orders in favour of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">120 At the same time, we do not think the question of whether an action under s 216 amounts to an abuse of process can be resolved by focusing solely on the essential remedy sought by the plaintiff …  To properly invoke s 216, the plaintiff would have to identify the real injury which it has suffered and establish that that injury does amount to oppressive conduct against it as a shareholder.  In this regard, it will be relevant to examine how the real injury which the plaintiff suffers as a <span class="font-italic">shareholder</span> is distinct from and not merely incidental to the injury which the <span class="font-italic">company</span> suffers. … The crucial question in such a case is whether the plaintiff shareholder can demonstrate an injury to it that is distinct from the wrong done to the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Applying the above analytical framework to the facts of <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>, the CA was satisfied that Sakae’s oppression claims related to personal wrongs committed against it and hence were claims that were properly pursued by way of an action under s 216 as opposed to a statutory derivative action under s 216A (at [124]).  The CA’s reasoning in this respect was instructive.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 On the question of <span class="font-italic">injury</span>, the CA agreed with the trial judge’s finding that Sakae’s rights had been carefully negotiated for in the JVA and/or other documents executed at the inception of the parties’ joint venture (at [125]).  The CA also agreed with the trial judge’s finding that there had been systemic abuse by Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon in relation to the management of Griffin’s affairs in that they had misappropriated large sums from Griffin without Sakae’s knowledge.  While such conduct undoubtedly constituted a wrong against Griffin, the CA was satisfied that it also separately amounted to a distinct personal wrong against the minority shareholder, Sakae.  In coming to this conclusion, the CA considered the following factors to be relevant.  Firstly, Sakae had entered into the joint venture as an investor and had provided funding for the joint venture: it would clearly have been Sakae’s legitimate expectation that its funds would not be mismanaged, much less siphoned away in the way it was done by Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon.  Secondly, it was also clear that Sakae had let Andy Ong and his team manage Griffin’s affairs because of the long-standing friendship between Andy Ong and Douglas Foo (“Foo”), the chairman of Sakae’s board.  Andy Ong knew that Foo – and by extension, Sakae – trusted him.  He deliberately took advantage of that trust, using Griffin as a vehicle through which he cheated Sakae.  In addition to the misappropriation of substantial funds, he and Ong Han Boon also engaged in fraudulent schemes by concocting sham documents to mislead Sakae and to conceal the true nature of the transactions.  The result was that there were “systemic abuses which benefitted one group of shareholders (namely, GREIC and, subsequently, ERC Holdings as well, both of which were controlled by Andy Ong at the material time) at the expense of the other (namely, Sakae)”.  In the CA’s view, therefore, the real injury which Sakae sought to vindicate was the injury to its investment in the joint venture and the breach of its legitimate expectations as to how Griffin’s affairs generally and its financial investment in Griffin in particular would be managed (at [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Turning next to the question of <span class="font-italic">remedy</span>, the essential remedy sought by Sakae was to exit the JVA.  In its statement of claim, it had prayed for either a winding up of Griffin or a buyout of its shares in Griffin.  In the CA’s view (at [128]), either remedy offered the only way in which Sakae could exit the joint venture with as little loss as possible and thereby meaningfully vindicate the real injury that it had suffered; namely, the misuse of its investment in Griffin and the breach of its expectations as to how Griffin would be managed.  Further, these remedies were only available in a s 216 action.  Although Sakae had additionally prayed for relief in the form of restitutionary orders against Andy Ong, Ong Han Boon and Ho Yew Kong, these orders did not constitute the essential remedy sought: rather, they were necessary in so far as they helped to ensure a fair value exit for Sakae, in that any restitution received would go directly to Griffin, such that on its winding up, all its shareholders (including Sakae) would receive the appropriate and due realisation of their investment in Griffin.  This outcome would also avert the risk of multiple claims being brought against Andy Ong and the others, as well as the risk of prejudice to the shareholders and creditors of Griffin.  Seen in this light, and given especially Sakae’s desire to wind up Griffin, any benefit that accrued to Griffin from Sakae’s oppression action was purely incidental to the essential remedy which Sakae sought – which was to bring to an end the matters that it complained of on the fairest terms possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In the circumstances, the CA concluded that it was not an abuse of process for Sakae to pursue its oppression claims by way of a s 216 action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 It should be additionally noted that “[a]lthough s 216(2) [of the Companies Act] confers on the court an extensive discretion to “make such order as it thinks fit”, the CA has cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) at [158] that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… any order granted must be made with a view to bringing an end to or remedying the matters complained of: <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon </span>([131] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 5.96.  The purpose of s 216 is to relieve minority oppression, not to proscribe majority rule.  It is for that reason that in most cases, the only practical mechanism to end minority oppression is a corporate divorce where one party buys the other out. …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>, the relief sought by the claimant (PPL Holdings) in its s 216 action was the invalidation of certain resolutions which the directors nominated by the majority shareholder had passed.  The CA held that given the gravely deteriorated state of the relationship between the parties, such an order could not possibly be an appropriate remedy in this case, even assuming the grounds of oppression relied upon were made out.  Among other things, there was a “real and present risk of further disputes … over the validity of resolutions owing to the fractious relationship between the parties”: invalidating the several resolutions highlighted by PPL Holdings would not go very far in redressing its underlying complaint of minority oppression.  Having concluded that the relief sought by PPL Holdings was not an appropriate remedy, the CA found it unnecessary to reach a decision on whether the substantive grounds under s 216 of the Companies Act were established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues in contention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It will be recalled that OHC’s claim of minority oppression was based on his “legitimate expectations” as to how the Company should be run.  These “legitimate expectations” were said to arise from his “legal rights” under “the Articles of Association of the Company, Section 157 of the Companies Act (Cap 50), common law and/or equity”, in so far as they formed the sources for duties imposed on OTC and OBC as directors of the Company

However, OTC disputed firstly that he was a director of the Company at the time the allegedly oppressive acts took place.  ACRA records showed that he was appointed a director of the Company between 3 July 1984 and 14 April 2001, and re-appointed as director on 30 December 2015; and he rejected OHC’s assertion that he was either a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> or a shadow director in the period between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015 when the allegedly oppressive acts were carried out

In this connection, as I alluded to earlier, each side’s opposing characterisation of the nature of these transfers and disposals was premised on the view they took of the Company’s solvency, the viability of its business, and the value of its assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Thirdly, even assuming the various transfers and disposals were found to have been carried out in breach of their directors’ duties, OTC and OBC contended that these breaches really amounted to wrongs against the Company and not against OHC in his personal capacity as a minority shareholder.  As such, even if they were held to be in breach of their directors’ duties, the appropriate course of action was for a statutory derivative action to be pursued under s 216A of the Companies Act; and it was an abuse of process for OHC to bring an oppression claim under s 216.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Fourthly, contrary to OHC’s claim that he had only found out about the various transfers and disposals “in December 2015”

My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 At the outset, it should be noted that whether someone is a <span class="font-italic">de jure</span>, <span class="font-italic">de facto</span>, or shadow director, he owes the same duties to the company under the Companies Act and at general law: see in this respect the definition of “director” in s 4(1) of the Companies Act and also the judgment of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings Ltd v Gryphon </span><span class="font-italic">Real Estate Investment Corp Pte Ltd and others (Foo Peow Yong Douglas, third party) and another suit</span> [2017] SGHC 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In so far as the definition of a “<span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director” is concerned, this has been clearly explained by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Hock Eng Peter and others</span><span class="font-italic"> (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties)</span> [2010] SGHC 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>”).  In that case, Chan Seng Onn J noted that there did not appear to have been any local judicial pronouncement on the exact meaning of the term.  Having reviewed the relevant English and Australian authorities, he cited with approval the applicable principles as set out by Jonathan Gaunt QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court) in <span class="font-italic">Gemma Ltd v Davies </span>[2008] BCC 812 as follows (at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) To establish that a person was a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of a company, it is necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director (per Millett J. in <span class="font-italic">Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd (in liq.)</span> [1994] BCC 161 at 163).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) It is not a necessary characteristic of a de facto director that he is held out as a director; such “holding out” may, however, be important evidence in support of the conclusion that a person acted as a director in fact (per Etherton J. in <span class="font-italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Hollier</span> [2006] EWHC 1804 (Ch); [2007] BCC 11 at [66]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Holding out is not a sufficient condition either. What matters is not what he called himself but what he did (per Lewison J. in <span class="font-italic">Re Mea Corp Ltd</span> [2006] EWHC 1846 (Ch); [2007] BCC 288).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) It is necessary for the person alleged to be a de facto<span class="font-italic"> </span>director to have participated in directing the affairs of the company (Hollier (above) at [68]) on an equal footing with the other director(s) and not in a subordinate role (above at [68] and [69] explaining dicta of Timothy Lloyd Q.C. in <span class="font-italic">Re Richborough Furniture Ltd</span> [1996] BCC 155 at 169–170).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) The person in question must be shown to have assumed the status and functions of a company director and to have exercised “real influence” in the corporate governance of the company (per Robert Walker L.J. in <span class="font-italic">Re Kaytech International Plc </span>[1999] BCC 390).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) If it is unclear whether the acts of the person in question are referable to an assumed directorship or to some other capacity, the person in question is entitled to the benefit of the doubt (per Timothy Lloyd Q.C. in <span class="font-italic">Re Richborough Furniture Ltd</span> (above)), but the court must be careful not to strain the facts in deference to this observation (per Robert Walker L.J. in <span class="font-italic">Kaytech</span> at 401).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the same judgement, Chan J also considered the concept of “shadow directors” and held that the test as to whether a person was a “shadow director” of a company was to be formulated as follows (at [45]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a “shadow director” is one “in accordance with whose instructions and directions the directors are accustomed to act”. By “accustomed”, this means that there must be a “pattern of behaviour” (per Lord Millet J in <span class="font-italic">Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd</span> [1994] BCC 161 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Hydrodam</span>”) at 163) on the part of the rest of the directors in complying with the shadow director’s directions or instructions. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Chan J added that he agreed with academic commentary to the effect that the word “accustomed” suggested “some degree of habit”: there must be some consistent pattern in the behaviour of compliance; and occasional instances of compliance would not be sufficient to satisfy the definition.  Equally, in the converse situation where there is such a pattern of compliance, the occasional exercise of independent judgment by the board should not excuse the alleged shadow director.  Chan J also made it clear that he found it unnecessary to introduce an element of “manipulation” or “puppeteering” into the definition of “shadow director” as the imposition of such additional requirements would defeat the <span class="font-italic">raison d’être</span> of this concept, which is to ensure that those who are responsible for the important corporate decisions of a company are held to task regardless of what they are called and their motives or manner in making such corporate decisions.  As Chan J put it (at [48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The test is, thus, simple: is there sufficient evidence showing that the directors of a corporation are accustomed to act on the directions or instructions of that person? If yes, then the status of a shadow director may be imputed to him. Whether the board has exercised its decision independently or otherwise is irrelevant and has to be so: otherwise, the rationale underpinning the “shadow director” concept would be subverted. It follows, therefore, that the shadow director is not necessarily a sinister puppeteer who is manipulating the board from the wings of a stage as our imaginations would have us believe. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Somewhat oddly, despite OHC having pleaded that OTC had acted either as a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> or a shadow director during the period 14 January 2008 to 29 December 2015, it was not clearly explained in the statement of claim what functions OTC was supposed to have undertaken in relation to the Company which could properly only be discharged by a director.  In his AEIC, OHC set out various acts by which OTC was alleged to have taken over control of the Company from 2008 onwards

It should be noted, however, that these events and acts related chiefly to the business and assets of subsidiary companies within the Tong Garden Group, rather than those of <span class="font-italic">the Company</span> itself; further, that only some of these were acts carried out by OTC.  No explanation was proffered by OHC in his AEIC, nor in the course of his testimony, as to how the above events and acts amounted to evidence of <span class="font-italic">OTC</span> having been either a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director or a shadow director of <span class="font-italic">the Company</span>.  For that matter, nothing emerged in the cross-examination of OTC and OBC which elucidated OHC’s case theory as to how OTC had acted either as a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director or a shadow director of the Company.  In particular, on the subject of shadow directors, it did not appear that OHC was able to pinpoint any specific piece of evidence which might establish that OBC had been “accustomed” to acting on the directions and instructions of OTC in the running of the Company.  If this was indeed what OHC was seeking to convey, it appeared to me to be conjecture; and tellingly, such a case theory was not actually explored with either OTC or OBC in cross-examination.  In the circumstances, I did not find any basis for concluding that OTC was a shadow director of the Company in the period between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I had somewhat more sympathy for the alternative argument that OTC was acting as a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of the Company.  Whilst the events and acts brought up in OHC’s AEIC (above) related mainly to subsidiaries such as Food Products (S) rather than to the Company <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, this was perhaps not surprising, given that the Company was a pure holding company which conducted no business of its own, and whose revenue was derived from its investments in the businesses of the subsidiaries and associated companies

OTC did not deny having made the various arrangements – the distributorship agreements, for example, and the secondment of Tong Garden Group employees to his own companies, as well as the purchase of equipment and other items from subsidiaries like Food Products (S).  Indeed, in his AEIC, he revealed that having agreed to OBC’s request to take over the running of the Tong Garden Group’s business, he made the decision to “let the Parent Company [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Company – Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd] and its subsidiaries become inactive and eventually wound up”

</div> – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With the involvement of OTC, I then, as before with OSA, left the running of the Tong Garden business to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 OTC has argued that he was simply stepping in to “clean up the mess that was [the late Mr Ong’s] Tong Garden Business” in the absence of any other Ong sibling’s willingness to do so and that instead of acting as a director of the Company, he was in effect acting as a manager.  I did not think this was an accurate description of the functions undertaken by OTC in the period between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015.  The decisions he took to let the Company and its subsidiaries become inactive and eventually to wind them up were decisions which were critical to the continued operation (or not) of the Company.  I did not think decisions on such existential issues could have been made and implemented by a mere “manager”.  In my view, these could only have been undertaken by a director of the Company.  The fact that OTC may not have held himself out as a director in the period between 2008 and 2015 is beside the point.  As Chan J remarked in <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span> ([116] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59] (quoting Lewison J in <span class="font-italic">Re Mea Corp Ltd</span> [2006] EWHC 1846 (Ch)), “what is important is not what he called himself, but what he did”.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For the reasons given above, I was prepared to accept that OTC was a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of the Company between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015.  As a director of the Company in that period, he was subject to the same duties of loyalty, honesty and diligence as OBC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether OTC and OBC acted in breach of their duties as directors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I next address the issue of whether OTC and OBC acted in breach of their duties as directors of the Company.  I found that they did not.  My reasons for coming to this conclusion were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 To recap, OHC’s case is that he had “legitimate expectations” that the directors of the Company would comply with the duties imposed on them as directors by various sources, including the Companies Act and common law; and that OTC and OBC breached these duties in carrying out the various impugned transfers, thereby breaching OHC’s “legitimate expectations”.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the plaintiff was the minority shareholder of the company Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd.  He brought a minority oppression claim against the defendants (who were the remaining directors and the majority shareholders) after being removed from his position as director and after discovering that the defendants had incorporated five new companies of their own to which they had diverted business away from Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd.  He relied on three grounds of oppression, one of which was the diversion of business.  In allowing the plaintiff’s claim on this particular ground, the High Court held (at [65]) that it was a “well-established principle” that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 … the directors of a company have a fiduciary duty to act in its best interests.  It follows from this that shareholders have a legitimate expectation that those in control of the company will act <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>in the best interests of the company.  That is especially so when the majority shareholders are themselves the directors.  These propositions were set out clearly by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison</span>.  In that case, he observed that, as a starting point, the legitimate expectations of shareholders must be analysed against the company’s constitution and the fiduciary duties imposed by the law …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Since keeping promises and honouring agreements is probably the most important element of commercial fairness, the starting point in any case under s 459 [equivalent to s 216 of the Act] will be to ask whether the conduct of which the shareholder complains was in accordance with the articles of association.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The answer to this question often turns on the fact that the powers which the shareholders have entrusted to the board are fiduciary powers, which must be exercised for the benefit of the company as a whole.  If the board act for some ulterior purpose, they step outside the terms of the bargain between the shareholders and the company. … [T]he fact that the board are protected by the principle of majority rule does not necessarily prevent their conduct from being unfair within the meaning of s 459. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Whether there has been a breach of a director’s fiduciary duties is thus a relevant, but not determinative, consideration in deciding whether there has been oppressive conduct.  In this respect, those in control of a company must act with valid commercial reasons when pursuing a company’s best interests … [T)he test is whether an honest and intelligent person in the position of the directors could objectively and reasonably conclude that the impugned acts were in the interests of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In so far as the diversion of business was concerned, the High Court held that “[t]he majority’s conduct in diverting business away from a company in which a complainant has a minority shareholding, without adequate justification”, would amount to oppressive conduct under s 216 of the Companies Act (at [67]).  On the evidence before it, the court rejected the defendants’ contention that they had valid commercial reasons for diverting business from Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd to their five new companies.  In the court’s view, the diversion – being without any valid commercial reason – was “contrary to the best interests of Ideal Design Studio”, and was “not only a breach of [the defendants’] fiduciary duties to Ideal Design Studio” but also “grossly commercially unfair to the plaintiff as a minority shareholder of Ideal Design Studio”.  The defendants were found to have “defeated the plaintiff’s legitimate expectation as a shareholder and [were] thus guilty of oppressive conduct within the meaning of s 216 of the [Companies] Act” (at [77]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 OHC sought to present his case as being very similar to <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), in that he too was complaining about the diversion of assets and business away from the Company to OTC’s companies, not for any valid commercial reason but (according to him) simply to benefit and enrich OTC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 I pause here to note that whilst the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> ([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) spoke only of a director’s fiduciary duties, in the present case OHC has pleaded – in addition to fiduciary duties on OTC’s and OBC’s part – a duty to “use reasonable diligence in the discharge of their duties”

</div> pursuant to s 157(1) of the Companies Act.   In this respect, it is not disputed that the relevant standard of care and diligence is objective: that is, whether the director has exercised the same degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The financial status of the Company in the period leading up to 2008 and thereafter</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The opposing narratives</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 By way of another recap: OTC’s and OBC’s assertion that they had valid commercial reasons for the impugned transfers – and OHC’s assertion that they had none – were based on competing narratives about the financial status of the Company in the period leading up to 2008 and afterwards.  OTC and OBC asserted that the Company – and the wider Tong Garden Group – had been struggling with considerable financial difficulties from 1999 through to 2008; and that these dire circumstances explained the efforts to wind down business operations in an orderly fashion via the 2008 restructuring exercise.  OHC, on the other hand, claimed that the Company had been a “flourishing” entity with “extremely valuable” assets which OTC and OBC had misappropriated for the benefit of OTC’s companies.  I found in favour of OTC’s and OBC’s version of events; and I was satisfied in the circumstances that they had valid commercial reasons for the various transfers.  I set out below my reasons for coming to these conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Why the solvency status of the Company was a point of contention</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 At the outset it should be noted that both OTC and OBC contended that the Company was insolvent in the period leading up to 2008 and certainly at the time the 15 March 2008 agreement was entered into.  Assuming they owed the Company duties as directors between 14 January 2008 and 29 December 2015, this issue of the Company’s solvency – or at least, of the gravity of its financial problems – was relevant to any consideration of the nature and extent of these duties.  As the High Court explained in <span class="font-italic">Parakou Shipping Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Liu Cheng Chan and others</span> [2017] SGHC 15 (“<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span>”, at [62]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where directors’ duties are concerned, it is axiomatic that directors have a duty to act in the interests of the company.  Generally, this refers to the interests of the company as a separate commercial entity which in many cases are very readily identified with the interests of its shareholders as a whole: Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Corporate Law</span>”) at para 09.045.  The company’s solvency status is relevant because “when a company is insolvent, or even in a parlous financial position, directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of the company’s creditors when making decisions for the company”: <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen</span>”) at [48].  The greater the concern over the company’s financial health, the more weight the directors must accord to the interests of creditors over those of the shareholders: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal </span>[2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty</span>”) at [34].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 To the above, it should be added that where a company is insolvent or in a parlous financial position, its directors’ fiduciary duty to “ensure that the company’s assets are not dissipated or exploited for their own benefit to the prejudice of creditors’ interests” is a duty owed to the company: there is no duty owed directly to the creditors (<span class="font-italic">Liquidators of Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Progen Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1089 at [48] and [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Both sides were also agreed that “[t]he cash flow test and the balance sheet test are well established tests for determining whether a company is solvent … [A] company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (the cash flow test) or if the value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities (the balance sheet test)” (<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span> at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 According to OTC and OBC, assuming they owed the Company fiduciary duties as directors at the time the allegedly oppressive acts took place, these duties included the duty to take into account the interests of creditors.  On the issue of solvency, it should also be noted that OTC’s and OBC’s position was that the Company was at the very least balance sheet insolvent at the material time.  As for cash flow insolvency, even if the Company itself could not be said to fall strictly within the definition of cash flow insolvency, its subsidiaries were cash flow insolvent – or faced severe cash flow issues; and these problems impacted adversely on the Company’s own finances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Not surprisingly, OHC denied that the Company was insolvent either before or at the point the allegedly oppressive acts occurred.  Nor did he even admit to the Company, or for that matter the Tong Garden Group, having any financial problems: according to him, “[t]here was no crisis”

</div>.  This state of affairs was also explained to OHC by the then Special Manager, one Tay Woon Teck, during an Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2003 when OHC asked why the 1999 audited accounts had not been consolidated.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Curiously, having previously declared in his capacity as director the belief that there were “no practical benefits” to be gained by the shareholders in having consolidated accounts prepared, OHC did not provide any coherent explanation for his insistence at trial on the need for one set of consolidated accounts.  He failed to explain how (if at all) the picture presented of the Company’s and/or the Tong Garden Group’s financial health by a set of consolidated accounts would differ from that presented by the existing financial statements.  In particular, he failed to demonstrate how a set of consolidated accounts would prove that the Company had actually been balance sheet solvent between 1999 and 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In this connection, it must be highlighted that before this matter came to trial, OHC already had the means to obtain the consolidated accounts.  Following several requests by OHC to the OA for the consolidated accounts of the Company, one Sebastian Chew (“Chew”) informed OHC on 17 June 2013

</div> that the OA’s office had consolidated the financials of the Company.  As the files were too large to be sent via e-mail, Chew suggested that OHC could either pay $800 to collect a set of these consolidated accounts from the OA’s office, or he could attend at the OA’s office to view these accounts and make a copy of the specific documents he required.  OHC replied to Chew on 18 June 2013 claiming that he was unable to pay $800 but would go to the OA’s office to scan the documents himself.  Astonishingly, however, it would appear that OHC never followed up to do so.  No such consolidated accounts were provided by him in discovery.  Nor were any such consolidated accounts provided to his expert, Mr Abuthahir, for the latter’s comments.  This would suggest that OHC either never bothered to obtain the consolidated accounts from the OA’s office – <span class="font-italic">or</span> that he <span class="font-italic">had</span> the accounts but did not want to disclose them.  When questioned about the matter in cross-examination, OHC blamed Chew (rather unfairly) for allegedly not replying to his e-mail of 18 June 2013, before conceding that he had <span class="font-italic">not</span> gone to the OA’s office but “cannot [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] remember the reason why [he] didn’t go there at that time”

</div>, the onus was on him to produce some evidence to support this claim.  Quite apart from failing to adduce in evidence the consolidated accounts, as I noted earlier, OHC failed to explain what sort of different picture such consolidated accounts would present of the Company’s financial status.  Certainly there was no evidence to suggest that consolidated accounts would result in a change in the negative NTA values recorded throughout the years in the Company’s audited financial statements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In the circumstances, I did not find it credible for OHC to argue that the absence of consolidated accounts precluded any finding of balance sheet insolvency based on the Company’s audited financial statements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The provisions for impairment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I next address OHC’s other arguments for objecting to a finding that the Company was balance sheet insolvent prior to and at the time the allegedly oppressive acts took place.  These concerned his objections to provisions for impairments which were made in the Company’s accounts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 At the outset, it must be highlighted that OHC’s position at trial regarding the questionable nature of the provisions for impairments was something which he had never pleaded in his statement of claim.  He should have pleaded it.  The alleged lack of basis for these provisions was a material fact on which OHC’s case depended.  It was critical to his case theory about the Company having been in good financial health and thus having been in no need of the 2008 restructuring exercise.  In my view, even if one were to overlook OHC’s procedural lapse in failing to plead this material fact, such failure – and the failure too to bring up the issue in his AEIC – must bespeak a certain lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> in the objections he subsequently raised at trial to the provisions for impairment.  Nevertheless, given that counsel for OTC and OBC addressed OHC’s arguments on these provisions at some length in their closing submissions, I will deal with the key points which were raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 It is not disputed that the $11m provision in June 1999 was what caused the Company to record negative NTA in that year, whereas in June 1998, the Company’s NTA had shown a positive value.

</div>, it was repeatedly suggested to OSA that the provisions for impairments in the Company’s accounts had to be made because of debts owed by Tong Garden (T) to Food Products (S) which the former failed to pay.  It was also suggested to OSA that Tong Garden (T)’s negative NTA – which OSA said was the factor leading her to propose to OBC a provision for the amount owed by Tong Garden (T) to Food Products (S) – “doesn’t mean anything” if Tong Garden (T) “actually had the ability to pay”

Despite her agreement with these suggestions during cross-examination by OHC’s counsel, when cross-examined by OTC’s counsel, OSA conceded that the inability of the Thai entities to pay the debts to Food Products (S) was not the only reason for the provision for impairment in June 1999.  OSA agreed with OTC’s counsel that in fact, “the biggest impairment for [the Company] was in respect of [TGHPL]”; and that in respect of the provisions made for doubtful debts owing to TGHPL, the largest sum was in respect of an amount due from the Company to TGHPL

Indeed, with respect, I found a lack of clarity in OHC’s own submissions on the issue of the Company’s insolvency, because it was not made clear in those submissions whether references to “insolvency” were intended to be references to balance sheet insolvency, or cash flow insolvency – or both.  In so far as balance sheet insolvency was concerned, there was no dispute that the Company would be balance sheet insolvent if the value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account the contingent and prospective liabilities (<span class="font-italic">Parakou</span> at [64]).

Firstly, OHC alleged that the Tong Garden Group owned numerous properties which would surely have constituted assets of some considerable value.  He relied on the list of properties set out in the Operational and Financial Review conducted on TGHPL by Stone Forest in September 2000.  Regrettably, however, he did not produce any evidence of the alleged value of these properties.  There was no evidence that these properties were unencumbered.  Nor was there any evidence of the status and the value of each of these properties as at end-2007.  Indeed, on the face of it, as the defence expert Mr Reid pointed out, at least several of the larger properties listed by Stone Forest in 2000 appeared to show market values that were well below their purchase price.  In the circumstances, there was no evidential basis for me to conclude that as at end-2007 (that is, just before the allegedly oppressive acts occurred), all these properties were still owned by the Tong Garden Group and that they would have tilted the balance in the Company’s favour in so far as its NTA was concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Secondly, I noted that OHC had relied on the declarations of solvency made by OTC for Food Products (M), Snack Food (M) and TGHPL – and on the fact that Food Products (S) underwent a members’ voluntary liquidation – as evidence that “the Tong Garden Business was always a healthy, profitable one”, and that there was “no commercial justification for implementation of the 2008 Restructuring”

It must be remembered that under 293(1) of the Companies Act, the declaration of solvency is really a statement of the directors’ opinion that “the company will be able to pay its debts in full within a period not exceeding 12 months after the commencement of the winding up”.  The various subsidiaries mentioned by OHC were wound up between 2012 and 2016 – that is, several years after the implementation of the 2008 restructuring.  The declarations of solvency for Food Products (M) and Snack Food (M) were filed on 6 November 2013

</div>.   What was noteworthy about this table – quite apart from the total amount paid – was the revelation that a sizeable chunk of the moneys used to pay UOBVI and UOB had come out of the working capital of Food Products (S).  For example, between 1999 and 2001, more than $1.5m of Food Products (S)’s working capital was diverted to paying off UOB in respect of loan recalls.  As another example, UOBVI’s claim for the Redemption Price (plus interest) of the Preference Shares under the 1995 UOB Agreement was eventually settled by the payment of a total sum of $4,015,919 – of which more than $1.2m came from the working capital of Food Products (S).  Another $1.5m came from a loan taken out with another bank (Bangkok Bank), while the remainder came from a rights issue and the sale of the Tong Garden Group’s trademarks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 I say this was noteworthy because on the evidence available, the satisfaction of the substantial liabilities owed to UOBVI and UOB left the Tong Garden Group financially strapped.  This was acknowledged by OHC himself in an e-mail he sent to OSA (then the Tong Garden Group’s financial controller) on 4 March 2002

Even more critically, any such suggestion would ignore the fact that in achieving the eventual settlement with OCBC, Food Products (S) was obliged to divest itself of the very premises it needed for its operations; and it would still have other bank loans and other liabilities to contend with even after having lost its operating premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Another point raised by OHC in his attempt to downplay Food Products (S)’s financial problems related to the large amount of unpaid taxes (some $1.5m) owed to IRAS, for which IRAS had appointed collection agents.  OHC argued that this claim by IRAS was resolved in the end.  However, he ignored the fact that the IRAS claim was resolved only after OSA had written to IRAS to put on record the company’s sizeable losses

</div>.  In particular, OSA had informed IRAS that the bad debts owing to the company were in excess of its estimated chargeable income.  OSA’s correspondence with IRAS thus confirmed the dire state of Food Products (S)’s finances; and the subsequent resolution of IRAS’ claim was no indication of any financial fortitude on the company’s part – indeed, quite the converse.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The third point is one I alluded to earlier.  In asserting that the Company was doing well financially and that it had no need of any restructuring in 2008, OHC placed considerable weight on the profitability of subsidiaries such as Food Products (S), Food Products (M) and Snack Food (M)

In respect of Food Products (M), for example, of the RM10.488m shown as its total current assets as at end-2007, Mr Reid pointed out that the bulk of that amount came from RM9.133m owing from related companies; and the largest item of liability was RM4.268m in “bank short-term borrowings”.  The significance of this for Food Products (M)’s financial health, as Mr Reid noted, was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [S]hort-term borrowings are shown as current liabilities.  That means that the short-term borrowings are due to be repaid within the next 12 months in the balance sheet. <span class="font-italic">The amount owing by related companies is 9 million. Given that it is the most significant asset on the balance sheet and some almost 50 per cent of that amount is shown as short-term borrowings, which by definition that is a current liability to be repaid within the next 12 months. If the amount owing by related companies is not received, and there are few other current assets, in fact it represents almost 90 per cent of the current assets, if that money is not paid, then one can expect that there will be difficulties in meeting the short-term borrowing payments required to be paid in the 12 months, based purely on this balance sheet</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Equally significantly, when asked, OBC’s evidence was that as at 2007, the Company and its subsidiaries “were in no position” to repay an amount of RM9.133m.

</div>.  OHC has argued in his closing submissions that there is no concept in law of “group insolvency”.  This is strictly correct, but it appears to me counsel’s point was that there were very large intra-Group borrowings, and that OBC’s evidence showed there was no prospect of these liabilities being satisfied.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In light of the above reasons, I was of the view that even assuming OHC was correct in saying the Company itself did not face direct claims from creditors, the financial circumstances of the subsidiaries in which it had invested were such that its own financial viability was in serious doubt by the time of the 15 March 2008 agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Indeed, this lack of viability could be seen from the reaction of the Ong siblings to whom OBC offered his shares in August 2007.

Critically, OHC’s case was premised on the proposition that the sale of these trademarks to Villawood on 13 March 2000 was not a genuine sale: Villawood never acquired – and was never intended to acquire – any beneficial interest in them.

</div>.  At no point was there any mention of the retention of beneficial ownership by the Company.  Indeed, in the decade following the sale to Villawood, no mention was ever made of the Company’s beneficial ownership of these trademarks or of the “intention” for them to be returned to the entities within the Tong Garden Group.   For that matter, nor was there any mention – whether at the time of the Villawood sale or in the years thereafter – of an obligation on anyone’s part to ensure that the companies of the Tong Garden Group would be licensed to use the trademarks in perpetuity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Not only did the documents point to there having been a genuine, outright sale of the trademarks to Villawood, the circumstances in which the transaction took place were such that OHC and his siblings could hardly have intended anything else.  I have already referred earlier to the financial problems created – not just for TGHPL, but also for the ultimate holding company, the Company – when UOBVI moved to redeem its Preference Shares in 1999.  The minutes of the 12 November 1999 EGM showed that TGHPL was by that stage already contemplating the sale of all its assets to raise funds for the redemption.

Indeed, records of subsequent meetings with the banks showed that other creditor banks such as OCBC were aware of the sale of the trademarks

In the original version of his statement of claim, OHC had pleaded that the 13 March 2000 agreement with Villawood came about only because “certain entities in the Tong Garden Group were embroiled in litigation with third parties at the material time”, and “all shareholders” of the Company agreed to assign the trademarks to Villawood “to prevent these valuable assets from falling into the hands of possible execution creditors”

Subsequently, OHC sought to amend the pleadings as he claimed that he had “refreshed” his memory and no longer believed that the plan among the shareholders had been to assign the trademarks to Villawood “to prevent these valuable assets from falling into the hands of possible execution creditors”: instead, “what was discussed was to generally protect the trademarks by transferring them offshore with a view to having the trademarks returned later on.  It was … more of a general asset protection strategy”

Indeed, in cross-examination, not only did OHC fail to explain the nature and purpose of the 13 March 2000 agreement, he proceeded to contradict his own pleaded position by putting forward at least two new allegations.  Despite having pleaded that the “intention was for the said trademarks to ultimately be returned to companies within the Tong Garden Group at a later stage”, in cross-examination OHC asserted that in fact, the shareholders had intended to transfer the trademarks to a new company to be incorporated in Mauritius, and that the assignment to Villawood had come about only because they were “anxious” about UOBVI’s demands for payment and the delay in the setting up of the Mauritian company

The “arrangement”, therefore – according to OHC – was for Villawood to hold the trademarks temporarily and to transfer them on a permanent basis to the new company in Mauritius once it was set up.

I have no evidence to back it up …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186  OHC’s lament that there was “no evidence” to back up his story of a loan from OBC was certainly justified: not a scrap of evidence was to be found in any of the documents to show that the $260,000 was a loan which OBC had extended to the Company (or to some other entity within the Tong Garden Group).  It was moreover unclear exactly what role (if any) the assignment of the trademarks to Villawood played in this scenario of a loan by OBC.  Here again, OHC was unhelpful to the point of being obtuse, claiming vaguely – with no supporting evidence – that it was OBC who had “needed this contract” for the sale of the trademarks “to negotiate with UOBVI”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 I should also highlight that it was never explained exactly how OHC’s story of the loan by OBC “using the formality of the transfer of trademarks” could be reconciled with his other story of the intended permanent transfer to a Mauritian company – let alone with the position pleaded in his Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2).  In my view, the multiple shifts in OHC’s narrative – and his inability to explain them – showed clearly that he was making up his case as he went along.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The same slippery ambiguity afflicted OHC’s testimony regarding the alleged undervalue at which the trademarks were sold to Villawood.  In his bid to demonstrate that the sale to Villawood could not be a genuine sale, OHC claimed that the $260,000 sale price did not reflect the true value of the trademarks.  Regrettably, as with his story about the $260,000 being a “loan from OBC”, here again there was no evidence to support his claims about the trademarks being undervalued.

I did not find it possible to give any weight to these claims.  I found that the objective evidence supported instead OTC’s and OBC’s assertion that the sale to Villawood was a genuine sale, and that there was no agreement or understanding of any sort for the trademarks to be returned to companies in the Tong Garden Group.  The sale price was based on a valuation produced by a reputable accounting firm; and no good reason has been shown to me to impute any impropriety to the valuation process.  Moreover, contemporaneous company records such as the minutes of TGHPL’s EGM on 12 November 1999 made it plain that there were legitimate commercial reasons for selling off the trademarks: the $260,000 paid by Villawood went towards paying off TGHPL’s liabilities, which meant that the Company – as the parent company of TGHPL – also benefited from the sale.  As for Villawood, it acquired both legal and beneficial ownership of the trademarks and could decide how to deal with them.  It was well within its rights to decide not to extend the ten-year licence given to the Tong Garden Group entities – and to assign the trademarks to other companies, including companies outside the Tong Garden Group.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Given the above, there was no basis for OHC to assert that OTC and OBC were obliged to ensure the return of the trademarks to the Tong Garden Group, or to prevent Villawood from transferring them to entities outside the Tong Garden Group.  There was thus no basis for finding a breach of fiduciary duties on their part when – at the expiry of the ten-year licence granted to the Tong Garden Group entities – the trademarks were transferred by Villawood to OTC’s companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195  The sale on 13 March 2000 effected the transfer to Villawood of the trademarks along with the goodwill of the business relating to the goods for which the trademarks were registered.  The goodwill of the business having been sold to Villawood, there was no basis for OHC to claim any wrongdoing on the former’s part in relation to its registration of the “Tong Garden” trademark via Trade Mark Registration No T0914609F.  It followed that there was no basis for OHC to assert that OTC and OBC should have prevented such registration; and thus no breach of fiduciary duties on their part when such registration was effected.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2008 restructuring</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 OHC’s failure to prove that the Tong Garden trademarks continued to be beneficially owned by the Company post 13 March 2000 held significant implications for his claims about the diversion of the Company’s “valuable assets” in Singapore and Malaysia via the 2008 restructuring.  According to OHC, this alleged diversion constituted the second major instance of oppressive conduct by OTC and OBC.  As OTC and OBC pointed out, however, leaving aside the trademarks, OHC had great difficulty pinpointing which “valuable assets” were “surreptitiously” diverted from the Company’s Singaporean and Malaysian subsidiaries by OTC and OBC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In OHC’s closing submissions, the following was alleged

The 15 March 2008 agreement – by which OBC agreed to transfer to OTC his shares in the Tong Garden Group, the debts owed to him by the Tong Garden Group, and the “Tong Garden” trademarks owned by Villawood for $7m – was the means by which OTC was able to implement his plans for the 2008 restructuring of the Tong Garden Group.  Both OTC and OBC have explained that the agreement was based on their shared understanding that OTC would “gradually deflate the old Tong Garden business structure, and build up a new one to avoid disruption to Tong Garden’s employees, creditors and reputation in the snack food market, while working with creditors to repay them and ensuring that there are continuing supplies”

In light of my findings on the state of the Company’s finances, I was of the view that OTC and OBC had acted with valid commercial reasons in the interests of the Company (<span class="font-italic">Ideal Design </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [66]).  This was not a case where the Company could have continued blithely on the same path without any fear of a financial reckoning.  Even OSA recognised this: when asked by OBC in May 2007 to indicate her preference as between letting OTC take over the business and winding up the Company, she did not protest that the Company should simply carry on as it had been doing, and in fact she preferred the more drastic option of winding up

</div>, if he had wanted to pick off the Company’s assets for himself, he and OBC could have quietly left the Company to flounder on and eventually fail on its own.  After all, as detailed in [161]–[163] and [170]–[171] above, the Singaporean subsidiary Food Products (S) was struggling so badly financially it had to resort to selling its factory to pay off OCBC, while the Malaysian subsidiaries which had been propping up Singapore operations with sizeable monthly remittances were also seeing their financial prospects grow increasingly dim.  More likely than not, it would have been a matter of time before the problems faced by the subsidiaries sounded the death knell for their ultimate holding company, especially since OBC – who had been lending money to the Tong Garden Group – was determined by August 2007 to jettison his shares in the Company and to turn his back on its business.  Once the liquidation process started for the Company and its subsidiaries, OTC could then swoop in to buy the liquidated assets on the cheap.  It would not of course be in the Company’s interests to adopt a course of action<span class="font-italic"> </span>that<span class="font-italic"> </span>would spell a potentially chaotic and ignominious end, even if the end was inevitable – but if indeed OTC and OBC had wanted to scoop up its “valuable assets”, such a course of action would have entailed little effort and risk on their part.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 On the other hand, if this was not what they wanted, then it was clearly in the Company’s interests for its business to be wound down in a gradual and orderly manner.  Since its business was really that of investing in its subsidiaries, this involved taking steps to ensure that the business of these subsidiaries was wound down in a gradual and orderly manner.  In this context, it made sense for OTC – in implementing the 2008 restructuring – to be concerned about paying suppliers and other creditors so as to prevent any hasty action by them which might rebound on the Company.  As OTC himself put it

According to OHC, OTC and OBC deliberately did not provide such a breakdown because they were intent on “concealing the value they attributed to OBC’s shares and the ‘Tong Garden’ trademarks from this Honourable Court”

</div>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I did not find any merit in OHC’s argument about the deliberate suppression of information in the 15 March 2008 agreement.  There was no evidence to support the suggestion that the absence of a breakdown of the $7m figure in the agreement was a deliberate ploy to oppress OHC’s rights as a minority shareholder by concealing information from him about the value of his shares and that of the Tong Garden trademarks.  Given the familial relationship between OTC and OBC and the relatively informal nature of the whole transaction (as seen for example from the lack of any formal valuation of the shares), I did not find it surprising – or sinister – that there was no breakdown of the $7m figure.  In any event, OBC did in cross-examination provide an explanation as to how he arrived at the $7m figure.  OBC believed that he had lent some $4m to $5m in total to the Tong Garden Group (which was why he had been willing to transfer his shares to OSL for $5m); and by the time he came to strike a deal with OTC in March 2008, he also wanted to ask for another $2m more to cover the amount then being claimed from him by OSL.  My understanding of OBC’s evidence was that apart from what Villawood had previously paid for the trademarks ($260,000), OBC wanted to recoup the moneys he believed he had expended over the years for his involvement in the business of the Tong Garden Group – whether on paying off its entities’ debts or on taking up shares in rights issues.  The $7m figure was not intended to be a precise computation of these various amounts: it was OBC’s approximation, but OTC was willing to accept it anyway without insisting on a detailed breakdown.  In return, it may be seen that OBC was willing to extend some leeway to OTC in the payment of the $7m: while the 15 March 2008 agreement provided for certain milestones to the payment schedule, it was clear that OBC did not insist on strict compliance with the milestones.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 In short, while the absence of a breakdown of the $7m figure indicated a certain lack of exactitude and formality in the transaction, this was indicative of the willingness of the two brothers to allow some give-and-take between them: I did not see it as being indicative of their intention to conceal from OHC the value of his shares and/or the value of the trademarks.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 2008 restructuring: Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In summary, I accepted OTC’s and OBC’s evidence that there were valid commercial reasons for the 2008 restructuring exercise.  I did not find any merit in OHC’s claims that this restructuring was simply a ploy to arrogate to OTC’s companies the “valuable assets” and business of the Company (and its Singaporean and Malaysian subsidiaries).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The disposal of the Thai entities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 I come next to the third act of oppression alleged by OHC: the disposal of the Thai entities.  This concerned the 2001 Thailand SPA, pursuant to which OTC had contracted to purchase from the Company “the whole of [its] undertaking” in “the Territory” (defined as being Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar) and “the goodwill and all other assets” situated in “the Territory”.  To recap, it was not disputed that despite the broad definition of “the Territory”, the only relevant business entities at the material time were the Thai entities.  It was also not disputed that the purchase price was to be based on the NTA of Tong Garden (T) for the year ended 31 December 2000 “after making appropriate adjustment for difference in inter company balances”.  It will be recalled that for various reasons, the valuation was not carried out until 2009, when OTC and the Company (represented by OBC) signed the Variation Agreement of 20 July 2009.  OHC’s case was that the Thai shares should have been valued as at 2009 and not 31 December 2000.  This was because a valuation report obtained shortly after the signing of the Variation Agreement put the fair market value of Tong Garden (T) shares as at 31 December 2000 at a negative figure.  It was OHC’s case that in proceeding to take 31 December 2000 as the relevant date for valuation, OTC and OBC were “act[ing] in concert” pursuant to a “scheme” they had “orchestrated” to “dispose and/or divert” the Thai entities’ shares to OTC “at a nominal price of S$2 in total, to further [OTC’s] personal commercial interests at the expense of the Company and its shareholders”

This concerned the extent of the Company’s ownership of the business entities in Thailand at the time the 2001 Thailand SPA was entered into.  In his statement of claim, OHC alleged that prior to 20 July 2009, the Company “effectively controlled and owned Tong Garden (T)”, and that it also “had an interest in NOI (T) through N.O.I.

In or around 1996, out of this sum of $635,000, $254,000 was taken up as an investment by the Company in 39.99% of Tong Garden (T).

The use of the NTA as at 31 December 2000 was contractually provided for in clause 4 of the 2001 Thailand SPA.  It has never been OHC’s case that the 2001 Thailand SPA was invalid or void – even as at July 2009.  Clause 4 also provided that the NTA value would be “as per the audited accounts … after making appropriate adjustment for difference in inter company balances”

That the parties had contemplated the prospect of some lag time between the signing of the agreement and the actual valuation was alluded to in an e-mail dated 15 January 2001 from the Company’s Stone Forest advisor Goh Hoi Lai (“Goh”) to OTC.  In that e-mail, Goh referenced not only the 2001 Thailand SPA but also the related agreement whereby OTC was to sell his shares in the Company to OHC, OBC and OSA before making the following comments

There was certainly no move to include a provision for any changes to the NTA in the interim to be taken into account in the valuation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 In short, therefore, there was a valid contractual basis for OTC and OBC to have regard to Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 2000 at the time they were seeking to determine the price to be paid for the shares in mid-2009.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 In so far as OHC sought to suggest that the CCK valuation in 2009 had substantially “undervalued” Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 2000, I also found no merit in this suggestion.  CC Koh &amp; Co’s valuation – that the NTA of Tong Garden (T) was negative as at 31 December 2000 – accorded with contemporaneous evidence: the evidence showed that even as at 2000 to 2002, the Company was already recording negative NTA – and OHC must have been aware of the fact.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 In particular, the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1996 (which were signed off by OHC himself) had recorded an entry that the value of Tong Garden (T) was being written down to zero.  When confronted with these accounts in cross-examination, OHC at first said he did not know why he had signed the accounts “back then” – but subsequently conceded that they showed the Company had taken the view that its investment in Tong Garden (T) was worth zero as at 1996.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 This state of affairs clearly did not improve in the years which followed.  In the Operational and Financial Review report which Stone Forest produced for the Tong Garden Group in September 2000, Stone Forest stated that Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 1999 was negative (-$1,577,721)

</div>.  Again, OHC could hardly have missed seeing this report: he was the one who had – on behalf of the Tong Garden Group – engaged Stone Forest to produce it.  Even after the signing of the 2001 Thailand SPA, references continued to be openly made to Tong Garden (T)’s negative NTA, on occasions where OHC was present.  For example, OHC was present at a meeting between Food Products (S) and OCBC on 26 March 2002 where OSA had informed OCBC of “the negative NTA in Thailand operations”

</div>.  If OHC had in fact held the belief as at 2001 that the Thai entities were valuable assets, one would have expected him to react to such information with shock and outrage.  He did not.  Just as oddly, in his testimony at trial, he gave no explanation at all for these communications.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 The upshot, therefore, was that OHC’s claim about Tong Garden (T) having been a “valuable asset” simply could not be believed.  None of the Ong siblings – not even OHC – disputed the fact that post the 2001 Thailand SPA, OTC was left to run the business of the Thai entities on his own with no participation by the Company

This was reflected, for example, in OSA’s letter to IRAS on 30 November 2005

The letter was written by OSA for the purpose of furnishing to IRAS information about the Tong Garden subsidiaries’ financial performance for the years of assessment 2000 and 2001; and in respect of Tong Garden (T), OSA referred to its dire financial state for the year of assessment 2000 in unambiguous terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As our ultimate parent company owns 39.99% of the Thai company, we were fully aware of the financial position of the Thai company.

Throughout the years which followed the signing of the 2001 Thailand SPA, there was no attempt by the Company to question the validity of the agreement.  As I have also noted, OHC’s position in these proceedings was not that the agreement was in some ways invalid or void.  The use of the NTA value as at 31 December 2000 as the basis for valuation of the shares was contractually provided for (clause 4 of the 2001 Thailand SPA): it was not something which OTC and OBC “engineered” on their own in the Variation Agreement in July 2009.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 As for the suggestion that OTC and OBC acted “surreptitiously” in bringing about the Variation Agreement, this was patently untrue.

From this, I inferred that the OA <span class="font-italic">must</span> have received the notice of the EGM – because if no notice had been given, OHC would surely have been quick to put such a fact forward as proof of his brothers’ duplicity.

Ultimately, in arguing that his brothers had damaged the Company’s interests in completing the sale of the Thai entities to OTC at a price based on Tong Garden (T)’s 2000 NTA, OHC was really saying that the Company was entitled to a higher sale price.  However, OHC could not dispute that what the Company was contractually entitled to was what had been provided for in clause 4 of the 2000 SPA.  This was perhaps what prompted the presentation of an alternative argument in his closing submissions

For this reason alone, I would have been disinclined to give any credence to this contention.  As the CA has pointed out in <span class="font-italic">V Nithia </span><span class="font-italic">(co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422 (at [36] and [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 … [P]leadings delineate the parameters of the case and shape the course of the trial.  They define the issues before the court and inform the parties of the case that they have to meet.  They set out the allegations of fact which the party asserting has to prove to the satisfaction of the court and on which they are entitled to relief under the law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 Thus, the general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue.  As Sharma J said in <span class="font-italic">Janagi v Ong Boon Kiat</span> [1971] 2 MLJ 196 (approved in <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 2311 …)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court is not entitled to decide a suit on a matter on which no issue has been raised by the parties.  It is not the duty of the court to make out a case for one of the parties when the party concerned does not raise or wish to raise the point.  In disposing of a suit or matter involving a disputed question of fact it is not proper for the court to displace the case made by a party in its pleadings and give effect to an entirely new case which the party had not made out in its own pleadings.  The trial of a suit should be confined to the plea on which the parties are at variance.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 I did not think it would have been fair in this case to allow OHC to rely on the unpleaded point about OBC’s “negligence”.  While the court retains discretion to allow a party to raise an unpleaded point, such discretion will generally be exercised only where no prejudice has been caused to the other party in the trial.  In the present case, considering that the allegation of “negligence” was not even put to OBC in cross-examination, the element of surprise – and therefore, of prejudice – was clearly present.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Moreover, OHC’s submissions were strangely vague on what exactly it was OBC should have done in 2009.  OHC certainly did not suggest that OBC should have repudiated the 2001 Thailand SPA.  What he suggested was that OBC should have taken “legal advice”

If what he meant to suggest was that OBC should have consulted lawyers on how he could negotiate with OTC to factor into the price any increases in Tong Garden (T)’s NTA between 2001 and 2009, such a suggestion was never pleaded nor put to OBC in cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In any event, even assuming that OBC was “negligent” in completing the share sale at a price based on the 31 December 2000 NTA value, OHC still had to show that this breach of his director’s duty of reasonable diligence amounted to a personal wrong <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> OHC himself as minority shareholder.  He was unable to do so.  I will deal with this failing in OHC’s case in the next section of these written grounds, as this was a failing which was common to his other allegations of breaches of fiduciary duties by OTC and OBC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 There are two remaining issues in this section I will address.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Deed of Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 The first issue concerns the Deed of Waiver which was also signed by OTC and OBC on 20 July 2009.    It was OHC’s case that this Deed of Waiver was another deliberate ploy by OTC and OBC to benefit the former.  For the reasons set out below, I did not find that this was so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 In so far as OHC decried the writing off of inter-company debts between the Company and the Thai entities, it should be pointed out that the resolution of these inter-company debts was already provided for in the 2001 Thailand SPA: clause 4 of the agreement expressly stipulated that the purchase price of the shares would be based on Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 2000, “after making appropriate adjustment for difference in inter company balances”

From the affidavits sworn by OTC, it was clear that his position had consistently been that the accounts sought – being accounts for the period spanning 1999 to 2009 – were no longer in his possession, custody or power.  This did not strike me as being unbelievable or unreasonable: it was not disputed that the law in Thailand only required companies to retain their records for five years, whereas the accounts sought were a decade (or more) old

By the time these proceedings were launched, it would scarcely have been difficult for OHC to find out from other sources – suppliers and customers, for example – whether the Thai entities were doing well.  OBC testified, for example, that he was able to observe during his trips to Thailand how Tong Garden products were widely stocked in hotels.  OTC himself did not appear to me to be chary of revealing the good performance of his Thai companies.  If anything, OTC was keen to highlight throughout the trial how he had turned the Thai entities around after the 2001 Thailand SPA by dint of his own efforts and by pumping in his own funds.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-justify font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Thai entities issue: Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 In summary, the evidence did not support OHC’s contention that the completion in 2009 of the sale of the Thai entities was a surreptitious scheme by OTC and OBC to “engineer” the acquisition of these entities by OTC on the cheap.  OTC and OBC had a valid explanation for why the price was based on Tong Garden (T)’s NTA as at 31 December 2000.  There was also no attempt by them to conceal the completion of the sale, as the Variation Agreement was put up for approval at an EGM of the Company, with notice being duly given to the OA (at that time OHC’s trustee in bankruptcy).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the alleged breaches of directors’ duties by OTC and OBC amounted to wrongs against OHC in his personal capacity as minority shareholder</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 At [123]–[261] above, I have explained why I rejected OHC’s contention that OTC and OBC had breached their duties as directors of the Company.

To recap, the question to be asked in such cases is whether the plaintiff who brings an oppression action under s 216, instead of seeking leave to commence a statutory derivative action under s 216A, is abusing the process; and “the appropriate analytical framework to ascertain whether a claim that is being pursued under s 216 is an abuse of process is as follows” (at [116]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Injury</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 I will deal first with the issue of the injury claimed by OHC in these proceedings.  As noted earlier, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([99]<span class="font-italic"> supra</span>) has explained how – in respect of the element of injury – the test it had articulated was to apply.  The CA held that while the abuse committed by Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon in relation to the management of Griffin’s affairs constituted a wrong against Griffin, this misconduct also separately constituted a personal wrong against the minority shareholder Sakae because of several factors.  In particular, the CA noted that Sakae had invested in the joint venture by providing funding; also, that Sakae had let Andy Ong and his team manage Griffin’s affairs because of the friendship which the chairman of Sakae’s board, Foo, had with Andy Ong and the trust he reposed in Andy Ong.  Noting that Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon had systematically misappropriated large sums from Griffin and fabricated documents to cover their tracks, the CA found that the real injury which Sakae had suffered was the injury to its investment in the joint venture and the breach of its legitimate expectations as to how Griffin’s affairs generally and its financial investment in Griffin in particular would be managed (see [125]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 In this connection, the findings of fact made by the trial judge – which the CA upheld – were instructive.  Thus, for example, in respect of the payment of excessive management fees to GCM (a company incorporated for the purposes of managing Griffin’s real estate investment, of which Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon were the directors), the trial judge had noted the express negotiations on the management fee which took place between the parties at the time of the JVA.  She found that <span class="font-italic">at the time of the JVA, Sakae had clearly indicated the amount of management fees it was willing to accept being paid; and yet Andy </span><span class="font-italic">Ong and Ong Han Boon had purposely disregarded Sakae’s position as to the proper amount of remuneration for GCM and gone behind its back to put in place an arrangement they knew Sakae would never agree to</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings </span>([115] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69]–[72]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 As another example, in respect of a loan of $10m which Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon had caused Griffin to disburse to ERC Unicampus (a company of which Ong Han Boon was sole director), the trial judge found that Andy Ong’s and Ong Han Boon’s conduct in relation to this loan was oppressive to Sakae because quite apart from the loan transaction being unlawful under s 163 of the Companies Act, it also <span class="font-italic">breached specific clauses in the JVA which mandated Sakae’s prior approval before any loan exceeding $2</span><span class="font-italic">m could be made by Griffin</span>.  In addition, when Sakae was on the brink of discovering these misdeeds, Andy Ong and Ong Han Boon engaged in <span class="font-italic">falsification of </span><span class="font-italic">Griffin’s accounts to deceive Sakae into believing no loss had been incurred by Griffin</span>.  As the trial judge put it, the chain of events evidenced “a pattern of disregard for Sakae’s interests and a tendency on the part of the defendants to flout the norms expected of them in order to mask the extent of their wrongdoing” (see <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings</span> ([115] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [101]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 In each of the above examples, a real injury to the minority shareholder Sakae could be identified which was clearly distinct from the injury suffered by the company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 In the present case, in respect of the <span class="font-italic">injury</span> alleged by OHC, it will be remembered that he claimed there were essentially three sets of oppressive acts by OTC and OBC.  The first was their alleged failure to preserve the Company’s beneficial ownership of the Tong Garden trademarks which resulted in the transfer of these trademarks to entities outside the Tong Garden Group – entities in fact owned and controlled by OTC.  The second was the 2008 restructuring exercise which resulted in the alleged transfer of assets, manpower, infrastructure, information and logistics away from the Singaporean and Malaysian subsidiaries within the Tong Garden Group, again to entities owned and controlled by OTC.  This alleged transfer was said to have been done “without adequate consideration being paid and without the knowledge of [OHC]”

</div>, OHC’s case was that because the directors of a company owe legal duties to the company such as the duty to act honestly and to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of their duties, he – as a shareholder – had “legitimate expectations” that the directors of the Company would discharge the legal duties they owed to it.  Breaches by the directors of their legal duties to the Company would then amount to breaches of his “legitimate expectations” – and thus amount to a personal wrong against him for the purposes of s 216

</div>
</div>
</div>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 I found OHC’s invocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectations – in the terms pleaded in his statement of claim – to be misconceived. With respect, he did not seem to be clear what the doctrine stood for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 In the context of minority oppression actions, shareholders’ legitimate expectations may provide the basis for the imposition of equitable considerations on the relationship between the majority and the minority, such that the former’s exercise of its legal rights is restrained in some way or other.  Critically, this generally arises where the relationship between the parties is one of mutual trust and confidence – that is, a quasi-partnership.  This was made clear by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Teo Chong Nghee Patrick and </span><span class="font-italic">others v Han Cheng Fong and another appeal</span> [2014] 3 SLR 595 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Chong Nghee Patrick</span>”).  In this case, the respondent (a Dr Han) was removed from his position in a joint venture company.  He sued his former joint venture partners, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for oppression, claiming that a document signed on 1 March 2010 constituted an agreement between the shareholders in the joint venture giving him an enforceable right to remain in his position.  At first instance, the High Court found in Dr Han’s favour.  One of the grounds on which the High Court found in his favour was the doctrine of legitimate expectations: the court held that the 1 March 2010 document and the surrounding circumstances gave rise to a legitimate expectation that Dr Han would not be removed from his posts, and that this legitimate expectation had been breached.  On appeal, however, the CA reversed the High Court’s decision.  The CA held that the 1 March 2010 document was not a shareholders’ agreement but a piece of “legal nonsense” devoid of any binding effect.  Over and above this, the High Court’s finding that Dr Han had a legitimate expectation to be allowed to remain in his posts was held to be “unsustainable given the nature of the relationship between the parties” (at [23] and [34]).  As the CA explained (at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The doctrine of legitimate expectations arises in the context of a relationship of trust and mutual confidence – a quasi-partnership, in other words – such that equity would intervene to suspend the otherwise oppressive exercise of legal rights: see our decision in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] 2 SLR 776 at [78]–[80].  The present case was not such an association: this was not a case of persons who had a close relationship of mutual trust who had come together on the basis of informal understandings and expectations.  The undisputed evidence was that the appellants [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Dr Han’s former partners] had brought Dr Han in because he had expertise in projects of such nature.  There was no room for the operation of any doctrine of legitimate expectations and it followed that Dr Han was not wrongfully dismissed on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 That the doctrine of legitimate expectations operates in the context of a quasi-partnership was again made clear by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([95] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).  This case involved an application to stay proceedings which had been brought by the plaintiff (Silica Investors Ltd) for relief under s 216 from oppressive or unfairly prejudicial conduct towards it as a minority shareholder in the first defendant company.  In considering the nature of s 216 proceedings, the CA cited the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in <span class="font-italic">O’Neill v Phillips</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1092 (at 1098–1099), in which Lord Hoffmann had said in relation to proceedings under s 459 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK), which was the English equivalent of our s 216:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A] member of a company will not ordinarily be entitled to complain of unfairness unless there has been some breach of the terms on which he agreed that the affairs of the company should be conducted.  But … there will be cases in which equitable considerations make it unfair for those conducting the affairs of the company to rely upon their strict legal powers.  Thus unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 In the present case, OHC had made it emphatically clear from the outset that he was <span class="font-italic">not</span> alleging the existence of a quasi-partnership between the shareholders of the Company.  Accordingly, there was no basis for him to claim reliance on the doctrine of legitimate expectations.  This was plainly not a case where he was claiming that the existence of a relationship of mutual trust and confidence as between him on the one hand and OTC and OBC on the other had given rise to some sort of equitable constraint based on “legitimate expectations”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 Indeed, on closer scrutiny, the legal proposition underlying OHC’s case was essentially this: for the purposes of s 216 proceedings, a minority shareholder should be able to establish a personal wrong against himself merely by characterising the majority’s breaches of their directors’ duties as breaches of his own “legitimate expectation” that directors should fulfill their legal duties to the company.  I did not think this proposition could be correct.  If it were, it would make nonsense of the proper plaintiff rule and the reflective loss principle, which underpin the conceptual distinction between personal rights and corporate rights, and the mechanism provided in s 216A for derivative actions would become otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 In advancing his case, OHC relied heavily on the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).  In that case, the High Court stated the following at one point in its judgment (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he directors of a company have a fiduciary duty to act in its best interests.  It follows from this that shareholders have a legitimate expectation that those in control of the company will act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the best interests of the company.  That is especially so when the majority shareholders are themselves the directors. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> ([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) did not actually assist OHC’s case.  In the same passage cited above, the learned judge had referenced the case of <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison</span> <span class="font-italic">&amp; Sons plc </span>[1995] 1 BCLC 14 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison</span>”), noting that in that case, Hoffmann LJ had held that “as a starting point”, the legitimate expectations of shareholders must be analysed against the company’s constitution and the fiduciary duties imposed by the law.  However, while the “starting point” was to ask “whether the conduct of which the shareholder complains was in accordance with the articles of association” [emphasis in original omitted], compliance with the articles of association “[did] not necessarily prevent [the directors’] conduct from being unfair within the meaning of s 459 [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the then English equivalent of our s 216]” (cited in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> at [65]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 It is worth looking at the rest of Hoffmann LJ’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Re Saul D Harrison</span>, because he went on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to explain the circumstances in which a shareholder might have legitimate expectations of the company’s directors going beyond what was stipulated in the articles of association (at 19):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">T]here are cases in which the letter of the articles does not fully reflect the understandings upon which the shareholders are associated</span>.  Lord Wilberforce drew attention to such cases in a celebrated passage of his judgement in <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd</span> [1972] 2 All ER 492 at 500 … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Thus the personal relationship between a shareholder and those who control the company may entitle him to say that it would in certain circumstances be unfair for them to exercise a power conferred by the articles upon the board or the company in general meeting</span>.  I have in the past ventured to borrow from public law the term ‘legitimate expectation’ to describe the correlative ‘right’ in the shareholder to which such a relationship may give rise.  It often arises out of <span class="font-italic">a fundamental understanding between the shareholders which formed the basis of their association but was not put into contractual form</span>, such as an assumption that each of the parties who has ventured his capital will also participate in the management of the company and receive the return on his investment in the form of salary rather than dividend … [I]n <span class="font-italic">Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd </span>([1972] 2 All ER 492 at 500) Lord Wilberforce went on to say:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘It would be impossible, and wholly undesirable, to define the circumstances in which these considerations may arise.

There are very many of these where the association is a purely commercial one, of which it can safely be said that the basis of association is adequately and exhaustively laid down in the articles.  The superimposition of equitable considerations requires something more…’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus <span class="font-italic">in the absence of ‘something more’, there is no basis for a legitimate expectation that the board and the company in general meeting will not exercise whatever powers they are given by the articles of association</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 In short, Hoffmann LJ in <span class="font-italic">Re Saul </span><span class="font-italic">D Harrison</span> was saying the same thing that the CA in <span class="font-italic">Teo Chong Nghee Patrick</span> ([274] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span> ([95] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>had said – namely, that the doctrine of legitimate expectations would arise in the context of a quasi-partnership.  The learned judge in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> ([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) having referenced <span class="font-italic">Re Saul </span><span class="font-italic">D Harrison</span>, it did not appear to me he intended to say anything different.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 In <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), it was accepted that the company in question (Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd) was not a quasi-partnership.  Nevertheless, the High Court held that the breach of fiduciary duties by the defendant directors (who were the majority shareholders) – in incorporating five new companies and diverting business from Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd to these five new companies – constituted a valid ground of oppression under s 216.  It should be noted that while the court remarked that acts involving the diversion of business were “[p]erhaps the most singularly censurable form of oppressive conduct”, even such acts of diversion would not invariably provide a valid ground for s 216 proceedings in every case: rather, “it <span class="font-italic">can</span> be oppressive conduct under s 216 of the [Companies] Act for a majority shareholder to favour another company to the detriment of the company in which a minority has his shareholding” [emphasis added] (at [67] of <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span>).  In this connection, it is necessary to examine the reasoning which the court followed in arriving at the conclusion that there had been oppression on the facts before it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 The defendants had cited what they claimed were valid commercial reasons for the incorporation of the five new companies and the diversion of business: the need to give their customers more choice, for instance, and the desire to keep their prices competitive.  The court rejected their explanation, holding that these were not the true reasons for their conduct.  In the court’s view, “the timing and circumstances under which the five companies were incorporated [were] noteworthy” (at [74]).  In gist, the court found that there had been an understanding between the parties that the plaintiff would resign as director of Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd and sell his shares back to the second defendant if he failed to achieve $200,000 in sales within his first six months.  The plaintiff apparently refused to sell back his shares despite failing to achieve $200,000 in sales within the first six months.  Following his refusal, the defendants convened an EGM where the plaintiff was removed from his directorship.  A month after his removal as director, and about two months after his refusal to sell back his shares, the defendants incorporated the five companies.  They did so secretly: the plaintiff was not told of the incorporation of these companies and did not find out about their existence till more than two years later.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 Based on the above facts, the court found that the defendants had adopted a “tit-for-tat approach to shareholder relations”: having failed to get the plaintiff to sell back his shares in Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd, they had proceeded in effect to “devalue his shareholding by diverting commercial opportunities, which should have been exploited by Ideal Design Studio for the benefit of all of its shareholders, to five companies in which they alone had an interest”  (at [76]).  The diversion was thus not only a breach of the defendants’ fiduciary duties to Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd; it “was grossly commercially unfair to the plaintiff as a minority shareholder”.  The court further noted that the plaintiff was seeking in his s 216 action a buyout of his shares at a price which assumed the diversion had not taken place.  While acknowledging that part of this purchase price would reflect a part of the loss of profits suffered by Ideal Design Studio Pte Ltd as a result of the defendants’ breach of their fiduciary duties, the court held that this did not bar the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief under s 216 because the plaintiff was not relying on their breach of fiduciary duties <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to found his cause of action: instead, he relied on these breaches as “evidence of [the defendants’] complete disregard of [his] interest as a minority shareholder” (at [87]–[91]).  Further, since his “ultimate complaint” was not the breach of fiduciary duties <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but the deliberate disregard of his interests as minority shareholder, a derivative action under s 216A would not have afforded him the relief he sought, which was “to be allowed to withdraw his capital and exit Ideal Design Studio by having his shares bought out by the defendants” (at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 Much as OHC tried to borrow the terminology used in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> ([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) in presenting his case, it was clear that the factors which justified the court in that case finding oppression simply did not exist in OHC’s case.  I have explained earlier my findings to the effect that OTC and OBC acted for valid commercial reasons in relation to the disposal of the Tong Garden trademarks, the 2008 restructuring, and the completion of the sale of the Thai entities (see [178]–[261] above).  Even assuming, however, that there were breaches by OTC and OBC of their directors’ duties, it did not appear to me that they had set out deliberately to disregard or to undermine OHC’s interests as a minority shareholder.  <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, in contrast with the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span> who incorporated the five companies in secret and concealed the diversion of business from the plaintiff, I found that OTC and OBC were open about what they were doing: there was no attempt on their part to conceal from OHC the disposal of the trademarks and other assets and business to OTC’s companies, and the completion of the sale of the Thai entities to OTC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 In short, despite dressing up his claim in the language of oppression, OHC’s “ultimate complaint” clearly began and ended with the alleged breaches of directors’ duties by OTC and OBC: he was unable to identify any other injury which was distinct from the wrong done to the Company by such alleged breaches (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([99] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [120]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 An examination of the reliefs prayed for by OHC put it beyond doubt that his real complaint was never about the oppression of his rights as a minority shareholder.  In cases of genuine oppression such as <span class="font-italic">Ideal Design</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([97] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the remedy sought by the plaintiff generally involves his exit from the company through an order for the buyout of his shares, with appropriate safeguards built in to the valuation process.

[emphasis in original omitted] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 In the present case, if the oppression of his rights as minority shareholder had been OHC’s real concern, the appropriate remedy would have been for him to be bought out at a price which assumed the acts of diversion he complained of had not happened.  In this connection, it was revealing that OHC was actually presented with numerous opportunities to have his shares in the Company bought out.  It will be remembered, for example, that in early 2010, OTC had made an offer to buy OHC’s shares for $50,000 – and after OHC had responded to the offer with indignant disdain, OTC had replied

</div>, OHC said he was not willing to sell his shares unless he had the consolidated accounts of the Tong Garden Group to enable him to assess the “true” NTA of the Company.  This was in my view a plainly nonsensical objection, because – as seen at [142] above – the evidence showed that OHC had been informed by the OA’s office on 17 June 2013 that they had the consolidated accounts ready for him – and yet OHC never followed up on this.  OHC also eventually admitted in cross-examination that OTC’s proposal of 19 August 2016 was reasonable – but he sought to cavil at the fact that OTC’s letter had not mentioned “the years of the accounts that they were going to rely on”.  When asked if he had pointed out to the OA the need to clarify “the years of the accounts” to be relied on, he was obliged to concede that he had not.  Indeed, he conceded that he had ignored OTC’s proposal <span class="font-italic">because he simply did not want to sell his shares to OTC</span>

On 2 July 2018, OBC offered to purchase the shares either for $500,000 or at a price based on an independent professional valuation.  OBC offered to let OHC appoint the accounting firm which would carry out the valuation, with the caveat that he (OBC) would not bear any of the cost of the valuation should the valuation amount be less than $500,000, whereas both of them would bear the costs equally if the valuation exceeded $500,000.  OBC’s offer was not taken up by OHC.  In closing submissions, OHC put forward a few reasons for why he thought OBC’s offer was not reasonable.  I found OHC’s reasons to be contrived and implausible.  For example, OHC objected to OBC’s suggestion that the shares should be valued as at 31 December 2007: he alleged, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that this valuation date would not take into account the possible profits made by OTC’s companies in the years since, which profits he claimed should be attributable to the Company

</div>.  I did not think OHC’s objection had any merit.  Based on OHC’s own case, the allegedly oppressive acts would have started in 2008: prior to 2008, OTC was still in Thailand running the Thai companies; and it will be recalled that I found he became a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of the Company only from 14 January 2008 onwards.  Since the allegedly oppressive conduct by OTC and OBC would only have started from 2008 onwards, it was reasonable for OBC to suggest that the valuation date be taken as the last day of 2007.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 I have mentioned these examples of offers by OTC and OBC to purchase OHC’s shares, firstly, because the fact that there were these offers – and that OHC either ignored them or rejected them on flimsy grounds – militated against his assertion that he wanted to have his shares bought out.  I should add that despite claiming he wanted to be bought out and despite decrying OTC’s and OBC’s various offers as being unreasonable, OHC himself has been remarkably coy about putting forward his own proposals as to the appropriate purchase price for his shares and/or the appropriate valuation date.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 Beyond the reasons he purported to offer for his objections, however, what OHC’s objections betrayed was his real preoccupation: namely, his desire to participate in the profits made by OTC’s companies.  This brings me to my second point about the relief sought by OHC in this s 216 action.  Despite claiming that he wanted to be bought out, OHC found it necessary to include – alongside the prayer for a buyout of his shares – an <span class="font-italic">alternative prayer that OTC be ordered to procure </span>“<span class="font-italic">the transfer of the requisite number of shares (to be determined) in Tong Garden Co.</span><span class="font-italic">, Ltd, N.O.I Food Industry Co., Ltd, Tong Garden Food (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Tong Garden Food (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd to [OHC] at the price of S$1 within 14 days</span>”

This was not a case of a plaintiff who “seeks an essential remedy directed at bringing to an end the oppressive conduct which it has been subjected to as a shareholder” (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span> ([99] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [119]).       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 From the above, I inferred that OHC’s concern was never really about remedying any personal wrongs he had suffered as minority shareholder.

</div>.  OHC has <span class="font-italic">not</span> alleged that the OA failed to receive the notice of EGM.  OHC did not attend the EGM, nor did anyone from the OA’s office attend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 In short, therefore, the objective evidence available – as well as OHC’s own testimony – showed that he was aware of all the matters complained of in his oppression suit by early 2010 at the very latest; and yet there was no evidence of any attempt by him to bring a suit against OTC and OBC.  There was certainly no evidence that he had sought leave from the OA to file an oppression action at any time up to his discharge from bankruptcy in September 2016.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 In my view, this delay by OHC in bringing his oppression action was yet another piece of evidence which cast doubt on his true motivation – and his <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> – in eventually filing the present suit in end-2017.  I should make it clear, however, that I did not eventually make a finding that the defence of laches had been made out.  This was because although the closing submissions filed on behalf of OTC dealt in detail with the evidence of OHC’s delay in filing the suit and the prejudice caused to OTC as a result, the submissions did not deal with the legal principles applicable.  In brief, it has been held in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sia Sukamto &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">another</span> [2013] 4 SLR 253 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>”) that laches is an equitable defence which operates only to bar the grant of equitable relief such as an injunction, but it does not extinguish a claimant’s legal right, nor bar its enforcement by (for example) an award of common law damages: [32]–[33] of <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>.  The closing submissions filed on behalf of OTC did not explain how the defence of laches would operate so as to bar OHC from seeking the statutory reliefs provided for in s 216.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 As for the time-bar defence, neither OTC nor OBC took this up in closing submissions.  I did not make a finding that the defence of time bar had been made out because as counsel for OHC rightly pointed out, there is clear authority to the effect that s 6 of the Limitation Act does not apply to oppression actions under s 216 of the Companies Act, such actions being “statutory in nature and not founded on a contract, or on tort, or on any other limb under s 6 of the Limitation Act”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng </span><span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2011] SGHC 30 at [95]; also <span class="font-italic">Lim Seng Wah </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Han Meng Siew and others</span> [2016] SGHC 177 at [163].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 In any event, given the findings I made in relation to the acts of oppression alleged by OHC, OTC’s and OBC’s failure to prevail on the pleaded defences of laches and time bar did not have any impact on my decision to dismiss OHC’s oppression claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">A brief note on OSA’s role in these proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">308 In respect of OSA, OHC had always made it clear that she was added purely as a nominal defendant and that he made no claims against her. OTC and OBC too had taken the position quite early on that she was a nominal defendant.  Prior to the start of the trial, OSA did not take an active part in the proceedings, and in fact discharged her counsel midway.  Surprisingly, at a pre-trial conference before me on 29 July 2019 (only a few weeks before the start of the trial), OSA appeared for the first time in person and sought leave to file an AEIC.  She also filed closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">309 With respect, I found the arguments advanced by OSA to be largely irrelevant to the issues in contention.  Many of the arguments she put forward had nothing to do with OHC’s oppression claim.  For example, she devoted a fair amount of time to questioning the extent of OTC’s and OBC’s shareholding in the Company

</div> even though this was not even an issue raised by OHC as part of his case.  While I did consider her evidence where it touched on matters relevant to OHC’s oppression claim, I did so with circumspection as I found that on more than one occasion, she presented a one-sided perspective which left out inconvenient facts.  Thus for example, she attacked OTC and OBC for allegedly being the ones who had failed to consolidate the accounts of the Tong Garden Group

</div> – despite the fact that she herself had been a director for nearly a decade up till 2008 and had been deeply involved in the Tong Garden Group’s financial and accounting affairs during that time.  Regrettably, it appeared that OSA had a deep-seated sense of resentment against both OTC and OBC, and saw the trial as an opportunity to ventilate her grievance.      </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 In dismissing the present action, I awarded OTC and OBC the costs of the action.  As parties were unable to agree on costs, they requested that I fix the amount of costs and filed written submissions for that purpose.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 OHC argued that OTC and OBC should only be allowed one set of costs.  Having regard to the guidelines articulated by V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 155, I was satisfied that OTC and OBC should each be awarded a separate set of costs. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, I noted in particular that the manner in which OHC’s case was pleaded and pursued in the course of these proceedings meant that OTC and OBC were not only entitled to adopt differing positions on key issues, they actually were obliged – by virtue of their differing interests and different involvement in the Company at different stages – to take differing positions on key issues (such as the sale of the trademarks to Villawood and the 2008 restructuring).  I also observed that throughout the trial, counsel for OTC and OBC did their best not to duplicate each other’s cross-examination and submissions.  There was some degree of overlap in the cases presented on behalf of OTC and OBC respectively, but this was mostly unavoidable.  Having had the benefit of examining first-hand the evidence adduced by each of them and the submissions made by each counsel, I would say the degree of overlap was modest; and I accounted for it with the appropriate calibration in the quantum of costs awarded to each of them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 OTC and OBC submitted that OHC should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis. Having considered all material circumstances, including the sadly broken state of the relationships which has subsisted for many years between the siblings of this family, I declined to make such an order.  I ordered instead that OTC and OBC should each get his costs on a standard basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 In so far as disbursements were concerned, these were for the most part not controversial. However, I note that both OTC and OBC claimed the costs of the real-time transcription services they engaged for the duration of the trial.  I did not think it was reasonable for the OHC to have to bear the costs of the real-time transcription, so I did not allow this item of disbursement in respect of both OTC and OBC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 In respect of OTC, I fixed costs in the sum of $230,000. In addition, I allowed OTC the disbursements set out in his Costs Schedule dated 29 January 2020, save for the amount of $20,807.92 attributable to the costs of the transcription services.  In respect of OBC, I fixed costs in the sum of $190,000.  In addition, OBC was allowed the disbursements set out in his Costs Schedule dated 29 January 2020, save for the amount of $20,807.92 attributable to the costs of the transcription services.  The costs awarded to OTC were higher than the costs awarded to OBC because OTC called two expert witnesses whereas OBC did not call any experts. While I appreciated that OBC’s counsel would also have had to address the evidence of the expert witnesses, I was of the view that additional costs were due to OTC whose counsel would have had to expend additional time and effort instructing the expert witnesses.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">315 In respect of OSA, as mentioned earlier, OHC, OTC and OBC all took the position in these proceedings that she was a nominal defendant. While OSA herself chose belatedly to file an AEIC and took it upon herself to cross-examine the other parties and their witnesses, she did not put in any submissions regarding costs, despite having been invited to do so. As none of the other parties sought any costs from her, I did not make any order on costs in respect of OSA.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pradeep Pillai, Simren Kaur Sandhu and Caleb Tan (PRP Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Gim Hai Adrian, Ong Pei Ching, Hari Veluri, Yeoh Jean Ann, David Aw and Lim Jian Wei Joel (TSMP Law Corporation) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andy Chiok Beng Piow and Margaret Lee Hui Zhen (JHT Law Corporation) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The third defendant in person. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
