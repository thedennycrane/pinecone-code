<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Summons No 1000 of 2010 (“the
                    Summons”) concerns an application taken out by Chen Chun Kang
                    (“the Plaintiff”) to enforce default judgment obtained against his
                    former mistress, Zhao Meirong (“the Defendant”). The Plaintiff had
                    brought an action against the Defendant, alleging that he had transferred
                    substantial sums of money to her in reliance on her false representations. On
                    29 July 2011, I ordered that the hearing of the Summons be adjourned to
                    30 November 2012. This was to allow the Defendant a final opportunity to
                    apply to set aside the Default Judgment as she has been incarcerated in Taiwan
                    since proceedings commenced in Singapore. The Plaintiff has appealed against my
                    decision to adjourn the hearing of the Summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a wealthy retired businessman,
                    aged 79, and a national of Taiwan. He was formerly a director of General Textile
                    Mill Corporation, a listed company in Taiwan. The Defendant is a national of the
                    People’s Republic of China who resided in Taiwan. The Plaintiff and the
                    Defendant met in Taipei in early 2000 and, in time, entered into an intimate
                    relationship. Over the course of their relationship, the Plaintiff transferred
                    substantial sums of money to the Defendant. The Plaintiff later sought to
                    recover these moneys, arguing that he transferred these moneys in reliance on
                    various false representations made to him by the Defendant, that:</p>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">she had given birth to a set of twins fathered by
                            the Plaintiff.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff subsequently discovered, in August
                    2007, that the Defendant was in fact 35 years old when he first met her and that
                    she was a Chinese national. She was not a student and had never read medicine.
                    The Defendant was also married to one Fan Li Wei (“Fan”). Her
                    parents were not ill or in need of any medical treatment and she never had a
                    brother. The Defendant was also not suffering from leukaemia. In addition, the
                    child that she presented to the Plaintiff on two separate occasions was her own
                    child with Fan. She had never conceived twins with the Plaintiff. (The Defendant
                    had presented a baby boy to the Plaintiff on the two occasions. However, she
                    brought only one child with her to visit the Defendant each time. She explained
                    that different nannies cared for each twin and it was difficult to bring both to
                    visit the Plaintiff at the same time. This, as it turned out, was in fact
                    untrue.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proceedings in Taiwan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff, accompanied by his daughter, Chen
                    Ying Hwa, lodged a complaint against the Defendant with the Taiwan Criminal
                    Investigation Bureau (“the Taiwan CIB”) on 13 November 2007.
                    The Defendant was arrested on 25 December 2007 and was detained pursuant to
                    a Writ of Detention issued by the Taiwan Taipei District Court. The Taipei
                    District Prosecutor’s Office later informed the Plaintiff in January 2008
                    that the Defendant could be guilty of fraud and other criminal offences,
                    including (peculiarly) money laundering. The Defendant was formally indicted for
                    fraud on 20 February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Plaintiff also initiated a Supplementary
                    Civil Action Incidental to Criminal Proceedings with the Taiwan Taipei District
                    Court, Criminal Tribunal on 3 March 2008, as he was advised that a victim
                    of a crime could institute a civil action for compensation under Taiwanese law.
                    The Plaintiff succeeded in his claim in tort and was awarded NT$458,525,966 by
                    the Taiwan Taipei District Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Taiwan Taipei District Court delivered
                    judgment in the criminal proceedings against the Defendant in Taiwan
                    (“the Taiwanese Criminal Proceedings”) on 19 August 2008. She
                    was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. The allegations against the
                    Defendant in the Taiwanese Criminal Proceedings included, but were not limited
                    to, the same series of acts that formed the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim
                    in Singapore against the Defendant. On appeal, her sentence was reduced to four
                    years and ten months, and ordered to run from 26 December
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Defendant is due to be released on
                    26 October 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proceedings in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Suit No 312 of 2008 arose because the Plaintiff
                    wanted to recover moneys and securities transferred to an account he opened in
                    Singapore in the Defendant’s name. The Plaintiff had two banking accounts
                    with Citibank Singapore, NA, Singapore Branch (“the Citibank Singapore
                    Branch”): Account 1 and Account 2 (“Chen’s Citibank
                    Singapore Accounts”). In 2005, the Plaintiff opened Account 3 in the
                    Defendant’s name (“Zhao’s Citibank Singapore Account”)
                    with the Citibank Singapore Branch. He alleged that he had transferred the
                    following sums from Chen’s Citibank Singapore Accounts to Zhao’s
                    Citibank Singapore Account in reliance on the Defendant’s false
                    representations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Pound Sterling (“GBP”)
                        1,949,622.30;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Canadian Dollars (“CAD”) 1,222,080; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Australian Dollars
                        (“AUD”) 4,557,365.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       He also transferred certain Ontario government
                    bonds (“the Ontario Bonds”), amounting to an estimated market
                    value of CAD2,584,800, from Account No 2 to Zhao’s Citibank Singapore
                    Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Plaintiff alleged that he had transferred
                    about NT$113,338,960 from his bank accounts in Taiwan to four accounts held by
                    the Defendant and/or her nominees:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Shanghai Branch of the China Merchants Bank
                            (Account 4);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Nan-Shih-Chiao Branch of the Hua Nan Bank
                            (Account 5) (“Zhao’s Hua Nan
                        Account”);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Wai-Tan Sub-Branch of the Shanghai Branch of
                            the China Merchants Bank (Account 6); and</div>

                            Bank (Account 7).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Out of the NT$113.338.960, the Plaintiff
                    alleged that the Defendant transferred approximately NT$67,150,495 to
                    Zhao’s Citibank Singapore Account from her and/or her nominees’ bank
                    accounts. In particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     An aggregate sum of NT$49,513,810
                        was transferred from Zhao’s Hua Nan Account to Zhao’s Citibank
                        Singapore Account; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     A sum of USD542,667.24 was transferred from Fan’s
                        account with the Nan-Shih-Chiao Branch of the Hua Nan Bank to Zhao’s
                        Citibank Singapore Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Plaintiff alleged that the sum of
                    NT$67,150,495 was in fact moneys that he transferred to the Defendant over the
                    course of their relationship. In all, the Plaintiff claimed (a) GBP1,949,622.30;
                    (b) CAD1,222,080; (c) AUD4,557,365; and (d) NT$67,150,495 (“the
                    Advances”) from the Defendant and also sought an order that the Ontario
                    Bonds be delivered to him, and/or damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Plaintiff obtained an interim injunction
                    on 23 June 2008 pursuant to an <em>ex parte</em>
                    application to prohibit the Defendant from disposing of her assets in Singapore.
                    The Memorandum of Service of the Writ of Summons (which was generally endorsed)
                    was filed on 20 August 2008. The Plaintiff then served the Statement of
                    Claim on the Defendant’s appointed agent for service, one Lu Gwo Shiun
                    (“Lu”) in Taiwan on 24 October 2008. The Defendant did not
                    enter appearance or file her defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 28 November 2008, the Plaintiff
                    applied (in Summons No 5271 of 2008) for judgment in default of Defence
                    (“the Default Judgment”) under O 19 r 7 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”). The Plaintiff obtained judgment on 17 December 2008 in
                    which it was ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Defendant [was] to deliver the Ontario Bonds

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Defendant [held] on trust all assets in whole or in

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     all other assets of the Defendant in Singapore [were] subject to an

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_g"></a>(g)     the
                        Plaintiff [was] granted an injunction to restrain the Defendant from

                        Singapore, including the moneys in Zhao’s Citibank Singapore Account
                        up to the aggregate of the Advances and the Ontario government
                    bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Plaintiff recovered a significant portion
                    of the Default Judgment debt in a series of enforcement proceedings. Pursuant to

                    10 February 2010, the Citibank Singapore Branch transferred to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, the Plaintiff found that there was
                    still a shortfall on the Default Judgment debt amounting to approximately
                    S$3,982,023.80. The Plaintiff also discovered that the Defendant had transferred
                    moneys from Zhao’s Citibank Singapore Account to her account with FBO
                    Salomon Smith Barney (“the SSB Account”) pursuant to a Global
                    Managed Portfolios Investment Management Agreement (“the
                    Agreement”) dated 30 May 2006 with the Citibank Singapore
                    Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Plaintiff therefore took out the Summons
                    and sought the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Defendant execute, sign or
                        indorse a written instruction to the Citibank Singapore Branch instructing
                        it to:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_17-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       terminate the

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_17-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       liquidate all securities and other investments in all investment
                            management accounts established under the Agreement, including, without
                            limitation, the SSB Account; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_17-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       transfer all assets in all investment
                            management accounts established under the Agreement to Citibank NA
                            Account 8 or such other account as the Plaintiff and/or his solicitors
                            may notify in writing to the Citibank Singapore
                    Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
                        if the Defendant fails to comply with the abovementioned order within seven
                        days of being served with a copy of the Order to be made, the Registrar of
                        the Supreme Court of Singapore shall be empowered to execute the written
                        instruction on the Defendant’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision to adjourn the hearing of the Summons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 29 July 2011, I ordered that the
                    hearing of the Summons be adjourned (“the Adjournment”) to
                    30 November 2012. It should be noted that the Defendant has been prevented
                    from participating or instructing her solicitors effectively since proceedings
                    commenced in Singapore. This is because she was and remains incarcerated in
                    Taiwan. In fact, she only managed to appoint a solicitor in Singapore as late as
                    14 August 2009. I adjourned the Summons to allow the Defendant a month
                    from her expected release date to apply to set aside the Default Judgment if she
                    so wished. The Defendant had sent a letter dated 15 July 2011 to the
                    Registry of the Supreme Court pleading that she be allowed to appear in
                    proceedings once her prison term was complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I would like to emphasise from the outset that
                    I made no order regarding the merits of the Summons. The hearing of the Summons
                    was adjourned a number of times because the parties were unable to ascertain
                    when the Defendant would be released from prison and be able to contest
                    proceedings in Singapore. On 6 April 2010, I had adjourned the matter for
                    the parties to ascertain when the Defendant would be released if she was granted
                    parole. The Defendant’s solicitor had then been informed by Fan that the
                    Defendant could be released in four months’ time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     During the next hearing on 20 April 2010,
                    the Plaintiff’s solicitors advised (wrongly, as it turned out) that the
                    Defendant would complete her sentence on 26 May 2011. Although the
                    Defendant was entitled to apply for parole around May 2010, the
                    Plaintiff’s solicitors admitted that the Plaintiff would be opposing
                    parole in order to keep the Defendant in jail up to 26 May 2011. (It should
                    be noted that the Plaintiff’s Taiwanese solicitors had advised that the
                    victim’s views as to the Defendant’s remorse would be a crucial
                    factor in her application for parole). I adjourned the hearing for four months
                    to 20 August 2010 based on the Defendant’s expected release date
                    should her application for parole be granted despite the Plaintiff’s
                    threatened opposition thereto.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the next hearing, the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors informed me that the Defendant’s application for parole on
                    2 July 2010 was rejected within a day. On the basis (as wrongly informed by
                    the Plaintiff’s solicitors) that the Defendant would be released on
                    26 May 2011, I adjourned the hearing to 30 June 2011 for further
                    directions. The Plaintiff’s solicitors subsequently informed the court in
                    a letter to the Supreme Court Registry dated 7 December 2010 that the
                    Defendant would only be released on 26 October 2012. The Defendant’s
                    second application for parole on 6 October 2010 had also been rejected and
                    so was her third application for parole in January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defendant’s solicitor discharged
                    himself on 29 June 2011, one day before the scheduled hearing date of
                    30 June 2011, citing difficulties in obtaining instructions from the
                    Defendant. Given that I had been informed meanwhile that the Defendant would
                    only be released on 26 October 2012 and not 26 May 2011, I was minded
                    to extend the adjournment until November 2012 (allowing the Defendant about a
                    month after her release to seek a setting aside of the Default Judgment).
                    However, at the request of the Plaintiff’s solicitors, I adjourned the
                    hearing to 29 July 2011 for the Plaintiff’s solicitors meanwhile to
                    inform the Defendant that she was to appoint another solicitor in Singapore
                    within a month. This was more in the hope than in the expectation that it would
                    expedite matters. I therefore also made it clear to the Plaintiff’s
                    solicitors that if the Defendant was unable to obtain effective representation,
                    I would have to allow further time. The Defendant wrote on 18 July 2011 to
                    the Singapore court pleading for proceedings to be stayed in Singapore to enable
                    her to appear in person once she was released from prison. She also expressed
                    that she “[would] not be able to discuss the case with her lawyer even if
                    she does engage one in Singapore”. She claimed that she was not allowed
                    to communicate by telephone while in prison, and that “correspondence by
                    letter to and from Singapore [could take up to] a month”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I hence decided to adjourn the hearing to
                    30 November 2012, directing the Supreme Court Registry to inform her that
                    she had to seek leave to apply to set aside the Default Judgment if she intended
                    to oppose the Summons by 30 November 2012. I also ordered that the
                    Plaintiff be at liberty to apply for an earlier hearing date should the
                    Defendant be released on parole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The following issues are relevant to the
                    Plaintiff’s appeal against the Adjournment:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Adjournment is an
                        “order” to which an appeal may be made to the Court of Appeal
                        in accordance with s 29A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                        (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the Adjournment is an
                        “order”, is it one that was made in the course of an
                        “interlocutory application” for which leave to appeal must be
                        obtained under s 34(2)(<em>d</em>) and the Fifth
                        Schedule of the SCJA?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether it was appropriate to grant the Adjournment in the interests
                        of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Adjournment was an “order” under
                s 29A(1) of the SCJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Section 29A(1) of the SCJA provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The civil jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals
                        from <em>any judgment or order</em> of the High Court
                        in any civil cause or matter whether made in the exercise of its original or
                        of its appellate jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of
                        this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon
                        which such appeals may be brought. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court of Appeal in <em>Bank
                        Austria </em><em>Creditanstalt AG v Go Dante
                        Yap</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 667 (“<em>Bank Austria</em>”) considered the meaning of
                    “order” in s 29A(1) of the SCJA. It observed at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, the word ‘order’ in s 29A(1) of the SCJA
                        connotes a decision of some kind or other. <em>The decision
                            may require that something should be done or a party to the proceedings
                            to do something, but it need not</em>. A court may make a decision
                        or ruling on a disputed point or issue without the need for any
                        consequential action by any party. <em>It may simply be a
                            ruling that affects the legal rights (substantive or procedural) of a
                            party</em>. In our view, an order under s 29A(1) of the SCJA
                        includes a decision or finding that a fact exists or does not exist, an
                        event has occurred or has not occurred, or an act may be done or may not be
                        done, which affects the legal rights of a party. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I am satisfied that a decision to adjourn the
                    hearing of an application can be regarded as an “order”, even if
                    the merits of the Summons were not dealt with and the parties’ legal
                    rights have not been determined. This view has been implicitly accepted in a
                    number of cases. In <em>Insas </em><em>Bhd v
                        Ayer Molek Rubber Co Bhd</em> [1995] 2 MLJ 833
                        (“<em>Insas</em>”), the defendants
                    appealed against the lower court’s decision to adjourn the hearing of a
                    summons. The Malaysian Federal Court observed (at 839) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As we know it, a court has power to adjourn a hearing as is given to
                        it under O 35 r 3 of the Rules of the High Court 1980. Mr SC
                        Loh did not produce any authority to show us that a party may appeal against
                        the <em>order</em> of a judge to adjourn the hearing of
                        any matter before him. We ourselves are not aware of any case in which an
                        appeal had been allowed to be made against <em>an order of
                            adjournment</em> for decision or further arguments of a case by
                        even a magistrate. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Similarly, in <em>Maxwell v
                        Keun</em> [1928] 1 KB 645 (“<em>Maxwell</em>”), the plaintiff appealed against the lower
                    court’s refusal to grant an adjournment of a hearing. It was argued that
                    the adjournment was not of the same nature as an order which is subject to
                    appeal under s 27(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act
                    1925 in England. The appellate court however found that the lower court’s
                    refusal to grant an adjournment with an order on costs was considered an order
                    that may be appealed (<em>Maxwell</em> at 649). Having
                    decided that the Adjournment can be regarded as an “order”, the
                    next issue to be considered is whether the Plaintiff must seek leave to appeal
                    against the Adjournment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Adjournment is an order for which leave to appeal must be
                sought</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It would be noted that s 34 and the Fifth
                    Schedule of the SCJA do not specify whether the Adjournment, which was granted
                    in the course of enforcement proceedings, would be one for which leave to appeal
                    must be sought. It is relevant to consider whether the Adjournment would fall
                    under para (<em>e</em>) of the Fifth Schedule of the
                    SCJA, <em>viz</em>, an “order [made] at the hearing
                    of any interlocutory application” for which leave to appeal must be
                    sought. On the one hand, the requirement of leave to appeal the Adjournment
                    would be in line with the legislative intent behind the amendments to the SCJA
                    which came into effect from 1 January 2011 to restrict appeals to the Court
                    of Appeal on interlocutory matters (see: Teo Guan Siew, “Recent
                    Amendments to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the Subordinate Courts
                    Act”, <em>Law Gazette</em>, January 2011) at
                    pp 16–21). During the second reading of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates
                        Official Report</em> (18 October 2010) vol 87 at col 1368,
                    Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... this Bill [to amend s 34 of the SCJA] contains two key changes.
                        First, it streamlines appeals to the Court of Appeal arising from
                        interlocutory applications. Second, it expands the types of hearings which a
                        two-judge Court of Appeal can hear. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 9 [of the Bill] therefore amends section 34 [of the SCJA] to
                            <em>streamline and restrict appeals to the Court of
                            Appeal on interlocutory matters</em>. Interlocutory applications
                        will now be categorised based on their importance to the substantive outcome
                        of the case. With this calibrated approach, some interlocutory orders will
                        not be allowed to go to the Court of Appeal, whilst others can only go to
                        the Court of Appeal with the permission of the High Court. The decision of
                        the High Court whether to grant permission is final. The right to appeal all
                        the way to the Court of Appeal will, however, remain for interlocutory
                        applications that could affect the final outcome of the case. The types of
                        orders in the three categories are set out in the Fourth and Fifth Schedules
                        to the Bill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A decision to adjourn the hearing of an
                    application would generally not affect the parties’ substantive rights
                    and, as such, it would be consistent with the legislative intent behind the
                    amendments to require that leave to appeal an adjournment must be sought. The
                    Malaysian Federal Court in <em>Insas</em> thus observed
                    that no appeal in general lies against a decision to adjourn proceedings and
                    that “at the most, frequent adjournments of a case for no good reason may
                    be made as one of the grounds in an appeal proper”. However, the specific
                    provisions in s 34 of the SCJA must be considered, and the question is
                    whether the Summons can be regarded as an “interlocutory
                    application” within para (<em>e</em>) of the
                    Fifth Schedule of the SCJA. The determination of when an application or order
                    would be regarded as “interlocutory” or “final” is
                    one of considerable difficulty (see: <em>Wellmix Organics
                        (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 525 (“<em>Wellmix
                    Organics</em>”) on the interpretation of “interlocutory
                    orders” in the former s 34(1)(<em>c</em>) of
                    the SCJA, now repealed). Chao JA in <em>Wellmix
                        Organics</em> observed at [10]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question of whether an order is truly interlocutory or final has
                        troubled the courts here, as well as in England, for a long time. However,
                        in England, they have resolved the problem by adopting a listing approach.
                        What kind of <em>applications or orders</em> are to be
                        treated as interlocutory are distinctly listed out. Singapore has not yet
                        adopted that approach and still has to grapple with the problem from time to
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The court in <em>Wellmix
                        Organics</em> then considered the meaning of “interlocutory
                    order” and affirmed that the test of whether a judgment or order is
                    interlocutory or final depends on whether it finally disposes of the rights of
                    the parties (<em>Wellmix Organics</em> at [10] affirming <em>Bozson v
                        Altrincham Urban District Council</em> [1903] 1 KB 547
                        (“<em>Bozson</em>”)). Chao JA explained
                    at [14] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    ... The word ‘rights’ has been
                            construed in Rank Xerox (at [8]) to mean the substantive
                            ‘rights’ in the action or proceeding. A little more
                            problematic are the other two words. The word ‘dispose’ has
                            a spectrum of meanings ranging from ‘to throw away’,
                            ‘to make final arrangement’, ‘to deal’ to
                            ‘to determine the outcome’. It seems to us that in the
                            context of the Bozson test, the word ‘dispose’ must mean
                            making a determination on the substantive rights and, as a matter of
                            common sense, the court can only make a determination on the substantive
                            rights after hearing the parties on the merits. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    As regards the word ‘finally’, its
                            ordinary meaning is clear. It means either ‘the last’ or
                            ‘completely’. ... There is much force in the argument that a
                            determination as to liability does not finally or fully dispose of the
                            rights of the parties where damages are also claimed in the action. That
                            will only be a partial determination of the rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, the Summons was an application taken out to
                    enforce the Default Judgment. The Plaintiff took out the Summons seeking that
                    the Defendant be ordered to execute written instructions to the Citibank
                    Singapore Branch to terminate the Agreement and to liquidate all securities and
                    other investments under the Agreement including those in the SSB Account. In
                    contrast to the legislative scheme then in effect when <em>Wellmix Organics</em> was decided, the issue that must now be
                    considered is whether the Summons is an “interlocutory
                    application”. I find that the Summons would not fall comfortably within
                    the meaning of an “interlocutory application”. The Summons is an
                    application to enforce a judgment rather than an interlocutory application which
                    is typically sought in the course of obtaining final judgment. In the absence of
                    specific legislative provision, I would prefer to proceed on the basis that
                    leave to appeal the Adjournment is not required under the SCJA and, in
                    particular, para (<em>e</em>) of the Fifth
                    Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Reasons for the Adjournment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I now turn to the reasons for my decision to
                    adjourn the hearing of the Summons to 30 November 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is established that the court has the
                    inherent jurisdiction to adjourn a hearing in the interests of justice, as
                    required by the facts of each case (<em>Wong Phila Mae v Harold
                        Shaw</em> [1991] 2 MLJ 147 at 149 (“<em>Wong Phila Mae</em>”)). A court would thus be
                    justified in adjourning a hearing if there are adequate reasons for doing so. A
                    decision to grant or refuse an adjournment of a hearing may be reviewed where it
                    would cause manifest injustice to one of the parties (<em>MGG
                        Pillai v Tan Sri Dato Vincent Tan Chee Yioun &amp; other appeals</em>
                    [1995] 2 MLJ 493 at 513). Manifest injustice may result where a judge
                    fails to consider all necessary matters or exercised his discretion arbitrarily
                        (<em>Lee Ah Tee v Ong Tiow </em><em>Pheng &amp; Others</em> [1984] 1 MLJ 107 affirming
                        <em>Dick v Piller</em> [1943]
                    1 All ER 627 (“<em>Piller</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The court would have to consider whether the
                    party requesting the adjournment would be unable to argue its case effectively
                    otherwise, while having in mind the need for cases to be dealt with in an
                    expedient manner (<em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic
                        Party and another suit</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 675; <em>Tan Pak v Cham Boon San and other actions</em> [1992]
                    2 MLJ 271). The English Court of Appeal in <em>Boyle v
                        Ford Motor Co Ltd</em> [1992] 2 All ER 228
                        (“<em>Boyle</em>”) gave some guidance as
                    to the appropriate balance to be struck. Lord Donaldson MR affirmed that the
                    court should exercise rigorous control in cases to ensure that there are no
                        <em>avoidable</em> delays. A delay is unavoidable if
                    justice cannot be done in absence of adjournment (<em>Boyle</em> at 233–234).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Several factors go towards the determination
                    of whether an adjournment would be just and fair (<em>Albon
                        (trading as NA Carriage Co) v Naza Motor Trading Sdn </em><em>Bhd and another (No 5)</em> [2008] 1 WLR 2380
                    affirming <em>Piller</em> (<a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> <em>supra</em>) and R <em>v General
                        Commissioners of Income Tax for Sevenoaks ex parte Thorne</em> [1989]
                    STC 560). These include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether a witness was unable to
                        attend the hearing on grounds of ill-health or other valid reasons which are
                        supported by proof;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether a witness’s evidence was reasonably necessary for the
                        party’s case to be properly presented;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether there was a reasonable prospect that a
                        witness would be able to attend court at a specific and reasonable future
                        date;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether
                        the other party would suffer injustice which cannot be remedied by an award
                        of costs or otherwise; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     the merits of the case of the party who is seeking or
                        requires the adjournment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I am persuaded that an adjournment would be
                    necessary in the present case to enable the Defendant to present her case
                    effectively and that no irremediable prejudice would be caused to the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendant is unable to effectively argue her case due to
                incarceration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     One compelling factor is that the Defendant
                    has been prevented from presenting her case since proceedings commenced in
                    Singapore. This is not a case where the Defendant merely refused to participate
                    in the proceedings. The Defendant has attempted, though without much success, to
                    convey her instructions to her solicitors. However, she faces significant
                    difficulties instructing her solicitors because she is incarcerated in
                    Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The fact that the Defendant is incarcerated in
                    Taiwan and unable to participate in proceedings in Singapore would be one
                    important factor in the court’s consideration of whether to grant an
                    adjournment. The Malaysian court in <em>Hup San Timber Trading Co
                        </em><em>Sdn </em><em>Bhd v Tan Ah
                        Lan</em> [1979] 1 MLJ 238, found that the lower court should
                    have granted an adjournment where a party was unable to enter the country
                    because he ran into difficulties with the immigration authorities. In <em>Piller</em>, the trial judge was also found to have exercised
                    his discretion wrongly when he refused an application for adjournment where the
                    defendant was too ill to attend. A party who has valid reason for being unable
                    to attend a hearing supported by proof should not be deprived of the right to be
                    heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Defendant had been detained in Taiwan
                    since 25 December 2007. She has not been able to appear in person nor was
                    she represented in proceedings till to 14 August 2009. Her solicitor,
                    Mr Sean Say (“Mr Say”) who was appointed by Fan (through
                    a power of attorney) has since discharged himself. He was unable to receive
                    instructions from the Defendant or contact Fan and Fan’s lawyer, one
                    Mr Liu.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Plaintiff’s solicitors maintain that
                    the Defendant’s right of access to counsel is unrestricted. They submit
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     under the Taiwan Criminal Procedure
                        Act, unless restrictions are imposed by a judge, a detainee is entitled to
                        receive visitors;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Taiwan Detention Enforcement Act provides that a visitor may
                        apply to visit the detainee once a day for thirty minutes;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     the detainee is
                        entitled to send and receive mail subject to censorship by the supervisor of
                        the Taipei Detention Centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, I am doubtful of the
                    Defendant’s ability to communicate with visitors, let alone instruct her
                    solicitors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Writ of Detention issued
                        against her stated that she was to be prohibited from interview or
                        correspondence because of her “recidivist behaviour [which increased]
                        the possibility of recommitting such acts of fraud”. She was
                        thereafter sentenced to imprisonment of six years (reduced to four years and
                        ten months on appeal) by the Taiwan Taipei District Court on 19 August
                        2008. It is uncertain whether such conditions continue to be imposed in any
                        form on the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiff himself experienced significant
                        difficulties communicating and serving court documents on the Defendant. The
                        Plaintiff’s Taiwanese solicitors made several unsuccessful attempts to
                        serve the Writ of Summons and the certified Chinese translation of the Writ
                        of Summons on the Defendant personally at the Taipei Detention Centre and
                        her residence on 22 and 29 July 2008 respectively. It was not until
                        13 August 2008 that a copy of the Writ of Summons could be served on
                        Lu, the Defendant’s appointed agent for service. The Plaintiff
                        experienced similar problems notifying the Defendant of his application (in
                        Summons No 3973 of 2008) to replace the banker’s guarantee furnished
                        in conjunction with the interim injunction. The Plaintiff sent letters
                        notifying the Defendant of the date of the hearing, receipt of which was
                        acknowledged by the Taipei Detention Centre on 19 November 2008.
                        Letters were also sent to Lu. However, the Plaintiff did not receive any
                        response from the Defendant or any official receipt evidencing service on
                        Lu. The Plaintiff’s Taiwanese solicitors simply sent an e-mail stating
                        that “the post office has confirmed that the letter was successfully
                        served to Lu”. Belinda Ang J, however, who heard Summons No 3973
                        of 2008) was not persuaded that service had been effected and she refused to
                        grant an order for replacement of the banker’s
                    guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Say, the Defendant’s former solicitor, had encountered
                        difficulties obtaining instructions from the Defendant from the time of his
                        appointment. He also could not contact Fan and was thus unable to file an
                        affidavit in reply to the Plaintiff’s summons for inspection of the
                        Defendant’s accounts with the Citibank Singapore
                    Branch.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        Defendant, in a letter to the court dated 18 July 2011, stated that she
                        would not be able to discuss her case with a lawyer, even if another
                        solicitor was appointed to replace Mr Say. She is not allowed to
                        communicate through telephone and correspondence by letter is not
                        expedient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In light of the difficulties faced by the
                    Defendant in contesting the Plaintiff’s claim, I was of the view that an
                    adjournment till her release from prison would be necessary to allow her to be
                    heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendant’s evidence is material to the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I note further that the Defendant’s
                    evidence is material and necessary for the just and fair disposition of the
                    case. The Court of Appeal in <em>Wong Phila Mae</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> <em>supra</em>) affirmed that an adjournment should be
                    granted where it is necessary to obtain additional material evidence, such as
                    affidavits by other relevant witnesses or to secure the presence of a crucial
                    witness. The court observed that (at 149):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It seemed to us that the point was not whether there was sufficient
                        evidence before the court but whether both sides had been given a fair
                        opportunity of putting forth all the facts before the court to enable it to
                        make up its mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Defendant’s testimony is material
                    because it remains uncertain whether the Advances were truly obtained by the
                    exercise of undue influence. It may well be that the Advances, though amounting
                    to substantial sums, could be explicable on account of the parties’
                    relationship. However, the court only has the benefit of the Plaintiff’s
                    evidence thus far. It should be noted that two affidavits sent by the Defendant
                    to the Plaintiff dated 18 and 25 July 2008 were rejected for failing to
                    comply with the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Furthermore, the veracity of the
                    Plaintiff’s evidence and his competency to testify are in doubt. The
                    Plaintiff underwent surgery for a brain tumour on 8 August 2000 and
                    subsequently suffered partial loss of memory and a degeneration of cognitive
                    abilities. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and a psychological
                    disorder around 20 August 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Plaintiff and Chen Ying Hwa have adopted
                    inherently inconsistent positions on the Plaintiff’s mental competency. On
                    one hand, the Plaintiff alleged that his doctors have confirmed that he has
                    sufficient cognitive ability to make his affidavit, understand the contents of
                    the affidavit and is fit and competent to give evidence in court. Chen Ying Hwa
                    also stated in her affidavit dated 2 May 2008 that the Taiwan CIB was
                    satisfied that the Plaintiff was able to give reliable statements during police
                    investigations. However, this contradicts her statement given during
                    interrogation conducted at the Taipei District Prosecutor’s Office on
                    29 February 2008 (“the Interrogation Records”) where she
                    testified that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chen, Chun-Kung had a brain tumour operation on August 8, 2000. After
                        that, he was unable to identify objects. ... He could not identify family
                        members either. ... At that moment, the physicians asked Chen, Chun-Kung
                        some basic questions for identification, but he could not answer those
                        questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, Chen Ying Hwa stated in her second affidavit dated
                    27 August 2010 that the Plaintiff’s judgment declined tremendously
                    after the operation and onset of Alzheimer’s disease and, as a result, he
                    was easily taken in by the Defendant’s misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The fact that the Defendant suffers from
                    Alzheimer’s disease is of course not conclusive of his competence (or lack
                    thereof) to give oral evidence in court. Section 120 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All persons shall be competent to testify unless the court considers that
                        they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from
                        giving rational answers to those questions by tender years, extreme old age,
                        disease, or any cause of the same kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Competency to testify depends on a
                    witness’s ability to understand the questions put to him and to give
                    rational answers to questions at trial (<em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Chan Wai Heng</em> [2008] 5 MLJ 798 (“<em>Chan Wai Heng</em>”) affirming <em>Kabiraj </em><em>Tudu v State of Assam</em> 1994
                    Cri LJ 432 (“<em>Kabiraj</em>”)). The court
                    proceeds on the presumption that a witness is competent to testify unless it is
                    shown that he falls under any of the qualifying exceptions. However, the court
                    in <em>Chan Wai Heng</em> at [32] affirmed observations in <em>Kabiraj</em> that a witness’ competency should be tested where
                    he suffers from disease or other abnormality of the body or mind that could
                    affect his ability to answer questions. In <em>Kee
                        </em><em>Lik </em><em>Tian v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [1984] 1 MLJ 306, the judge erred
                    when he refused to permit the defence counsel to test whether a prosecution
                    witness who was found to be mentally retarded had the competency to
                    testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I find that in light of the Plaintiff’s
                    inconsistent statements on his mental condition, the court must be satisfied of
                    his competency to testify. The Plaintiff maintains on the one hand that his
                    mental condition made him vulnerable to the Defendant’s conduct, but
                    insists on the other hand that he was not so incapacitated as to be unable to
                    testify in court. However, there are allegations that he did not testify at
                    trial in Taiwan, possibly because of his mental condition (see <em>infra</em><a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>). The Plaintiff has not adduced any
                    medical report to prove that he is competent to testify. In fact, the medical
                    report dated 21 January 2008 annexed to the Plaintiff’s first
                    affidavit discloses that he “provided irrelevant answers to the interview
                    questions and was found to have impaired calculative abilities and other
                    cognitive impairments”. A report dated 14 January 2007 by the
                    Plaintiff’s attending doctor, Wang PN, also described the Plaintiff as
                    suffering from “cognitive decline with symptoms of forgetful [<em>sic</em>], disorientation to time, impaired judgment and
                    executive function was noted for 2 years”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It would be unjust to disallow the Defendant
                    an opportunity to present her case and to rely solely on the Plaintiff’s
                    evidence when his ability to recall facts and respond to questions is in doubt.
                    Even if the Plaintiff is assumed to be competent to testify in court, the
                    Defendant’s evidence is necessary on the issue of whether the Advances
                    were explicable on account of her relationship with the Plaintiff. It appears
                    that moneys were transferred to the Defendant on 6 September 2007 even
                    after the Defendant’s “fraud” was allegedly discovered by
                    the Plaintiff in August 2007. In any event, details of when and who discovered
                    the Defendant’s “fraud” remain uncertain. The Plaintiff
                    stated in his first affidavit that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1.1 In or around August 2007, a friend of mine, who
                            has declined to be named, contacted the Defendant and discovered that
                            the Defendant was actually from Shanghai, China. He further discovered
                            that she was in fact married. He subsequently informed me of his
                            findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.1.3 Further, when I subsequently applied for a
                            Household Registration Transcript in or around October 2007,
                            I discovered that there was no registration information for
                            ‘my’ ‘twins’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is inconsistent with Chen Ying Hwa’s testimony that she
                    was the one who discovered the fraud when the Defendant went to the
                    Plaintiff’s house to take a remittance confirmation note from him in
                    September 2007. Given the numerous inconsistencies and doubts surrounding the
                    veracity of the Plaintiff’s and Chen Ying Hwa’s evidence, it would
                    only be fair to give the Defendant an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The fact that the Defendant was convicted of
                    fraud in Taiwan is not determinative of whether the Advances were obtained as a
                    result of undue influence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendant should be given the opportunity to set aside the
                Default Judgment for lack of full and frank disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is established that the court may set aside
                    an order granted <em>ex parte</em> under O 32 r 6
                    of the Rules of Court. A party may apply for the order to be set aside if the
                    plaintiff did not make full and frank disclosure in his <em>ex
                        parte</em> application. The plaintiff in <em>ex
                        parte</em> proceedings has the duty to make full and frank disclosure
                    of all material facts, even if they are prejudicial to the plaintiff’s
                    claim (<em>The “Vasiliy </em><em>Golovnin”</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994

                        <em>The Vasiliy</em> at [85] affirmed that: “the
                    onus of ensuring that the judge is given a balanced view of the matter rests
                    squarely and uncompromisingly on every applicant in an <em>ex

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test for materiality is always an objective one. In the words of
                        Prakash J in <em>The Rainbow Spring</em>, the test is
                        to simply ask ‘how <em>relevant</em> the fact
                        is’ [emphasis added] (at [33]). However, the duty imposed on the applicant requires him
                        to ask what might be relevant to the court in its assessment of whether or
                        not the remedy should be granted, and not what the applicant alone might
                        think is relevant. <b>This inevitably embraces matters, both
                            factual and legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the
                            successful outcome of the applicant’s application. It extends to
                            all material facts that could be reasonably ascertained and defences
                            that might be reasonably raised by the defendant.</b> It is
                        important to stress, however, that the duty extends only to plausible, and
                        not all conceivable or theoretical, defences. For example, if there have
                        been unsuccessful prior proceedings, the context as well as the reasons for
                        the dismissal must be adequately disclosed. <b>In short, the
                            material facts are those which are material to enable the judge to make
                            an informed decision</b> (see <em>Brink’s
                            Mat Ltd v Elcombe</em> [1988] 1 WLR 1350 <em>per</em> Ralph Gibson LJ at 1356). [emphasis in original

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Rajah JA further observed that the
                    “mere disclosure of material facts without more or devoid of the proper
                    context is in itself plainly insufficient to constitute full and frank
                    disclosure” (<em>The Vasiliy</em> at [91]). The
                    manner of disclosure of material facts to the court is also important. Baker J
                    in <em>Intergraph Corporation v Solid Systems CAD Services
                        Limited</em> [1993] FSR 617 at 625 observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... To present a judge with 600 pages of material on an <em>ex parte</em> application is coming a bit near abuse, unless
                        he is firmly and carefully guided, through the material. ... <em>it is of no use putting it in if the judge either cannot or
                            does not read it</em>. It is just as much not disclosed as if
                        it had not been put in at all. Unless the document is presented to the eyes
                        and/or the ears of the judge, it is not disclosed. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Plaintiff in seeking the Default Judgment
                    did not disclose that he did not give oral evidence nor was he cross-examined in
                    the Taiwanese Criminal Proceedings. There are suspicions as to whether the
                    Plaintiff relied on dementia to avoid testifying in the Taiwanese Criminal
                    Proceedings. The Defendant, in an affidavit dated 25 July 2008 (which was
                    sent to the Plaintiff), stated that “in Taiwan, Chen [the Plaintiff]
                    refused to attend the court to testify and lied that he had dementia and could
                    not attend court to testify”, and that “his daughter [Chen Ying
                    Hwa] also clearly expressed to the judge that his [<em>sic</em>] father had dementia and could not attend court to
                    testify”. Only Chen Ying Hwa’s evidence was set out in the record
                    of proceedings in the Taiwan Taipei District Court on 6 May 2008. There is
                    no evidence that the Plaintiff testified and was competent to do so in the
                    Taiwanese Criminal Proceedings. It was later stated in the judgment of the
                    Taiwan High Court (when the case went on appeal) that the Plaintiff simply
                    confirmed his statement made during investigation and signed it. This casts
                    further doubt on the Plaintiff’s assertions on his competency to testify.
                    If the Plaintiff indeed relied on his dementia to avoid giving oral evidence in
                    the Taiwanese Criminal Proceedings, this would be a material fact that should
                    have been drawn to the judge’s attention when the Default Judgment was
                    sought. However, this fact was not disclosed to the learned judge when the
                    Plaintiff applied to obtain the Default Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In light of the factors set out above, I was
                    persuaded that the Adjournment would be necessary to allow the Defendant a fair
                    opportunity of contesting the Plaintiff’s claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No substantial prejudice to the Plaintiff from the
                Adjournment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In granting the Adjournment, I was also
                    satisfied that the Plaintiff would not suffer substantial prejudice. It may be
                    said that the Plaintiff should not be prevented from realising the fruits of the
                    Default Judgment. However, it should be noted that the Plaintiff has already
                    recovered a substantial portion of the Default Judgment debt (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>). In addition, the Plaintiff
                    obtained an interim injunction on 13 July 2010 to restrain the Defendant
                    from giving any instruction to the Citibank Singapore Branch to terminate or
                    liquidate the securities under the Agreement, including moneys in the SSB
                    Account. There is no risk of dissipation of the Defendant’s assets if the
                    hearing is adjourned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It may also be argued that the Adjournment may
                    result in the Plaintiff becoming incompetent (if he was not already so) to give
                    oral evidence in court, given that the Plaintiff’s mental condition is
                    said to be deteriorating. However, considering that the Plaintiff’s
                    competency to testify was allegedly in doubt from the time proceedings were
                    commenced in Singapore, I am not persuaded that the Adjournment would be as
                    great an injustice to the Plaintiff as a refusal of such Adjournment would
                    clearly be to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I am also mindful of the fact that the
                    Defendant has attempted but has been prevented from presenting her case in these
                    proceedings. She clearly intends to contest the Plaintiff’s claims,
                    although her attempts to put forth a defence have largely been unsuccessful. In
                    addition, the Defendant’s application for parole has been refused time and
                    again. The Plaintiff’s counsel admitted that the Plaintiff would oppose
                    any application by the Defendant to obtain early release on
                parole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In light of these considerations, I considered
                    that it would only be just and fair to grant the Adjournment till the Defendant
                    is released from prison or, at the very least, till she is able to instruct
                    solicitors in Singapore. The Plaintiff is at liberty to apply for an early
                    hearing date should the Defendant’s application for parole be
                    granted.</p>
