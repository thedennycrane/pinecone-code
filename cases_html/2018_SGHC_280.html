The root of the dispute dates back to an indenture executed in 1985 where one brother, the plaintiff, transferred his interest to the other two, the defendants. The plaintiff, however, claimed that the indenture did not divest him of his interest in the property and that the defendants held the property on trust for him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In December 2015, the Property was sold for $16.3m.

The indenture of conveyance conveyed the trust property to the plaintiff and two defendants in equal shares. Each brother (Tai Sing, the plaintiff and two defendants) therefore had a one-quarter share in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On the same day the plaintiff received his interest under the 1974 Trust, the plaintiff executed an indenture of conveyance, transferring his one-quarter share in the Property to the two defendants in equal shares (each defendant thus receiving an additional one-eighth share in the Property) (the “Indenture”). By that conveyance, the final holding of the Property was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Two-eighth share in the Property held by Tai Sing (he previously received from the Father’s conveyance in 1974).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Three-eighth share in the Property held by the 1st defendant (comprising the one-quarter share in the Property previously held on trust for the 1st defendant and half of the plaintiff’s share in the Property).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Three-eighth share in the Property held by the 2nd defendant (comprising the one-quarter share in the Property previously held on trust for the 2nd defendant and half of the plaintiff’s share in the Property).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The conveyance from the plaintiff to the two defendants was the central focus of this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the Indenture, it was stated that a consideration of $200,000 was given by the defendants for the plaintiff’s interest in the Property.

While on the face of the Indenture, his interest in the Property was transferred to the two defendants for consideration, the true purpose of the transfer was to have the defendants hold the transferred interest on trust for him. The plaintiff’s interest would then be transferred back to him when he was older or when the property was sold. This arrangement was at the Mother and Tai Sing’s behest. Further, the consideration of $200,000 stated in the Indenture was a sham; there was no intention for actual funds to be passed nor were such funds actually paid. Against this backdrop, the plaintiff argued that the interest conveyed to the defendants was held on a resulting trust for him.

One of which was that the defendants had received the plaintiff’s share in the Property knowing that the transaction was made pursuant to breaches of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff argued that the Mother and Tai Sing’s instructions to have the plaintiff’s share in the Property transferred to the defendants were breaches of their fiduciary duty as trustees under the 1974 Trust. This is because the Mother, Tai Sing and the defendants exerted undue influence on him, among other things. The particulars pleaded in relation to the allegation of undue influence is that the defendants’ words and conduct were directed at having the plaintiff enter into the Indenture.

He relied on what he claimed were the practices of the family; which he described as closely-knit, and under the thumb of the Mother and Tai Sing, following the Father’s death. A particular point made was that the family had the practice of transferring assets among its members to protect its assets from creditors. The conveyance by the Father to himself, the Mother and Tai Sing, as well as the setting up of the trust in 1974 was one such attempt at shielding the family’s assets from creditors. At the material time, a business interest of the Father, Chenta Rayon (S) Pte Ltd was facing liquidation and the Father was personally liable to the business’ creditor, Bangkok Bank, under a guarantee. This prompted the Father to transfer various assets, including the Property, to different members of the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 When it came to the plaintiff’s financial woes, the Mother and Tai Sing instructed that the plaintiff transfer his interest in the Property to the defendants so as to shield the family’s assets from the plaintiff’s creditors. The plaintiff, however, would be able to have his interest in the Property back when his dues were paid off or when he was older. This position, however, evolved during the course of the proceedings. At one point, it appeared that the plaintiff was asserting that he was set up to go into bankruptcy as the family sought to protect its interests against Bangkok Bank pursuing claims relating to the guarantee given by the Father.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The principal event and transaction dates back to the 1980s, close to half a century ago. With the passage of time, the recollection of witnesses may be strained. To compound matters, the Mother and Tai Sing, two witnesses who had direct knowledge of the principal event, had since passed away. Given these difficulties, I found it better to base findings on probable events and documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I emphasise here that I came my conclusions primarily on the Indenture itself. The Plaintiff made assertions about the circumstances of the Indenture, including why he was asked to transfer his interest in the Property, who initiated it, and what the defendants knew or ought to have known. But in making these assertions, he had to convince the court to disregard the force of the written document, which was really the only objective evidence available. The burden lay on the plaintiff to introduce evidence that rebutted what was recorded in the Indenture. In this connection, the evidence adduced did not advance the plaintiff’s case far. Much of the plaintiff’s evidence were tangential to the central issues in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Additionally, the plaintiff raised a plethora of legal arguments in his closing submissions. In the final analysis, the issues tended to overlap and converge on several key factual points. Indeed, the entire basis of the plaintiff’s case was that the Mother and Tai Sing had arranged for the plaintiff to transfer his interest in the Property to the defendants under the Indenture to protect the family home from creditors. It was agreed that the defendants would hold the plaintiff’s share in the Property on trust for him and return his interest at a later point in time. A number of the plaintiff’s contentions could be disposed of on findings in this regard.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Ultimately, while it is understandable that the plaintiff faced evidential hurdles in making out his case, I was, in the end, not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to cross the requisite threshold. Various allegations were based on speculations as to the events that occurred and there was a dearth of objective evidence to support the plaintiff’s contentions. On balance, the plaintiff’s case failed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff raised a wide number of issues. In terms of the analysis, I found it best to first examine the central factual issues necessary to resolve the matter, before turning to consider the legal issues. In this relation, I propose to discuss the issues in the following order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The relevance and materiality of the various allegations made by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The effect of the 1985 transfer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Indenture).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) And flowing from the above, the causes of action as well as other peripheral matters: the plaintiff’s claims regarding a resulting trust or constructive trust, and the issue of undue influence, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Pleadings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Before I delve into the issues proper, it is apt at this juncture to address certain issues relating to the plaintiff’s pleaded case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It is trite that, generally, only material facts have to be pleaded. To this end, the key portions of the plaintiff’s pleaded case are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was common practice for property in the family to be held by one member for the benefit of others to avoid creditor claims. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff had poor control over his finances. By 1985, the Mother and Tai Sing were concerned that the plaintiff would squander his share of the Property and if the plaintiff ran into financial difficulties, the family home would be at risk. Hence, the Mother, Tai Sing and the defendants procured the plaintiff to remove any reference to his interest in the Property from the title.

Sometime around April 1985, the Mother and Tai Sing told the plaintiff to transfer his share in all the family assets (including the Property) to other family members. The inference to be drawn is that the Mother and Tai Sing wanted to use the plaintiff as the vehicle to escape claims from Bangkok Bank. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Sometime between 1987 to 2002, the family’s assets were consolidated in the 1st defendant’s name. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The dispute over the disposition of the Property arose sometime in 2013 or 2014, with the 2nd defendant being keen on selling the Property.

An example of this is the very circumstances that gave rise to the 1974 Trust: the Father arranged for the sons to effectively hold interest to the Property so as to circumvent claims from Bangkok Bank. This practice of circumventing creditors continued after the Father’s death.

The Mother and Tai Sing thus sought to have the plaintiff transfer his interest in the Property to the defendants. There was a separate contention in the submissions. The plaintiff asserted that he was used as a sacrifice to protect the family’s assets from his Father’s creditors, who were still pursuing claims against the Father’s estate at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As a result of the plaintiff seeking to prove the existence of the family’s practice of circumventing creditors, reference was made to various other unrelated assets owned by the Father for the benefit of the family or owned by the family itself. This included a property located on Emerald Hill and business interests in Malaysia.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiff’s resort to evidence of family practices is understandable as there was little evidence supporting the plaintiff’s case on the motivations behind the Indenture (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the attempt to shield the family home from creditors be it those of the Father or the plaintiff). Apart from the Indenture (which was against the plaintiff’s case), there was little relevant objective evidence which the plaintiff could rely on to shore up his position. The Mother and Tai Sing were obviously not able to provide evidence as to the reasons for the Indenture. The defendants, unsurprisingly, denied any knowledge of the plaintiff’s alleged motivations behind the Indenture. Hence, a considerable amount of time was spent on the issue of family practices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the end, I was of the view that the alleged family practices did not assist the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First and foremost, given the passage of time and the passing of key witnesses, such as the Mother, Tai Sing and for that matter, the Father, it was difficult to place significant weight on the evidence of the witnesses on the existence or non-existence of family practices. Furthermore, the plaintiff and the defendants’ views on the family practices would be affected, to some degree, by their interest in the outcome of the present case and were the parties’ own interpretation of the family’s affairs. As such, witness testimonies may not be the most reliable evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 There is also the further task of persuading the court of the inferences to be drawn from family customs and practices, as well as the relevance of and weight to be placed on those inferences to the immediate issue at hand. The strength that can be attributed to evidence of custom or practice as part of a chain of inferences about the facts in issue is likely, in most cases, to be weak:  alternative explanations come readily to mind. To illustrate in the context of testamentary dispositions, the mere fact that a family is patriarchal, and one that generally favours males over females, does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> mean that in relation to a particular disposition, there was an intention to favour the male members of the family over the females. What matters more is the direct evidence of the intention of the testator or person disposing of the property at the time of the legacy or gift. If there exists a document, evidence of custom or practices have to be particularly cogent to overcome the documentary evidence; even on the standard of a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The critical question before me concerns a specific transaction that took place in 1985 (the Indenture). None of the background matters raised by the plaintiff touched directly on the transaction in question, and in fact predate the 1985 transaction by about a decade. The inferences that could be drawn from the Father’s attempts at shielding assets from creditors would at most be speculative; especially since it was the Mother and Tai Sing, not the Father, who orchestrated the various transfers in 1985. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The crucial aspect of the plaintiff’s case is not the fact that he divested himself of interest in the Property but the fact that there was an arrangement that the interest be returned to him eventually. Even if the plaintiff’s evidence on the existence of a family practice were accepted, there needs to be evidence of the Mother, Tai Sing and the defendants arranging to have the interest held on trust and an understanding that the interest would be transferred back the plaintiff. The weight to be given to the plaintiff’s asserted family practices, if I should find it to be true, is therefore negligible. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Indenture was a genuine conveyance </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Both parties were in agreement in so far as the plaintiff was facing financial woes leading up to the execution of the Indenture. However, both sides parted ways when it came to the effect of the Indenture:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As regards the plaintiff, there was an arrangement to have his interest held on trust for him and for this interest to be returned to him at a later date. This was to circumvent creditor claims. The Indenture therefore did not capture the full arrangement of the family <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the plaintiff’s interest in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As regards the defendants, the plaintiff had to sell his interest in the Property to raise funds to pay off his dues. The Indenture was therefore evidence of an outright sale by the plaintiff to the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I begin by setting out the details contained within the Indenture.

</div> The Indenture was made on 10 April 1985 between the plaintiff as “vendor” and the two defendants as “purchasers”. On its face, the document stated that the vendor had agreed to sell the Property to the purchasers at the price of $200,000. Upon conveyance, the purchasers held the vendor’s interest in fee simple as tenants-in-common in equal shares. The Indenture was signed by the plaintiff. The Indenture was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of the solicitor acting in the matter. It was thereafter duly registered at the Registry of Deeds. No issue was taken with the formalities of the document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As there was a properly signed, sealed and delivered document that was witnessed by a solicitor, cogent evidence would be needed for this court to disregard the clear contents of the Indenture. The burden lay on the plaintiff to introduce evidence that would rebut what was recorded in the Indenture. As noted above, I was not persuaded that there was cogent evidence to find that the plaintiff’s interest was conveyed pursuant to a particular arrangement where he would have his interest returned. The Indenture was an outright sale of the plaintiff’s interest. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alleged arrangement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the Property would be retransferred at a later point in time. The plaintiff was facing financial woes at the material time, and the Mother and Tai Sing decided that it would be best if the plaintiff divested himself of his interest in the interim to protect the family home from creditors. Following the Mother and Tai Sing’s decision, the defendants (as well as the Mother and Tai Sing) exerted undue influence on the plaintiff to have him execute the Indenture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff added that he agreed to the transfer as he was loyal and obedient. The arrangement that the Mother and Tai Sing came to was mentioned in the presence of the two defendants.

He was promised that there would be a retransfer when he was older or when the Property was sold. The plaintiff further explained that Tai Sing was particularly close to him. Tai Sing was able to persuade the plaintiff to transfer  his interest in the Property to the defendants as the plaintiff believed that Tai Sing would be alive for long enough to protect his interest should the defendants try to keep the plaintiff’s share for themselves.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I could not accept the plaintiff’s evidence for several reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, the changes in the plaintiff’s position on the motivations behind the Indenture cannot be overlooked. The plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the purpose of the transfer was to shield the family home from his own creditors. In the submissions, the plaintiff’s case took on a different shade; suggesting that he was a scapegoat for the family to defraud the family’s (or the Father’s) creditor. There was reason to believe that the position eventually reached in the plaintiff’s submissions was an afterthought. Further, the changes in the plaintiff’s position leave doubt in the reliability of his evidence. This is in contrast to the defendant’s consistent position that there was no arrangement (see below at [61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The second difficulty lies in the plaintiff’s evidence during cross-examination. It was critical to the plaintiff’s case that the arrangement for retransfer of his interest was communicated to the defendants, as this was the very basis for the plaintiff’s claim in trust. Thus, it was the plaintiff’s position in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the arrangement to have his interest retransferred to him was discussed in the presence of the two defendants. During cross-examination, however, the plaintiff appeared to retract from this position. He appeared not to have had personal knowledge of whether the defendants were aware of the alleged arrangement. When asked by counsel for the 1st defendant whether he was uncertain or had no knowledge of the Mother and Tai Sing mentioning the alleged arrangement to retransfer the shares to the 1st defendant, the plaintiff replied: “Yes”.

</div> The plaintiff was also asked by counsel for the 2nd defendant about his personal knowledge as to whether the alleged arrangement was told to the 2nd defendant. The plaintiff’s responses skirted around the issue. Eventually the position the plaintiff came to was that the 2nd defendant must have known of the alleged arrangement because it was the 2nd defendant who brought him to the solicitors to effect the Indenture.

</div> This answer did not advance the plaintiff’s case at all. As the trial progressed, the plaintiff came to the position that he did not discuss with the two defendants the decision taken by the Mother and Tai Sing regarding the alleged arrangement.

</div>
</div> In the end, I found, on a balance of probabilities, that the plaintiff was unaware of whether the defendants had actually been told of the alleged arrangement. This finding is crucial as it goes against the plaintiff’s assertion that the document the family had him execute was a sham, and the assertion that there was collusion between members of the family to apply undue influence on the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Give the above weaknesses of the plaintiff’s case, I found the defendants’ respective positions to be the more probable explanation of what transpired. While there were slight variations in the accounts, the factual commonality was that the plaintiff needed funds to pay off his dues and thus an arrangement was made to have the plaintiff sell his interest in the Property to the two defendants. The Indenture was the embodiment of this sale. To my mind, it was significant that the plaintiff did not dispute the fact that he was facing financial woes at the material time. There was therefore reason to believe that the plaintiff himself sought the family to purchase his share in the Property so that he could pay off his creditors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of the solicitor who drafted and witnessed the Indenture</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The solicitor who drafted and witnessed the Indenture was called to the stand. I did not place much weight on the solicitor’s testimony as the solicitor generally gave evidence about what he would have done rather than what actually transpired at the material time. This is unsurprising as the events took place close to half a century ago. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff, during the trial, sought to suggest that there was a possible collusion between the solicitors of the firm that oversaw the Indenture and Tai Sing. This is a strong allegation and particularly cogent evidence would be required. Again, the plaintiff only had his word to rely on.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On a whole, what was before me was the Indenture. On its face, there was nothing untoward about the Indenture. As noted, it was duly signed, sealed, delivered and witnessed (by a solicitor no less). It had all the trappings of a genuine conveyance. The plaintiff had to therefore adduce cogent evidence to suggest otherwise. The plaintiff was unable to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether consideration was given</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The plaintiff asserted that no consideration was received. The defendants, on the other hand, each maintained that consideration was paid, although they gave differing evidence of how payment was made. It is clear that both sides faced evidential difficulties in demonstrating whether consideration was paid or not. However, the Indenture indicated that payment was made on or before execution. Bearing in mind that the plaintiff had to adduce cogent evidence to the contrary, the assertion that payment was not received, without more, would not advance the plaintiff’s case very far. The fact of non-payment could well be a breach of the terms of the Indenture as opposed to evidence of a sham transaction. What is more pertinent are circumstances prior to the drafting of the Indenture suggesting that the document was intended to be a façade. For these reasons, the probable inference is that the $200,000 had indeed been paid. I therefore was unpersuaded by the plaintiff that consideration was not paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Seeing that there was difficulty demonstrating that consideration was not paid, the plaintiff made certain arguments to bolster his position. One of which was that consideration did not move from the defendants.

</div> This is a non-starter. If it were accepted that consideration had been paid (regardless of the recipient), then it would be moot to suggest that the transaction was a sham. The parties would have acted in a manner consistent with there being a genuine conveyance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Ultimately, even if consideration were not paid, this does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>lead to the conclusion that the Indenture was a sham. The conveyance was done by way of an indenture, whether consideration flowed from the defendants or was given at all is strictly speaking irrelevant. This is because an indenture, being a deed, may be enforced without proof of consideration: <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon </span><span class="font-italic">Ing v Loh Szi Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [65]. As stated, the more pertinent issue is whether there are circumstances prior to the drafting of the Indenture to suggest that the document was intended to be a façade. To this end, my findings were that there was no arrangement to have the defendants hold the plaintiff’s interest in the Property in the interim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether a resulting trust arose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I come now to the plaintiff’s arguments on the existence of a resulting trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 There are generally two ways in which a resulting trust is presumed to arise. The first is where there has been no exhaustion or transfer of the beneficial interest because of some failure or omission (typically, in cases where the express trust fails), and the second is where there has been unequal contribution towards the acquisition of property or the transfer of property as a gift: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [34]. Pausing here, the term “presumed” here is used in a broad sense to denote a trust that arises by operation of law as a response to a set of presumed factual incidents, and not in the distinction between presumed and automatic resulting trusts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 A resulting trust may also arise independent of the presumption of resulting trust so long as it can be shown that the transfer was not intended to benefit the recipient. In the same vein, a resulting trust may not necessarily arise even if there were no consideration, if it can be shown that the transfer was indeed intended to benefit the recipient: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [35]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [43]. While the doctrinal basis of the resulting trust has not been fully settled, there appears to be agreement coalescing around the idea that a resulting trust arises from a lack of intention to benefit the recipient of the property: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [44]–[48].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Given the findings above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the conveyance was genuine, there was no family arrangement to have the plaintiff’s interest in the Property transferred back to him, and consideration was duly paid, no resulting trust arose (whether presumed or otherwise). There was no oral express trust among the family members that failed, and the transfer was not a gift. The plaintiff’s conveyance was not one where there was no intention to benefit the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I should, however, address a point raised by the 2nd defendant. It was submitted that the plaintiff’s intention or lack thereof can clearly be discerned from the plaintiff’s subsequent conduct. The plaintiff’s conduct showed that he did not consider himself to have had any interest in the Property; making particular reference to the plaintiff’s declaration of his assets in relation to bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff sometime between 1985 to 1988.

</div> I could not accept this argument. The plaintiff’s conduct was equivocal at best – his conduct may suggest that he did not regard himself as having any beneficial interest in the Property but it may also well be that the plaintiff chose not to make full disclosure during the bankruptcy proceedings. The point being that the plaintiff could have acted the way he did for a number of reasons and not necessarily because he believed that he did not have an interest in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Constructive trust and knowing receipt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiff’s case on constructive trust and knowing receipt was unclear: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At points, the plaintiff appeared to take the position that a constructive trust ought to be imposed against the defendants (or that the defendants took property subject to a constructive trust) because they had received trust property knowing that the transfer of the property was the result of a breach of fiduciary duty or undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At other points, the plaintiff appeared to take the position that the constructive trust arose upon the Mother and Tai Sing having exerted undue influence and having breached of their fiduciary duty. The defendants as volunteers received the plaintiff’s interest in the Property subject to the constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There were also hints of a remedial constructive trust; the argument being that in all the circumstances surrounding the Indenture, without having reference to the Mother and Tai Sing’s position as trustees under the 1974 Trust, it would be unconscionable for the defendants to retain the plaintiff’s interest to the Property.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Regardless of the vagueness in the plaintiff’s position, the entire basis of the plaintiff’s claim in relation to a constructive trust and knowing receipt is the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty on the part of the Mother and Tai Sing, and the undue influence exerted by the Mother, Tai Sing and the defendants. It is only on this basis that the plaintiff could make the further allegation there was knowing receipt on the part of the defendant or that the circumstances were unconscionable. As the primary plank of the plaintiff’s case appears to be the exercise of undue influence, I will deal with this first. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Undue Influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The law recognises that there may be situations where consent or agreement may not be an expression of a person’s free will. One such instance is where there has been an exercise of undue influence (where there has been some misuse of a person’s influence over another such that consent procured was not the exercise of free will). In this relation, the exercise of undue influence by a trustee would generally amount to a breach of fiduciary duty as it manifests an intention to act against the interests of the affected beneficiary: see <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v </span><span class="font-italic">Etridge (No 2)</span> [2002] 2 AC 773 (“<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span>”) at [104] and [156] on the interaction between undue influence and fiduciary relationships. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Undue influence may be proved in one of two ways: actual undue influence, and presumed undue influence. Actual undue influence is quite self-explanatory – there being proof of actual misuse of ascendancy over another to procure consent. It is presumed undue influence that warrants some discussion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The law splinters presumed undue influence into two further categories, commonly referred to as Class 2A and Class 2B undue influence. The distinction between the two categories lie in the relationship in question between the influencer and the influenced. In the former (Class 2A), the relationship is one where trust and confidence (or influence) is presumed. This includes the relationship between a trustee and a beneficiary. In the latter, (Class 2B), the relationship of trust and confidence (or influence) is not presumed. That said, a relationship of trust and confidence alone (without any impropriety) is not enough to impugn a transaction. It must further be shown that the transaction in question calls for an explanation: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed), (Academy Publishing, 2012)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 12.117; see generally <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Whether the label Class 2A or Class 2B should be adopted is a matter of some debate. However, what is clear is that in relation to presumed undue influence, the court must be satisfied that the relationship between the parties was one where there would be a likelihood for abuse (hence the term “trust and confidence”) and the transaction in question calls for an explanation. What amounts to a transaction that calls for an explanation is of course a fact-sensitive inquiry and much would depend on the strength of inferences to be drawn from the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff appeared to take the position that the undue influence was exerted by the Mother, Tai Sing and the defendants. In my view, there was no evidence of actual undue influence. Neither was there anything in the transaction which calls for an explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I start with the transaction itself. As I have found above, the Indenture was properly executed and consideration was duly paid. I further accepted as probable, the defendants’ evidence that the plaintiff had sought the sale of his interest in the Property to obtain funds for the purposes of paying off his dues. On this basis, there was nothing untoward about the transaction in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 There was also insufficient evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the execution of the Indenture to raise any suspicion of any exercise of undue influence. The plaintiff’s evidence in court was that the defendants did not have much influence over his conduct.

</div>
</div> Furthermore, as I stated above, the plaintiff did not know if the defendants were aware of the alleged arrangement regarding the transfer and retransfer of the plaintiff’s interest in the Property. It stands to reason that the defendants could not have exercised undue influence as the defendants would likely have mentioned of the alleged arrangement if undue influence had been exercised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As for the Mother and Tai Sing, apart from the plaintiff’s testimony, the court did not and could not have the benefit of the Mother and Tai Sing’s version of events. In such circumstances, the court is left with the documentary evidence to size up the plaintiff’s testimony and as I have stated, the plaintiff’s evidence was insufficiently cogent to rebut the inferences to be drawn from the documents adduced in court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other breach of fiduciary duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiff was not entirely clear as to what fiduciary obligations had been breached. However, seeing that the plaintiff’s compliant was about the family not having protected his interests, the plaintiff must be referring to the no-conflict and no-profit rule. The simple point is that the plaintiff was ultimately the one who executed the Indenture. As stated, the execution was proper and consideration was paid. I had also not found there to have been undue influence exercised on the plaintiff. In these circumstances, there was no breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff had been kept aware of the circumstances and allowed the events to unfurl. In any event, the plaintiff’s oral testimony on the alleged breach of fiduciary duty did not advance his case at all. When queried during cross-examination about whether he maintained that the Mother was in breach of her fiduciary duties, the plaintiff stated that she was not and made some vague reference to “reasons” behind the Mother’s actions.

The plaintiff called upon the conveyancing solicitor who took conduct of the drafting of the Deed of Confirmation at trial. It was revealed that the solicitor had relied exclusively on the plaintiff’s instructions without the input of any of the defendants.

</div>
</div> While the solicitor attempted to water down his answers, the fact of the matter is that as a conveyancing solicitor, it was incumbent on him to trace the root of the title. As it turned out the searches on the Property did not yield the plaintiff as a proprietor and yet the solicitor proceeded to act on the assumption that the plaintiff’s instructions were correct (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the plaintiff had a beneficial interest to the Property since 1985).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Secondly, the Deed of Confirmation was not contemporaneous with the Indenture. It was drafted at least 20 years after the Indenture was executed. This leads me to the point below on the purpose of the Deed of Confirmation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thirdly, the Deed of Confirmation came about because the defendants were at odds about the sale of the Property sometime in 2014. According to the 1st defendant, he had been in a dispute with the 2nd defendant at the material time. As matters transpired, there were discussions among the proprietors to sell the Property, while the 1st defendant was insistent that the Property not be sold so that the Mother could continue living in the family home. The plaintiff acted as an intermediary between the 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant at the material time and proposed a solution to the matter. This involved the conveyance of the plaintiff’s original interest in the Property to him to be held neutrally so that any attempts at a sale of the Property could be stopped. Hence, the 1st defendant was brought to sign the Deed of Confirmation.

</div> In other words, the Deed of Confirmation was a compromise between the parties. I accepted the 1st defendant’s evidence. It is supported by a draft Deed of Confirmation which included the following phrase: “undertake to transfer back to you your 1/8 share held by me in trust for you … when our mother passes away or when the property is sold”.

</div> While, the portion concerning the death of the Mother and the sale of the property was pencilled out, the fact remains – the Deed of Confirmation concerned the disposal of the Property while the Mother was still alive. Additionally, the plaintiff’s case itself does, to some extent, corroborate the 1st defendant’s account of the events in 2014.

In general, conditions may be imposed on the disposition of property. It follows that regard may be had to the context surrounding the disposition to discern the intention of the transferor in relation to a condition of the disposition: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</span> (Tan Sook Yee gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) at paras 5.20–5.24.

While the document did not expressly state that it was to come into effect only if signed by both defendants, it was clear from the context that the parties intended for this to be the case. Indeed, the plaintiff’s solicitor explained that the plaintiff had intended to record a compromise where both the defendants had to sign the Deed of Conveyance. The solicitor added that after informing the plaintiff that the Deed of Conveyance was ineffective for want of the 2nd defendant’s endorsement, the plaintiff simply informed him that there was “nothing he can do”.

Hence, calling these additional witnesses would not have yielded much in the end. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The 2nd defendant contended that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by laches as the plaintiff’s delay in claiming the trust had prejudiced him. The prejudice, as was argued, arose from the passage of time; given that the 2nd defendant would not be able to recall events and the lack of witnesses.

</div> While it is true that the passage of time may in some cases cause prejudice, I am doubtful that the passage of time and its effect on the quality of evidence alone would be sufficient prejudice on the facts here. Whether it would be inequitable for the claimant to assert his interest after a delay would be dependent on the circumstances. The primary mischief addressed by the doctrine of laches is the prejudice arising from a claimant seeking to pursue a claim after having sat on it for an inordinate amount of time such that the other potential party would have proceeded on the basis that his interests were not subject to an adverse claim. The court would not readily find laches simply because of the passage of time but would have to assess the matter in the round: see <span class="font-italic">Nelson v Rye and another </span>[1996] 1 WLR 1378 at 1392G. Here, the plaintiff’s case was that his interest was held on trust since the transfer of his interest by way of the Indenture. I was of the view that it would be inappropriate for laches to operate in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Flowing from the findings above, the reliefs sought by the plaintiff are refused.
