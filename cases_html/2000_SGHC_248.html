<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><b>The facts</b></p>
<p align="justify">1.    The plaintiff, Mr Denis Matthew Harte (‘Mr

Harte’), is from New York. He came to Singapore in August 1996 to work as a trading

manager with E D &amp; F Man Asia Pte Ltd. It was a promotion for him. His wife, Mrs

Michelle Lynn Harte (‘Mrs Harte’), later joined him in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">2.    Mr Harte is 36 years of age and his wife is 38.

They were married in November 1989. When they were in New York, they started trying for a

child in the spring of 1994. Having met with no success after 2 years, they sought medical

advice. In April 1996, Mrs Harte saw a gynaecologist, Dr James Jones. On Dr Jones’

advice, Mr Harte consulted Dr Lawrence Dubin, a New York urologist. Tests conducted

established that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Mr Harte produced a normal quantity of sperm and ejaculate. Seminal

  test on 22 April 1996 revealed that the total sperm count was 98 million as opposed to 60

  to 80 million for a normal sperm count.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) His testicles were of normal size, the right measuring 25 cc and

  the left measuring 15 cc.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) He had normal testosterone levels.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The quality of his sperm was in a subfertile range. Some 40% of his

  sperm were motile with poor forward progression, when the normal level should be about 60%

  with good forward progression. Only 11 % reached full maturity when the normal level

  should be over 60%.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) Clinical examination showed that he had a large left varicocele

  with reflux, palpable with Mr Harte standing in an upright position while performing a

  valsalva manoeuvre (i.e. forceful attempt at exhalation with nostrils and mouth closed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3.    Dr Dubin then advised Mr Harte to undergo a

surgical procedure known as a left varicocelectomy. According to Dr R.G. Notley, a

consultant urological surgeon in the United Kingdom testifying on behalf of the plaintiff,

the objective of a varicocele operation is to reduce the pool of warm blood in the

varicose veins surrounding the testes, which increases the temperature in the

spermatogonia and decreases the efficiency with which they turn into spermatids. By

ligating the appropriate number of varicose veins in the scrotum, the pool of warm blood

is removed due to the mechanism of thrombosis. The temperature in the testicular area is

correspondingly lowered and fertility is enhanced.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    On 15 May 1996, Dr Dubin wrote to Dr Jones and

copied his letter to the plaintiff. After 3 semen samples from Mr Harte were analysed, Dr

Dubin concluded that they were highly sub-fertile specimens due to poor sperm morphology.

He suggested a left varicocelectomy to improve the semen quality. All expectations,

ramifications and complications were fully explained to the couple. Some concepts of

intrauterine insemination together with stimulation of ovulation were discussed. But they

were told that the high degree of immaturity in the sperm would perhaps negate this

approach. In vitro fertilization was also mentioned briefly to them. The plaintiff did not

dispute these discussions as stated by Dr Dubin in his letter.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    Dr Dubin eventually performed the left

varicocelectomy surgery in June 1996. It involved ligation and excision of two markedly

dilated internal spermatic veins at the groin area, where a left inguinal incision was

made and carried down to the area of the external ring. Subsequently, Dr Dubin checked

under 6 power loupes magnification to ensure that the artery and vas were intact. After

the surgery, Mr Harte had minor pain and swelling, and some discomfort for about two days.

At worst, his scrotum increased about 50% in size. By the third day, the pain and swelling

subsided. The pathologist found that the tubular dilated spermatic vein removed by Dr

Dubin measured 0.1 cm in diameter.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    From August 1996 (when the couple arrived in

Singapore) to early 1997, they tried again to start a family but there was no success

despite that left varicocele operation by Dr Dubin.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>7 April 1997 – 1<sup>st</sup> Consultation</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">7.    On 7 April 1997, Mr Harte decided to consult the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant, Dr Tan Hun Hoe (‘Dr Tan’), who is a specialist urologist and a renal

transplant surgeon in Singapore. Dr Tan’s private clinic is known as H H Tan Urology

Centre Pte Ltd., which was then located at unit #04-03 on the 4<sup>th</sup> storey of the

Gleneagles Medical Centre. Gleneagles Medical Centre is located next to Gleneagles

Hospital (‘hospital’), which is owned and managed by the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants. Dr Tan is an accredited surgeon with the hospital and has an arrangement,

whereby he may perform his surgical operations on his private patients using the

hospital’s facilities. At all material times, Mr Harte was a private patient of Dr

Tan. </p>
<p align="justify">8.    At the first consultation in Dr Tan’s clinic,

Mr Harte informed Dr Tan of his left varicocelectomy by Dr Dubin. He told Dr Tan that no

seminal analysis was done since to determine how effective that surgery was. Dr Tan

therefore requested for a seminal analysis. On clinical examination, Dr Tan found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) there was no abnormality in his genitalia;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) his testes were of normal size and consistency;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) there was <u><b>no varicocele</b></u> or hydrocele.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">9.    The seminal test results dated 8 April 1997 from

Sheng Yu Laboratory revealed that Mr Harte had a sperm count of 29.5 million per ml (the

normal level being about 20 million per ml) and a good volume of ejaculate of 4 mls after

abstinence of 5 days (the normal level being between 1 to 6 mls). However, the sperm

motility was 35 % (the normal level being equal or above 40%). Normal forms were only 3 %

(the normal level being equal or greater than 30%). The laboratory classified his sperm

quality as "Asthenozoospermia (reduction in the vitality of spermatozoa) with severe

teratozoospermia (the presence of deformed spermatozoa)." The laboratory’s

comment was "Adequate volume of semen showed low % sperm motility and low % normal

forms with high % tail defects."</p>
<p align="justify">10.    Instead of improving, the normal forms had in

fact dropped from 15% to some 3% after Dr Dubin’s operation. Based on this seminal

analysis, Dr Dubin agreed that there was no improvement after the operation. In his

opinion, about 15% of cases would not show improvement after a varicocelectomy.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>14 April 1997 - Dr Tan’s letter to Dr Wun</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">11.    On 14 April 1997, Dr Tan wrote to Dr Winnie Wun,

the gynaecologist whom Mrs Harte was consulting for her own fertility problems. Dr Wun had

recommended Dr Tan to them. As this letter indicates the then state of mind of Dr Tan and

reveals his contemporaneous medical conclusions, it featured in my assessment of whether

Dr Tan was negligent in recommending a bilateral varicocelectomy operation for Mr Harte. I

therefore set it out in full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dear Dr. Wun, </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Re: Denis M. Harte M/32</b> </p>
<p align="justify">Thank you for referring Denis, husband of your patient Michelle.</p>
<p align="justify">He gave a history of left variocelectomy in New York in June ’96

  and <u>a thermal scan subsequently showed improvement</u>. </p>
<p align="justify">Clinically <u>no abnormality was detectable</u> in his genitalia. Both

  testicles were of normal size and consistency. <u>There was no evidence of varicocele.</u></p>
<p align="justify">A 3 D [Three Dimensional] TransRectal Ultrasound Scan revealed a <u>normal

  prostate and ejaculatory ducts.</u> Both seminal vesicles were distended but he had

  abstained for 5 days.</p>
<p align="justify">A S.A. [Seminal Analysis] revealed <u>Asthensozoospermia with severe

  Teratozoospermia. Volume and density was adequate</u>.</p>
<u><p align="justify">A Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scan <b>could be useful</b> in view of

  the above findings.</p>
</u><p align="justify">Will keep you informed.</p>
<p align="justify">Warmest regards,</p>
<p align="justify">(Signed Dr Tan Hun Hoe)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">12.    It appears that Dr Tan was hoping to find the

cause or source of the infertility using the Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scan

(‘CDUS’) after he failed to detect any varicocele clinically. Having checked

that the prostate and ejaculatory ducts were normal, what then was the cause of his poor

sperm quality? I do not find that Dr Tan’s further investigations using the CDUS can

be regarded as exceptional, wrong or negligent. I do not expect a doctor to stop his

inquiries simply because the clinical investigation has failed to locate the source of the

problem. I expect him to continue with other tests, aids and investigating techniques in a

systematic manner, whether with or without special instruments, to find the cause and

resolve the patient’s medical problem if he can.</p>
<p align="justify">13.    I thus reject the opinion of the plaintiff’s

experts that it was wrong for Dr Tan to use a CDUS to detect varicoceles simply because no

varicocele was detected clinically or that the CDUS was too sensitive an equipment for

detection of varicoceles. The following medical literature supports the use of ultrasound

equipment to detect clinical and subclinical varicoceles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Evaluation and Management of the Infertile Male: What’s New

  and What’s Important (Interactive) by Goldstein, Pryor and Schlegel.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Clinical versus Subclinical Varicocele: Improvement in Fertility

  after Varicocelectomy by Dhabuwala, Hamid and Moghissi.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Correlation of Testicular Color Doppler Ultrasonography, Physical

  Examination and Venography in the Detection of Left Varicoceles in Men with Infertility by

  Petros, Middleton and Picus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14.    The caveat I have is that instruments must always

be correctly used and the results obtained must be properly interpreted in the light of

the peculiar limitations and characteristics of the instruments. Full regard must also be

given to clinical observations and other investigations performed. After that, a carefully

considered medical judgment is called for whether to recommend proceeding with the

operation or not, taking into account the risks involved in that particular type of

operation and weighing them against other alternative courses of therapy (i.e. without the

operation). Depending on the condition of the patient and the amount of information sought

by the patient, the doctor must use his clinical judgment to decide what and how much he

should tell the patient of the various risks, the pros and cons of each viable option and

then, he has to objectively present and explain them to his patient, taking account of the

patient’s level of understanding and interest in the matter, so that the patient will

have enough information to make the final decision.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    Mr Harte complained that had he seen the letter

to Dr Wun, he would not have agreed to the operation because Dr Tan had found no evidence

of varicocele. He would have sought a second opinion. To my mind, that was with the

benefit of hindsight.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>15 April 1997 – 2<sup>nd</sup> Consultation</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">16.    On 15 April 1997, Mr and Mrs Harte saw Dr Tan

again. They handed to him copies of his surgery reports and other medical documents

pertaining to his first varicocelectomy as well as some medical literature provided by Dr

Dubin.</p>
<p align="justify">17.    I will digress a little to deal with the medical

literature first. I presumed that Mr and Mrs Harte had read these articles and were not

completely ignorant when they discussed their fertility problems with Dr Tan.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    I note that the article published in November

1977, ‘<i>Varicocelectomy: 986 Cases in a twelve-year study</i>’ by Dubin and

Amelar had stated, "<i>We have also performed <b>reoperations</b> in 5 other patients

who had previously had varicocelectomy by other physicians with recurrence: 3 of the 5 had

improvement in semen quality and pregnancy. These cases are not included in this reported

series.</i>" Therefore, variocelectomy <b>reoperations</b> are not something unknown

or exceptional.</p>
<p align="justify">19.    Another article published in May 1987, ‘<i>Right

varicocelectomy in selected infertile patients who have failed to improve after previous

left varicocelectomy’</i> also by Dubin and Amelar, reported that "<i>Most

recently in 1986, McClure and Hricak studied 50 infertile men using scrotal sonography and

found that 24 (48%) had bilateral varicoceles as <b>detected with ultrasound</b> (as

opposed to an 8 % incidence of bilateral varicoceles in fertile controls.)</i>" This

shows that using ultrasound to detect varicoceles is not inappropriate as an aid for

diagnosing such a condition. In my opinion, it is a useful diagnostic tool if used

correctly. The authors, Dubin and Amelar, had not commented that it was wrong to do so.

However, for their own practice they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The clinical diagnosis of varicocele is not always a simple matter. In

  our practice we rely on careful palpation. Contact scrotal thermography using the Clark

  Topical Thermograph (Clark Research and Development, Inc., New Orleans, LA) has been a

  useful supplemental diagnostic tool, but for this study we have relied entirely on our

  careful palpation for making the decision about whether or not a patient had a varicocele

  and whether it was small, moderate, or large in size. </p>
<p align="justify">Patients must be examined in the upright position because all but very

  large varicoceles will be overlooked because of venous decompression if the patient is

  supine. Reflux of blood down the internal spermatic veins into the scrotum should be

  determined by careful palpation of both left and right spermatic cords while the standing

  patient performs the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver is extremely important because small

  varicoceles will not be diagnosed without it, and correct bilateral therapy will not be

  suggested.</p>
<p align="justify">If by this method of careful palpation we cannot detect a varicocele,

  we do not diagnose a varicocele in that patient. We have not subscribed to the existence

  of the so-called subclinical varicocele that cannot be detected by careful palpation with

  the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">20.    The authors were clearly concerned that small

varicoceles were not missed, although they did not think that these small varicoceles

would escape a careful palpation with the Valsalva maneuver. Thus they preferred the

clinical approach even for small varicoceles whereas as I see it, others might well prefer

using the CDUS as an aid in detection.</p>
<p align="justify">21.    In the third article given to Dr Tan by Mr Harte,

‘<i>Varicocelectomy: Twenty-five Years of Experience’,</i> published in 1988, it

recognised that the modification of the Ivanissevich procedure is simple and the <b>average

surgeon can achieve excellent results</b>. In this procedure, the inguinal incision is

made over the internal inguinal ring. An incision is made in the external oblique muscle

through the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord there is then dissected free.

Finally, the internal spermatic veins are ligated and partially excised at the internal

inguinal ring. <b>In recent years, the procedure has been further modified by ligating the

veins even lower at the level just below the external ring</b>. However, the article

cautioned that the artery, the external spermatic veins, and the vasal veins should not be

ligated in this procedure. Table II of the article shows very few incidents of

post-operative complication, which attest to the benign nature of the surgery. None of the

varicocelectomy operations involving 986 men resulted in a disastrous post-operative

complication of testicular atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">22.    The article went on to say that surgery is

indicated by poor sperm motility and immaturity, <u><b>and</b></u> the presence of

varicocele. Varicocele is established by a large body of evidence as a major cause of male

infertility. Where the varicocele cannot be demonstrated by palpation or <b>crude doppler

techniques,</b> the temptation to ligate the internal spermatic vein in patients with poor

sperm motility and morphology must be resisted. This suggests that where an ultrasound

doppler scan as an alternative confirmatory test to palpation does confirm the presence of

varicocele in a man with poor semen quality, it is in order to proceed with a

varicocelectomy operation. Therefore, the contention that it was wrong for Dr Tan to have

operated is without foundation if the CDUS that Dr Tan requested for had indeed detected a

varicocele condition.</p>
<p align="justify">23.    On 15 April 1997, Dr Koay Lok Hin, a radiologist

practising at Gleneagles Hospital, performed the scrotal ultrasound scan with Mr Harte

lying supine. Dr Koay’s brief report stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><u>COLOUR DOPPLER U/S OF TESTES</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Both testes show normal size and parenchymal echogenicity. No evidence

    of abnormal focal intratesticular lesions is seen.</p>
<p align="justify">Both heads of epididymis appear normal.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>There is evidence of <b>intermittent</b> varicoceles demonstrable on

    the left side on valsalva manoeuvre. <b>Very early minimal intermittent</b> varicoceles is

    noted on the right side on valsalva manoeuvre.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><u>COMMENTS</u></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>Intermittent</b> varicoceles noted on the left side.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">24.    Mr Harte admitted being told by Dr Tan that the

CDUS revealed a varicocele recurrence on the left side, and a varicocele <b>forming</b> on

the right. Dr Tan further read, explained and showed him the radiological report. I cannot

find any deliberate concealment or misrepresentation of the CDUS results by Dr Tan. Mr

Harte’s complaint was apparently about Dr Tan’s failure to disclose that he did

not find any varicocele <b>clinically</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">25.    Based on the CDUS, Dr Koay explained that he

found evidence of varicocele on the left side and very mild varicocele on the right side.

Dr Tan’s interpretation and explanation to Mr Harte of the CDUS report was thus

fundamentally correct.</p>
<p align="justify">26.    Dr Tan wrote on 16 April 1997 to Dr Wun informing

her that Mr Harte’s CDUS revealed ‘<i>recurrence/persistence of the left

varicocele.</i>’ He noted that only two branches of the internal spermatic veins were

ligated previously and suggested a repeat varicocelectomy at a <b>lower level</b> for Mr

Harte to consider.</p>
<p align="justify">27.    This letter significantly corroborates Dr

Tan’s oral evidence that he operated at a different site from that operated by Dr

Dubin. Dr Tan testified that he operated at a lower part of the spermatic cord. Thus the

problems alluded to by the plaintiff’s experts of the dangers or increased risks of

re-operating on the same part of the spermatic cord do not apply.</p>
<p align="justify">28.    According to the plaintiff, Dr Tan advised them

to have a second varicocelectomy to enhance his fertility. He remarked that Dr Dubin had

been too conservative. Dr Tan said that he still had a left varicocele and a varicocele

was developing on the right as well. Even after Dr Dubin’s surgery, the quality of Mr

Harte’s sperm had not improved. So he advocated a bilateral varicocelectomy because

the infertile condition was due to bilateral varicoceles. I have no doubt that Mr and Mrs

Harte relied on the advice of Dr Tan and consequently, consented to the bilateral

varicocelectomy.</p>
<p align="justify">29.    Dr Tan assured them that there would be no

complications following the day surgery other than some minor swelling and general

discomfort lasting just a few days. Mr Harte was not surprised because he had experienced

these normal side effects after his previous varicocelectomy in New York. Dr Tan however

did not mention any risks inherent in the surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">30.    The plaintiff alleged that Dr Tan was negligent

in omitting to advise him that he could suffer a scrotal haemotoma, atrophy of his testes,

be incapable of producing sufficient testosterone or cease to produce sperm altogether.

Had Dr Tan done that, he would not have gone for the operation.</p>
<p align="justify">31.    In my judgment, the risk of testicular atrophy is

entirely remote as a normal consequence of such a simple surgery. An omission to mention

some fanciful and very remote risk does not constitute a negligent omission. Just as death

is a possibility in every surgery however minor, I do not think that a surgeon will be

regarded as negligent when he omits to mention death as a possible risk in a

varicocelectomy, if in fact death unfortunately occurs. The House of Lords in <i>Sidaway v

Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and Maudsley Hospital and Others</i>

[1985] 2 WLR 480 specifically addressed the question of non-disclosure of risks and the

duty to inform. By a majority of 4 to 1, House of Lords held that the <i>Bolam</i> test

applied not only to the diagnosis and treatment of a patient, but also extended to the

giving of medical advice. Hence, the question whether an omission to warn a patient of the

inherent risks of an operation constitutes a breach of the surgeon’s care towards his

patient is to be determined by an application of the <i>Bolam</i> test. However, Lord

Bridge added the following important caveat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">..even in a case where, …, no expert witness in the relevant

  medical field condemns the non-disclosure as being in conflict with accepted and

  responsible medical practice, I am of opinion that the judge might in certain

  circumstances come to the conclusion that disclosure of a particular risk was so obviously

  necessary to an informed choice on the part of the patient that no reasonably prudent

  medical man would fail to make it. The kind of case I have in mind would be an operation

  involving a <u><b>substantial risk</b></u> of grave adverse consequences, as <u><b>for

  example, the ten per cent risk</b></u> of a stroke from the operation which was the

  subject of the Canadian case of <i>Reibl, v. Hughes</i>, 114 D.L.R. (3d) 1. In such a

  case, in the absence of some cogent clinical reason why the patient should not be

  informed, a doctor, recognising and respecting his patient’s right of decision, could

  hardly fail to appreciate the necessity for an appropriate warning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">32.    In this case, the plaintiff called no medical

expert to condemn the non-disclosure by Dr Tan of the possible risk of atrophy. This

indicates perhaps that hardly any urologist would think that such a warning is called for.

Probably, the majority hold the contrary view. I doubt for instance that Dr Dubin ever

mentioned that risk to Mr Harte prior to his left varicocelectomy surgery. Otherwise, why

would Mr Harte be ignorant if Dr Dubin had previously apprised him of it? As the risk of

atrophy of the testes in a varicocelectomy is so remote and negligible, I do not regard it

as being so obviously necessary that no reasonably prudent urologist would fail to

disclose it. As such, Dr Tan is not negligent even if he had not told Mr Harte of the risk

of testicular atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">33.    Is the bilateral varicocelectomy with a repeat

surgery on the left side at a different level, a radical and experimental treatment by Dr

Tan? Having perused the medical literature tendered, I think not.</p>
<p align="justify">34.    A further complaint by Mr Harte is that no advice

was given of any other treatment as an alternative to the bilateral varicocelectomy

although he and his wife had specifically asked Dr Tan whether other options were

available. Dr Tan told them that bilateral varicocelectomy was the only solution.</p>
<p align="justify">35.    I do not believe that Dr Tan would have been so

adamant about the operation being the only solution. Mr Harte exaggerated his evidence

somewhat in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It is more likely in my view for Dr Tan to

have recommended bilateral varicocelectomy operation as their <b>best</b> option, which

implied that there were indeed other options although Dr Tan might not have enumerated

them. In court, Mr Harte moderated his evidence somewhat and testified that Dr Tan told

him that the <b>best</b> option would be bilateral varicocelectomy but no other

alternatives were offered.</p>
<p align="justify">36.    With the history of their fertility problems and

the medical literature they had, surely they must have known of the existence of test-tube

babies, in vitro fertilization and a myriad of other similar methods besides varicocele

operations. In fact, Dr Dubin himself mentioned in vitro fertilization to the couple. I

find it hard to believe their ignorance of other options even if it were true that Dr Tan

had not apprised them of their existence and availability. I conclude that no negligence

has arisen out of the purported failure of Dr Tan to apprise them of other options.</p>
<p align="justify">37.    Prior to leaving Dr Tan’s office on 15 April

1997, Mr and Mrs Harte asked Dr Tan whether they should store some sperm in a sperm bank

before the operation in case something went wrong after the operation. Dr Tan dismissed it

as he was confident that nothing would go wrong in the surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">38.    Assuming that Dr Tan had given that advice, I do

not consider that he had acted negligently because testicular atrophy is clearly not a

foreseeable consequence of a simple benign operation like varicocelectomy where an average

surgeon can achieve excellent results let alone an expert urologist like Dr Tan who has

had many years of experience and who has performed 200 of such operations without a single

case of atrophy. If it were a reasonable precaution that should normally be taken, and

advice was given to the contrary, then there might be grounds to allege negligence on Dr

Tan’s part for having given that advice which was relied on and followed by the

plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">39.    As Dr Tan felt that storage of Mr Harte’s

semen was of no benefit since his semen was of such poor quality anyway, it was not an

unreasonable basis upon which to advise against the necessity of sperm banking. If the

worst possible foreseeable outcome is a nil improvement in sperm quality, and since fresh

semen for any artificial insemination is generally preferred over thawed out deep frozen

semen, it is a fair and rational advice as far as I can see. I also note that sperm

banking prior to varicocelectomy is not a routine procedure with all the major hospitals

in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">40.    In any event, if Mr and Mrs Harte had wanted to,

they could have gone to the sperm bank themselves to bank some of Mr Harte’s sperm

and pay for it separately, without any need to obtain the green light from Dr Tan. There

is nothing to stop them from doing so.</p>
<p align="justify">41.    There was also the argument raised that

subclinical varicocele ought to be left alone and hence, Dr Tan should not have operated

to remove the subclinical varicocele. The following papers point to the contrary that the

detection of subclinical varicocele may be warranted in infertile men with abnormal sperm

and that its treatment may have some beneficial effect on spermatogenesis:</p>

Gleneagles Hospital for his operation as instructed by Dr Tan. The hospital counter staff

gave him some forms to sign: admission form, consent form and conditions of

services/hospital policies form. Dr Tan performed the surgery under general anaesthesia.

It commenced at 0955 hrs and ended at 1115 hrs. After the surgery, Mr Harte was wheeled to

<p align="justify">43.    Against the advice of the hospital’s nurse,

Ms Tan Sang Eng, the plaintiff insisted on using the toilet despite the nurse having

brought a urinal and offered a bedpan. Mrs Harte told the nurse that ‘if he wants to

go to the toilet he must’. She said that she would accompany him. Mrs Harte and the

nurse helped to seat Mr Harte on the toilet bowl. Mrs Harte remained in the toilet with

him.</p>
<p align="justify">44.    Whilst seated on the toilet bowl, he fainted,

fell off the toilet bowl and his head hit the floor first. This fall took place at 12.20

p.m., about an hour after the surgery. Mrs Harte who was present tried to prevent him from

falling but was unsuccessful because he was too heavy. These facts are not disputed.</p>
<p align="justify">45.    The major issue here is whether Mr Harte had in

the process contused his scrotum and both testes, as he fell off the toilet bowl whilst in

an unconscious state. Were his testes and scrotum trapped by the toilet seat resulting in

additional traction injury to the delicate structures of the veins and arteries within the

spermatic cord?</p>
<p align="justify">46.    Thus, I have to consider (a) whether he had slid

and then toppled off the toilet bowl (i.e. a combination of sliding and toppling) and (b)

whether his upper torso could possibly rotate about his knees to lift his entire scrotum

clear of the toilet seat in the course of the fall. This is a matter of considerable

importance when determining whether there was any contusion or traction injury (or both)

resulting from Mr Harte’s fall from the toilet seat in an unconscious state. It is

not disputed that an unconscious man is not capable of activating his leg muscles to lift

himself clear from the toilet seat to avoid injury to his scrotum and testes. I will

examine these issues in much more detail later.</p>
<p align="justify">47.    After the fall, Mrs Harte called the nurses to

help lift him up and put him on the bed. The hospital’s nurse immediately telephoned

to notify Dr Tan’s clinic of the fall. Dr Tan sent Dr Balaji Sadasivam, a

neurosurgeon, to examine Mr Harte’s head. Dr Balaji did not examine the surgical

incisions or the testicular area.</p>
<p align="justify">48.    Mr Harte said that he felt pain at the bump on

his head but not in his testes or scrotum on that day. By about 5.00 p.m., the effects of

the anaesthesia had worn off.</p>
<p align="justify">49.    Dr Balaji saw Mr Harte again during the evening

and informed him that he could be discharged later in the evening unless there were

complications. Since no complications occurred, he was certified fit for discharge. After

settling his bills, Mr Harte left the hospital at about 7.00 p.m. together with his wife.</p>
<p align="justify">50.    At the time of discharge, he felt some minor

swelling and discomfort at the scrotal area. He was able to walk slowly. Mr Harte assumed

that they were the normal effects of the surgery based on what Dr Tan had earlier told

him. At bedtime, there was some swelling at the scrotum area but it did not seem unusual

to Mr Harte. Then he went to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify">51.    According to Mr Harte, no one mentioned that Dr

Tan would be seeing him. However, Dr Tan alleged that he told the theatre nurses to inform

Mr Harte to wait for him. Ms Magdalene Taye, the assistant clinic nurse working for Dr Tan

at that time, testified that she visited Mr Harte in the day ward and specifically

informed him to wait for Dr Tan to review him. There appears to be some corroborative

evidence in the form of an entry at 1350 hours in the Nursing Care Plan for Mr Harte in

Gleneagles Hospital which states "<i>S/B Dr. Tan’s clinic nurse – Dr. Tan

will review pt in wd.</i>"</p>
<p align="justify">52.    With the evidence I have, I think that Mr Harte

was not quite truthful in saying that he was not told that Dr Tan would be seeing him.

However, I do not think that it was reasonable for Dr Tan to expect the patient to wait

indefinitely for him. Mr Harte had waited from 12.20 p.m. (the time of the fall) to 7.00

p.m. Yet there was no sight of Dr Tan, who was too busy with his other operations.

Apparently he had lined up 7 operations for himself, one after another, and Mr

Harte’s was his 2<sup>nd</sup> operation for that day.</p>
<p align="justify">53.    In any event, I do not think this is crucial

because Dr Tan himself said that even if he had seen Mr Harte, he would not have done

anything because there was no complaint of pain in the scrotum and the surgical sites did

not bleed. In my judgment, discharging Mr Harte was not substandard post-operative patient

care since there were no obvious or alarming signs at that time that his testicles were

traumatised.</p>
<p align="justify">54.    Not being given the details of the fall, Dr Tan

assumed that Mr Harte fell from the standing position and hit his head. Even if he had

been told that he had fallen off from a toilet bowl whilst in an unconscious state, he

would not have envisaged a possible scrotal and testicular haematoma leading to atrophy.

He frankly admitted that the thought never even crossed his mind. I believe him. The

causation mechanism is not one which is immediately apparent without a meticulous analysis

on how a fall like that can possibly contuse the testicles or cause traction injury. In my

opinion, it is not likely for a reasonably competent urologist in the shoes of Dr Tan to

foresee that possibility at all at that time. Hence, even if Dr Tan discharged the patient

after seeing him, I would not consider him negligent. Dr Tan’s inability to attend to

Mr Harte before he left the hospital had not contributed to the damage caused.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>29 April 1997 – Swelling</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">55.    On the following morning when Mr Harte woke up,

he found that both his testes had swollen considerably to almost 2 to 3 times their normal

size. I think that Mr Harte was describing the swelling of his scrotum as a whole and not

the swelling of his testes <i>per se </i>i.e. intratesticular swelling without

extratesticular swelling. The swelling was much more than what he experienced after his

first varicocelectomy by Dr Dubin. He felt excruciating throbbing pain around his

testicular area, which was not there the night before.</p>
<p align="justify">56.    Mr Harte testified that he telephoned Dr

Tan’s office at about 9.00 a.m. in a desperate attempt to find out what was going on

and whether he should go back to hospital immediately. One of Dr Tan’s nurses told

him that Dr Tan was busy. When he managed to speak with Dr Tan, he told him of the unusual

pain and swelling. Dr Tan assured him that no action was needed and the swelling would

subside. Dr Tan instructed him to take the pills prescribed and everything would return to

normal thereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">57.    However Mr Harte in his complaint to the

Singapore Medical Council stated that he consulted Dr Tan <b>two days</b> after the

surgery, which suggested that he did not speak at all to Dr Tan on the day following the

surgery. This was clearly wrong as Dr Tan was not in Singapore on 30 April 1997.

Obviously, Mr Harte was mistaken. Apart from this discrepancy, the rest of his complaint

was generally consistent with the events described in his evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p align="justify">58.    Dr Tan denied receiving a phone call from Mr

Harte on the day following the surgery i.e. 29 April 1997. I prefer Mr Harte’s

testimony as it has a ring of truth to it. The swelling would have been considerable and

unusual. A swelling of the size described would naturally cause considerable pain. Under

the circumstances, I cannot imagine Mr Harte sitting still with the swelling he had and

not seek immediate assurances from Dr Tan personally.</p>
<p align="justify">59.    Dr Tan never asked Mr Harte to see him at his

clinic. Believing Dr Tan’s assurances, Mr Harte remained at home, in great pain,

hoping and expecting the pain and swelling to subside. Over the next few days, the

swelling increased instead until his scrotum was 5 to 6 times its normal size. As the

swelling increased, his pain increased correspondingly.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>30 April 1997 – Further phone calls</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">60.    Mr Harte called Dr Tan’s clinic again on 30

April 1997 because the pain and swelling was even greater than the previous day. He did

not get to speak to Dr Tan but managed to speak to a nurse. He informed the nurse of the

pain and swelling and said something was wrong. She told him to take the pills and come in

on 2 May 1997. In sheer desperation, he had, in one of his telephone calls, asked the

nurse whether he should apply ice to his scrotum. She told him not to.</p>
<p align="justify">61.    According to Dr Tan, he was out of Singapore on a

day trip to Kuala Lumpur on 30 April 1997. 1 May 1997 was a public holiday. Another

urologist would normally cover him in his absence. Had Mr Harte called the nurse or the

answering service and asked for Dr Tan on 30 April 1997, the nurse would have referred Mr

Harte to the covering urologist. The clinic has an answering service after office hours.

Dr Tan alleged that Mr Harte had not called the clinic on 30 April 1997. However, he

failed to call all the material witnesses (e.g. all his staff who handled telephone calls

in his clinic) to support what he said.</p>
<p align="justify">62.    I accept Mr Harte’s evidence that he called

the clinic on 29 April and managed to speak with Dr Tan, and that he made further calls to

Dr Tan’s clinic on 30 April because the swelling and pain had increased further.</p>
<p align="justify">63.    In my opinion, Dr Tan or his nurses should have

asked Mr Harte to come to the clinic immediately. An issue thus arises whether there was

any post-operative negligence. I shall deal with this in more detail later.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>2 May 1997 – 1<sup>st</sup> consultation after surgery</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">64.    By the 2 May 1997, Mr Harte’s scrotum had

grown to the size of a mango, about 7 inches in length and 5 inches across. The swelling

was at its maximum on the 2 or 3 May 1997 before it began to subside slowly.</p>
<p align="justify">65.    Due to the pain and swelling, it was agonising

for him to walk down the hallway to Dr Tan’s clinic even with the assistance of his

wife.</p>
<p align="justify">66.    When he saw Dr Tan, he testified that he <b>complained

of</b> the swelling and the <b>intense pain</b>. After a short examination, Dr Tan simply

repeated his earlier advice that he had no treatment other than some medication. Dr Tan

explained that he had a <b>scrotal haematoma</b> and he would prescribe something to <b>ease

the pain</b> and reduce the swelling. The swelling should subside in due course. If the

swelling remained, he would <b>drain the blood from his scrotum</b>. (The significance of

this evidence in bold will only be apparent later.)</p>
<p align="justify">67.    Dr Tan prescribed <b>painkillers</b>, antibiotics

and anti-inflammatory medication. He did not inform Mr and Mrs Harte that the haematoma

could lead to irreparable damage to or atrophy of his testes. No ultrasound scan was done

on the swollen scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">68.    The next appointment was set for 9 May 1997.

However, Mr Harte was still worried about the intense swelling and the pain. He kept

calling Dr Tan’s clinic every day for advice. Despite his persistent calls, Dr Tan

did not see him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>9 May 1997 – 2<sup>nd</sup> consultation after surgery</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">69.    On 9<sup>th</sup> May 1997, Mr and Mrs Harte went

to see Dr Tan. The swelling had by then begun to subside somewhat although his scrotum was

quite hard or firm to the touch. He examined the plaintiff’s scrotum with the

ultrasound machine in his office.</p>
<p align="justify">70.    Dr Tan said that it was not necessary to drain

the blood because the swelling had gone down. He prescribed more pills.</p>
<p align="justify">71.    In his medical report dated 24 May 1997, Dr Tan

stated that he had reviewed Mr Harte on 2 May 1997 and noted that he had a complication of

a ‘scrotal haematoma’. Mr Harte was prescribed Zinnat, Danzen, Voltaren and

Antacids. When he was last reviewed on 9 May 1997, the haematoma had begun to subside.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>26 May 1997 – 3<sup>rd</sup> consultation and events

thereafter</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">72.    By the next consultation on 26 May 1997, the

swelling had completely subsided. Dr Tan put Mr Harte on a 3 months’ course of

Povinorum, which is a drug containing a form of synthetic testosterone known as

mesterolone. No explanation was given to the plaintiff why this drug was necessary. This

did not seem proper to me. At the trial, Dr Tan’s explanation was that the

mesterolone was part of the usual therapy that he normally gives to varicocelectomy

patients to improve their fertility after surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">73.    The plaintiff called Dr Schlegel as an expert

medical witness. Dr Schelegel is the Director at the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine

&amp; Microsurgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine, The New York

Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York. He is also

the Associate Professor of Urology and Vice-Chairman for Clinical Affairs, Department of

Urology at the same establishment. Dr Schlegel testified that synthetic testosterones like

mesterolone in fact inhibit sperm production. If what Dr Schlegel said is true, then Dr

Tan’s explanation does not appear credible to me. I am inclined to believe that Dr

Tan already knew that the plaintiff’s testes were damaged to the extent that he was

not producing sufficient testosterone himself and he had to prescribe the synthetic

testosterone. But he could not bring himself to inform Mr Harte. </p>
<p align="justify">74.    On 29 August 1997, Dr Tan ordered a seminal

analysis at the plaintiff’s request. This analysis revealed a marked reduction in the

quantity and quality of his sperm. The count was less than 1 million sperm per millilitre

compared with 29 million sperm per millilitre in April 1997, and 27.68 million in April

1996. A second seminal analysis a week later on 5 September 1997 showed no more sperm

production.</p>
<p align="justify">75.    Mr Harte saw Dr Tan again on 11 and 18 September.

On both these occasions, he tried to explain that his sperm could be collected in

locations other than his semen and he purportedly looked for blockage although prior to

the surgery, there was no evidence of retrograde ejaculation or any blockage. </p>
<p align="justify">76.    On 8 October 1997, Dr Tan noted some 5 months

after the operation that the ‘<i>haematoma occurred 2 –3 days post operation,

initially very gradual</i>.’ This was hardly a contemporaneous record of the clinical

findings. It was then that he began to consider the ‘<i>?mechanism of the haematoma</i>’,

which was what he wrote in his clinical notes.</p>
<p align="justify">77.    On 9 October 1997, Mrs Harte called Dr Tan to

find out the reasons for the disastrous seminal test results. Dr Tan explained that his

testes were not functioning properly. Much dried blood was in his scrotum. There was a

small 3mm epididymal cyst on his left side. Blood flow in his testes was not increased.

There was no evidence of varicocele except for thrombosed varicoceles on the left side.</p>
<p align="justify">78.    On 11 October 1997, Dr Tan broke the devastating

news that it was very unlikely that he would ever father his own child. Mr and Mrs Harte

were shocked and devastated.</p>
<p align="justify">79.    On 17 October 1997, Mrs Harte queried Dr Tan

again. Dr Tan told her that he did not encounter any problems during the surgery. He had

removed as many as 18 veins in other patients without the swelling that Mr Harte had. In

Mr Harte’s case, he removed about one third to half of the veins in his scrotum and

those left were ‘small veins’ less than 2 mm in size.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Dr Tan’s reply to the Singapore Medical Council</b></p>
<p align="justify">80.    As Dr Tan’s contemporaneous clinical notes

were brief, I have included his reply to the Singapore Medical Council dated 23 October

1998 where some of his observations were included. Dr Tan stated <i>inter alia</i> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">On review on 2 .5. 97, he complained of a scrotal hematoma that had

  developed<u> 2 -3 days</u> after the operation. The hematoma was <u>non-tender</u>. He was

  prescribed antibiotics prophylactically and Danzen to aid resolution of hematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">He was reviewed again a week later on 9.5.97. The hematoma had subsided

  but he complained that the left testicle was harder than the right. </p>
<p align="justify">The next review was on 26.5.97. The swelling had subsided almost

  completely but there was residual induration of the scrotal sac which was expected to take

  a longer period to subside.</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">In my opinion the cause of his testicular hypofunction is difficult to

  determine at this time as it was highly unlikely that the arterial supply could have been

  cut off during the operation which was carefully done with magnification. Whether the fall

  and the subsequent hematocele had an effect on the outcome is again difficult to

  ascertain. However due care was taken to manage the hematocele conservatively as it was

  not tender and was expected to subside spontaneously. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Mr Harte’s condition</b></p>
<p align="justify">81.    Due to the insufficient levels of testosterone in

his blood, he became lethargic, had no stamina, lost his muscle mass and his sexual

libido, and had difficulty in achieving an erection. He started to grow breasts and had

tender nipples until he received testosterone replacement therapy.</p>
<p align="justify">82.    After getting testosterone replacement, his

libido improved and he did not feel as lethargic. The tenderness in his nipples subsided.

However, his sex life was not the same as before.</p>
<p align="justify">83.    It is not disputed that Mr Harte’s right

testis shrank in volume to 6 cc from what was previously 25 cc in April 1996. The left

testis shrank to 8 cc from what was previously 15 cc. His testes had suffered irreparable

and irreversible vascular damage. Having atrophied, they cannot now produce sperm or

testosterone.</p>
<p align="justify">84.    He feels ashamed of his body, in particular his

testes, when he has to use changing rooms in clubs and gymnasiums. He is now flabby even

with daily exercise.</p>
<p align="justify">85.    Worst of all, he can no longer father a child

through natural means because of the azoospermia i.e. total absence of sperm in his semen.

This has devastated him and his wife emotionally and psychologically.</p>
<p align="justify">86.    The testosterone replacement therapy of skin

patches by Dr Walter Futterweit was ineffective due to the humid climate in Singapore. Dr

Jimmy Beng prescribed testosterone supplement tablets in May 1999, which Mr Harte took on

a daily basis instead. Testosterone replacement therapy would have to be continued for the

rest of his life. The plaintiff alleged that the heavy dosage exposed him to increased

risk of liver and prostrate cancer. Dr Clarence Lei Chang Moh testified that the risk of

prostrate cancer was not increased though he agreed that some kinds of testosterone might

stimulate the growth of small tumours in the liver.</p>
<p align="justify">87.    On 11 September 1997, Mr Harte went for another

CDUS scan of his testes. Dr Koay reported the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">EXAMS: ULTRASOUND TESTES</p>
<p>COLOUR DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF TESTES</p>
<p align="justify">Both testes are of small volume with a patchy parenchymal echo pattern.

  There are at least two calcific foci in the left testis. Both heads of epididymis appear

  normal. There is a small 3 mm epididymal cyst on the left side. Tissue perfusion is not

  increased. No evidence of demonstrable varicocele is shown on valsalva manoeuvre.

  Thrombosed varicoceles are noted on the left side.</p>
<p>COMMENT</p>
<p>Patchy parenchymal echo pattern noted in both testes. There are a few calcific foci in

  the left testis. There is a small epididymal cyst on the left side. Thrombosed varicoceles

  are noted on the left side. Tissue perfusion is not increased.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">88.    Dr Koay explained that a normal testis is fairly

homogeneous. Since he saw a patchy echo pattern, it might be due to inflammation,

ischaemia or infarction. The patchiness showed that the tissue was not uniform and could

indicate necrosis. The ‘calcific foci’ in the left testis indicated the presence

of coagulated blood in the testes, an old haematoma, previous infection or infarcted

testicular tissue. ‘Tissue perfusion’ meant that there was still some blood flow

through the arteries through the spermatic cord to the testes and implied that not all the

arterial blood supply had been cut. From his subjective assessment of the CDUS scan, the

blood flow rate was either reduced or it could be normal. Hence, he wrote in his report

that the tissue perfusion was not increased.</p>
<p align="justify">89.    In October 1998, Mr Harte consulted Dr Dubin

again for bilateral testicular biopsies. The pathology report showed that there was ‘<i><b>partial

germinal tubules sclerosis and hyalinization</b></i>’ and ‘<i><b>focal preserved

germinal tubules showing decreased spermatogenesis with only few spermatids (less than 5

per germinal tubule)</b></i>’ for the left testicle biopsy, and ‘<i><b>complete

germinal tubules and interstitial sclerosis and hyalinization’</b></i> and ‘<i><b>no

spermatogenesis identified in this specimen’</b></i> from the right testicle biopsy.

Essentially this suggested that Mr Harte’s left testis could not produce any mature

sperms but just some spermatids (i.e. immature sperms) whereas his right testis was in a

worse condition because no live sperm or spermatid was found.</p>
<p align="justify">90.    Dr Schlegel advised that he might be able to

extract sperm from his left testis and attempt the ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection)

procedure to fertilise one of Mrs Harte’s eggs. Several tries might be necessary. Dr

Schlegel was hopeful of achieving a pregnancy.</p>
<p align="justify">91.    Hence Mr and Mrs Harte had no other alternative

but to return to New York for the ICSI treatment by Dr Schlegel, which Mr Harte alleged

was the only way for them to receive the treatment they needed on a frequent, closely

monitored basis. Treatment ‘long-distance’ was not possible and was not ideal.

Further, leaving Singapore allowed them to reduce to some degree, the emotional trauma and

haunting memories of what had happened. Driven by their desire to achieve a pregnancy, Mr

Harte decided to give up his position in Singapore thereby forgoing his expatriate

package, perks and bonuses, and all prospects of promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Broad Issues</b></p>
<p align="justify">92.    Mr Harte alleged that Dr Tan had recommended an

unnecessary surgery and further, that he negligently performed the operation producing the

disastrous results that such operations were not known to produce. Dr Tan however blamed

the atrophy on Mr Harte’s fall in the toilet of the hospital soon after the surgery,

which he said had caused both contusion and traction injuries. The hospital denied that

they were liable at all as Dr Tan was not an employee of the hospital but a private and

independent doctor from whom Mr Harte had sought treatment.</p>
<p align="justify">93.    The main issues as characterised by the plaintiff

may thus be summarised under 3 categories:</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(a) Pre-operative</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">(1) Whether the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant acted in accordance with the

<p align="justify">For the reasons given earlier, I find that Dr Tan had not acted below

</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Anatomy of the male reproductive system</b></p>
<p align="justify">94.    Before I deal with the evidence, it is useful to

have an understanding of the male reproductive system. I find the following medical

literature to be most helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Exhibit P 18 -- Atlas of Surgical Management of Male Infertility

  edited by Thomas and Nagler. Chapter 2: Normal surgical anatomy contributed by Frank

  Hinman.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Exhibit P 20 -- Color Atlas of Urologic Surgery by Cockett and

  Koshiba at page 306: The Scrotum and Its Contents.</p>

  Warwick, Dyson and Bannister</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Exhibit P 6 -- A colour diagram of ‘The Male Reproductive

  System’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">95.    It is appropriate that I give a brief description

of the structure of the scrotum. The scrotum is divided by a septum into two compartments,

each containing one testis. The skin of the scrotum is thin and elastic, and richly

vascularized. Beneath the skin is the dartos muscle and connective tissue that contracts

with the cold and relaxes with heat. Another layer of loose connective tissue lies between

the dartos layer and the deeper layers. This connective tissue is loose and permits the

scrotal contents to move freely. It also allows blood and other fluid and haematomas to

accumulate and spread. The blood supply of the scrotal wall comes from the external and

internal pudendal arteries. The scrotal wall is also supplied by a rich network of

lymphatics.</p>
<p align="justify">96.    There are 3 complete layers that envelop and

protect the testis, epididymis and the spermatic cord: external spermatic fascia,

cremasteric fascia and muscle layer, and the deepest is the internal spermatic fascia.</p>
<p align="justify">97.    The testis is encased within a tough fibrous

membrane called the tunica albuginea. It is loosely suspended by the spermatic cord and

its investing tunic layers. The gubernaculum attaches the testis to the base of the

scrotum. The epididymis is a long narrow body sitting at the posterior border of the

testis with its enlarged head near the upper pole of the testis. The tail of the

epididymis is attached to the testis at its lower end. This tail connects to the vas

deferens, which is a tube for the passage of sperm.</p>
<p align="justify">98.    The testis produces sperm within the seminiferous

tubules and secretes androgen from the Legdig cells. The epididymis collects the immature

sperms from the testes and allows them to mature.</p>
<p align="justify">99.    The spermatic cord is a long, round bundle that

begins at the internal inguinal ring and exits at the external inguinal ring near the

groin region, and finally ends at the upper pole of the testis. Within it are the vas

deferens, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerve fibres to the cord and testis. </p>
<p align="justify">100.    There are two main arteries in the spermatic

cord: internal spermatic artery (also known as the testicular artery) and the artery to

the vas deferens. Both supply blood to the testis and epididymis. They are connected

together at their distal ends. Therefore, damage to any one of these two arteries will not

compromise the testis. Additionally, the cremasteric artery (also known as the external

spermatic artery) supplies blood to the coverings of the spermatic cord. D13 is a good

diagram showing the free anastomosis between the three arteries supplying blood to the

testis.</p>
<p align="justify">101.    The veins of the testis and epididymis form the

pampiniform plexus, part of which surrounds the spermatic artery (internal spermatic

veins) and the other surrounds the vas deferens (vasal veins). As these veins ascend up

the spermatic cord, they merge and decrease in number but increase in size. Finally, they

converge into the spermatic vein at the internal inguinal ring. Arteries supply blood to

the scrotum and testes, and the veins drain the blood away. The testis is also drained by

the cremateric veins, external veins and the gubernacular veins as illustrated by Dr Tan

in exhibit D28.</p>
<p align="justify">102.    With this brief summary out of the way, I shall

revert to the case at hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Plaintiff’s case</b></p>
<p align="justify">103.    The plaintiff relied heavily on the doctrine of <i>res

ipsa loquitur</i> to establish his case because the surgery was entirely under the

management and control of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, and vicariously, the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants. It is not disputed that bilateral testicular atrophy is not likely to occur

following a bilateral varicocelectomy unless the surgeon has not performed the surgery

with sufficient care or is simply incompetent. According to Dr Notley, bilateral

testicular infarction is not an acceptable complication of this surgical procedure. All

the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s medical experts generally agreed that it is

exceedingly rare to have testicular atrophy and azoospermia as a result of such an

operation.</p>
<p align="justify">104.    The various possibilities put forward on what

might have gone wrong during the operation to cause such a disastrous outcome were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a) Inadvertent injury to or ligation of a testicular artery which is

  known to result in testicular atrophy or impaired spermatogenesis, or both;</p>
<p align="justify">b) Compression of the venous structures within the spermatic cord;</p>
<p align="justify">c) Venous hypertension from the division of an excessive number of

  veins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">105.    Initially, the main thrust of the

plaintiff’s case was the division of an excessive number of veins by Dr Tan. In

support of this, counsel for the plaintiff referred me to the following passage from

Clinical Negligence by Powers and Harris 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition at p 1389 para 41.100:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">When the complaints are infertility and the testes are lost because of

  ischaemic necrosis after open correction of the varicoceles, patients are particularly

  aggrieved and likely to resort to litigation. Testicular death may follow venous

  congestion leading to increased testicular pressure which, in turn, results in arterial

  impairment leading to ischaemic necrosis. When the presenting complaints are of mild

  discomfort only and testicles are lost, patients are likely to resort to litigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">106.    However, this line was not pushed very hard

during closing submissions by counsel for the plaintiff after Dr Schlegel himself

categorically said that one could divide all the veins leaving the vasal vein intact both

for a man with or without varicoceles, and no atrophy would result because there would

still be sufficient venous drainage with the vasal vein intact.</p>
<p align="justify">107.    Counsel for the plaintiff postulated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Dr Tan could have damaged the vas and its vessels when he clamped

  his Babcock forceps around the vas and spermatic cord, which would be larger in the case

  of an obese man like the plaintiff;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) He could have caused traction injury to the spermatic cord when he

  tried to deliver it out through the layers of muscle and subcutaneous fat, and through the

  skin incision so that he could perform the surgery on the veins in and around the

  spermatic cord. The likelihood of such injury increased when the incision through the

  layers of muscle and fat was oblique or diagonally made to reach the spermatic cord i.e.

  the ‘undermining technique’, which is a more difficult surgical procedure;</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Due to the insufficient spermatic cord length available at the

  subinguinal region, it was doubtful that Dr Tan could have pulled out the spermatic cord

  through the skin incision without causing traction injury to the delicate structures;</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Dr Tan could have inadvertently ligated or divided the testicular

  artery (or even other arteries as well) because of inadequate optical magnification of 3 x

  power optical loupes when the medical literature recommended the use of 6 x power, thereby

  causing loss of or reduced blood supply. Similarly, inadvertent over-ligation of veins due

  to inadequate optical magnification increased the risk of venous congestion. [Whilst on

  this point, I note that Goldstein, Gilbert, Dicker, Dwosh and Gnecco in their paper, <i>Microsurgical

  Inguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing

  Techniques</i> published in December 1992, referred to the use of <u><b>2.5</b></u> x

  magnification loupes for varicocelectomies. By this standard, I do not think that Dr Tan

  had used insufficient magnification for his surgery.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">108.    It was thus submitted that Dr Tan blundered in a

similar fashion on both the left and right side of the varicocelectomy operation because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the undermining would have led him to operate on the spermatic cord

  fairly closely to the left and right testes owing to the insufficient spermatic cord

  length, which meant that his was not a subinguinal approach but a scrotal approach, which

  carried with it a high risk of testicular atrophy;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the veins at that lower level of the spermatic cord near the testes

  would be more numerous and finer in the form of the pampiniform plexus; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the scrotal varicocelectomies involving vein ligation in that

  region of the pampiniform plexus were no longer carried out, as such scrotal approaches

  were associated with the ligation of too many veins leading to ischaemic necrosis due to

  venous impairment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Nurses’ evidence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">109.    Nurse Tan Sang Eng examined Mr Harte immediately

after the fall. He did not complain of any pain in the scrotum or penis area. She took a

glance at the plaintiff’s scrotal area when she removed the blanket covering Mr Harte

to examine the skin incision sites (which were not at the scrotum but much higher up at

the groin area: see photographs P25 to P 28). She did not see any swelling, bruising or

discolouration. She maintained that she was sufficiently experienced to tell if the

plaintiff’s scrotum or penis was bruised or discoloured.</p>
<p align="justify">110.    Nurse Looi Chai Hong examined the plaintiff at

about 2.00 p.m. She also saw no bruising, swelling or discolouration at the scrotal area,

but she did notice a slight bruise, <b>slight bluish in colour</b>, on the left side of

the plaintiff’s head. Her examination was about 1 hours after the fall. However by

7 p.m., Mr Harte could feel the swelling and discomfort because his scrotum touched his

pants.</p>
<p align="justify">111.    Dr Notley believed that swelling should begin

about 2 hours after the fall. Consequently, the nurses might not notice any swelling at

his scrotum. The nurses would probably also not see any difference or notice any

colouration at that stage. Dr Notley’s evidence demonstrates that the absence of

swelling, bruising or discolouration at this time is not conclusive.</p>
<p align="justify">112.    Dr Notley also said that a change of colour of

the scrotum within 2 hours would be expected for a severe injury causing a severe

haematoma. The obvious corollary is that a blunt trauma of a less serious nature may not

involve a change of colour. This is not exceptional where there is minimal or no rupture

of the blood vessels in the scrotal area external to the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">113.    It is my opinion therefore that the nurses would

probably have noticed the bruising and discolouration if it was a very serious blunt

trauma that not only damaged the testes internally, but also severely ruptured the blood

vessels in the extratesticular area of the scrotum. Where the blunt trauma was not as

severe, the testes might still suffer contusion but there might not be a violent rupture

(as opposed to a minimal rupture or rupture at the microlevel) of the extratesticular

blood supply to lead to an obvious scrotal haematoma. Nonetheless, the intratesticular

contusion itself might still be serious enough to lead to atrophy. Thus the absence of

discolouration and scrotal swelling observed by the nurses was inconclusive. In other

words, one could not rule out internal testicular traction or contusion injury (or both)

as a possible cause of the atrophy simply because those symptoms were absent.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Plaintiff’s evidence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">114.    The plaintiff did not vomit or feel nausea after

the fall. He only experienced ‘minor swelling and discomfort’ but no pain in his

scrotum by the time of his discharge. The pain was only felt the following morning, when

he woke up.</p>
<p align="justify">115.    A/Prof Foo Keong Tatt said that if the pain was

very severe, there would be severe nausea and the patient would vomit. Dr Schlegel also

said that in cases of blunt trauma to the testicle causing damage, there would be a sudden

and dramatic increase in pain accompanied normally by nausea and vomiting at that time

because of its severity. From this evidence, it appears that severe pain is likely to

cause vomiting and nausea. Since Mr Harte did not feel any intense pain, it is not

inconsistent that he felt no nausea and did not vomit. But not all blunt traumas cause

severe pain. Thus, the absence of severe pain, vomiting and nausea after the fall is again

inconclusive.</p>
<p align="justify">116.    Based on table 3 in the paper ‘<i>Blunt

Scrotal Trauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management</i>’ by Munter and

Faleski, it was submitted that there should be symptoms of vomiting and nausea whenever

there was testicular or scrotal contusion. The article itself referred to a case report of

a 9- year-old boy who sustained a blunt straddle type injury about 24 hours before. He was

brought for evaluation after persistent swelling, discolouration and right testicular

pain. Despite this, there was <b>no nausea, vomiting or fever</b>. He had been comfortable

in bed but had significant pain when walking which was in an exaggerated straddle type of

gait. Here, an ultrasound showed that the left testicle was normal but the right testicle

was moderately enlarged with intact tunica albuginia and epididymis. Within 36 hours, the

pain and swelling resolved and the patient did not suffer atrophy. This example clearly

drives home the point that not all trauma injuries must be accompanied by symptoms of

nausea, vomiting or fever. It is overly simplistic to conclude that the plaintiff could

not possibly have suffered any testicular or scrotal contusion because these symptoms were

not manifested. As with all symptoms, I must emphasize that their absence or presence is

not conclusive but may only be indicative of a particular medical condition.</p>
<p align="justify">117.    The aforesaid table 3 shows that the risk of

significant morbidity if misdiagnosed in the case of testicular or scrotal contusion is

not high compared with torsion injury and testicular rupture or epididymal rupture. I

understand the argument to be that testicular or scrotal contusion is thus not likely to

result in any testicular atrophy. In my opinion, table 3 compares the risk of morbidity

for contusion injury with the far more serious cases of (a) torsion at the spermatic cord

level which can choke off all the blood supply to the testis; and (b) rupture of the

testis or epididymis. It is going too far to infer from table 3 that morbidity in

contusion injury is <i><b>per se</b></i> unlikely.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Mrs Harte’s evidence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">118.    According to Mrs Harte, the plaintiff was ‘<i>alarmed

at the swelling in his scrotum’</i> on the morning after the surgery. It was more

than the swelling after the first varicocelectomy operation by Dr Dubin. The

plaintiff’s scrotum was ‘<i><u><b>bright</b></u> red initially when he woke up.

Over the next few days it turned <u><b>reddish purplish</b></u></i>’. She never said

his scrotum appeared blue-black, blackish or dark in colour. But clearly, she did notice a

change of colour to a deeper or darker colour.</p>
<p align="justify">119.    Reddish purplish is actually a mixture of red

and blue, giving the purple hues. Colour perception is very subjective and it depends also

on the kind of light under which she observed Mr Harte’s swollen scrotum. In my mind,

some reddish inflammation coupled with a blue-black bruising might well manifest in a

colour combination, which appears darkish reddish purplish in colour. It is not possible

to rule out scrotal haemorrhage being mixed with the inflammation. When the inflammation

resolves itself faster than the blue-black bruising, then a tinge of blue could well

remain after several days. Thus it is not that simple and straightforward to determine or

infer reliably from the colour changes the actual cause of the extratesticular swelling,

whether it is exclusively the result of haemorrhage due to contusion or traction, or

inflammation <i>per se</i>, or a combination of both inflammation and haemorrhage.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Dr Tan Eng Choon’s and Dr Jimmy Beng’s evidence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">120.    Counsel for the plaintiff referred me to the

following testimony of Dr Tan Eng Choon, who treated Mr Harte in October 1997:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A: From the history of the surgery and history of swelling after the

  operation, I suspect that a vascular event had probably taken place, which resulted in the

  atrophy of the testes. A vascular event means that his blood supply to the testes has been

  compromised meaning reduced, or the swelling could be compressing on the vital structures,

  which is the testes; and that resulted in the reduced blood flow, which caused the testes

  to undergo atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Did you think <b>at that time</b> that the atrophy would have been

  related to the surgery?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I suspected very strongly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">121.    However, when Dr Tan Eng Choon was asked if he

had been told during the consultation that Mr Harte fell in the toilet soon after the

operation, Dr Tan said he had no such information based on his record.</p>
<p align="justify">122.    Dr Jimmy Beng who examined the plaintiff in May

1999 (some 19 months after Dr Tan Eng Choon) similarly took the position that ‘<i>in

view of the history given that there was a severe swelling after the surgery… some

damage had occurred to the testes, most likely of a vascular cause’. </i>He referred

to the biopsy performed on Mr Harte’s atrophic testes on 21 October 1998 and the

pathology report, which mentioned ‘<i><b>germinal tubules sclerosis and hyalinization</b></i>’.

Dr Jimmy Beng explained that ‘sclerosis’ meant scarring and

‘hyalinization’ was a change in the protein structure of the cells. These

changes were not consistent with an infection and could be observed when an organ such as

the testes was deprived of blood supply.</p>
<p align="justify">123.    I remind myself of the various objections which

I shall not go into, one of which was that both Dr Jimmy Beng and Dr Tan Eng Choon

subpoenaed by the plaintiff were not willing to be expert witnesses. Hence, I limited

their evidence to the medical findings reached by them at that time as part of their

treatment of Mr Harte. They were merely witnesses of fact and no more.</p>
<p align="justify">124.    It appears that the fall was not made known to

Dr Tan Eng Choon and Dr Jimmy Beng. Not having the full history, it is not surprising that

Dr Tan Eng Chuan readily suspected that the surgery was the sole cause of the atrophy

since that was the only known event occurring earlier. But where there are two or more

known events, then each must be separately evaluated to see if each can cause the same

result. If some or all of them are capable of causing the same result, then one must

thoroughly evaluate the causative factors in each ‘capable event’ and balance

all the probabilities before coming to any conclusion as to which ‘capable

event’, or even which combination of the several ‘capable events’ is the

likely cause of all the vascular damage. This exercise of fact-finding is hardly an easy

task where there is more than one ‘capable event’.</p>
<p align="justify">125.    Since Dr Jimmy Beng and Dr Tan Eng Choon did not

have the benefit of performing this diagnostic exercise (unlike the medical expert

witnesses called by the plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> defendant who were required to do

this evaluation), their evidence would not have as much probative value in relation to the

correct inference to be drawn for the proximate and probable cause of the vascular damage,

although I do accept (a) their medical finding that vascular damage had indeed occurred,

and (b) Dr Jimmy Beng’s explanation for the presence of ‘hyalinization’

which he said could be seen when an organ was deprived of blood supply.</p>
<p align="justify">126.    In my opinion, a contusion injury to the testes

due to a fall may cause internal haemorrhage within the tissues of the testes. The

resulting testicular haematoma and buildup of pressure inside the testes can also shut

down the blood supply leading to ‘hyalinization’. Thus the presence of

‘hyalinization’ <i>per se</i> does not indicate that it must necessarily be due

to the devascularisation flowing from some negligent surgical operation. Thus both events

are equally capable of producing the same end result of ‘hyalinization’. One

cannot so readily infer from the presence of ‘hyalinization’ that the cause

cannot be due to a physical injury from a fall.</p>
<p align="justify">127.    That there is ‘sclerosis’ and

‘hyalinisation’ as found in the pathology report is not disputed. In fact, that

the damage is vascular in nature is also not in dispute at all. The dispute is solely

whether the deprivation of blood supply and the resultant vascular damage is more likely

to be caused by the surgery or by the fall. I observe that no party has adopted any

intermediate position that both events might well have contributed to the vascular damage,

with one being the dominant cause and the other, the secondary cause. As such, I shall not

address this point since the parties themselves have not regarded that as a reasonable

possibility. All three parties pursued the ‘all or nothing approach’ i.e. either

the surgery or the fall was the cause but not both.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Dr Schlegel’s and Dr Notley’s evidence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">128.    Dr Schlegel and Dr Notley testified that

substandard surgery was the cause of the vascular damage. Dr Notley’s belief was that

the testicles were infarcted because Dr Tan operated on Mr Harte who no longer had

varicoceles. The previous varicocelectomy had removed the varicocele on the left and there

was no varicocele on his right. After the operation by Dr Tan, Mr Harte therefore ended up

with an inadequate venous drainage, a serious venous congestion leading to reduced blood

flow, a lowered oxygen saturation within the testicles and the deadly sequence of

infarction.</p>
<p align="justify">129.    Dr Notley considered Dr Koay’s ultrasound

report to be ambiguous. He believed that ultrasound was not a reliable tool of

investigation. It would have to be backed up by the presence of a clinical varicocele.</p>
<p align="justify">130.    In Dr Notley’s opinion, a doctor should not

operate on an assumption. If an assumption was made that a patient had a varicocele, which

could not be demonstrated clinically or unequivocally on ultrasound, the number of veins

taken should be limited very severely. Dr Notley’s inclination was that no operation

should be performed unless the doctor was completely certain. If he was not, then it was

substandard management. In his view, Dr Tan had operated improperly on an assumption that

Mr Harte had varicocele. His ligation of the veins subinguinally to deal with his

infertility by further varicocele operations was therefore substandard. The fact that Mr

Harte ended up with bilateral infarction flowed from Dr Tan’s substandard management.</p>
<p align="justify">131.    Dr Koay himself testified that there was in fact

evidence of varicocele on the left side and mild varicocele on the right side. He

mentioned ‘intermittent’ varicocele on the left side to mean ‘mild to

moderate’ varicocele. ‘Intermittent’ meant that the varicocele appeared

under stress. Without stress, it was not seen.</p>
<p align="justify">132.    Dr Tan read Dr Koay’s radiologist report

and considered the description used by Dr Koay of ‘intermittent’ varicocele to

mean the presence of varicocele. I accept that Dr Tan had not misinterpreted Dr

Koay’s report. To understand ‘intermittence’ in the context of a

varicocele, an example may be appropriate. Clearly, there is no such thing as

‘intermittent cancer’. Just as with cancer, a varicocele represents a medical

condition. It is not as if the varicocele medical condition is an intermittent one. The

‘intermittence’ is actually a manifestation of a varicocele vein because the

reflux of blood is seen as intermittent in the sense that the blood refluxes when pressure

is applied. That description may have been confusing to Dr Notley, but not to Dr Koay and

Dr Tan.</p>
<p align="justify">133.    Further, Dr Tan testified that he found

varicocele veins when he operated on Mr Harte. In that regard, Dr Koay’s and Dr

Tan’s diagnosis based on the CDUS had been surgically confirmed to be correct.</p>
<p align="justify">134.    In the circumstances, I have to reject Dr

Notley’s opinion that Dr Tan had operated merely on an assumption that Mr Harte had

varicocele and therefore he had been substandard in his management.</p>
<p align="justify">135.    Dr Notley made a clear distinction between

operating on a patient with varicocele and on one without. For a patient with varicocele,

it was unlikely that he would suffer from testicular infarction when the vas was isolated

and not ligated. However if that was done for a normal person, there would be a much

greater risk of infarction because a normal person would not have those extra veins, which

a person suffering from varicocele would have. When counsel for the plaintiff referred Dr

Notley to the medical literature showing that leaving one set of vasal veins was

sufficient, Dr Notley explained that every one of those articles assumed that the

operation was on a man with a clinically evident varicocele and therefore, leaving a set

of vasal veins was sufficient for drainage.</p>
<p align="justify">136.    However, Dr Schlegel contradicted Dr

Notley’s evidence. In his testimony, Dr Schlegel emphatically said that the vasal

vein alone would be enough to drain the testes to avoid infarction. The rest of the

internal veins and external veins could be tied up. This was true <u><b>both</b></u> for a

man suffering from varicocele and one who was not. From his experience at Cornell where

thousands of such operations had been performed based on such a procedure using the vasal

veins as the only source of drainage, there had never been a case of testicular atrophy.

Therefore, if Dr Tan had left one set of vasal veins behind for venous drainage as he said

he had, his surgery would not have caused atrophy, regardless whether Mr Harte had

varicocele, minimal varicocele or no varicocele. In my opinion, Dr Schlegel’s

evidence here is very damaging to the plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p align="justify">137.    In Dr Schlegel’s view, inadvertent injury

during surgery to the arteries supplying blood to the testicles could lead to

devascularisation. As a matter of causation, this could not be disputed. Dr Tan agreed

that if the internal wall of the artery was damaged (i.e. endothelial injury) then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a)    platelets in the blood adhere to the injured sites

  on the endothelium (inner wall of the arteries) and clots would form;</p>
<p align="justify">b)    thrombosis might result; and</p>
<p align="justify">c)    this could lead to ischaemic injury to the

  testicle, resulting eventually in testicular atrophy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">138.    Dr Tan maintained however that he did not injure

any artery during the surgery. He had carefully lifted up the spermatic cord during the

surgery by using a Babcock forceps to grip and lift the cord. He then slipped his finger

under the cord to bring it up. I doubt that the arteries in the spermatic cord had

sustained any endothelial damage from such handling by Dr Tan.</p>
<p align="justify">139.    Since there are three arteries supplying blood

to each testis, one needs to inadvertently damage more than one artery on each side before

devascularisation can happen. Having evaluated this, I think it is unlikely for Dr Tan to

make so many consecutive errors. In any event, if it is a shutdown of blood supply due to

total arterial blockage, one should not see swelling. Since there was intratesticular

swelling, I have to rule out this mode of causation.</p>
<p align="justify">140.    Dr Notley then attributed the colour changes on

the plaintiff’s scrotum to infarction after surgery. He explained that the scrotum

and testicles have a rich blood supply. The very dense subcutaneous plexus of vessels in

the scrotum act as a radiator so that large amounts of heat can be lost. A scrotal

haematoma is caused by rupture of one or more of the vessels in the scrotum and that

results in bleeding into the tissues of the scrotum. Within the first hour, there is not

much colour change. As the bleedings come to the surface, the scrotum looks a bit blue.

Gradually, it becomes more and more dense. The scrotum will rapidly become black within

two or three hours after the injury. By twelve hours, the scrotum is usually black and

swollen for a <u><b>severe</b></u> haematoma. The haematoma is contained within the fascia

planes but may spread to the penis, which is shared. The blackening will probably reach a

peak in about 12 to 24 hours, stay black for two or three days, and then it will fade

gradually, going yellowish, greenish and through ‘all the colours of the

rainbow’.</p>
<p align="justify">141.    The colour change is due to the deoxygenation

and the haemoglobin in the blood cells left within the scrotum. This haemoglobin is broken

down by the local activity of the inflamed cells in the scrotum that changes the pigment

into the bile pigments, which are yellow and green. Hence, a black haematoma gradually

goes through this varying change of colour through yellow and green. It takes about 10 to

12 days to subside. Dr Notley said that anti-inflammatory drugs would not make any

difference to that natural process.</p>
<p align="justify">142.    Dr Notley expected Mr Harte to have an obvious

scrotal haematoma by the time he left the hospital if the fall had caused it. A scrotal

haematoma usually takes several hours for the colouration to appear. <b>It depends on the

severity of the injury, the nature of the injury, the size of the scrotum initially and a

multiplicity of factors. It varies from individual to individual.</b></p>
<p align="justify">143.    I agree entirely with Dr Notley’s opinion,

which I have highlighted in bold. I observe that Dr Notley’s evidence of a black

scrotum was made in the context of an extremely severe haematoma or a very serious injury.

I certainly do not think that remains invariably true of a less severe injury.</p>
<p align="justify">144.    By way of contrast, the physical manifestations

of an infarction according to Dr Notley are as follows::</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If a patient has an isolated testicular infarction, there will be

  initially no discolouration of the scrotum at all. … After about eight to ten to

  twelve hours, the reactionary swelling in the scrotum around the infracted testicle ...

  will become red and it will look as if it was inflamed. And it will do that because of the

  reaction of the scrotum to the infarcted testicle within it. It is the standard reaction

  of the body to anything that happens to it which is the classical changes of the

  inflammatory reaction which are redness, swelling, pain and tenderness, heat.

  …….. So for testicular infarction, after about three or four days, the patient

  will have a large firm scrotum which is this curious plumish colour discoloration, rather

  light plum colour, rather the colour of the chair, the leather in the chair in which you

  are sitting in, and it will gradually fade subsequently after that but it will not go

  black. ..… I believe that the appearances of a testicular haematoma are so dramatic,

  they really are very dramatic, it’s black .. </p>
<p align="justify">If it’s an injury, it will be black, … I think within a few

  hours, 6 at the most. … I personally put it blackish blue.</p>
<p align="justify">…. If we took Mr Harte’s case, I would have expected him to

  have an obvious scrotal haematoma by the time he left hospital……. To start with,

  it would look a bit blue as the bleedings came to the surface and gradually, it would

  become more and more dense.</p>
<p align="justify">… I’m absolutely confident that 12 hours after sufficient

  injury to produce a haematoma ..the scrotum will be black.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">145.    Dr Notley opined that testicular infarction not

associated with any physical trauma would cause the scrotum to be bright red. Gradually

the colour would become more dense: reddish brownish. That colour stays for about 4 to 5

days. Gradually, as the swelling subsides, the inflammatory reaction in the scrotum also

diminishes. But the scrotum will not turn black, unlike a scrotal haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">146.    During cross-examination by counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant, Dr Notley explained that infection would make the situation worse for an

infarcted testicle. The patient will run a temperature, and if the situation is not

diagnosed, there will be an abscess because the tissue is dead. If the surgeon does not

drain it, the abscess will burst and discharge itself. He agreed that infection might

follow infarction. The scrotum will then be very bright red. When the pus comes to the

surface, it will be yellow. Inflammation does not show up as purplish or bluish black,

which can only be produced by a haematoma under the skin. Dr Notley could not think of any

mechanism that would produce a bright red coloured scrotum, which later became bluish

purple or bluish black.</p>
<p align="justify">147.    Where there is loss of blood supply, the testis

turns pale in colour but the scrotum skin will probably retain its normal colour because

the blood supply to the scrotum has not been interfered with. Dr Notley however did not

think that Dr Tan tied up the arteries to Mr Harte’s testes. It would have to be a

very ‘ham-fisted operation’ and a very substandard operation if three arteries

to each testis were tied up inadvertently. I share this view too.</p>
<p align="justify">148.    Dr Notley disagreed that a ‘tinge of

blue’ would describe a haematoma. Neither would that be an appearance from a

contusion injury. If he had to offer an explanation for the ‘tinge of blue’

colour observed by Dr Tan on 2 May 1997, Dr Notley proffered the incredible explanation

that perhaps Dr Tan was seeing the ‘black testicles shining deeply within the

scrotum’ in the same way that our veins could be seen underneath the skin. I find Dr

Notley’s explanation unconvincing having regard to the number of tissue layers

protecting the testes, which are buried deep within the scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">149.    When asked why the larger testicle ended up

being smaller, Dr Notley said that the plaintiff had partial atrophy of his testicles from

the histology of the subsequent biopsies. So one testicle underwent further atrophy. It

did not make a difference whether it was due to contusion or infarction. In his opinion,

no deductions could be made as to which mechanism or pathological process was operating.</p>
<p align="justify">150.    Dr Notley conceded however that infarction of

the testicles from trauma could occur (without an associated scrotal haematoma) if the

trauma specifically damaged the blood vessels to the testicle in isolation without

damaging the blood vessels in the scrotum. However, Dr Notley thought that it would be

very difficult to damage the blood vessels within the testes without damaging the blood

vessels in the scrotum at the same time.</p>
<p align="justify">151.    Dr Notley explained infarction as the death of a

piece of tissue due to the abolition of the blood supply to it. One could of course

abolish the blood supply to a tissue by a blood clot, or by stuffing up the veins so that

the blood could not flow. Contusion on the other hand might cause haemorrhage of the blood

vessels. If there was haemorrhage in the testes with coagulation, Dr Notley agreed that

the testicles could also infarct. Dr Notley said that if it was possible to have contusion

of the testicular tissues without damaging the extratesticular tissues, the scrotum could

still turn red because of the infarction in the testes. The undamaged arteries to the

scrotum would dilate to produce the inflammatory red reaction, whereas spillage of blood

from damaged arteries into a foreign place where it was no longer oxygenated would cause

it to turn blue-black. The following testimony by Dr Notley is relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">His Honour: ..The infarction is very simple, in a contusion, you

  contuse it, the vessels burst, and the vessels burst, the blood coagulates, and no blood

  supplies come from that, you get an infarcted testis.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, you certainly will but—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So therefore the reaction for both infarcted testes,

  whether – whatever means of causation, you land up with a reddish coloured looking

  scrotum. That is provided the skin is not damaged.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But I’m making the point, and I’m sorry to keep

  going back to it---</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: -- as I do not believe you can contuse anything in that part

  of the world with—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: I’ll leave that aside, I’m coming to that—</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: --without creating a haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Yes, I’m coming to that.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But if you could in some magical way do that without contusing

  the tissues outside artery, yes, you’re absolutely right, I agree with you, if you

  could infarct the testicle in some way, you would end up with a situation of the bright

  red swollen scrotum 12 or so hours later. So that I would go along with that completely. I

  just put the caveat that I don’t believe you could do it without producing a

  haematoma. </p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So now, the test now really is, would passing through a

  smooth surface, smooth hard surface on one side only, produce damage to the skin? Because

  I don’t expect the other side which touches his body will produce the skin trauma.

  The other side, which is smooth, well, it’s a big question mark.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But what we’re damaging with an injury to produce a

  haematoma is the blood vessels within the substance of the scrotum beneath the skin. There

  are no blood vessels of any size in the skin—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So it’s just sub-skin?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Underneath the skin, there is this rich plexus of vessels

  which I refer to, which is the radiator to keep the scrotum cool.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: OK, let me ask you this question. Because the scrotum is

  soft, right—</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: And if I were to press it, like you see here

  (demonstrates), OK, and release after less than a second, and because the vessels in the

  skin outside the testis is not packed into a balloon, will it burst these skin capillaries

  to create that blue-black situation?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Wouldn’t be the capillaries, your Honour.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Oh, those whatever blood vessels they may be, small

  arteries.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: It would be the small blood vessels, veins and arteries—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Veins and arteries.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: -- underneath the skin. I believe they would, yes Sir. I

  don’t believe you could create sufficient force onto a scrotum to rupture the blood

  vessels inside the testicle without rupturing the blood vessel outside the testicle. Blood

  vessels are the same whether they are inside or outside. It’s nothing to do with

  being in a ---</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: The difference is the tunica. That’s what I’m

  concerned with. The difference is the tunica.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But the force you apply—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: If all of them don’t have the tunica, then I will

  agree with you. My problem is that this one is in the tunica, so there lies a difference.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Well, I can’t agree with you, Sir.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: You can’t agree with me. OK, fine.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: I’m sorry. I believe you would damage the blood vessels

  in the scrotum. Blood vessels shear under these circumstances, and if you’re rolling

  this chap off the toilet seat between his weight which--- I don’t know quite what

  those kilograms are but, if his weight is bearing down sufficiently to produce your

  theoretical 15 millimetres, that is going to produce a sufficient shearing force, as

  it’s rolled over, which, if it damages the testicle itself, it will damage, to a

  lesser extent, I accept, the blood vessels in the scrotum, and that would produce a

  haematoma. I just do not believe the two things can be divorced. Doesn’t make sense,

  it’s not logical.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Dr Notley, do you have any medical literature to back up what you

  have just said?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No, of course I don’t. Why should I have?</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: No, you see, Dr Notley, you see, if what you say is right,

  then under—the part of his body near the, or rather, between the anus and the

  suspended point of his testes which the testes is in contact, in the process of passing

  through, one would also expect a blue-black. Biologically, but one wouldn’t—I

  don’t think so. </p>
<p align="justify">Witness: No, I don’t think you would, because the blue-black, the

  thing that is being crushed is the scrotum, not the—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Yes, it’s the pressure, it’s the pressure because

  the pressure acts both ways, so this is the hard part of the toilet seat, this is the

  testis and on top is his body. So if you expect the skin here to be blue-black and the

  skin on the top of the scrotum is blue-black, I would expect at the same time that the

  skin underneath, on his body side, to be blue-black because they are all subjected to the

  same pressure.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But I sit on that piece of skin all my life, Sir, and I

  don’t make haematomas.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: That’s precisely the point, that’s precisely the

  point. You sit on the skin all your life, there is no blue-black there.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But I don’t sit on my balls.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Ah-huh, that’s what I mean by the difference, the

  difference is in the tunica. You sit on the skin, it’s no problem.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Or I sit on my scrotum as well.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: The pressure could be very high, that’s my point, ah.

  Can you explain? You’re sitting on the skin for a short while there, the skin of the

  scrotum and not the skin of your flesh, no doubt. But there is no [haematoma.] Why?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: I mean, I think this theory is not a tenable one because I

  just don’t believe you could roll a large man across a toilet seat or a flat floor or

  a set of stones sufficiently to compress his scrotum and its internal contents, so that

  you’ll get an intratesticular haematoma without shearing some of the blood vessels in

  the scrotum. It simply does not—it’s not believable. I mean, the basis of injury

  is that blood vessels get hit, they tear, they produce bruises, there is no literature as

  far as I know about men falling off their scrotum and squashing their testicles.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: No, no, that’s a different ball game, that’s a

  physical problem which our engineers will be dealing with. I’m just interested in the

  physiological aspects of it. You carry on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">152.    Counsel in re-examination asked Dr Notley

whether there were differences between the scrotal skin and the skin of the buttocks for

instance. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The scrotal skin is lax and very elastic, it’s not very thick,

  quite thin. The skin of the perineum, the area of the sit-upon which lies between the anus

  and the buttocks is much thicker, it’s more securely fixed, so when you slide about

  on a chair or a bicycle saddle, it doesn’t move, so you don’t get shearing

  effects. The scrotal skin is, as I say, lax, and you can easily get shearing effects

  particularly if you roll the scrotum or move the scrotum in the way that has been

  described and if you roll yourself off a toilet seat in this way and shear your scrotum

  sufficiently badly to produce an intratesticular haematoma, I can entirely imagine how the

  shearing would produce haematoma, but I can’t imagine that the slide of the smooth,

  much more supported skin of the back of the thighs and the back of the buttocks and the

  perineum would shift in the way to produce shearing and haematoma formation. Obviously, if

  it was a direct contusion, like a kick or a hammer, then, yes, you would certainly get a

  haematoma on the perineum or the back of the buttocks, but I don’t think a slide of

  this shearing nature would produce that lesion in those areas.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Mr Notley, what’s the incidence of fat in the scrotal skin as

  opposed to, let’s say, the skin of the perineum or the buttocks or even the abdomen?</p>
<p align="justify">A: There is very little fat in the scrotum, very little indeed, whereas

  there is more fat underneath those other areas, parts of skin that you mentioned. But

  there isn’t much fat beneath the perennial skin which is what you sit on.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: How much pressure must there be? Let’s assume the

  experiment is one whereby you just apply pressure, without any shearing, just press the

  scrotal skin and then let go, will you get a haematoma?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Well, you could do it you pressed it hard enough and for

  several minutes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: What sort of pressures are you talking about?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: I don’t really know, but a common example is the

  love-bite that people produce in the neck, that’s pressure on the skin over a period

  of time, that’s a haematoma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">153.    Dr Notley then concluded that it was not

uncommon for injuries to result in scrotal haematomas and only very infrequently did they

get testicular atrophy afterwards. A scrotal haematoma (i.e. extratesticular haematoma) <i>per

se</i> does not cause atrophy of the testes. The published literature suggests that the

scrotum is normally injured where testicular atrophy follows sufficiently severe trauma to

the testicle. There is no published literature indicating that one can have the sort of

catastrophic damage, which Mr Harte had, without physical damage to the scrotum in the

form of a haematoma or abrasion of the skin. Many of these very severe traumas actually

disrupt the scrotum. Dr Notley was not aware of any reported cases of testicular atrophy

due to blunt trauma in which there had not been externally apparent injury to the scrotum

in the form in its most minor way of a scrotal haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">154.    Dr Schlegel testified that a force applied

directly to the testes sufficient to cause bilateral testicular atrophy would also be

applied to the scrotum skin tissues. Fairly significant bruising and damage to these

tissues would be expected as well.</p>

National University Hospital. He testified that a compression injury might give rise to a

haematoma, which could be either extratesticular or intratesticular, or both.</p>
<p align="justify">156.    Where the testes have been crushed internally,

blood vessels within are ruptured. That causes congestion. An intratesticular haematoma

develops. Whereas an extratesticular haematoma usually results from a direct hit on the

scrotal skin. The ruptured blood vessels in the scrotal skin and adjacent dartos muscles

leak out blood, thereby causing the extratesticular haematoma. Bleeding of the blood

vessels in the external spermatic, cremasteric muscle and internal spermatic fascia will

also cause an extratesticular haematoma although this is less likely because these tissues

are more mobile than the dartos muscles. The chances of injuring something mobile is less

in a direct hit or in blunt trauma. In either case, the scrotum will appear black in

colour. A very big black scrotum the size of a mango definitely indicates substantial

bleeding underneath the dartos muscle and in the subcutaneous area.</p>
<p align="justify">157.    A/Prof Li further clarified that if there is no

damage to the blood vessels within the dartos muscle, but ‘blood is poured into the

scrotal sac’ from another source, the scrotum skin will also look bruised and black

because of the blood permeating through and causing discolouration to appear through the

scrotal skin.</p>
<p align="justify">158.    A/Prof Li then elaborated on the kinds of

scrotal injuries that he had seen viz kicks, hits, fights, bicycle and motorcycle

accidents, falls into drains and falls suffered by construction workers. The scrotum

bruising showed up as a blue-black scrotum all the time.</p>
<p align="justify">159.    I asked A/Prof Li specifically whether the

dartos muscle in the scrotum would bleed in a particular situation where there is a

rolling over the toilet seat when a person falls off, which is a different situation from

the case when the scrotum is hit [i.e. by strong impact forces or the like]. He answered

in the positive but with a number of what I believe to be important qualifications. He

said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">His Honour: OK. So do you think, therefore, the rolling over a toilet

  seat will cause the dartos muscle to bleed because it is not the hitting, you know. If he

  falls off, let’s assume that he rolls over.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: The thing is, it really --- if you look at it this way, if we

  purposely, like your Honour was saying "I squeeze, and then I pay attention that I

  only squeeze the balls and I don’t squeeze any other things", that was a

  scenario that it could happen but what I would say is, if somebody is rolling over, we

  don’t know the speed. We know that there’s a ---</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: The speed, let’s assume it’s slow, not a speed of

  a car, let’s say, this is slow roll over.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, OK.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Like a pancake, you know, you prepare a pancake, you roll

  over, you know, the pancake, you have this thing to roll.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: <u><b>And we also don’t know how much pressure is there

  and how much pinching and crushing and weight and so on, we don’t really know but we

  only know that he’s a big size chap.</b></u></p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Yes. And would the dartos muscle in that situation be

  caused to bleed?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes. The scenario, your Honour, that you gave was you avoid

  but as far as I’m concerned, clinically, I have seen a lot of patients who had

  scrotal injuries and so on, I have never seen the scrotum being spared, the skin being

  spared. It is always the black bruise, the whole thing is black.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">160.    Due to the various qualifications, I cannot

reasonably construe A/Prof Li’s answer to be that the plaintiff would necessarily

have a black swollen scrotum if he had a contusion injury. Many unknown factors come into

play. The examples given (from which A/Prof Li derived his opinion that a black bruise

invariably appears), are those where the impact forces are sudden and of short duration

viz kicks, hits, fights, bicycle and motorcycle accidents, falls into drains, falls

suffered by construction workers. I can accept that the colour of the swollen scrotum may

be black in these categories of trauma because of the strong and sudden impact force which

is likely to cause severe rupture and fairly extensive bleeding of the blood vessels

within the dartos muscle, which with time may develop into a black swollen scrotum as

described by A/Prof Li.</p>
<p align="justify">161.    However, the nature and magnitude of the

contusion forces acting on the testes in this case during a roll off from a toilet seat is

totally different (assuming that the testes in the scrotum were caught and pressed between

the hard but smooth toilet seat surface on one side and the soft area in the

plaintiff’s perineum on the other side, and then sandwiched between the

plaintiff’s fleshy thighs on both sides and his flaccid penis in the front). Clearly,

these contusion forces acting on the testes and scrotum skin tissues are not impact

forces. I do not think that the expected result will necessarily be the same as that from

impact forces.</p>
<p align="justify">162.    The rate and extent of the buildup of pressures

and forces on the testes and scrotum skin tissues arising from a slow roll over are far

more gradual by comparison. It is wrong to think that the entire weight of 103.7 kg of the

plaintiff was crushing the scrotum and testes at the point of roll over because the thighs

(resting on the toilet seat) would still bear a substantial part of his torso weight. For

this reason, there is a fair probability that the contusion was not as severe as one might

think, although it remained sufficient to damage the internal of the testes. Hence, it is

much too presumptive to conclude that the absence of a black scrotum automatically rules

out the possibility of a moderate contusion injury to the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">163.    A/Prof Li’s evidence of a black scrotum

must be made subject to the several qualifications that he himself had made earlier. My

conclusion is supported by A/Prof Li’s evidence that it would be quite unusual to see

a black scrotum where there was no bruising on the skin. If there is crushing or rolling

over by something smooth, then the skin may well be spared and hence, there will be no

extratesticular bleeding in the scrotal tissues between the scrotal skin and the tunica

albuginea, and there will also be no black scrotum because the blood vessels in between

the skin and tunica are not damaged or at least not extensively damaged. But there can

still be an internally big intratesticular haematoma because of the damage to the blood

vessels within the testes due to the crushing or rolling over by a smooth object.</p>
<p align="justify">164.    Photograph D 51G shows the smooth and rounded

edge of the same toilet seat that Mr Harte sat on when he fell off. This photograph shows

the position of his scrotum when Mr Harte was probably sitting upright as in photograph

D51F and hence, his scrotum was lifted upwards. When his torso fell towards his thighs

(i.e. when he would be bending downward and forward in the final stages of the fall), his

scrotum naturally drooped much lower into the toilet bowl. This effect can be seen in

photographs D 51 D and E. In this position, the risk of his rather large scrotum (which I

think prior to the fall, would be even larger than that seen in photographs D 51D and E

because he had much larger and presumably heavier testicles then) being caught and

squashed between his body and the top of the toilet seat during the fall is in my view

much greater. A/Prof Li said that he would not expect any skin injury from abrasion. I

agree with him that the injury if any to the testicles, the dartos or to any structure in

that area is likely to be caused by pressure principally.</p>
<p align="justify">165.    During cross-examination of the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant’s experts, Mr Kronenburg went on enthusiastically to explore all kinds of

imaginable errors that Dr Tan could commit during his operation. I shall cite some of

them, which I find to be largely improbable upon closer examination.</p>
<p align="justify">166.    The first is the inadvertent ligation and/or

cutting of blood vessels. A/Prof Li testified that if the veins were cut without tying

them up and then allowed to bleed, a haematoma the size of a big mango would not form

because the veins would stop bleeding after a bit of pressure. Unlike an artery, the

pressure of the blood oozing out of the veins would be relatively low. So it was unlikely

to push to form a swelling the size of a mango. But where an artery was cut inadvertently,

the blood outflow pressure would be high. The resulting extratesticular swelling should

consequently be much larger. But A/Prof Li discounted the likelihood of an inadvertent

snipping of an artery during the surgery because a cut artery would spurt out blood like a

small fountain. The blood would obscure the surgical field. Dr Tan would immediately

realise that he had accidentally cut an artery. The necessary measures to rectify the

mistake could then be made.</p>
<p align="justify">167.    Counsel then suggested the possibility of tying

up the arteries inadvertently together with the varicose veins during the surgery. No

blood would spurt out if he were to cut both the artery and vein together. While it is

true that the surgeon is none the wiser, but there will be no extratesticular haematoma

although there will be atrophy due to devascularisation. This does not fit the facts of Mr

Harte’s case.</p>
<p align="justify">168.    The significance of A/Prof Li’s evidence is

this. If indeed the vein ligations done by Dr Tan had slipped, the veins would be oozing

out blood into the extratesticular area but that could only cause a small extratesticular

haematoma due to the low venous pressure. Since a large scrotum was presented, it

suggested that the cause could not be attributed to a failure of any of the 18 x 2 sutures

used to tie up the 18 ligated and divided varicose <u>veins</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">169.    Counsel for the plaintiff then asked A/Prof Li

whether slipping of the knots at the inadvertently divided <u>artery</u> would lead

instead to a big extratesticular haematoma. He agreed it would, provided it was the knot

at the pressure end and not the distal end that slipped. If the distal end slipped, it was

all right. A/Prof Li added that slipping of knots is one of the problems of a new surgeon

or a trainee.</p>
<p align="justify">170.    A/Prof Li alluded to an interesting point that

the pressure within the scrotum was not very high at the time of the maximum swelling

because it was pear shaped as drawn by Mr Harte. As an example, the pressure within a pear

shaped balloon would not be as high as in a round balloon. The pear shape suggested that

it was not likely that an open artery was pouring blood into the scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">171.    After considering the number of things that must

go wrong for this mode of negligence, I find it most unlikely having regard to the fact

that Dr Tan is a very experienced surgeon. Further, I do not think he is at the age where

he no longer has steady hands and good eyesight. In order for the bleak scenario painted

by counsel to happen, the defendant would have to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Inadvertently ligate and divide the arteries to the left and right

  testes. Ligation of the testicular artery alone does not produce testicular infarction.

  More than the testicular artery must be inadvertently tied up and divided on each side.

  That accounts for two consecutive major errors.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Slipping of knots must occur separately on both sides as the

  scrotum cavity is divided into two compartments by a septum and Mr Harte’s scrotum

  swelled on both sides.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The knot slippage must be on the pressure side of the divided

  artery and not on the distal side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">172.    The likelihood of all these independent events

happening at the same time sounds absolutely remote to me. I thus rule it out as a

fanciful possibility. The final answer from A/Prof Li that the blood flowing out of the

artery would be able to track back up and result in bloody incision at the skin ends this

speculation because the skin incision and dressing on both sides were found to be clean

and not stained with blood.</p>
<p align="justify">173.    With an extratesticular haematoma, A/Prof Li

believed that one would see bruising and a black discolouration. Upon palpitation, the

doctor would find a thick and less mobile scrotal skin. Normal skin is thin and mobile.</p>
<p align="justify">174.    A/Prof Li confirmed that the black blood clots

in the testes with intratesticular bleeding could not be seen through the scrotal skin. I

agree with him. The skin should appear normal in colour although the testicle is enlarged

because of the several layers enveloping each testis. Any change in colour of the scrotal

skin can only be due to blood in the extratesticular region appearing near the dartos

muscles.</p>
<p align="justify">175.    A/Prof Li said that he understood Dr Tan’s

description of ‘scrotal haematoma’ in his clinical notes to mean a bruised and

black scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">176.    When A/Prof Li’s attention was drawn to the

evidence of Mrs Harte of a bright red scrotum later changing to reddish purplish, A/Prof

Li thought that it was not possible. He felt that her observation of a reddish-purplish

scrotum was inconsistent with a scrotal haematoma because the main constituent of a

scrotal haematoma is blood in the scrotum and that never goes reddish-purplish. Like all

blood clots inside the body, it is black.</p>
<p align="justify">177.    When it is bright red, it means that there must

be blood on or near the surface of the skin. But blood is not bright red, it is dull red

in colour and blood never turns purple and neither will it turn reddish purple. A/Prof Li

testified that the colour of a haematoma is blackish, like the colour of hair. Therefore,

haemorrhaging within the dartos layer would not result in a red scrotum. Similarly a

slipped knot resulting in bleeding into the scrotum would not produce a red coloured

scrotum. Again it would be black. In the case of a fall, it was not inconceivable that the

knots at the tied up veins might slip. A blood clot inside the body would also be black.

In a case of bleeding from a slipped knot, A/Prof Li postulated that the blood would take

about an hour to accumulate and the blood clot would be fully manifested say by 6 hours.</p>
<p align="justify">178.    In the case of ligation of all the veins, the

testes would be fully congested within about 10 to 20 minutes. A nagging pain would be

felt. It would not be a sharp pain. The testes would bloat up to about double its size

volumetrically by the time the operation was over and the patient had awakened. He should

be able to see that his testes were larger. But the scrotum would be smaller than a mango.

However, if not all the veins were tied up, the congestion would be proportionally less.</p>
<p align="justify">179.    Dr Tan wrote the following in his medical notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">9 May 1997</p>
<p align="justify">Haematoma subsided<br/>

  Complained of hard testicles, left worse than right.<br/>

  Ultrasound scan: organised clot around left testicle, small hydrocele<br/>

  Wants medical report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">180.    A/Prof Li interpreted the ‘organised clot

around the left testicle’ as an internal blood clot <u>within</u> the testicle and

not one underneath the scrotal skin. He reinforced his testimony by saying that a scrotal

haematoma underneath the skin is normally very hard to find on ultrasound because it

merges with the tissues. <b>From the ‘small hydrocele’, he concluded that there

was intratesticular bleeding</b>. When the clot forms within a cavity, it pulls down into

two separate layers. The top layer is the serum i.e. the hydrocele, and the lower layer is

the clot and this hydrocele was found inside the testis..</p>
<p align="justify">181.    I consider this evidence to be very significant.

It confirms that there was internal bleeding in the testicle. If the veins were merely

tied up or too many veins were tied up, I accept that devascularisation could occur but I

do not think there would be any bleeding. There might simply be thrombosis of the blood

vessels and capillaries but there would be no rupture of these vessels or bleeding to

leave behind an organised clot and a small hydrocele. This critical evidence clearly

swings the balance of probability more in the direction of the contusion trauma and injury

of the testes with rupture of the blood vessels within the testes. This conclusion is

confirmed by A/Prof Li that with an intratesticular haematoma, then there must be trauma

or injury to the testicle.</p>
<p align="justify">182.    A/Prof Li did not think that an immediate

operation to drain the blood from the testes was necessarily a good idea. It was another

general anesthesia. Drainage of a haematoma may introduce infection because blood is a

very good medium for bacteria to grow and the scrotum is just next to the anus, which is a

potentially contaminated area.</p>
<p align="justify">183.    With regard to the intratesticular haematoma,

A/Prof Li was of the opinion that Dr Tan would not be able to do anything to remedy the

situation. If the testicle was to be saved from atrophy, action should be taken within the

first twenty hours or so. Beyond that it was hopeless. Even for an operation done within

twenty hours of injury, there was no guarantee that atrophy would not result. Therefore,

there was the possibility of salvage if the haematoma could be detected by 6.00 pm on the

day of the operation. Timing would be critical. In his opinion, it was too late to save

anything by 2 May 1997 if there was in fact internal testicular haemorrhage from the fall.</p>
<p align="justify">184.    A/Prof Li then went on to explain the mechanism

of necrosis. When the blood supply to an organ is reduced to 5 or 10% of what it was

before, ischaemic changes occur. The organ may shrink in size. For instance, when there is

a decrease in the blood supply to the leg, there will be pain. Later, the big toe turns

black. As a result of a chronic lack of blood supply to the leg, the toe can even drop

off.</p>
<p align="justify">185.    Although A/Prof Li was unable to say what would

happen when the blood supply to the testicle dropped to 5 or 10%, he accepted that it was

possible to get ischaemic necrosis through a decreased blood supply. As everything is

possible in a biological human being, it is also possible to have a situation that the

epididymis is alive and normal but not the testis, because the oxygen via the blood supply

is somehow just sufficient for the smaller epididymis but insufficient for the relatively

larger organ, the testis. But he thought that a situation like this was unlikely and

remote.</p>
<p align="justify">186.    When the radiology report from Cabrini Medical

Centre dated 21 October 1998 was shown to A/Prof Li by Mr Kronenburg, he agreed that the

reduced perfusion sufficient to support the head of the epididymis was sufficient to

support some spermatogenesis because ‘decreased spermatogenesis with only a few

spermatids’ was found in the left testis although in the right testis, ‘no

spermatozogenesis’ was found.</p>
<p align="justify">187.    Based on the ultrasound report of Dr Koay on 11

September 1997, A/Prof Li understood that the testes were of small volume with atrophy

having set in and they were almost dead. However the presence of tissue perfusion

indicated that there was still some blood supply through the testes based on the CDUS

scan.</p>
<p align="justify">188.    Further the fact that both heads of the

epididymis appeared normal as stated in Dr Koay’s ultrasound report confirmed this

because the epididymis shared the same blood supply as the testis. If indeed Dr Tan had

inadvertently ligated the artery or the veins, or in other words, if it were purely a

blood supply or a venous congestion problem, the epididymis would have disappeared too.

One could not have the testis atrophying but not the epididymis. Based on logical

deduction, this substantially rules out the theory that all the veins/arteries, or far too

many veins/arteries were tied up because both the epididymis and testes should die or

atrophy together. A/Prof Li believed that if the epididymis survived a blood supply

reduction of say 50%, the testes would similarly survive. But whatever decrease there

might be in the blood supply sufficient to cause death of the testis, it should also be

sufficient to cause the epididymis to die. I fully agree. As an illustration, cutting the

blood supply to the hand will also cut off the blood supply to the fingers. But with

trauma, one can damage the fingers without damaging the hand because it depends on where

the physical trauma happens to be inflicted.</p>
<p align="justify">189.    According to A/Prof Li, the fact that there was

severe damage to the testes without corresponding damage to the epididymis in Mr

Harte’s case indicated that it was more likely the result of trauma or contusion than

a case of loss of or insufficient blood supply. This evidence lends substantial support to

the defendant’s fall theory and undermines the plaintiff’s theory of a loss of

or severe reduction of blood supply.</p>
<p align="justify">190.    Following this, counsel for the plaintiff

rightly explored the question whether both the testes and epididymis would suffer

contusion injury given the nature of the fall. A/Prof Li explained that the epididymis is

a very soft tissue. In a crushing or rolling situation, these soft tissues can yield to

the contusion. The epididymis is located at the top posterior of the testis. Assuming a

fall from a toilet seat where the pelvic bone presses down on the testis, there will be

sandwiching of the epididymis between the pelvic bone and the tunica. But there is the

possibility of a rotation of the testis because there is a lot of freedom and the scrotal

skin can stretch to allow the rotation. The significance then is that the forces are not

acting directly on the epididymis if the testis rotates. To my mind, A/Prof Li has given a

reasonable explanation why a contusion injury to the testes may not necessarily damage the

epididymis. Unlike the testis, which is encased within a tough unstretchable membrane

called the tunica albuginea, the epididymis is located outside this membrane. Being softer

and having greater elasticity, the epididymis can easily stretch and thus yield to the

compression because it is not ‘compacted’ or ‘constrained’ so to speak

within a fairly non-elastic container or tunica albuginea, which is being flattened. For

this reason, I accept that the epididymis can withstand pressure or contusion better than

the testis.</p>
<p align="justify">191.    Interestingly, Dr Schlegel gave evidence in

support of the fall theory when he said that an injury affecting directly the testicle

from trauma would not usually affect the epididymis primarily either.</p>
<p align="justify">192.    Even Dr Notley appeared to concur . He did not

see any reason why the epididymis would not survive when the testes were squeezed. Whether

it was infarction or contusion, the epididymis might survive as it is a ‘<i>pretty

tough bit of equipment</i>’. Thus the absence of damage to the heads of both

epididymis does not rule out contusion as a cause of the bilateral testicular atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">193.    Associate Professor Foo Keong Tatt (‘A/Prof

Foo’), the Senior Consultant Urologist and Head of the Department of Urology at the

Singapore General Hospital, was called by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant as his medical

expert witness. He testified that one would find bruising, ecchymosis around the scrotum

and possibly some abrasion on the scrotal skin and penis were a patient to suffer

contusion injury to the scrotal and testes sufficient to result in almost total testicular

atrophy. Similarly, Dr Clarence Lei Chang Moh, a consultant urologist at the Normah

Medical Specialist Centre, Petra Jaya, Kuching, Sarawak, gave evidence that the scrotum

would appear ‘darkish, dark blue’ or ‘bruised and dark’ four days

after trauma to the scrotum. It would not be red anymore. Then Mr Lek asked Dr Lei for his

diagnosis if the grapefruit sized swollen scrotum had a ‘bluish tinge’ instead.

Dr Lei thought that if the testis had been normal before and there was a history of a

fall, and the result was a dark, blue-black scrotum, then it was probably due to the fall.

He did not directly answer Mr Lek’s question.</p>
<p align="justify">194.    Dr Lei then went on to deal with the other

scenario when the testes were pressed and rolled over between a smooth hard surface and

the patient’s perineum (i.e. space between the anus and scrotum) and there was

intratesticular injury as a result of that. He explained that there would probably not be

injury to the scrotal skin. He explained that the testis is an organ held by a very tight

tunica and it cannot expand. Accordingly, the slightest pressure on it can cause

intratesticular damage. In response to questions from Mr Lek, Dr Clarence Lei said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q : … if there was intratesticular injury, OK, as a result of that

  motion [i.e. pressing and rolling over], OK, would you agree that it is likely that at the

  time, there would also be injury to the scrotal skin? Assuming there was intratesticular

  injury, would that at the same time be injury to the scrotal skin?</p>
<p align="justify">A : There may not be. In fact, I think probably there will not be

  because the testis is an organ that is held by a very tight tunica and it cannot expand.

  So <u><b>even the slightest pressure on it can cause intratesticular damage,</b></u> and I

  think you can easily find out by doing your own experiment. You just squeeze your testes a

  little, it’s going to hurt a lot because of that nature. It’s just like the

  brain where it’s inside a very tight capsule. So, unfortunately, for the testes, no,

  but if you say about the muscle, for example, you know, you damaged the muscle, then there

  will be associated injury. If the muscle is damaged, then the skin will surely be damaged

  but not for the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: It’s a very delicate structure, is it?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Delicate structure with a tight capsule. So you can damage it

  without damaging the skin very much, unfortunately, that’s what we are born with.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: But if there was eventual total intratesticular atrophy, that means

  not just merely injury but there was eventual total intratesticular atrophy, would you

  agree that it is likely that there would be some injury to the scrotal skin?</p>
<p align="justify">……</p>
<p align="justify">A: ….<u><b>But my opinion is that, that you can damage the testes

  without significant damage to the scrotal skin because of this special arrangement.</b></u></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the same issue, A/Prof Foo’s evidence was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q : Would you require the tunica to stretch before you could say

  atrophy would occur?</p>
<p align="justify">A : The atrophy would ---the tunica itself cannot stretch because

  it’s a very tough membrane, and that is the reason why when it bleeds inside within

  the testicle, the pressure builds up, it’s like your skull, cannot stretch.</p>
<p align="justify">Q : So, in other words ---</p>
<p align="justify">A : So intra cranial haematoma is very dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">195.    From the medical and bioengineering point of

view, I find these answers of Dr Lei and A/Prof Foo to be very sound, although it is a bit

of an exaggeration to say that the ‘slightest pressure’ can cause

intratesticular damage. More likely it is moderate pressure that can cause intratesticular

damage. I do not wish to be overly semantic about these things but what is important in my

view is the mechanism of damage that Dr Lei and A/Foo had alluded to in their evidence,

which must take account of the special biological construction or structure of the scrotum

and testes.</p>
<p align="justify">196.    All the while, the plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants proceeded on the basis that there must necessarily be some skin abrasion and/or

serious bruising of the scrotal skin whenever there is a rolling over or squeezing of the

internal testes. Clearly, there can be internal damage to the testes without the dark

colour associated with scrotal skin bruising. Because each testis is contained in a tough,

fairly non-elastic capsule, any flattening of the capsule thus reducing its volume will

cause the internal pressure to build up very rapidly in the tissue contents. Even

biological matter must obey the universal laws of physics. For instance, in a case

involving a fixed mass of a gaseous substance maintained at the same temperature, the

pressure is inversely proportional to its volume. This is Bolye’s law. The smaller

the volume, the higher will be the internal pressure throughout that fixed mass of gaseous

substance, and vice versa. In the case of a fixed mass of a liquid substance, which is

largely incompressible, the pressure in that liquid substance will increase very much more

when the volume is reduced even slightly by compression. Where a fixed mass of liquid is

contained within a flexible capsule, and an external force is applied over a small area of

the capsule (i.e. an external pressure is applied on a small part of the external surface

of the capsule), the pressure in the liquid throughout the capsule will rise such that it

will be equal to that external pressure being applied. Therefore, if a man were to sit on

his scrotum and thereby exert a strong external pressure on the tunica albuginea encasing

his testes, that strong external pressure will be transmitted internally throughout the

testicular tissue within the tunica albuginea, assuming that there is no rupture.</p>
<p align="justify">197.    Thus by flattening or compressing the tunica

albuginea, the corresponding increase in pressure throughout the testicular tissue encased

within the tunica albuginea may rise to a level where it causes microvascular damage by

two modes (a) direct damage to the tissue cells and (b) rupture or tearing of the delicate

capillary vessels with resulting haemorrhage within the testes due to the elongation or

strain from the flattening process. A reasonably good analogy will be the air

(representing the testicular tissue contents) enclosed in a balloon (representing the

tunica envelop). Flattening the balloon will raise the internal air pressure all round and

the balloon will be forced to elongate.</p>
<p align="justify">198.    Therefore, moderately intense squeezing of the

testis is likely to cause microvascular damage to the delicate tissues encased within the

tunica albuginea, which can subsequently damage the whole or part of the testis.</p>
<p align="justify">199.    I find support from the evidence of Dr Tay Kah

Phuan who confirmed the two ways in which compression pressure causes damage. One is

contusion pressure on the cells themselves and the cells die. The direct contusion force

can also disrupt the tissue and cause it to die. The second is microvascular rupture of

blood vessels. Due to the rupture, there is a buildup of pressure that can subsequently

infarct the testes. Sometimes, one cannot tell which comes first.</p>
<p align="justify">200.    A/Prof Foo also clarified that there are no

nerves within the actual tissues inside the testis. With the squeezing of the testis, it

is the stretching of the tunica covering that causes the pain, not the damage to the

internal tissues of the testes <i>per se</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">201.    I then clarified with A/Prof Foo on the

mechanism of the pain in the scrotal region:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A: So, a pressure causing – a pressure that would cause the tunica

  to stretch would also cause pain?</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: No, you see, the cause of the pain is the stretching ---</p>
<p align="justify">Mr Kronenburg: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So, if it is damage <i>per se</i> within the layer without

  stretching you won’t feel pain. That’s why I’ve to establish that.

  It’s only after the thing stretches due to congestion and so on and coagulation, then

  the pain begins as it stretches. Because the stretching is where the nerve detects the

  stretching. That’s where you get the pain. If the tunica doesn’t stretch, you

  damage the inside, he says you won’t feel the pain because there are no nerves

  inside.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: That’s right, your Honour.</p>
<p align="justify">……</p>
<p align="justify">Q : Professor, if the Plaintiff had a squeezing contusion injury to the

  extent that atrophy resulted, would he feel pain – yes, maybe, or no? If the

  Plaintiff had a squeezing contusion injury to the extent that atrophy resulted,

  wouldn’t he feel pain --</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: When, the question is when.</p>
<p align="justify">Mr Kronenburg: Yes, I was going to ---</p>
<p align="justify">Witness : That’s what I’m going to explain. Initially there

  may be pain.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: But subsequently?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Subsequently there may not be pain ---</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Immediately after?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Immediately after, there may be pain and then the pain will subside,

  but as the pressure builds up within the tunica ---</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Pain comes back again?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: That’s right, your Honour.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: All right.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: So there will be pain and the pain will disappear, then the pain

  will come back again?</p>
<p align="justify">A: That’s right, your Honour.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: But you’re certain there will be pain at the outset?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Initially. Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: Which is for a short while, is it?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, Your Honour. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">202.    Dr Notley in his rebuttal evidence substantially

confirmed what A/Prof Foo had said was the pattern of the pain: "<i>And, of course,

with the infarction as with the haematoma, the pain will subside over the next few days.

And so by four days, it might not be so painful.</i>" Dr Notley explained that the

pain in testicular contusion or injury would be felt instantly as the injury occurred. The

pain intensity would probably be very high at the time of the injury and would last for a

few minutes. But over the next few minutes, the severe pain would subside leaving the

patient with a nasty and unpleasant ache. And if the testicle was injured, that nasty

unpleasant ache would gradually increase over the next few hours because the full force of

the patient’s blood pressure would be pushing into the swollen testicle causing

tension in the inelastic tunica albuginea. So the pain would come on within a few hours of

the dull, unpleasant natured pain.</p>
<p align="justify">203.    In contra-distinction, infarction would not be

painful initially, no more painful than a patient who had excision of a varicocele which

did not produce infarction. Because the pressure would be gradually rising within the

testicle and within the tunica albuginea, this pain would be a dull pain, not a sharp

acute pain. According to Dr Notley, the dull pain would come on gradually over a matter of

hours, building up, starting probably as a mild ache a few hours afterwards and then

getting worse and worse, and probably peak ten to twelve hours later.</p>
<p align="justify">204.    The apparently irreconcilable evidence is that

by 7.00 p.m., Mr Harte still did not feel any pain except discomfort and a dull ache at

his scrotum when he left the hospital. If there was any severe contusion injury, I think

he should have felt the pain. Since there was no complaint of acute pain, it appears

either that (a) there was no contusion injury, or (b) the contusion injury might only be

moderate in magnitude. This calls for closer examination.</p>
<p align="justify">205.    Since Mr Harte could feel the pain from the bump

on his head, I have to rule out the possibility that the pain killer tablets consumed by

Mr Harte after surgery (if any) and the remaining effects of the general anaesthesia were

of such magnitude that they completely removed his ability to detect pain in his scrotum.

I expect that Mr Harte would be more sensitive to pain in his testes than on his forehead.

I also note that Mr Harte could feel discomfort from the minor swelling in his scrotum

when he was recovering in the day ward after the surgery. This again suggests to me that

the anaesthesia wore off fairly quickly. If indeed there was a severe and substantial

blunt trauma to the testes, it is surprising that the acute pain would have escaped Mr

Harte. But where the blunt trauma is moderate, then it is not beyond believability that Mr

Harte could not, after regaining consciousness, detect the pain because it might not be as

acute and that pain might have passed away or significantly reduced by the time he

recovered from his syncope. It is not improbable that Mr Harte did not complain of the

pain because he was already expecting discomfort, pain and swelling from the testicular

congestion due to ligation of veins, which is inherent in a varicocele operation. As Dr

Tan’s operation on Mr Harte was bilateral in nature (as opposed to the unilateral

varicocele operation on the left side by Dr Dubin), I suppose even greater pain and

discomfort were to be expected. Thus, Mr Harte was content not to complain.</p>
<p align="justify">206.    I find that the forces involved in a non-violent

roll over and compression/squeezing of the testes are dissimilar in nature and are

probably of lesser magnitude in comparison with those in the typical impact trauma

situation involving for instance, a violent kick, or a motorcycle accident, where a sudden

large impact force hits the scrotum and testes. In my considered opinion, the contusion in

Mr Harte’s case involved only a moderate non-impact force. It was more a gradual

squeezing of the testes, as his heavy body rolled over his scrotum during the fall off the

toilet seat. The duration of application of the force would be about a second or less. The

resulting pain envisaged in this situation would probably not be acute and would have

diminished quickly and not be noticeable by Mr Harte by the time he regained

consciousness. The absence of a rupture of the tunica albuginea also suggests that the

compressive force was not particularly severe. A/Prof Foo did not think that Mr Harte

suffered any rupture of the tunica albuginea based on the medical evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">207.    Nevertheless, the probability of internal

microvascular damage cannot be excluded. If the damage is microvascular in nature within

the testicular tissues (which I am made to understand do not have any nerves), I doubt

very much that the microbleeding itself is going to cause much pain. When the

microbleeding or haemorrhage feeding the growing intratesticular haematoma starts to swell

and stretch the intact tunica albuginea and exert pressure on it, then the pain will

begin. As the intratesticular swelling and pressure slowly increase, the pain will also

gradually increase. Looked at from this angle, I find that the pain symptoms from moderate

contusion and microvascular damage are largely consistent with the absence of clear signs

of acute pain and the presence of a dull pain and some minor swelling when Mr Harte was in

hospital waiting to be discharged. They are also consistent with the acute pain that Mr

Harte felt only on the following morning after the surgery, when he experienced fairly

substantial swelling.</p>
<p align="justify">208.    The important outcome of the above analysis is

that the absence of acute pain does not rule out contusion as a probable cause of the

devascularisation damage in the testes. I believe that the absence of acute pain can only

exclude severe impact injuries and severe contusions <u><b>but not those which are

moderate in magnitude</b></u>.</p>
<p align="justify">209.    A/Prof Foo was then asked specifically to

describe the pain pattern for a case of trauma leading to intratesticular injury

sufficient to lead to testicular atrophy. His view was that Mr Harte would slowly develop

pain and a scrotal haematoma. Unless the pain was very severe, he might sometimes feel

nausea. If there was severe nausea, the patient would vomit. After 4 days, there would be

a big haematoma. It would be difficult to feel the testes, and therefore, it would be

difficult to ascertain whether the haematoma was extratesticular or intratesticular. But

A/Prof Foo thought that sometimes the pain would subside by the fourth day or the person

might get used to the pain. The haematoma would harden.</p>
<p align="justify">210.    As for venous congestion due to an inappropriate

or negligent surgical procedure, A/Prof Foo agreed that it would take a few minutes for

the pressure to build up in the testes after tying up the veins. However, it would take a

few hours for the swelling to build up depending on the extent of the venous impairment or

congestion. Interestingly, A/Prof Li said that the pain arising from venous congestion was

not sudden but would build up slowly. With partial and not total impairment of venous

flow, the congestion might take longer to build up. If this was the mechanism of

devascularisation, then it would be similar to the discomfort and dull pain felt after the

operation and over the next 12 hours.</p>
<p align="justify">211.    I am persuaded by the preponderance of expert

medical opinion to conclude that the absence of acute pain cannot exclude either venous

impairment damage through careless surgery on the one hand, or microvascular bleeding and

haemorrhage from contusion damage on the other. That also means that the absence of

vomiting and nausea felt by Mr Harte after the fall does not exclude either a surgical

cause or contusion damage.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Defence of 1<sup>st</sup> defendant</b></p>
<p align="justify">212.    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Dr Tan, attributed

the testicular atrophy entirely to the fall in which the plaintiff’s exposed scrotum

was squashed between the toilet seat and his heavy torso, as his body collapsed forward

and eventually slid off the toilet seat in an unconscious state with his head hitting the

floor first.</p>
<p align="justify">213.    On being told of the fall and the injury on the

head, Dr Tan sent for a neurosurgeon, Dr Balagi, to examine Mr Harte. Dr Tan never asked

for more information, and hence, he never received all the details about the fall. Dr

Balagi saw Mr Harte twice and diagnosed "syncope" fainting, which Dr Tan said

explained in part why the plaintiff did not feel pain in his scrotum area.</p>
<p align="justify">214.    As I have said above, even if full details of

the fall were provided, a reasonably careful and competent urologist might not visualise

or realise that the testes could be contused by a fall in an unconscious state from a

toilet seat. Being such an unusual and rare occurrence, I accept Dr Tan’s defence

that atrophic damage to testes arising from a fall from a toilet seat is not a reasonably

foreseeable consequence.</p>
<p align="justify">215.    As such, I find that no negligence arises from

Dr Tan’s failure to examine Mr Harte before his discharge from the hospital. Whether

the reasons proffered by Dr Tan for not seeing him are reasonable or not need not concern

me. Neither is it relevant whether his message to the plaintiff to wait for him was in

fact conveyed to Mr Harte. It makes no difference as Dr Tan would have discharged Mr Harte

even if Dr Tan did examine him personally. I doubt that Dr Tan would have been able to

diagnose a potentially dangerous intratesticular haematoma developing at that stage,

especially when Mr Harte had not complained of any serious pain and there were no obvious

signs of bruising or swelling.</p>
<p align="justify">216.    Dr Myint Soe stressed that the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant is a FRCS (General Surgeon) as well as a specialist FRCS (Urology). He is the

only one in Singapore with a FRCS (Urology) qualification. He had received extensive

training in hospitals in England and in Singapore before he set up his own private

practice. Varicocelectomy is a minor operation involving only day surgery. He has done far

more difficult operations like kidney transplants. Furthermore, he has done about 200

varicocelectomies including those via the subinguinal approach. So far, he has never

encountered any disasters of any kind. Neither has he made any blunders in any of his more

difficult operations. Basically, to have blundered twice in two consecutive simple

operations causing atrophy on both sides must be so remote as to be statistically

improbable having regard to his experience and his numerous previous successful

operations.</p>
<p align="justify">217.    I consider this statistical argument to be a

point in favour of Dr Tan that he could not have botched up the simple operation twice.

What is statistically significant and hardly to be ignored is the very strange coincidence

that the allegedly consecutive substandard operation is accompanied by a fall. Without

anything else, immediate suspicion will be cast on the fall as being the more likely cause

than the alleged negligence of a competent and very experienced urologist. This

statistical analysis will be considered in more detail subsequently.</p>
<p align="justify">218.    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant testified that he

used the recognised subinguinal approach, which allows access to the external veins. His

method of surgery using optical lubes is recognised. New medical studies have advocated an

aggressive approach to ligate all the veins leaving just one set of veins to the vas

intact and there should be no adverse consequences such as venous congestion. Dr Tan

opined that he was in fact much far more conservative as he had left many other veins

intact during his operation. First, he took care to ensure that the vas and the bundle of

vessels were identified and kept out of the surgical field after opening the cremasteric

fascia. This ensured that some veins and the vasal artery were kept intact. He was trained

to do this and he followed this standard procedure. I find no reason to disbelieve him on

this. Besides leaving the vasal veins untouched, he also spared the gubernacular veins

thereby reserving more than adequate channels for venous drainage. Since he did not

deliver the testes out during the surgery, he had not ligated or cut any of the

gubernacular veins, which were at the bottom end of the testes. On these aspects of his

operation, Dr Tan was not shaken in cross-examination and had steadfastly maintained that

he had left the vasal artery and vasal veins intact together with the vas.</p>
<p align="justify">219.    The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant explained that in a

lattice like network of varicocele veins, the tributaries of the same dilated vein could

be cut twice, counting as 2 cuts, which gave the wrong impression that an unduly large

number of veins were ligated. Lower down at the subinguinal level, the number of veins

increases due to branching as one gets closer to the pampiniform plexus and the scrotum

level, where for instance, for each internal spermatic vein encountered higher up at the

inguinal canal level, two to four tributaries may be encountered at the lower level of the

plexus, the lattice like network of intercommunicating veins. This accounts for the larger

number of veins (subcutaneous veins, the external veins and the cremasteric veins) ligated

normally lower down at the subinguinal level as compared to an operation higher up at the

inguinal level.</p>
<p align="justify">220.    Dr Schlegel agreed that the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant’s surgical procedure described by him would generally fit the standard of

care for treatment of a varicocele. I cannot find any objective evidence from which to

infer that Dr Tan could not have done what he said he did. In the absence of such

evidence, I have no reason to disbelieve his testimony on how he performed the operation.</p>
<p align="justify">221.    Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein in an article

‘Anatomical Approach to Varicocelectomy’ described their preferred inguinal

approach to varicocelectomy, where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…All external spermatic veins are identified and doubly ligated ..

  and divided. The gubernaculum is inspected for the presence of veins exiting from the

  tunica vaginalis. These are either cauterized, doubly ligated or clipped, and divided.

  …. All internal spermatic veins, even very small veins should be ligated. On

  completion of the dissection, the spermatic cord is run over the index finger to confirm

  that all veins have been ligated…… At least one set of blood vessels around the

  vas deferens should be preserved because they allow the only egress of blood from the

  testis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">222.    From the above passage, it can be seen that very

aggressive ligation of as many veins as possible (including very small veins) was

advocated by Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein. Dr Goldstein in Chapter 19: "<i>Mini-Incision

Microsurgical Inguinal or Subinguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis</i>"

in his book "<i>Surgery of Male Infertility</i>" stated at page 177 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The vas deferens is always accompanied by two sets of vessels. <i>As

  long as at least one set of vasal veins remains intact, venous congestion will not occur.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">223.    The above statement is also repeated in the

joint paper by Goldstein, Gilbert, Dicker, Dwosh and Gnecco in "<i>Microsurgical

Inguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing

Technique</i>".</p>
<p align="justify">224.    In essence, leaving untouched only the vasal

vein at the vas deferens is sufficient to prevent vascular damage to the testes. This

evidence representing the views of a number of responsible urologists, later confirmed by

Dr Schlegel in his testimony, is <u><b>fatal</b></u> to the plaintiff’s postulation

of excessive division of veins by Dr Tan as the cause of the devascularisation.</p>
<p align="justify">225.    I accept that Dr Tan had left all the arteries

including the vasal artery intact. He did not ligate and divide the vasal vein. He also

left some other veins behind as shown in D29. I find that there was adequate blood supply

to and sufficient venous drainage from both his testes. As such, Dr Tan’s operation

did not cause the devascularisation, which led to Mr Harte’s substantial testicular

atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">226.    Having failed in this direction, counsel for the

plaintiff spent a considerable amount of time taking issue with all imaginable ways that

Dr Tan might have misused the Babcock forceps, one of which was that Dr Tan might have

applied too much pressure on the spermatic cord when he used it to pull it out of the skin

incision and the other was clamping the arteries between the rounded ‘teeth’ of

the Babcock forceps, just to cite two examples. In my opinion, the foray into this area

was not fruitful.</p>
<p align="justify">227.    Counsel for the plaintiff invited Dr Notley to

give a multitude of examples on how the misuse of the forceps would lead to

devascularisation: closing the ends on the blood vessel and damaging the blood vessels,

twisting the forceps through 180 degrees together with the vessels within it, undue

traction on the Babcock forceps obstructing the flow of blood through the vessels thereby

causing thrombosis, which is a very likely cause of devascularisation. Without some

supporting evidence, these countless possibilities remain in the speculative realm and

have little weight. Speculation on all sorts of possibilities is not going to get the

plaintiff very far.</p>
<p align="justify">228.    Dr Schlegel initially also asserted that the

clamping and pulling of the vas deferens and blood vessels with the Babcock forceps could

have actually damaged those blood vessels. I then note that Dr Schlegel uses it as well.

This is an atraumatic instrument with curved rounded edges. Dr Tan maintained that he had

held the sides of the spermatic cord where there were no major arteries to bring it out to

the skin level as was recommended by Marmar and Kim. He did not encircle the spermatic

cord within the Babcock forceps. At worst, if he had applied too much pressure momentarily

say for 10 seconds as he pulled out the spermatic cord, devascularisation could not

possibly happen. A period of 10 seconds is far too short for any cell death to occur

through lack of oxygenated blood flow. Just for the sake of comparison, the medical

evidence before me was that salvage of the testes must be done within 6 hours if the blood

supply is choked off due to a torsion injury, which necessarily implies that a temporary

shut off of blood supply to the testis for any reason during the 1  hour operation is

not likely to cause any cell death or testicular death through devascularisation.</p>
<p align="justify">229.    I thus accept the submission of counsel for Dr

Tan that even if he had occluded the blood supply, it could not have been for a sufficient

length of time to cause vascular damage of the kind seen.</p>
<p align="justify">230.    Dr Tan testified that he used the Babcock

forceps to isolate and keep the vas and its vessels out of harm’s way. If he had

inadvertently kinked the vessels with the Babcock forceps, the effects would be obvious

because the veins would swell up or get engorged. Hence, I would imagine that he would

have remedied the obvious problem immediately. Even if his use of the Babcock forceps had

damaged any vasal artery, there were two other sets of arteries, viz the testicular and

the cremasteric arteries to supply the blood to the testicles. Atrophy would not likely

occur.</p>
<p align="justify">231.    I also note that the plaintiff’s expert

witness on biomechanics, A/Prof Lim Chwee Teck had produced a document P54 from ‘Data

Book on Mechanical Properties of Living Cells, Tissues and Organs’ verifying the

degree to which arteries can be stretched. It appears from the yield strain data that

arteries can tolerate stretching up to 34 %, which indicates that they are fairly flexible

and can safely withstand a fair amount of stretching. This proves that arterial damage is

unlikely when the arteries are a little stretched in the process of bringing the spermatic

cord to the skin level. It is fanciful to think that these arteries are so extremely

delicate when they are not. Fortunately, Mother Nature has provided a certain level of

inbuilt tolerance and robustness in these arteries because they have to transport blood

under pressure to all parts of the human body, and are subject to movements and stretching

when a human being runs and exercises.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Defence of 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants</b></p>
<p align="justify">232.    Mr Harte had of his own volition chosen to

consult Dr Tan for his fertility treatment and varicocele operation.</p>
<p align="justify">233.    The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants’ defence was

that Dr Tan was not their employee, servant or agent. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants and Dr

Tan never represented to the plaintiff that Dr Tan was ever an employee, servant or agent

of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. Dr Tan has his own private clinic. In legal parlance, Dr

Tan is an independent contractor. He is merely accredited to use the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants’ hospital facilities and has been granted admitting privileges for his

patients.</p>
<p align="justify">234.    Mr Harte could not be mistaken that he was

consulting a private specialist because the signboard outside Dr Tan’s clinic would

have clearly shown that his clinic was not part of the hospital establishment at all.

Official receipts given to the plaintiff showed that they were issued by H H Tan Urology

Centre Pte Ltd of #04-03 Gleneagles Medical Centre Singapore 258499.</p>
<p align="justify">235.    Similarly, when he went to Sheng Yu Laboratory

of #07-11 Specialists’ Centre for his basic seminal analysis, for which he was

separately issued a receipt, it must be clear to Mr Harte that the laboratory test was not

done by the hospital but by a private agency.</p>
<p align="justify">236.    Balanced against these were the direct payments

to the hospital on the day of the surgery on admission. He paid an initial deposit of $300

to the hospital upon his admission for the surgery. He paid a total of $4,803.68 again to

the hospital when he was discharged after the surgery. Both receipts represented that he

was paying to ‘Gleneagles Hospital Singapore, 6A Napier Road Singapore 258500’.</p>
<p align="justify">237.    There was no breach of contract between the

plaintiff and the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants’ contract

with the plaintiff was contained in the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants’ "Conditions

of Service/Hospital Policies" dated 28 April 1997, which was for the provision by the

2<sup>nd</sup> defendants of hospitalisation services to the plaintiff in consideration of

the plaintiff agreeing to pay the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants all fees and expenses for the

same. There was no allegation of any breach of this contract by the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">238.    There was no battery or trespass on the person

of Mr Harte as all treatment, care and attention administered to him during his stay in

the hospital was undertaken with his consent.</p>
<p align="justify">239.    The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants maintained that

they were not negligent with regard to the fall in the toilet. There was also no

allegation by the plaintiff that the fall was caused by the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants’ negligence. Having regard to the undisputed fact that it was Mr Harte who

had, against the nurse’s advice, insisted on going to the toilet, Mr Harte must

accept full responsibility for his own fall whilst seated on the toilet bowl. If he did

suffer any contusion of his testes as a result of the fall, he should not blame others for

it. He could not say that the contusion was caused by the negligence of the hospital. I

entirely agree.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>The Law</b></p>
<p align="justify">240.    There is no dispute as to what the law is in

relation to the standard of care required in the area of medical negligence as it is

fairly well settled. Judith Prakash J in a recent decision in <i>Jason Carlos Rancisco v

Dr L. M. Thng &amp; Anor</i> (Suit No 573 of 1998) had succinctly and clearly set out the

law and I can do no better other than to quote paragraphs 106 and 107 of the learned

judge’s decision, which I most respectfully adopt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">106. The duty of the medical practitioner is to exercise reasonable

  skill and care in treating his patient and the burden lies on the plaintiff to satisfy the

  court that the defendant was in breach of his duty. Reasonable skill and care are assessed

  on the basis of the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have

  that special skill and not on the standard of the highest expert. This is what is known as

  the ‘Bolam test’ taken from the direction to the jury of Mc Nair J in <i>Bolam v

  Friern Hospital Management Committee</i> [1957] 1 WLR 582. This test has been restated

  many times and has been approved by the House of Lords in cases like <i>White House v

  Jordan</i> [1981] 1 All ER 267 and <i>Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal

  Hospital</i> [1985] 1 All ER 643.</p>
<p align="justify">107.    The standard of care has been held to be a

  matter of medical judgment in <i>Sidaway</i> where Lord Scarman stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘The <i>Bolam</i> principle may be formulated as a rule but a

    doctor is not negligent if he acts in accordance with a practice accepted at the time as

    proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even though other doctors adopt a

    different practice. In short the law imposes a duty of care; but the standard of care is a

    matter of medical judgment’.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">241.    The learned judge also accepted the following

formulation of the law by Lord Scarman in <i>Maynard v West Midlands Regional Health

Authority</i> [1984] 1 WLR 634 at p 638-639:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A case which is based on an allegation that a fully considered decision

  of two consultants in the field of their special skill was negligent clearly presents

  certain difficulties of proof. It is not enough to show that there is a body of competent

  professional opinion which considers that theirs was a wrong decision, if there also

  exists a body of professional opinion, equally competent, which supports the decision as

  reasonable in the circumstances. It is not enough to show that subsequent events show that

  the operation need never have been performed, if at the time the decision to operate was

  taken it was reasonable in the sense that a responsible body of medical opinion would have

  accepted it as proper …</p>
<p align="justify">I would only add that a doctor who professes to exercise a special

  skill must exercise the ordinary skill of his speciality. Differences of opinion and

  practice exist, and will always exist, in the medical as in other professions. There is

  seldom any one answer exclusive of all others to problems of professional judgment. A

  court may prefer one body of opinion to the other: but that is no basis for a conclusion

  of negligence.</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p align="justify">….I have to say that a judge’s ‘preference’ for one

  body of distinguished professional opinion to another also professionally distinguished is

  not sufficient to establish negligence in a practitioner whose actions have received the

  seal of approval of those whose opinions, truthfully expressed, honestly held, were not

  preferred. …in the realm of diagnosis and treatment negligence is not established by

  preferring one respectable body of professional opinion to another. Failure to exercise

  the ordinary skill of a doctor (in the appropriate speciality, if he be a specialist) is

  necessary.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">242.    Judith Prakash J. emphasized that the judge has

to exercise his own critical faculties and not simply be swept along by the opinion of the

medical experts. I agree with her completely as can be seen later in this case, I found

myself unfortunately in complete disagreement with the medical experts called both by the

plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, particularly in relation to their expert

opinion that the colour of a scrotal haematoma from physical trauma is necessarily

‘as black as hair’, ‘black as a gown’ or ‘blue-black’.</p>
<p align="justify">243.    Just as with the learned judge, I accept the

authoritative proposition of law stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i>Bolitho v. City and

Hackney H.A.</i> (H.L.(E.)) [1998] A.C.232, which clarifies the ambit of the <i>Bolam</i>

test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">….in my view, the court is not bound to hold that a defendant

  doctor escapes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads

  evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinely of opinion that the

  defendant’s treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice.</p>
<p align="justify">……</p>
<p align="justify">….in cases of diagnosis and treatment there are cases where,

  despite a body of professional opinion sanctioning the defendant’s conduct, the

  defendant can properly be held liable for negligence (I am not here considering questions

  of disclosure of risk). In my judgment that is because, in some cases, it cannot be

  demonstrated to the judge’s satisfaction that the body of opinion relied upon is

  reasonable or responsible. In the vast majority of cases the fact that distinguished

  experts in the field are of a particular opinion will demonstrate the reasonableness of

  that opinion. In particular, where there are questions of assessment of the relative risks

  and benefits of adopting a particular medical practice, a reasonable view necessarily

  presupposes that the relative risks and benefits have been weighed by the experts in

  forming their opinions. But if, in a rare case, it can be demonstrated that the

  professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical analysis, the judge is

  entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.</p>
<p align="justify">I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to

  reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert are

  unreasonable. The assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter of clinical

  judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidence. As the

  quotation from Lord Scarman makes clear, it would be wrong to allow such assessment to

  deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of which

  are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a judge can be satisfied that

  the body of expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all that such opinion will not

  provide the benchmark by reference to which the defendant’s conduct falls to be

  assessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">244.    I applied the above test not only in relation to

Dr Tan’s medical advice to Mr Harte (as seen earlier), but also to Dr Tan’s

medical diagnosis of Mr Harte’s varicocele condition, all aspects of his surgery and,

not forgetting the no less important area, his post-operative patient care.</p>
<p align="justify">245.    To prove that Dr Tan was negligent in his

surgery, the plaintiff relied on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur. </i>His counsel

referred me to the following passages from Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol 33:

Negligence, para 664 –668:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Under the doctrine <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, a plaintiff establishes a

  prima facie case of negligence where (1) it is not possible for him to prove precisely

  what was the relevant act or omission which set in train the events leading to the

  accident and (2) on the evidence as it stands at the relevant time it is more likely than

  not that the effective cause of the accident was some act or omission of the defendant or

  of someone for whom the defendant is responsible, which act or omission constitutes a

  failure to take proper care for the plaintiff’s safety. There must be reasonable

  evidence of negligence. However, when the thing which causes the accident <u>is shown to

  be under the management of the defendant</u> or his employees, and <u>the accident is such

  as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use

  proper care</u>, if affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the

  defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.</p>
<p align="justify">..</p>
<p align="justify">Even though the matter is not one of common experience, and where an

  unexplained accident occurs from a thing under the defendant’s control, and medical

  or other expert evidence shows that such accidents would not happen if proper care were

  used, there is at least evidence of negligence for the court. </p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify"><u>Where the plaintiff successfully alleges <i>res ipsa locquitur</i>

  its effect is to furnish evidence of negligence on which a court is free to find for the

  plaintiff.</u></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">246.    I do not think that the above maxim has any

application here. The plaintiff’s fall in the toilet unfortunately has crept into the

equation and is capable <i>per se</i> of causing bilateral atrophy. The fall is something

beyond the management and control of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. It is not for the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant to prove that the fall caused the damage. So long he shows that there are other

probable causes (other than his surgery) for the atrophy, without proving which is in fact

responsible for the damage, the principle of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> can no longer help

the plaintiff, who always has the legal burden to prove that Dr Tan had breached his duty

of care towards him.</p>
<p align="justify">247.    At this juncture, it bears remembering that an

allegation of clinical negligence stemming from incompetence or malpractice amounts to an

attack on the professional standing and reputation of a doctor. Hence, the charge of

negligence against that doctor is necessarily of a serious nature. The standard of proof

required for matters of such gravity has been laid down by the Court of Appeal decision in

<i>Hucks v Cole</i> (1968) 112 Sol Jo 483 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A charge of professional negligence against a medical man was a serious

  charge, on a different footing to a charge of negligence against a motorist or an

  employer. The reason is because the consequences for the professional man are far more

  grave. A finding of negligence affects his standing and reputation. It impairs the

  confidence which his clients have in him. The burden of proof is correspondingly greater.

  The principle applies that: ‘In proportion as the charge is grave, so ought the proof

  to be clear’: see <i>Hornal v Neubergger Products Ltd</i> [1957] 1 QB 247.</p>
<p align="justify">Another difference lies in the fact that, with the best will in the

  world, things do sometimes go amiss in surgical operations or medical treatment. A

  striking illustration was <i>Roe v Minister of Health</i> [1954] 2 QB 66. So a doctor is

  not to be held negligent simply because something goes wrong. It is not right to invoke

  against him the maxim <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> save in an extreme case. He is not liable

  for mischance or misadventure. Nor is he liable for an error of judgment. He is not liable

  for choosing one course out of two which may be open to him, or for following one school

  of thought rather than another. He is liable only if he falls below the standard of a

  reasonably competent practitioner in his field – so much so that his conduct may

  fairly be held to be – I will not say deserving of censure, but, at any rate,

  inexcusable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">248.    However, I think the above test laid down in <i>Hucks

v Cole</i> does not apply to the initial fact-finding, or the proof of causal factors or

causation, which ordinarily remains on the civil test of a balance of probability in any

case. After establishing the causal factors, there is still the next step of proving the

breach of the doctor’s duty of care, which is the foundation of the charge against

the doctor for his negligence. For this next step, I believe the principle stated in <i>Huck

v Cole</i> must be kept in view: ‘<i>In proportion as the charge is grave, so ought <b>the

proof to be clear</b>.’</i> Therefore the fact that something has gone wrong during

surgery is not <i>per se </i>indicative of negligence. The mere fact of a complication

occurring does not necessarily mean that the surgeon has fallen below the accepted

standard of care of a reasonably competent surgeon. The question always has to be whether

the proven facts are reasonably capable of an inference of negligence, where there is no

direct evidence of negligence.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>My Analysis</b></p>
<p align="justify">249.    To begin with, it is wrong to think that both

testes of the plaintiff have been completely infarcted or are now made up of dead tissue

only. Dr Notley himself said that the biopsies done some months after the surgery showed

that parts of the testes survived. He had no doubt that other parts of the testes had also

survived up to a point. Dr Schlegel even said that Mr Harte’s testes were probably

one of the best in a man who has non-obstructive azoospermia with reference to the results

of the testicular biopsy done on 21 October 1998. This clearly is a case of partial

atrophy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(a) Infection as a cause of atrophy</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">250.    Subclinical infection (especially if it is

inside the testis) is possible as infection is always a possibility after any surgery.

Infection causing testicular failure can be a contributory cause. A swollen scrotum the

size of a grapefruit can be the result of infection. But A/Prof Foo did not think that

infection could cause testicular atrophy unless it was a very bad infection, in which case

there would be pus and fever and the rest of the symptoms. Dr Jimmy Beng also concluded

that the ‘hyalinization’ found was inconsistent with an infection. With no

evidence of pus and fever and with evidence of ‘hyalinization’, I can safely

rule out infection as a possible cause of the atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(b) Was the Scrotal approach adopted?</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">251.    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Dr Tan

had essentially used the scrotal approach in his operation on Mr Harte.</p>
<p align="justify">252.    The old-fashioned scrotal approach normally

involved incision at the scrotum itself. Dr Notley condemned the scrotal approach as being

dangerous because it produced a high incidence of testicular infarction. Those using the

scrotal approach would operate and ligate at the level of the pampiniform plexus network

of veins before they coalesce into the vasal veins and other sets of veins. The surgeon

might not know which were the important veins to leave behind and the minimum number that

ought to be left behind unligated. Thus, the vasal veins and tributaries at the

pampiniform plexus were likely to be divided as well. According to Dr Notley, the scrotal

approach had since been abandoned because of these reasons. </p>
<p align="justify">253.    However, Dr Notley’s explanation of the

dangers of the scrotal approach did not accord with the reasons given at page 1364 of

‘Campbell’s Urology’ 7<sup>th</sup> Edition where it stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the early 1900s, an open scrotal approach was employed, involving

  the mass ligation and excision of the varicosed plexus of veins. At the level of the

  scrotum, however, the pampiniform plexus of veins is intimately <u>entwined with the

  coiled testicular artery</u>. Therefore, scrotal operations are to be avoided because <u>damage

  to the arterial supply</u> of the testis frequently results in testicular atrophy and

  further impairment of spermatogenesis and fertility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">254.    I was thus given the wrong impression by Dr

Notley that overligation of veins was the cause of the frequent incidence of atrophy in

such scrotal operations when in fact it was the severance or damage of the arteries

entwined with the veins ligated and excised at the scrotal level that led to the problem.</p>
<p align="justify">255.    In any event, I find no evidence in this case

that Dr Tan operated at the scrotum level using this old-fashioned method. Photographs P25

to 28 show the location of the incision at both sides, which were over the external

inguinal ring. He did not deliver the testis out of the wound in both operations. He

delivered up part of the spermatic cord to enable him to proceed with the vein ligation

and division at the level consistent with the subinguinal approach. I find no evidence

that the vein ligations and divisions were at the level of the pampiniform plexus network

of veins. I believe there would be sufficient spermatic cord length above the pampiniform

plexus network of veins for him to retrieve out of the skin incisions to perform the

subinguinal varicocelectomy.</p>
<p align="justify">256.    The fact that Dr Tan ligated a total of 11 and 7

veins on the right side and left side respectively does not indicate that he must have

ligated at the pampiniform plexus. A/Prof Li said that at the subinguinal area, one might

find on the average 15 to 20 internal veins already, and perhaps 5 or 6 external veins.

There would also be some cremasteric veins. The medical literature tendered also

recognises that there are more veins encountered with the subinguinal approach. So the

total number of veins ligated by Dr Tan is not, in my view, inconsistent with an operation

at the subinguinal level.</p>
<p align="justify">257.    Neither were the two skin incisions too high or

too low that it was not possible for Dr Tan to do a subinguinal surgery. Upon being shown

the photographs of the skin incisions on Mr Harte, A/Prof Li said that with those skin

cuts, one would definitely be able to do a subinguinal surgery because the skin was mobile

and the patient was relatively fat. The skin incision could be easily moved to the area

where the actual operation was intended. The operation in the deeper areas of the body

need not be directly at the location where the skin incision had been made.</p>
<p align="justify">258.    No evidence is led by the plaintiff to show that

Dr Tan’s skin incision at the level for Mr Harte is something that a reasonably

competent urologist will not do for a subinguinal variocelectomy. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(c) The operation</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">259.    In this case, there is no clear evidence proving

that Dr Tan was negligent in his operation. As counsel for the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant

rightly pointed out, there is no concrete evidence like a swab or an instrument left

behind. The alleged negligence is based wholly on an inference that Dr Tan must have

botched up the operation because atrophy has occurred.</p>
<p align="justify">260.    The main theory advanced by counsel for the

plaintiff initially was that Dr Tan had tied up too many veins. That theory was demolished

by Dr Schlegel, the plaintiff’s own witness. Dr Schlegel agreed that if Dr Tan had,

at the level of the subinguinal surgery, cut 11 veins on the right side, and 7 on the

left, leaving the vasal vein intact and with no inadvertent damage to other veins or

arteries, then there would not be any vascular damage to the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">261.    In fact, Dr Schlegel had in his professional

papers suggested an even more aggressive varicocelectomy method where nearly all the veins

except for the vasal veins are ligated. Dr Notley also stated that ‘<i>modern

operations designed to excise all the spermatic veins, both internal and external, and

even the gubernacular veins rarely create this disastrous complication [i.e. testicular

infarction]. The crucial veins to be spared are those accompanying the vas.</i>’

Since I accept Dr Tan’s evidence that he had not ligated the vasal veins, it is thus

most unlikely that he had infarcted Mr Harte’s testicles.</p>
<p align="justify">262.    Even if it were true that keeping just the set

of vasal veins turned out to be inadequate for venous drainage in Mr Harte’s case,

and the testicles consequently infarcted leading to atrophy, I still cannot regard Dr Tan

as having been negligent because operating in that manner is recognised by eminent and

reputable urologists such as Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein, including Dr Notley, as an

acceptable practice. I would regard their views as representing a responsible body of

professional opinion. I cannot see how Dr Tan could be said to have breached his duty of

care to his patient by using such a widely recognised and accepted technique. A/Prof Li

also said that the standard practice is to ligate as many veins as possible but leave the

vasal veins intact. His is the view of yet another equally eminent and distinguished

urologist.</p>
<p align="justify">263.    Counsel for the plaintiff went on in his

submission to analyse the countless ways in which Dr Tan could have misused the Babcock

forceps and damaged the arteries or the vasal veins. There is also the added allegation of

insufficient optical magnification by Dr Tan, implying that he did not see very well

during his operation. As I have said before, they remain as theoretical possibilities,

which do not carry much weight without some substantive evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">264.    Mr Lek, counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants, made a valiant attempt in his submission to explain the unusual, consecutive

negligence of Dr Tan for the varicocelectomy operation on each side as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    Dr Tan made the skin incision at the same level

  as Dr Dubin who used the inguinal method. As Dr Tan opted for the subinguinal approach, he

  had to reach quite deep down (4 to 5 cm) in the case of the obese plaintiff in order to

  reach and pull out the spermatic cord.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    A/Prof Li had said that it would be more

  difficult to deliver up the spermatic cord for a fat man and the surgeon would have to dig

  deeper to get to the cord. </p>
<p align="justify">(c)    At times, there might not be enough cord length

  to bring the whole spermatic cord up to the surface or the skin level and in that

  situation the surgery would have to be done within the wound. </p>
<p align="justify">(d)    In the process either of operating on the cord

  within the wound or in attempting the difficult procedure of delivering the spermatic cord

  out of the wound, he injured the testicular arteries, which led to ischaemic injury to the

  testicles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">265.    Mr Lek thus submitted that since Dr Tan used the

same technique on both sides, that was why testicular artery damage occurred on both sides

resulting in atrophy in both testicles at the same time.</p>
<p align="justify">266.    On closer examination of A/Prof Li’s

evidence, I find that the greater difficulty of retrieval of the spermatic cord was said

in the context of a fat man versus a thinner man and the depth of retrieval. He did not

say that there was real difficulty <i>per se</i>. On the contrary, A/Prof Li testified

that actually there is no difficulty in pushing up the testis, through the inguinal area

to deliver it out of the wound as the testis is mobile and there are no muscles in the way

of the delivery. It is not at all traumatic on the spermatic cord to pull the whole testis

out. However, the operation takes more time. Photographs in D44 show a varicocele

operation where the entire testicle with part of its spermatic cord had been delivered

completely out of the wound. Photographs in D43 show a typical varicocele operation on the

spermatic cord where the testicle was not delivered out of the wound. A/Prof Li confirmed

that there is also no difficulty pushing up the testis halfway without actually delivering

the testis, in order to expose just the part of the spermatic cord that the surgeon

intends to perform his varicocelectomy. Thus, the premise of Mr Lek’s submission is

not sound.</p>
<p align="justify">267.    Mr Lek in his cross-examination elicited from

A/Prof Li numerous possibilities on how accidental testicular artery injury can occur:

clamping it, tying it, twisting it, pinching it, or burning it during diathermy. A/Prof Li

accepted that these are the usual risks of surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">268.    In his submissions, Mr Lek then referred me to

the following articles to emphasize the importance of safeguarding the testicular artery,

damage of which can cause atrophy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) <b>Surgery of Male Infertility by Marc Goldstein, Chapter 18 -

  Varicocelectomy: General Considerations</b> - The incidence of testicular artery injury

  after inguinal varicocelectomy is unknown. Case reports, however, suggest that this

  complication may be more common than realized. It can result in testicular atrophy and, if

  the operation is performed bilaterally, azoospermia may ensue in a previously oligospermic

  man. Furthermore, Starzl and his transplant group reported a 14 per cent incidence of

  testicular atrophy and a 70 per cent incidence of testicular atrophy and a 70 percent

  incidence of hydrocele formation when the spermatic cord was divided and the vas and vasal

  vessels were preserved. (My Comment: In Mr Harte’s case, there was no division of the

  spermatic cord, unlike the cases cited by Starzl which involved severance of the other

  arteries at the time of division of the whole spermatic cord where these arteries run

  alongside.)</p>
<p align="justify">(2) <b>Testicular Artery Ramification Within The Inguinal Canal by

  Jarow, Ogle, Kaspar and Hopkins -</b> Testicular arterial anatomy has great clinical

  importance due to the application of this knowledge to testicular surgery. The capability

  of collateral arterial blood supply through the deferential and cremasteric arteries to

  support the testis has been used in patients who require transection of the main

  testicular vessels during orchiopexy for crytorchidism. However, in some cases this

  collateral blood supply does not appear to be sufficient to maintain the testis and

  atrophy ensues. (My Comment: Again, this is not applicable because there is an intentional

  division by transection of the testicular artery during the operation, which did not take

  place in our case. Dr Tan had not cut any of the arteries during his operation.)</p>
<p align="justify">(3) <b>Microsurgical Inguinal Varicocelectomy with delivery of the

  Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing Technique -</b> Testicular atrophy and azoospermia

  following varicocelectomy are risks associated with ligation of the testicular artery.

  Preservation of the testicular artery is particularly critical when operating upon a

  solitary testis, or in children and adolescents on whom the operation is being performed

  prophylactically. (My Comment: This is also inapplicable because the article refers to

  ligation of the testicular artery, which did not happen here.)</p>
<p align="justify">(4) <b>Anatomical Approach to Varicocelcctomy: Schlegel and Goldstein -</b>

  Inadvertent injury to a testicular artery is easily possible with inadequate care or

  optical magnification. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">269.    In my view, Mr Lek tried to elevate the

consequences of inadvertent injury to the testicular artery to that of a <u><b>deliberate

severance (i.e. total damage)</b></u> of a testicular artery as a part of the operation,

where the risk of atrophy would naturally be higher. Mr Lek appeared to be suggesting that

Dr Tan accidentally damaged the testicular artery on both sides so severely that it

amounted to a complete severance of a testicular artery first on one side followed later

by the other side because of insufficient optical magnification. To my mind, this is not

only remote but also highly speculative. Am I to believe that Dr Tan was operating almost

blindfolded figuratively speaking, or he was so very heavy handed during both operations,

tugging at the arteries more than he should, thereby causing severe traction injury to the

arteries? I do not.</p>
<p align="justify">270.    Whilst on this point, I tend to agree with

A/Prof Foo that the traction force when using the Babcock forceps to grip and pull up the

spermatic cord through the skin incision is not that rough and severe to cause injury to

the artery. A/Prof Foo explained that the Babcock instrument is constructed in such a way

that it does not cause severe injury to the tissue generally unless the surgeon is very

rough or heavy handed and does things without care.</p>
<p align="justify">271.    For the purpose of analysis, let me assume the

worse that Dr Tan, despite all the care taken, had accidentally damaged the testicular

artery fairly severely. Impairment of blood flow would then result. But I have to remind

myself that there are three arteries (i.e. internal spermatic artery, artery of the vas

deferens and cremasteric artery) supplying blood to each testicle. According to Dr

Schlegel, the testicle will survive and in fact function pretty well where there is damage

to just one artery. Exhibit D 13 confirms what Dr Schlegel said. The diagram there shows

the free anastomosis between the three arteries supplying each testis. To accidentally and

severely damage all three arteries which are not co-located together at one place on each

testicle (i.e. making a total of six arteries to be damaged) to get to the disastrous

stage of bilateral atrophy seems highly improbable.</p>
<p align="justify">272.    This is also borne out by Dr Notley’s

observation that it is quite difficult to infarct the testicle because of its profuse

arterial supply and the profuse anastomosis.</p>
<p align="justify">273.    Furthermore, if the arteries or the veins were

ligated, A/Prof Foo explained that there should not be any scrotal haematoma. I agree.

A/Prof Foo’s evidence makes logical sense because in that situation, there would be

no blood flowing into the organ to create any haematoma, whether intratesticular or

extratesticular. Whatever theory postulated must fit the facts. When it does not as in

this case, the theory must be discarded. Since there was an intratesticular haematoma, the

likelihood of inadvertent ligation of all the arteries or arterial damage resulting in

their complete blockage has to be ruled out.</p>
<p align="justify">274.    The CDUS result in September 1997 showing

perfusion indicated that the arteries were still functioning to some extent, as there was

still blood flow. This clearly dispels the hypothesis of inadvertent ligation or severe

damage and blockage of the arteries.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><i><b>(d) The operation technique used</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">275.    In my judgment, the operation technique used by

Dr Tan cannot be faulted. The subinguinal approach is recognised and supported by a number

of medical papers tendered, which I find it unnecessary to enumerate. Dr Schlegel had

agreed that if Dr Tan had done what he said he did, there would be no atrophy. Dr Schlegel

accepted that the procedure used by Dr Tan as described in his affidavit generally fits

the standard of care for treatment of a varicocele. Dr Schlegel did not say that the

optical magnification used by Dr Tan during his surgery was insufficient or that too many

veins were ligated.</p>
<p align="justify">276.    All the experts agree that bilateral testicular

atrophy after varicocelectomy is unheard of. Atrophy on one side has been reported but is

extremely rare.</p>
<p align="justify">277.    There is no credible evidence produced to

persuade me that Dr Tan’s surgery for this simple operation fell below the standard

of care expected of any responsible and competent urologist surgeon.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(e) Traction injury</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">278.    Dr Tan opined that Mr Harte suffered both

contusion and traction injuries, the latter being more serious. In a varicocelectomy

operation, the area of the spermatic cord cut open is mechanically weakened. When sudden

traction force is applied, the resulting damage is thus even more severe than what it

would otherwise be. See illustrations D 19, 22 and 23 by Dr Tan. His explanation for the

mechanism of the traction injury was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The small veins external to the testicle will tear. Blood will leak

  into the scrotum and cause an extratesticular or scrotal haematoma and not an

  intratesticular haematoma. The rate of scrotal swelling depends on the size and number of

  veins damaged. The swelling may take up to a day in Mr Harte’s case to be noticeable.

  A/Prof Foo also believes that traction injury will only cause an extratesticular

  haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Although arteries are mechanically stronger than veins,

  nevertheless excessive stretching can still tear the fragile inner wall lining of the

  arteries. The tearing causes spasm and contraction of the artery. Blood clots build up at

  the tear region, narrowing the arteries. Eventually that leads to thrombosis at the choke

  points. As blood flow slows down, the testes become ischaemic. If the blood supply is

  completely cut off, the testicle will devascularise but it will not lead to any swelling

  or intratesticular haematoma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">279.    However, Dr Notley had not heard of a traction

injury. He had not seen one. He did not think that it was recorded in the medical

literature.</p>
<p align="justify">280.    Dr Schlegel too had not come across a traction

injury to the spermatic cord vessels during a varicocele surgery. In his opinion, as long

as the muscles were around the spermatic cord, using the Babcock forceps to pull out the

spermatic cord was not likely to cause enough injury to the blood vessels to damage them.

After the blood vessels were separated from the muscles, then the exposed vessels would

become vulnerable to avulsion or traction injuries.</p>
<p align="justify">281.    A/Prof Foo also said that he was not aware of

anything in the medical literature that supported a proposition that a traction injury to

the spermatic cord would lead to eventual testicular atrophy. A/Prof Foo explained that an

intratesticular haematoma caused by crushing of the testicles might be aggravated by

traction injury to the arteries, which could at the same time compromise the blood supply

to the testicles. Thus, the traction injury could contribute to the atrophy of the testes.

However, in his opinion, the crushing injury was a more significant contributory than the

traction injury.</p>
<p align="justify">282.    A/Prof Li felt that one would need to pull

extremely hard on the testes before there could be any traction injury to the spermatic

cord. Not having come across this, he did not appear enamoured by this possibility. I

share his sentiments.</p>
<p align="justify">283.    Based on the opinions of the experts, I come to

the conclusion that traction injury is not likely to cause any rupture of the capillary

vessels within the testicular tissue and hence, internal intratesticular haemorrhage from

traction injury is improbable. With continuous stretching according to A/Prof Foo, the

internal spermatic fascia will be the first to give way, followed by the veins and

lymphatics, then the arteries, the vas deferens and lastly the nerves (which are all

within the spermatic cord). This shows that the arteries are much stronger than the

internal spermatic fascia, veins and lymphatics. Hence, it is not likely for the arteries

to give way so readily.</p>
<p align="justify">284.    It is of course possible that a very large

traction force can still sever or damage all 3 arteries to the testes on each side to

cause bilateral atrophy through devascularisation. But I think that possibility is remote.

The blood flowing out <b>under pressure</b> from the ruptured arteries will quickly

distend the scrotum extratesticularly, thereby creating a big haematoma, which with time

must cause some discolouration on his swollen scrotum. Mr Harte should perhaps be having a

fairly dark coloured bluish black or reddish purplish scrotum with significant swelling by

the time he left the hospital. But these were not the symptoms observed. There was no

significant discolouration and/or swelling to move Mr Harte to raise an alarm before his

discharge at 7.00 p.m. Neither was there evidence that the internal spermatic fascia was

ripped or that the lymphatics were torn resulting in a substantial hydrocele formation. I

thus rule out traction injury to the arteries as a cause of the devascularisation of the

testes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><b>(f) Contusion injury</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">285.    The plaintiff’s main contentions against

the contusion theory were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    the absence of abrasion and bruising of the

  scrotal skin and penis;</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    the absence of pain and swelling before discharge

  from the hospital;</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    the absence of a black coloured scrotum;</p>
<p align="justify">(d)    the presence of a bright red swollen scrotum

  turning to a reddish purplish colour on the morning after the fall;</p>
<p align="justify">(e)    the extraordinary force needed to contuse the

  testes before one can get bilateral testicular atrophy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">286.    Before dealing with the above contentions, I

will closely examine how the mechanism of contusion can result in pain, scrotal swelling,

intratesticular haematoma and finally atrophy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>i. Intratesticular haematoma and atrophy</u></p>
<p align="justify">287.    With his schematic diagrams D18, D20 and D21, Dr

Tan illustrated how the contusion injury could have occurred.</p>
<p align="justify">288.    Dr Tan testified that contusion injury without

rupture of testicles would lead to oedema (a condition characterized by an excess of

watery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body), and also internal

haemorrhage of the small capillary vessels within the testes. The accumulation of bleeding

from the capillary vessels causes swelling, expansion and rise in pressure. An

intratesticular haematoma forms within the tunica albuginea, which results in raised

intratesticular pressure thereby shutting off the microcirculation. See illustrations D 9

and D 15 by Dr Tan. The rate at which oedema and swelling occur depends on how severe the

contusion injury is and on how rapidly the blood flows into the testicles. I agree.</p>
<p align="justify">289.    The post-operative ultrasound scan of the

testicles showed micro-calcifications and a patchy appearance, which were not present

before and could be due to the intratesticular haemorrhage or intratesticular haematoma.

The presence of perfusion suggested that the arterial supply to the testes was not

compromised.</p>
<p align="justify">290.    A/Prof Foo was referred to an article: <i>Blunt

Scrotal Trauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management by Munter and Faleski</i>.

He was asked whether he would agree with the fact that a contusion without a testicular

rupture seldom leads to morbidity. A/Prof Foo said that there were various degrees of

contusion from mild to severe. But a mild one alone would not cause significant damage to

the testes but a severe one combined with other factors would. He emphasized that in

medicine one usually faces multiple causes and effects contributing to a final result.

There is not just one factor to explain a phenomenon. I have to agree wholeheartedly. In

his opinion, the severe contusion had contributed to the testicular atrophy. </p>
<p align="justify">291.    A/Prof Foo testified that compressing a taut

testis due to venous congestion or pressure buildup after the varicocele surgery would

cause more damage. Intratesticular haematoma can also result from pressure damage to the

testicular tissue within the testis itself.</p>
<p align="justify">292.    In my opinion, the fact that the testicles

became more congested after the operation due to the ligation of several varicocele veins

was certainly a contributory factor. I fully agree that squeezing a congested taut

testicle as opposed to an uncongested one is much more likely to cause internal

microvascular and microstructural damage to the testicular tissue and capillary blood

vessels. It is nothing more than pure common sense.</p>
<p align="justify">293.    Apart from such direct microvascular and

microstructural testicular tissue damage due to contusion, I am of the opinion that

subsequent development of a significant haematoma, particularly an intratesticular

haematoma, can also lead to atrophy due to the buildup of pressure that may compress the

veins to an extent that the venous outflow of the testes becomes seriously impaired, and

correspondingly the venous inflow too. I find support for this in P29: Clinical Negligence

by Powers and Harris 3<sup>rd</sup> Edn at para 41.98 at p 1388.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>ii. Pain</u></p>
<p align="justify">294.    I generally accept the following explanation by

A/Prof Foo on the mechanism of pain and the pain symptoms resulting from intratesticular

haemorrhage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A: …let’s assume that …bleeding starts in the testes but

  the bleeding is slow, you know, it accumulates slowly and at that point in time, within a

  few hours, they may not have any severe pain but only subsequently, it can cause serious

  damage to the testicles. It’s the same in the head. We have seen patients with head

  injury, just a knock and then they fainted, so call, and then when they get up, they look

  very well. But sometimes they go to the A &amp; E, they still look well but when they were

  sent home, you know, he can become unconscious and can even die from that because at the

  point of impact, bleeding occurs inside. But when the bleeding is minimal, it will not

  cause pressure on the brain but after a few hours, when it caused more pressure, patient

  becomes unconscious. It is a similar analogy in the testicles which the tissues inside

  cannot expand. So, initially, we might think that it is a minor injury. Even, you know,

  after a few days, it may not be detected. But only when it starts to manifest, you know,

  when patient becomes unconscious, then a scan or what may suspect there is intra-cranial

  haematoma. And it needs urgent operation to drain the haematoma to save the brain;

  similarly to the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So are you saying that the pain comes along when the tunica

  is stretched?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, so initially there may not—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So if it is not stretched ---</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: ---be much pain.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: --but there is bleeding?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, if there is bleeding, it may not have much pain at that

  time. </p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: It may not have pain. So the nerve detects the stretching,

  is it, or what?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: The nerve may—</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: How does the nerve mechanism and the pain mechanism work?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: The stretched nerve may numb the part a bit. So at the point

  of impact, he may not have the pain and subsequently, the pain may be due to stretching of

  the tunica covering the testicle. But this will take a few hours to develop. So when the

  patient goes home at that time, you know, the increased pressure in the testes may not be

  that great to cause him a lot of pain. But, as he himself said, after he went home, he

  started to develop more and more pain, and tried to contact Dr Tan and Dr Tan somehow he

  doesn’t get the message and—this can explain the whole theory.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Doctor, this—what you’ve just described, is it consistent

  with the traction or contusion injury?</p>
<p align="justify">A: As I said, both, you see. The traction injury will injure the

  lymphatics, the veins, and possibly the artery and then the nerves. And that will explain

  the extratesticular haematoma. And that may explain why at the point of impact, you know,

  because of the nerve is injured, he may not feel severe pain at the point of impact. Now,

  the contusion injury within the testicle will not cause pain initially but it will cause

  pain subsequently, after he goes home. As the pressure builds up within the testicle, he

  will feel the pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">295.    A/Prof Foo agreed that pain generally increases

with the size of the testicular swelling. But if the patient has continuous pain, the

patient may become desensitised to it after a while. The nerves become slightly numb. The

pain felt may be less but this varies from patient to patient.</p>
<p align="justify">296.    I reiterate that the pain arising from moderate

contusion may well be confused with the dull pain from the normal congestion that Mr Harte

experienced in his previous varicocelectomy operation. The pain from the surgery itself

may mask the pain arising from microvascular damage due to contusion. For all the reasons

given earlier, I do not believe that Mr Harte could readily distinguish between them. I am

therefore not surprised that he did not complain of any pain, although he experienced some

swelling, discomfort and dull pain in his scrotum when he was leaving the hospital.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>iii. Swelling – extratesticular and intratesticular</u></p>
<p align="justify">297.    A/Prof Foo testified that if only one of the

three arteries to the testis was ligated or one artery was damaged, the swelling would

take longer to develop. Should there be a complete shutdown of blood supply due to

ligation of all arteries, atrophy would occur but there would not be any swelling because

there could never be any venous congestion without blood inflow.</p>
<p align="justify">298.    However, if the veins leaving the testes were

tied up instead, there would be venous congestion causing increased pressure and swelling

in the testes. Should the tunica be stretched to its maximum, no more blood would ever

flow in. This would similarly cause atrophy due to shutting down of the blood supply.

Therefore, the rate of intratesticular swelling depends on the number of veins and/or

arteries ligated.</p>
<p align="justify">299.    As for extratesticular (i.e. scrotal) swelling,

A/Prof Foo alluded to this other possibility of blood and fluid collecting in the

extratesticular region. He explained the source of this blood and fluid as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Witness: From the---if there is traction injury, the bleeding, that is,

  the lymphatic will be torn, the vein will be torn, and the bleeding from the traction

  injury damaging the lymphatic and vein will leak around the testicle. The crushing injury

  will cause bleeding inside the testicle, so you can expect both extratesticular haematoma

  as well as intratesticular haematoma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">300.    A/Prof Foo agreed that swelling could also

result from an infarcted testicle, howsoever caused (for instance by devascularisation,

venous congestion, blunt trauma or torsion):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: .. Doctor, if a testicle is infarcted, OK, would there be swelling?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Depends on the time sequence. Initially, there may be swelling but

  subsequently, you know, after a few weeks, a few months, it becomes in fact atrophied,

  becomes smaller.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: I see. So initially swelling, but after a few months, few weeks, it

  becomes smaller.</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: As the swelling grows, would there be pain?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes, your Honour.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: And this pain would increase until the swelling reached its peak?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Generally speaking, if the patient does not sort of get used to the

  pain, sometimes after a period you become refractory to the pain,….. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">301.    Dr Notley gave a comprehensive account of how

physical damage can be caused within the testes from compression of the testicles with

sufficient force to produce atrophy in the longer term. He said that the blood vessels in

the scrotum are numerous and profuse and will be damaged in just the same way as the

vessels within the testis. The vessels will be contused and probably torn and split. The

only way the injury can produce testicular atrophy is by disruption of the blood vessels.

The capillaries, arterials and venials haemorrhage because the testicle itself is crushed

and so the vessels are broken, disrupted, torn, split or pulled apart. These are

microscopic blood vessels. They are very fine and very delicate. If the testicle is

distorted to pass through a small gap, those vessels are going to be subjected to shearing

forces, which are going to tear them, pull them and break them. So as they bleed, one gets

an intratesticular haematoma. I agree thus far with Dr Notley.</p>
<p align="justify">302.    The scrotal skin also suffers from the same

pressure. The ‘very profuse subcutaneous vascular plexus in the scrotum’ cannot

escape damage as well, and the patient will then have an external as well as an internal

haematoma. Dr Notley explained that extremely small damage to blood vessels within the

scrotum could produce a spectacular haematoma. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Witness: ..I mean, it’s just not a reasonable assumption to say

  that you can have sufficient force supplied to the testicle to disrupt the testicle and it

  will not damage the testicular vessels. You only need …an <u><b>extremely small

  damage</b></u> to blood vessels within the scrotum <u><b>to produce a spectacular

  haematoma</b></u>. I know this from long experience, I do vasectomies through very small

  incisions, perhaps, half-centimetre incisions, and I’ve, from time to time, produced

  extremely major scrotal haematoma. So, you don’t need very much. It spreads.

  ……. if I do the same sort of injury to a blood vessel in the scrotum, quite a

  small one, because it is free and elastic and floats in the breeze, a small bleed will not

  be confined ….It would tend to spread round the scrotum. So you will get a

  decent-size haematoma even with quite a small local injury. So I can’t accept that

  you can pass a gentleman’s testicles, ..whole scrotum, through a pair of rollers or a

  roller and a smooth rock, which is only 15 millimetres … apart , and sufficient to

  create a crush injury, a compression injury to the testicle, which I agree it’s a

  rather special case, but I cannot accept that it would not damage the scrotal tissue

  sufficiently to produce a haematoma of some size or other which somebody would see, and

  that would happen, that’s, haematoma will become visible within five or six hours, in

  my contention. I just do not believe you can do that sufficient to crush a testicle and

  not get a scrotal haematoma. It is inconsistent, to my knowledge of anatomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">303.    Therefore, it is not surprising at all if a

contusion results in a large scrotal or extratesticular haematoma. In fact, that is

usually an expected consequence of contusion. I can readily understand that. But I wanted

to find a credible and reliable explanation for the large extratesticular haematoma if the

cause was wholly surgical in nature. That was where I became most curious. So I asked Dr

Notley to explain what one could expect to see when there was purely venous congestion of

the testicles (assuming an overligation by Dr Tan during his operation) but with no

physical injury sustained to the scrotum and testes (during the fall). Why was it that Mr

Harte could develop such a spectacular swollen scrotum? It was most puzzling.</p>
<p align="justify">304.    Based on the all the evidence before me, it

became fairly clear that a large extratesticular or scrotal haematoma would not happen <i>per

se</i> from the ligation or overligation and division of the veins or surgical damage to

the arteries resulting in a shut down of the blood flow to the testes. That seemed to rule

out the plaintiff’s theory. If so, what reasonable biological explanation could there

be for Mr Harte’s large scrotal or extratesticular swelling, if indeed the plaintiff

was right that there was no contusion injury after all.</p>
<p align="justify">305.    Then Dr Notley explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Witness: Well, if I may explain? The testicle swells but it probably

  doesn’t swell to more than about twice its normal size because of the tight tunica

  albuginea. You know, that’s what I think we all agree. But, by then, the scrotum has

  within it an acutely congested, abnormal, inflamed, angry, bad, dying testicle. The body

  reacts to any tissue like that by producing the classical inflammatory reaction which is

  the body’s response to any injury, be it bacteria, be it viral, be it trauma, burns,

  hit it with a hammer, scrape it with a piece of barbed wire. The blood vessels locally

  will dilate, the capillaries, you remember the little tiny tubes that we have between the

  end of the arteries and before the veins, where all the activity in the tissues takes

  place, where all the chemical activity, the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxides takes

  place, they become permeable as a result of the inflammatory reaction being produced by

  some hormones, which I'm afraid I cannot remember the name of, but they become permeable

  so that the fluid content of the blood leaks out into the tissues, that’s the

  lymphatic fluid, but greatly exaggerated by the increased permeability of the capillaries.

  There is the, at the same time as this, a great increase in the blood supply coming into

  this as a result of the inflammatory response. So you get swelling as a result of the

  exudation that is going on, as part of the body’s normal reaction to a piece of dead

  tissue within it. You get swelling due to the increase of blood flow through it, and

  because there’s an increase in blood flow, you get an increase in heat of the area,

  so you feel hot. You also get an increase in the red colouration because it is oxygenated

  blood that is being passed through these dilated vessels. </p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: But the tunica, isn’t it a fairly impermeable layer?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But we’re not talking about the tunica albuginea.</p>
<p align="justify">…..</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: But I’m concerned with how this swelling is spreading

  to the other parts, you know, the mechanism of it</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: But it is the reaction of the scrotum to this happening within

  it, because within it is a testicle that has been injured, has swollen to twice the size,

  the tunica albuginea will, to a certain extent, be involved in the inflammatory change of

  –</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: You mean that would also swell? That would also be

  inflamed?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: Yes, this will be thickened and exudate will form upon it as a

  result of the infarction, and this is what the scrotum itself will react to. So the chap

  will end up with a big red scrotum after twelve hours or so, which is acutely painful and

  tender to touch. ….After all, the tunica albuginea has all the blood vessels to the

  testicle passing through it. So it is, as it were, like---it’s more like a pin

  cushion, isn’t it, with lots of little holes in it where the blood, the arteries go

  in, the veins come out, so it’s not an impermeable sheet like a polyethylene or

  damp-proof membrane you might care to put in your cellar to keep the water out. It’s

  not like that at all. It’s completely permeable to these things. And, particularly,

  if the blood vessels have been damaged and congested, you will have an exudation coming

  out into the scrotum which will produce this <b><u>local inflammatory reaction</u></b>.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: So that causes the extratesticular swelling?</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: <b><u>That causes the extratesticular swelling, the big

  scrotum</u></b>.</p>
<p align="justify">His Honour: All right.</p>
<p align="justify">Witness: <b><u>So the chap, the next morning, will have a big red, hot,

  painful, scrotum</u></b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">305.    Thus Dr Notley came up with this very attractive

proposition that the resulting testicular infarction from devascularisation led to a

severe inflammation in the morning. So Mr Harte would wake up finding himself with a big,

red, hot, swollen scrotum. Dr Notley thus attributed the large red scrotal swelling <u><b>purely</b></u>

to the inflammation, the cardinal signs of which would manifest within some hours of the

infarction and progress over the next six to twelve hours. In its acute form, inflammation

would be characterised by classical signs of pain (<i>dolor</i>), heat (<i>calor</i>),

redness (<i>rubor</i>), swelling (<i>tumor</i>) and loss of function (<i>function laesa</i>).

This reactive scrotal swelling with pain and reddening would increase the size of the

scrotal swelling progressively over the next 24 hours or so. By then Mr Harte would have a

firm, enlarged, red and painful scrotal swelling which would be tender to touch.</p>
<p align="justify">306.    I have great difficulty accepting that the

body’s reaction to and rejection of a dead pair of testes alone can produce such a

large scrotal swelling without <u><b>an extremely severe</b></u> inflammation, with

infection and pus, and perhaps also accompanying fever of some sort from that infection,

which Mr Harte never had. Further, I find it exceptional that just overnight, the testes

would have died so rapidly, and the body would have reacted so violently and so quickly to

the dead testes, that in just less than about 20 hours, Mr Harte would have developed a

red, hot, very swollen, tender and inflamed scrotum adversely reacting to and rejecting

the pair of dead testes within.</p>
<p align="justify">307.    Although I do accept Dr Notley’s

explanation (which has also been confirmed by other expert witnesses) that a very large

swelling in the nature of a scrotal haematoma can readily form from a minor haemorrhage of

a small blood vessel, nevertheless I think it is quite unlikely for reactionary

inflammation alone from a pair of infarcted dead testicles to produce a large swelling the

size of a mango so quickly (without the aid of a haemorrhaging blood vessel of some kind).</p>
<p align="justify">308.    There is no evidence of him complaining of a

red, hot, swollen and inflamed scrotum. All the evidence I have is a bright red scrotum

turning later into a reddish purplish colour, according to Mrs Harte. I also have the

evidence of Mr Harte that he had a painful scrotum. However, he did not say that his red

and hot scrotum was also tender to the touch, typically expected of badly inflamed or even

septic scrotum. Why should an inflamed bright red scrotum turn to a deeper reddish

purplish colour, and after some 4 days later become a little bluish in colour as observed

by Dr Tan, which is most incomprehensible and totally inconsistent with a bad reactionary

inflammation. I find somehow that a deeper reddish purplish colour, changing to a bluish

colour is more consistent with the appearance of an extratesticular/scrotal haematoma than

a severe reactionary inflammation. Further, the absence of tenderness to touch typically

reflects more of a haematoma than a septic and reactionary inflammation.</p>
<p align="justify">309.    If it was indeed a reactionary inflammation, it

is inconceivable that Mr and Mrs Harte should consider applying ice on his scrotum.

Applying ice is more consistent with an attempt to reduce swelling from a haematoma than

an inflammatory reaction in the scrotum against a pair of dead testes.</p>
<p align="justify">310.    Mrs Harte’s evidence was that her husband

was in pain when Dr Tan prodded his scrotum area. After examining him, Dr Tan said that if

the swelling did not go away, then he would have to draw blood from his scrotum. Dr Tan

explained to them that Mr Harte most likely suffered from a scrotal haematoma. Dr Tan

informed her that there was a blood clot and her impression was that the swelling was due

to this. Again, there was nothing discussed about any severe reactionary inflammation.</p>
<p align="justify">311.    The symptoms and evidence in my view do not fit

Dr Notley’s postulation that the entire reddish swollen scrotum the morning after the

surgery was <u><b>purely</b></u> the result of a reactive scrotal inflammation. I cannot

rule out that there may be <u><b>some</b></u> inflammation giving the reddish colour.

Physical injury may also give rise to inflammation. Blood from ruptured capillary vessels

slowly permeating to the tissues near the skin can also make the scrotum look

‘reddish’. A taut scrotal skin may enhance the colouration. In fact, the

subsequent change to a darker purplish red or reddish purplish colour indicates the

presence of some scrotal haemorrhage. The tinge of blue colour observed by Dr Tan confirms

this.</p>
<p align="justify">312.    Dr Tan’s contemporaneous notes of a ‘<b>scrotal

haematoma</b>’, and the fact that he told Mrs Harte of the presence of ‘<b>dried

blood’</b> in his scrotum reinforce my opinion that there was in fact some

extratesticular haemorrhage, which points towards the existence of a contusion injury. I

shall be examining the evidence of an extratesticular hematoma in more detail later. For

the moment, it suffices to state my view that the extratesticular haemorrhage with the red

blood slowly permeating to the outer layers of the scrotum, and the inflammation arising<i>
</i>from the contusion injury itself, additionally coupled perhaps with some minor

inflammatory reaction at that stage to the gradually dying testes (damaged by a contusion

process as explained earlier) constitute some of the multiple factors swelling Mr

Harte’s scrotum to the size of a mango, and colouring it bright red on the morning

after the surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">313.    An intratesticular haematoma (<u><b>without</b></u>

an accompanying extratesticular haematoma) will obviously not result in a black or

blue-black or dark reddish purplish coloured scrotum. I doubt very much that the colour of

the haematoma within the testes can be seen through the scrotal skin. I reject Dr

Notley’s evidence of ‘black testicles shinning deeply within the scrotum’

to explain the ‘tinge of blue’ colour noted by Dr Tan when he examined Mr Harte

on the fourth day. As the scrotal wall consists of 5 layers, I find it extremely difficult

to accept that the dark coloured infarcted testes can be seen through all these layers to

give it a tinge of blue colour.</p>
<p align="justify">314.    In my opinion, the discolouration of the scrotum

and the changes in colour seen by Mrs Harte and Dr Tan are likely to be associated with

primarily an extratesticular haematoma and secondarily with some inflammation at the same

time. I reject Dr Notley’s evidence that the discolouration seen on the scrotal skin

can possibly reflect the colour of the infarcted and dead pair of black testes. For the

reasons given earlier, I also reject the contention that all contusion injury and

resulting extratesticular haematomas, regardless of severity, must necessarily lead to a

black coloured scrotum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>iv. Extraordinary force not needed</u></p>
<p align="justify">315.    The plaintiff’s experts relied heavily on

the supposition that extraordinary force was needed before any blunt trauma to the

testicles could occur. Dr Schlegel kept referring to the paper "<i>Bilateral

Testicular Atrophy Following Blunt Trauma</i>" by MacDermott and Gray of the

Department of Urology, Royal Infirmary, Bradford to demonstrate that a scrotal haematoma

and bilateral testicular atrophy could only result when the impact forces reached the

order of magnitude of a car falling with its wheels landing on the testicles. To my mind,

it is a gross exaggeration to say that the forces must reach such proportions before they

can cause testicular contusion and bilateral atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">316.    In fact, I find that the comment of the authors

of that article to be most interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In this case, there was <u><b>neither rupture of the tunica albuginea

  nor disruption of the macroscopic blood supply of either testis; indeed the testes

  appeared completely viable at operation.</b></u> The testes and scrotum were, however,

  caught under the revolving car wheel and subjected to a <u><b>compressive force</b></u>.

  This would have been sufficient to cause <u><b>microvascular damage to the testicular

  tissue leading to atrophy</b></u>. This case again illustrates the <u><b>importance of

  microstructural damage in testicular trauma</b></u>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">317.    The doctors there concluded that both testes

were viable after the accident because the tunica albuginea had not been breached and

fresh bleeding was obtained through a short incision made in the tunica albuginea. Yet at

the review 5 months later, both testes were found to have atrophied to pea-sized nodules. <b>Microvascular</b>

damage and <b>microstructural</b> damage from trauma had led to the bilateral testicular

atrophy. This shows how delicate the testes can be since damage at the microlevel can

still lead to devastating results. I do not believe at all that extraordinary force is

necessary in every case having regard to the fact that damage at the microlevel is already

sufficient, given time, to produce testicular atrophy as that case demonstrates.</p>
<p align="justify">318.    This supposition that maximum force is needed to

cause testicular atrophy is debunked by Dr Tay Kah Phuan, a urologist practising at the

Gleneagles Medical Centre and having his own private clinic called K P Tay Urology. He

testified that ‘very minimal trauma when applied very wrongly can result in very

maximal injury’ citing a recent case he treated. He accepted, quite rightly, that as

a general rule, a minimal force would not cause a severe injury but one must never

discount that a minimal force could also cause a maximal injury. This comment is with

reference to the delicate tissues in the scrotum including the testes.</p>
<p align="justify">319.    The brief facts of that recent case are as

follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) A 15 year old Indian boy was accidentally kicked on 7 June 2000 in

  the groin by his younger 13 year old brother whilst they were both asleep together on the

  bed. The boy woke up and noted that he was kicked. His younger brother was still asleep

  and unaware that he had kicked his older brother in the groin. The older boy went back to

  sleep again. In Dr Tay’s opinion, a sleeping 13 year old boy obviously could not have

  kicked very hard.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) On waking up the following morning, 8 June 2000, the boy had some

  pain and some minimal swelling. The pain was not sufficient for him to complain to anyone

  yet.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The swelling progressed. As the swelling increased, the pain

  increased. He also developed a low-grade fever. The father brought him to Dr Ravi, who

  brought the boy and his father to consult Dr Tay just before midnight on 9 June 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Dr Tay examined him on 10 June 2000 (i.e. past midnight and in the

  early hours of the morning). The boy had some discomfort at the lower part of his abdomen.

  Dr Tay found that his scrotum and penis were swollen. His testes were not palpable on both

  sides. He had a scrotal haematoma the size of a small orange and it was ‘dusky

  blue-black’ in colour. This meant that there was a blood clot.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) Ultrasound revealed a normal right testis and a left

  intratesticular haematoma with possible left testicular rupture.</p>
<p align="justify">(f) He was operated on immediately at 0140 hours on 10 June 2000.

  Operative findings revealed a large scrotal haematoma as well as a haematoma on the left

  testis and epididymis with near rupture because of the swelling and the trauma, and

  haemorrhagic infarction of the left testis, epididymis and spermatic cord. He also had a

  haemorrhagic hydrocele. It was a collection of bloodstained fluid in the area outside the

  testis. His left testis was removed. The tunica was not ruptured.</p>
<p align="justify">(g) Histology report stated that there was reddish-black discolouration

  throughout the tissue of the testis. There was extensive congestion. Sections of the

  testis and epididymis under microscopic examination confirmed the presence of extensive

  haemorrhagic infarction consistent with the effects of haematoma induced by trauma. </p>
<p align="justify">(h) Dr Tay said that in blunt trauma like this, one would not usually

  see injury on the skin unless it were to be so extensive as to rupture the skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">320.    Dr Tay drew attention to the histology report

which revealed that <i>‘a few viable seminiferous tubules [were] seen focally,

showing normal spermatogenesis’</i> despite the extensive damage to the boy’s

testis. The fever was reactionary and in response to inflammation. There was extensive

inflammation. To all intents and purposes, the left testis was dead and he had to remove

it. According to Dr Tay, tissue death must occur first before atrophy can set in. After

the tissue dies, it undergoes fibrosis and scarring. Thereafter, it slowly shrinks with

time.</p>
<p align="justify">321.    He said that the boy would have some initial

pain which woke him up but the pain <u>was not severe enough</u> to interrupt his sleep or

for him to beat up his brother so to speak. But on the following day, the boy noted <u>increasing

pain which progressed</u>. It progressed until the following day when he actually went to

tell his father that he was kicked. The pain symptoms from the trauma to the boy’s

scrotum were remarkably similar to Mr Harte’s.</p>
<p align="justify">322.    In Dr Tay’s opinion, it was highly unlikely

that he could have saved the testis even if the boy had come to see him as early as 2

hours after the accident. If it was tissue death because of a crushing injury, it would

take time for the tissue to die, but it would die. In his view, there was nothing much

that the doctor could do. Unlike torsion injury interrupting the blood supply, the surgery

to untwist the testis to restore the blood supply should be done within 6 hours in order

to save it.</p>
<p align="justify">323.    Dr Tay also gave an instance of another patient

with much delayed scrotal swelling and pain after trauma. This was a cyclist wearing tight

lycra pants. When he pulled the bottom of the pants to urinate, his lycra pants slipped

and snapped back, hitting his right testis. He had very little pain and could cycle home.

He noticed pain on his right testis only at night, followed by swelling in the testis a

day later. The pain and swelling subsided but recurred 2 days before seeing Dr Tay. When

Dr Tay examined him a week after the accident, his testis was swollen to nearly double its

size. The right epididymis was thickened and very tender. There was a small hydrocele, a

collection of fluid in the testis. The skin was perfectly fine with no scrotal haematoma.

The ultrasound report revealed a ‘right-sided epididymitis’ (meaning

inflammation of the right epididymis with evidence of ‘marked hyperaemic

changes’) and ‘mild orchitis’ (meaning infection of the testis). This was a

relatively minor trauma according to Dr Tay. It was fortunate that he did not lose his

testis nor suffer atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">324.    Another interesting example given by Dr Tay was

a case he treated many years ago, where a Thai worker had swelling of his testes. There

was no history of trauma that he could tell Dr Tay. He had infection of the testes and

infection of the epididymis. He had spiking fever that went up and down. He was given

injections and antibiotics. About 5 days or a week later, the testes actually eroded

through the scrotum and discharged pus. This anecdote is important, as we shall see later,

as it helps to establish if it was only the intratesticular haematoma plus very severe

reactionary inflammation (without any accompanying scrotal or extratesticular haematoma)

that caused the scrotum to swell to the size it was on the morning after and to continue

to swell to the size of a mango by the 4<sup>th</sup> day. To my mind, that inflammation

must be extremely severe for the reactionary swelling to be the main contributory of the

mango sized scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">325.    I am inclined to believe that it was the

intratesticular haematoma, plus the extratesticular haematoma plus some degree of

inflammation, which together caused the extensive swelling seen in Mr Harte’s

scrotum. One has to bear in mind that the plaintiff never had any fever, which would

naturally be expected for a serious reactionary inflammation. Dr Tay had explained very

succinctly that trauma <i>per se </i>would not cause infection. Trauma <i>per se</i>

causes inflammation. With an inflamed tissue, there is going to be swelling in that

tissue. Then it can become secondarily infected but it will take some time. In the case of

the Indian boy for instance, trauma remains as the primary injury although there can be

secondary reactive inflammation with associated fever.</p>
<p align="justify">326.    I admitted such anecdotal evidence under s 48 of

the Evidence Act, being evidence which might be consistent or inconsistent with the

opinion of the different medical experts including Dr Tay himself in relation to the rate

of swelling, degree of pain felt, severity of the trauma and the extent of testicular

damage. Just as with the other case studies cited in the medical literature admitted into

court, these first hand case studies of Dr Tay are relevant evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">327.    Dr Myint Soe referred me to <i>C v C</i>

reported in Butterworths: Personal Injury Litigation Service (Issue 31) where a tanker

driver used a toilet with a defective seat. The seat came loose, trapping his left

testicle. Later, his left testicle had to be removed. Again, this shows that the force

needed to cause severe injury need not be very large.</p>
<p align="justify">328.    When the example of the Indian boy was put to

Prof Schlegel, he attributed the damage to ‘torsion’ of the testicle, which he

said commonly occurs in young boys. He said that it was not pathologically possible to

tell the difference between torsion and trauma and the results were equally consistent

with both.</p>
<p align="justify">329.    Based on the totality of the evidence, I think

that the infarction in that Indian boy’s left testicle was due to trauma and not

torsion. There was no sharp pain felt during the night because the boy fell asleep after

the kick. A sharp pain is normally associated with torsion injury. Dr Tay, who examined

the boy and operated on him to remove the dead testicle, never diagnosed a torsion injury

after considering the history related by the patient, the ultrasound report, his operative

findings and the histology report. His conclusion was affirmatively that of trauma to the

testicle due to the kick. Without any question, this case clearly shows how delicate the

testes really are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>v. Evidence of a Scrotal Haematoma</u></p>
<p align="justify">330.    I do not consider the absence of a black

coloured scrotum to be evidence fatal to Dr Tan’s postulation of a contusion injury

sufficiently severe to cause atrophy. Mr Harte’s reddish purplish scrotum (as

described by Mrs Harte), depicting a dark coloured scrotum, might well show up by the

fourth day as a tinge of blue as described by Dr Tan, depending on how the inflammation

and bruising were resolving themselves.</p>
<p align="justify">331.    In my opinion, a blue-black coloured scrotum

might well be conclusive that there was a scrotal haematoma but the absence of the

blue-black colour is not necessarily conclusive that there could never be any trauma or

physical contusion to the testes, and hence there could not be any scrotal haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">332.    Prof Li Man Kay quoted from medical literature

that 50 Kg is required to cause testicular atrophy. I believe that Prof Li must be

referring to the paper Wasko and Goldstein: <i>Traumatic rupture of the testicle</i>,

where the authors have estimated that a force of 50 kg of pressure is needed to rupture

the tunica albuginea in blunt scrotal trauma.</p>
<p align="justify">333.    Although none of the experts have suggested that

Mr Harte had sustained any rupture of the tunica albuginea covering his testes,

nevertheless it is still enlightening to find out what are the signs and symptoms expected

in cases of blunt trauma involving a <b>rupture of the tunica albuginea</b>. Fournier,

Laing and McAninch stated the following at page 382 of their paper: <i>Scrotal

Ultrasonograph and the Management of Testicular Trauma</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><b>Signs and Symptoms</b></p>
<p align="justify">Rupture of a testis secondary to blunt trauma is a violent and

  immediately painful event. Wasko and Goldstein have estimated that a force of 50 kg of

  pressure is needed to rupture the tunica albuginea in blunt scrotal trauma. Nausea and

  vomiting are frequently associated, as occasionally is syncope. <u>The amount of scrotal

  swelling and ecchymosis <strong>can differ</strong>.</u> Rupture of the tunica albuginea

  behind the tunica vaginalis <u>can be associated with <strong>no ecchymosis</strong> and <strong>minimal</strong>

  to moderate testicular enlargement</u> because bleeding and the extruded seminiferous

  tubules will be contained by the tunica vaginalis. On the other hand, if subalbugineal

  arterioles are involved, the hematocele can be large and may compress the parenchyma,

  eventually leading to parenchymal atrophy. If the rupture involved the junction of the

  tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis in the area of the epididymis, the bleeding will

  extend into the scrotal sac proper and lead to a scrotal hematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">Findings on physical examination are <strong><u>various</u></strong>.

  Occasionally, the testis is displaced to the inguinal canal and not palpable in the

  scrotum. The most consistent sign is exquisite pain with palpation. Scrotal ecchymosis and

  swelling are also frequent, although <strong><u>their absence does not rule out a rupture</u></strong>.

  The differential diagnosis includes simple hematocele without rupture, torsion of the

  testis or one of the appendices, testis tumor, epididymis, reactive hydrocele, and

  spermatic cord. <u>An accurate history should be taken if possible to ascertain the

  magnitude of the force causing the injury.</u> Cassie has reported that an associated

  neoplasm may predispose to rupture after apparently minor injuries. In this case, <strong><u>testicular

  rupture was manifested by swelling and pain some 16 hours after a fall down a flight of

  stairs</u></strong>. Patients with normal testes will report scrotal trauma that is much

  more violent and directly localized and they usually experience pain and swelling

  immediately; alternatively, they may have been in an accident resulting in multiple

  injuries. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">334.    It is my opinion after considering all the

evidence presented to me, that rupture of the small blood capillaries at the microscopic

level does not require extraordinary trauma. The proposition that only extraordinary force

can cause testicular damage is simply untrue. The above passage confirms that physical

symptoms are indeed very variable. Even for testicular rupture, which is more serious, the

pain and swelling manifested only some 16 hours after the fall. It was not immediate. The

authors went on to say that the absence of scrotal ecchymosis (i.e. a small haemorrhagic

area in the skin or mucous membrane either blue or purplish in colour) and swelling do not

rule out an injury as serious as a rupture of the tunica albuginea.</p>
<p align="justify">335.    I also disagree with the medical expert opinion

presented on both sides that a bruise must necessarily appear black or as ‘black as a

gown’. It seems to me that in a very severe case of bruising that might well be the

colour. But bruising from a less substantial trauma involving microvascular damage cannot

to my mind, become as black as that.</p>
<p align="justify">336.    In cases of soft tissue trauma, e.g. a heavy

slap on the cheeks or thighs may cause swelling and redness but not necessarily a black or

blue-black bruise. Whereas a punch landing on an area of the body which is near a bony

structure e.g. the forehead or cheekbone will more likely result in a denser blue-black

bruise. Even then, it may not necessarily be of that colour as can be seen from nurse Ms

Tan Sang Eng’s testimony that she observed some <b>redness</b> (not blackness) at the

plaintiff’s left forehead and left cheek after he had hit his head on the hard toilet

floor during his fall from the toilet seat. Another nurse Ms Looi Chai Hang, who saw the

bruise on Mr Harte some 1 hours later described it as having a <u>very slight bluish

colour</u>. All this clearly shows that there is no certainty that a bruising injury must

show up as a black or blue-black swelling. It is a fallacy. As can be seen from the

evidence of these two nurses, a bruise from trauma can start off with a reddish colour and

later change to a slight bluish colour. The colour changes observed on Mr Harte’s

swollen scrotum are remarkably similar.</p>
<p align="justify">337.    The swelling reactions and colour of the

bruising depend on the magnitude of the force applied, whether it is an impact or

non-impact force, the kind of body tissue involved, whether the tissue is against a bone

or against another soft part of the body, whether there is a rich supply of blood vessels

in that area, and the degree of rupture or haemorrhage of these vessels at the traumatised

area. In my opinion, there can be internal testicular haemorrhage without obvious signs

appearing on the scrotum skin immediately or at all. The reddish, bluish, purplish

reddish, blue-black or even black colour may surface later on as the blood from the

ruptured vessels in the scrotum gradually permeates to the outer skin layers, and various

complex, biological, chemical and inflammatory reactions subsequently take place, giving

the various possible colours.</p>
<p align="justify">338.    Thus, it is far too dogmatic to think that all

scrotal bruising must be black and if there is no black colour seen, there is no bruising

and therefore no trauma of any kind, or that redness seen on the scrotum must exclude an

extratesticular haematoma. Not only is it simplistic, it is also unrealistic and

completely ignores the fact that multiple factors come into play.</p>
<p align="justify">339.    I think that a more balanced view is that

expressed in "<i>All New Family Medical Guide to Health and Prevention</i>" by

Martin and Powell, 1995 Edn where it simply states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A bruise is nothing more than blood under the skin. If blood leaks out

  of a blood vessel due to any cause, a bruise forms. It may be <u><b>red, yellow, orange,

  or blue</b></u>. Blue usually indicates a deeper bruise; the color is caused by the blood

  pigment, hemoglobin, reflected through skin tissue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">340.    I happened to check with the Dorland’s

Illustrated Medical Dictionary and am gladly reassured that the <b>‘<u><i>reddish

purplish</i>’</u></b> coloured scrotum seen by Mrs Harte is entirely consistent with

the presence of a scrotal haematoma. Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 20<sup>th</sup>

Edn gives the following definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ecchymosis : a small <b>hemorrhagic spot</b>, larger than a petechia,

  in the skin or mucous membrane forming a nonelevated rounded or irregular, <b>blue or

  purplish</b> patch.</p>
<p align="justify">Petechia : a pinpoint, nonraised, perfectly round, <b>purplish red</b>

  spot caused by intradermal or submucous <b>hemorrhage</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">Intradermal : 1. Within the dermis. 2. Intracutaneous.</p>

<p align="justify">341.    Naturally, a collection of round purplish red

spots caused by intradermal or submucous haemorrhage in the scrotum will show up as a

‘reddish purplish’ scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">342.    I note that Dr Schlegel had medically examined

Mr Harte on 12 January 2000. Being an experienced and eminent urologist, Dr Schlegel must

have taken a detailed history from Mr Harte. Yet in his report given as late as 22 March

2000, Dr Schlegel stated his view that Mr Harte had developed a <b>scrotal haematoma</b>

subsequent to the varicocelectomy. Nothing was mentioned in Dr Schlegel’s report that

Mr Harte had developed an inflamed red scrotum (without a scrotal haematoma), which Dr

Notley postulated had happened. I would imagine that Dr Schlegel knew the difference

between a scrotal haematoma and an inflammatory swelling.</p>
<p align="justify">343.    Similarly, Dr Dubin who also saw Mr Harte on 21

October 1999 wrote to Mr Harte on 27 October 1999 stating that he had <b>haematoma</b> of

the scrotum after his operation in Singapore. Again, I imagine that Mr Harte would

probably have told Dr Dubin about the signs and symptoms he felt after his surgery and

would have given Dr Dubin the whole history. Yet Dr Dubin did not mention anything about a

large red, hot scrotal swelling arising from a severe reactionary inflammation, which

would be quite different from a haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">344.    Dr Tan Hun Hoe testified that the haematoma he

saw some 4 days later was the size of a large orange and it was <u><b>‘a tinge of

blue’</b></u> which in his opinion was due to the ‘altered blood clots’. Dr

Tan explained that ‘altered’ meant that the blood there was no longer

functioning having lost its oxygen, and it was beginning to denature i.e. to change its

biological and chemical properties.</p>
<p align="justify">345.    Dr Tan gave Mr Harte a medical report dated 24

May 1997 stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">He was reviewed on 2<sup>nd</sup> May ’97 and was noted to have

  the complication of a <u><b>scrotal haematoma</b></u>. He was prescribed Zinnat, Danzen,

  Voltaren and Antacids and when last reviewed on 9<sup>th</sup> May ’97 the <u><b>haematoma</b></u>

  had begun to subside. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">346.    I presume that Dr Tan based his medical report

on his contemporaneous medical notes on 2 May 1997 where he wrote, "<i>Had<b> scrotal

haematoma</b></i>". On 9 May 1997, he recorded, "<i><b>Haematoma subsided. </b>Complained

of hard testicles, left worse than right. Ultrasound scan: organised clot around left

testicle, small hydrocele</i>."</p>
<p align="justify">347.    The mention of an organised clot around the left

testicle also suggests to me that there was a haematoma rather than an adverse reactionary

inflammation to a pair of dead infarcted testes.</p>
<p align="justify">348.    Dr Tan in his report to the Singapore Medical

Council dated 23 October 1998 stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">On review on 2.5.97, he complained of a <u>scrotal hematoma</u> that

  had developed 2 – 3 days after the operation. The hematoma was <u>non-tender</u>. He

  was prescribed antibiotics prophylactically and Danzen to aid resolution of hematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">He was reviewed again a week later on 9.5.97. The <u>hematoma</u> had

  subsided but he complained that the left testicle was harder than the right.</p>
<p align="justify">The next review was on 26.5.97. The swelling had subsided almost

  completely but there was <u>residual induration</u> of the scrotal sac which was expected

  to take a longer period to subside.</p>
<p align="justify">…..<br/>

  …..</p>
<p align="justify">In my opinion the cause of his testicular hypofunction is difficult to

  determine at this time as it was highly unlikely that the arterial supply could have been

  cut off during the operation which was carefully done with magnification. Whether the fall

  and the <u>subsequent hematocele</u> had an effect on the outcome is again difficult to

  ascertain. However due care was taken to manage the <u>hematocele</u> conservatively as it

  was <u>not tender</u> and was expected to subside spontaneously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">349.    I observe that there was mention in the

contemporaneous medical notes for 26 May 1997 that "<i>Induration subsided but can

still be felt. Swelling subsided.</i>"</p>
<p align="justify">350.    The fact of induration of the scrotal sac

suggests the presence of some hardening due to dried blood. That was also what Dr Tan had

told Mrs Harte, which Mrs Harte had scribbled down in her notes exhibited at ABD 171.</p>
<p align="justify">351.    Further, the fact that the scrotum was

non-tender does not suggest a severe reactionary inflammation to me. I expect a

reactionary inflammation giving rise to swelling the size of a mango to be very tender.</p>
<p align="justify">352.    The later notes taken by Dr Tan for 8 October

1997 had the following remarks showing Dr Tan’s puzzlement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Discussed possibility of Retrograde ejaculation, possibility of

  ‘page’ kidney effect of haematoma on testicles. <b>? mechanism of haematoma.</b></p>
<p align="justify">Haematoma occurred 2 – 3 days post operation, <b>initially

  very gradual</b>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">To complete the picture, his notes for 17 October 1997 were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Mrs Harte called up.</p>
<p align="justify">Wanted clarification on operation findings and procedure</p>
<p align="justify">Past cases and results</p>
<p align="justify">Discussed haematoma</p>
<b><p align="justify">Patient’s fall in toilet on front? Cause of haematoma</p></b>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">353.    After the defendants closed their case, counsel

for the plaintiff recalled Dr Notley who threw in at the last minute an explanation of a

reactive inflammation for the bright red coloured swollen scrotum appearing on the morning

after the surgery. This red herring admittedly threw me off balance in my analysis of the

cause of the bilateral testicular atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">354.    The sworn complaint by Mr Harte himself to the

Singapore Medical Council dated 2 September 1998 puts to rest whether he had a severe

reactionary inflammation or a haematoma. Mr Harte wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">After the surgery I had a very painful <b>scrotal hematoma</b>. I

  consulted Dr Tan two days after the surgery and he advised that the swelling should go

  down in a few days and everything would be normal. When the swelling persisted, I made an

  appointment to see him. The soonest he could see me was on May 2, 1997. He said that if

  the swelling did not subside he would have to <b>drain the blood from my scrotum</b>. He

  didn’t seem concerned and asked that I return in one week for another check-up. The

  swelling did eventually subside, but, until it did I called Dr. Tan on a daily basis for

  advice. I asked if I should <b>put ice on it</b> and was told not to by one of his

  assistants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">355.    Again why should there be a need to consider

draining of blood from his scrotum if there was no haematoma but a severe reactionary

inflammation? Further, why was there a need to consider putting ice on the scrotum if it

was a severe reactionary inflammation? My own understanding is that an ice pack will help

reduce swelling in a haematoma and is not quite appropriate for a reactionary inflammation

of a septic nature. From all the above evidence, I am convinced that Mr Harte did suffer

from an extratesticular (or scrotal) haematoma besides an internal haematoma. This

conclusion points towards physical contusion rather than surgery as the cause of both

kinds of swelling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>vi. Absence of abrasion and bruising on the scrotum and penis</u></p>
<p align="justify">356.    A/Prof Foo held the view that it was not

necessary to have a blue-black penis in the fall from a toilet seat. I agree with him. It

depends on the nature of the force and how the force is applied. It is possible for the

penis skin to be scratched when falling off a toilet seat. But the fact that scratch marks

are absent cannot exclude that event. Where there is the same degree of contusion to the

testis and flaccid penis, contusion injury is more likely to surface in the testis than in

the penis because the testis is hard and taut whereas the penis is flaccid. A flaccid

penis moulds to the force acting on it but not an erect penis, which can therefore suffer

from a contusion injury. Like the erect penis, the firm testes can succumb to contusion

injury.</p>
<p align="justify">357.    The inner rim of the toilet seat is not a sharp

object. The inner edge is contoured and smooth as can be seen in photograph D51G of the

actual toilet seat in question. Given the smoothness and rounded contour, the absence of

obvious abrasion or bruising on the skin of the penis or the scrotum is hardly surprising,

regardless whether there was any contusion injury. Dr Notley also did not think that there

would be bruises on the penis if the patient slid over the front edge of the toilet seat.</p>
<p align="justify">358.    I believe that the soft, flexible, stretchable

scrotal skin and the underlying dartos muscle can withstand a fair amount of pressure and

stretching without sustaining bruising. Dr Notley aptly observed that one could sit on the

skin of the buttocks without experiencing bruising. But with the testis itself, which is

encased in a tough tunica envelope, I think it is a completely different matter.

Compressing an egg-like testis encased in a fairly tough, inelastic membrane generates a

considerable buildup of pressure within it, which may cause tissue damage and haemorrhagic

ruptures internally without any significant observable bruising to the scrotal skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>vii. Uneven damage to testicles</u></p>
<p align="justify">359.    None of the plaintiff’s experts could

provide a plausible reason based on their own theories why the testicle on the right side

originally much bigger at 25 cc had ended up being smaller at 6 cc whereas the left

smaller testicle of 15 cc had ended up being larger at 8 cc. This seems to contradict

their position that the left operation being a repeat operation was more risky than the

right. Yet the damage on the right turns out to be far more severe than the left.</p>
<p align="justify">360.    Dr Tan offered a logical explanation that where

a compressive force acts on two unequal sized testicles at the same time, the larger one

is naturally more traumatised. Second, the right testicle is usually attached by a shorter

cord and therefore, it will sustain more of the traction injury when both testicles are

equally trapped at the inner rim of the toilet seat before being pulled through and

compressed. For this reason, the right testicle will suffer greater traction injury. See

the illustrations D21 and D22 by Dr Tan. A/Prof Ng Wan Sing from the School of Mechanical

and Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University confirmed this aspect of Dr

Tan’s evidence from an engineering point of view.</p>
<p align="justify">361.    Dr Tan testified that a force of 50 kg would be

more than enough to rupture the tunica albugenia. The corollary would be that a force less

than 50 Kg might not cause rupture but it could still be sufficient to cause contusion

injury.</p>
<p align="justify">362.    That the right testis has been more severely

atrophied is also consistent with what Munter and Faleski stated in <i>Blunt Scrotal

Trauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Testicular, scrotal, and epididymal hematomas and contusions may occur

  as a direct result of a blow. Because of the shape of the testicle, its mobility within

  the scrotum, and the protection of the tunica albuginia, testicular rupture occurs when

  the testicle is trapped between the striking object and a hard surface, typically the

  public bone or thigh. ….</p>
<p align="justify">The <b>right testicle is more often injured</b>. This is postulated to

  be caused by the <b>higher position</b> of the right testicle, with a resultant <b>greater

  chance to be caught against the pubic or ischial bone.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">363.    The higher position of the right testicle

mentioned by Munter and Faleski confirms what Dr Tan had said that the right testicle is

usually attached by a shorter spermatic cord.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><i><b>(g) Biomechanical analysis</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">364.    Dr Tan’s principal defence was that the

fall of Mr Harte from the toilet seat was the sole cause of his bilateral testicular

atrophy (‘fall theory’). The plaintiff weighed about 103 kg at that time. He was

indeed heavy. By comparison, a force of 50 kg would be sufficient to cause rupture and

very severe damage to the testes. Having heard evidence from two engineers, I shall now

scrutinise Dr Tan’s ‘fall theory’.</p>
<p align="justify">365.    Mrs Harte described how Mr Harte fell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">There were 3 nurses may be 4 nurses were holding him and walking him to

  the toilet and I was following behind. They sat him on the toilet and then they left the

  toilet. I remained inside. He was looking a little pale at that time and was sweating. So

  I turned around to the sink to get a paper towel. When I turned round back to Denis, his

  eyes were rolling back in his head and I could see that he was about to pass out. I moved

  towards him to hold him up but he was already falling forward. So I grabbed him to try to

  break the fall and that’s when he hit his head on the floor.</p>
<p align="justify">When he was falling, I grabbed his body at his chest and back, but he

  was so heavy that he continued to go forward and his head hit the floor first, followed on

  by the rest of his body. He was lying eventually on his left side with his left leg on the

  floor and the right crossed over his left leg and his hand above his head. As he was

  falling, his buttocks lifted upwards up from the toilet seat. At the time of falling, both

  his feet were at the axle point of the roll.</p>
<p align="justify">As his head hit the floor, his body was in a couched position with his

  body fairly close to his thighs, when he rolled onto the floor hitting his head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">366.    According to Mrs Harte, his body was so heavy

that as he fell forward, his buttocks automatically rose upwards. His head hit the floor

first. He eventually landed on his left side with his right leg crossed. His knee was

protecting his groin and scrotal area. She maintained that his scrotum was <b>not crushed</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">367.    This part of her evidence seems contrived

because I do not think she was in a position to see whether his scrotum was ever

sandwiched between his body and the floor. I also doubt that she could have in that split

second observed that Mr Harte’s scrotum was not crushed by the toilet seat,

especially when her attention was focussed on preventing Mr Harte from falling. One has to

bear in mind that Mr Harte was in hospital attire at that time which would have obscured

much of her view in any case. As with all oral evidence, there is always a possibility of

wrong recollections and even biased embellishments. For instance, Mrs Harte’s

evidence that 3 or 4 nurses held and walked Mr Harte to the toilet with herself following

behind was contradicted by nurse Tan Sang Eng who said that only she and Mrs Harte helped

Mr Harte into the toilet and seated him.</p>
<p align="justify">368.    After Mr Harte fell, Mrs Harte ran to get help.

The nurses came. Mrs Harte and the nurses could not lift him up from the floor because he

was so heavy. After Mr Harte regained consciousness, he got up himself with some

assistance from them.</p>
<p align="justify">369.    A/Prof Ng Wan Sing from the School of Mechanical

and Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, was called by Dr Tan to

substantiate his fall theory. A/Prof Ng’s report is at D 40.</p>
<p align="justify">370.    A/Prof Ng basically applied a static analysis to

what was clearly a dynamic situation. In my opinion, his qualitative analysis is a little

simplistic. The results of A/Prof Ng’s analysis can easily mislead if the limitations

of his static model are not fully appreciated. A/Prof Ng conceded that his static analysis

had not taken into account the dynamic nature of the forces, motions and accelerations.

His static model projected a shifting pivoting point about the toilet seat with toppling

and sliding occurring thereafter. As Mr Harte slid off the edge of the toilet seat under

the full weight of his body and given the closeness of his scrotum to the inner rim of the

toilet seat, A/Prof Ng concluded that it was ‘<i>very possible that the scrotum

pressed against the seat and rim during the roll over and sliding</i>’. With only a

qualitative analysis, Prof Ng could not determine the amount of clearance, if any, between

the toilet seat and Mr Harte’s perineum region as Mr Harte slid off. Neither could

Prof Ng establish the magnitude of the compressive force.</p>
<p align="justify">371.    I find that A/Prof Lim Chwee Teck from the

Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, presented a far

more sophisticated quantitative finite element analysis using the computer software called

‘ABAQUS/Explicit finite element software.’ The computer simulation models the

dynamics of the plaintiff falling off the toilet seat when he lost consciousness. From the

trajectories, one can study whether Mr Harte’s scrotum would be caught underneath the

toilet seat or pressed between his body and the toilet seat during the fall. A/Prof Lim

was tasked to analyse the dynamic nature of the free fall due to gravity assuming

different initial torso angles of Mr Harte just before his torso started collapsing to his

thighs due to syncope.</p>
<p align="justify">372.    I agree that A/Prof Lim’s dynamic analysis

better predicts the trajectory of the fall than A/Prof Ng’s static analysis. A/Prof

Lim’s report is at P50.</p>
<p align="justify">373.    The approximations and assumptions applied in

A/Prof Lim’s model must be fully appreciated. He approximated the mass distribution,

centre of mass and radius of gyration, and then calculated the moment of inertia of the

various segments of Mr Harte’s body relying on the ‘<i>Dempster’s Body

Segment Parameter Data for 2-Dimensional Studies</i>’ shown at Appendix B of his

report. The coefficient of friction between the plaintiff’s thigh and toilet seat was

obtained from a paper ‘<i>Friction behaviour of human skin’</i> by Sasada, Ide

and Kawakami. The plaintiff’s body is modelled as 4 segments viz (a) head, trunk and

arms; (b) thighs and pelvis; (c) legs; and (d) feet. Each is modelled as a rigid segment

connected to the other segments using frictionless joints.</p>
<p align="justify">374.    As Mr Harte fell in an unconscious state, it is

assumed that he lost muscular control instantaneously. Therefore, all the major joints in

his body are approximated to function as loose frictionless joints. Mr Harte’s body

is assumed to be a deadweight falling under the influence of gravity. The model simply

treats Mr Harte’s non-rigid 3-Dimensional body as a rigid 2-Dimensional body with

frictionless joints and with certain maximum limits of collapse angles at the knees and

ankles based on actual measurements taken from Mr Harte himself.</p>
<p align="justify">375.    In his report, A/Prof Lim described his

engineering findings on the dynamics of the fall as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The upper torso first pivots about the pelvis until it hits the

  thighs.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The upper torso and thigh then pivot as one mass about the knee

  with some simultaneous pivoting of the leg about the ankle.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The knee then starts to collapse under the weight of the body and

  reaches the minimum angle achieved by the knee.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) The head and upper torso continue to move forward and downward with

  the head hitting the floor first followed by the rest of the body.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) There is no sliding of the thighs on the toilet seat due to the

  great inertial torque arising from the substantial deceleration upon the rigid body

  impact. </p>
<p align="justify">(f) The buttocks lift off the toilet seat.</p>
<p align="justify">(g) There is noticeable clearance between the scrotum and toilet seat

  based on a hanging distance of the scrotum of 6 cm.</p>
<p align="justify">(h) The closest the scrotum gets to the toilet seat during the fall is

  approximated to be about 4 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm for the fall from 80 , 70 and 60

  positions respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">376.    I accept that finite element analysis using

software packages and computers are often used to perform complicated, engineering

calculations and to solve complex engineering problems. In this case, the modelling of the

fall (assuming different starting angles of a human body with the physical characteristics

of Mr Harte and with certain general parameters obtained from biomechanical data about the

distribution of body mass, radius of gyration and the position of the centre of mass for

each of the body segments modelled), gives a better insight and understanding of the

motions and trajectories of a fall off a toilet seat under the influence of gravity. Short

of replicating either with Mr Harte on the toilet seat and subjecting him to anaesthesia

to create the unconsciousness, or with an actual 3-Dimensional model built to mimic the

physical characteristics of Mr Harte, the 2-Dimensional computer simulation is the next

best and most practical solution. Although it is helpful as a guide, nevertheless one must

remember its limitations and its inability to fully simulate the human body, which is

flesh and blood.</p>
<p align="justify">377.    The most useful part of the finite element

dynamic analysis as opposed to the common sense and more readily understood static

analysis of A/Prof Ng is to demonstrate the hitherto unforeseen effect of rotation of the

torso about the knees before collapsing because of the forward and angular momentum of the

torso in the course of the fall. Where there is no slip between the feet and the toilet

floor, the tibia and fibula bones of the lower part of the leg act as a strong strut and

they can transmit forces along its length through the frictionless pivot at the knee

joint, to allow the upper torso to use it momentarily as a strut, over which the torso

could continue to rotate about the knee pivot in the course of falling. The initial torso

rotation about the strut at the knee pivot is the main reason for the ‘lift’ of

the buttocks off the toilet seat or the ‘flying’ motion as described by Dr Myint

Soe in his submissions. This fall trajectory cannot be appreciated without the dynamic

analysis. The computer program is at exhibit P55 with full instructions for its operation.</p>
<p align="justify">378.    A/Prof Ng in my view had no engineering basis

for asserting that the ankles of the plaintiff would buckle from the onset of the fall and

that the tibia and fibula would not act as a ‘strut’ and therefore, Mr

Harte’s torso could only rotate about the toilet seat as he fell off. Of course, if

the feet of the plaintiff had already slipped (for instance where the floor was slippery),

then the tibia and fibula would not function properly as a strut, and there might not be

any pivoting about the knee at all in the course of the fall. The body would then have

fallen as if the obstruction (in the way of the fall) from the lower leg were not there at

all.</p>
<p align="justify">379.    However, as the angle of the lower leg in

relation to the floor was close to 90 , and as the floor was not exactly slippery, I

take the view that the friction force was sufficient to prevent any slippage at the feet

at least at the initial part of the torso rotation about the knee. I find support for this

in the evidence of Mrs Harte that ‘<i>at the time of falling, both his feet were at

the axle point of the roll</i>.’</p>
<p align="justify">380.    During the later stages of the fall and as the

angle of the lower leg to the floor became more acute, it might well be that the friction

forces between the feet and the floor were overcome at some stage and both feet would

begin to slip backwards. However, these later stages of the fall were not material in my

analysis whether contusion was in fact possible. The effect of the feet slippage is

relevant only when one needs to consider how much closer the final rest position of the

body and buttocks after the fall was going to be. Logically, the earlier the slippage of

the feet during the fall, the nearer would be the final position of the body to the toilet

bowl.</p>
<p align="justify">381.    If Mr Harte had fallen from a starting position

with his torso completely resting on his thighs, then the results of A/Prof Lim’s

analysis and A/Prof Ng’s analysis would tend to converge. In other words, the dynamic

model predicts much of the outcome of the static model when the initial fall angle is set

at the minimum of 25 , which essentially transforms the dynamic model into a static

model. At 25 , there will no longer be any angular rotation nor angular momentum left in

the torso just prior to hitting the thighs.</p>
<p align="justify">382.    A/Prof Lim gave a quantitative analysis for the

whole spectrum of fall angles between 80 and 30 whereas A/Prof Ng’s qualitative

analysis related only to the far end of that spectrum with the fall angle at 25 . The

real answer is probably somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. But which end

of the spectrum is the actual fall going to be nearer? If the torso angle is closer to the

low end of the spectrum (i.e. nearer the 25 angle which is the equivalent of the static

model), then there is a higher probability of contusion. If the torso angle is towards the

high end of the spectrum, then there is a higher probability that the scrotum will clear

the toilet seat and not be contused at all.</p>
<p align="justify">383.    Based purely on common sense (which I must

caution myself may well be wrong), if the torso starts to fall from an angle closer to

25 (which essentially is the static model), I reason that the buttocks will slide first

before toppling over the edge of the toilet seat. If there is any lifting of the buttocks

in the course of the fall, it will be minimal. More likely, the lift will not be

sufficient to enable the scrotum to clear the rim of the toilet seat. As such, it is

probable for the scrotum and the then much larger testicles (prior to his atrophy) to be

squashed by his heavy torso in the course of sliding off the toilet seat as he fell. Can

this common sense reasoning of mine be confirmed more scientifically by the dynamic finite

element model of A/Prof Lim? I shall now proceed to examine this.</p>
<p align="justify">384.    I note that there are many important unknown

parameters which affect the outcome predicted by the simulation: (a) elasticity and energy

absorption characteristics of the stomach and thighs at the point of impact; (b) how Mrs

Harte had held the plaintiff, the amount of force she applied to prevent the fall and the

amount of energy she expended in doing so; (c) the rate at which Mr Harte lost

consciousness; and (d) the energy loss in the process of stretching the strong back

muscles of the torso and the skin as the body fell.</p>
<p align="justify">385.    Since these parameters were not known or readily

available, A/Prof Lim recognised that he had totally ignored them to make the modelling

easier. He readily acknowledged that if these unknown parameters were taken into account,

they would affect the clearance between the toilet seat and the scrotum.</p>
<p align="justify">386.    What is clear in my mind is that these unknown

parameters will negate the dynamic effects from the falling torso, reduce the angular

velocity and momentum of the torso just before the impact on the thighs. Hence the

‘lift effect’ due to the rotation about the knee will be substantially reduced.

Consequently, the clearance between the toilet seat and scrotum diminishes. It is

conceivable based on the dynamic finite element model that the plaintiff’s body might

have crashed down after being lifted slightly, and thereafter squashed or crushed his

scrotum on the toilet seat before he finally fell to the floor.</p>
<p align="justify">387.    One way to demonstrate the effects of these

unknown parameters is to treat the plaintiff as having fallen from a lower torso angle

position to compensate for these unknown parameters (which I shall call

‘interventions’). Simulating lower torso angles indirectly allows the finite

element computation of the fall dynamics to factor in all the interventions. To enable me

to have some understanding of the trajectories when these unknown parameters are taken

into consideration, I therefore directed A/Prof Lim to perform further computer

simulations for lower angles from 50 down to 30 . In other words, an 80 fall, after

factoring all the interventions, may be approximated by a 50 simulation. Similarly, a

70 fall after accounting for the effects from all the interventions may be represented

by a 40 simulation. A fall from 70 with the interventions taken into consideration may

be the equivalent of a simulated fall from an assumed torso angle of 30.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>i. Interventions</u></p>
<p align="justify">388.    I shall now elaborate on these interventions,

which collectively would reduce the angular velocities, angular momentum and rate of fall

of the collapsing torso: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    Mrs Harte’s attempt to stop Mr Harte’s

  fall in my opinion is a significant intervention. She managed to catch him at his chest to

  prevent him from falling. She must have caught him fairly early in the fall because it was

  not likely for her to catch him at his chest level if Mr Harte had already fallen close to

  his thighs. Further, she had some time to anticipate as she saw his eyeballs rolling and

  thus, would have time to place herself in a position to grab him. Faced with that

  situation, I imagine Mrs Harte as a dutiful wife would have mustered all her strength to

  stop his fall. She might even have used her body to push him back. Certainly, it could not

  be a half-hearted attempt. Being a well-built Caucasian woman, I think she would be quite

  strong. Her considerable intervention slowed down the rate of fall and hence, the ability

  of the torso to pick up momentum. The energy in the falling torso, manifested in its

  linear and angular velocities, would be correspondingly reduced. Not satisfied with merely

  a qualitative reasoning (which I accept can be erroneous), I looked for some confirmation

  by some quantitative analysis and modelling. For this, I have asked for and I have the

  benefit of A/Prof Lim’s programme written on Microsoft Excel (P55 file) computing (a)

  the potential energy released as a result of the fall of the heavy torso of Mr Harte for

  various fall angles, and (b) the energy reduction caused by Mrs Harte’s intervention

  assuming a range of angles for her intervention at different levels of force applied by

  her to prevent the fall. After using the programme and going through the various

  possibilities (see P55A for the computations I have done using the programme and Annex A

  for the results), I estimate that it is likely that her intervention could have reduced

  the energy in Mr Harte’s fall by between 30 to 50 %. I therefore conclude with a fair

  degree of confidence that Mrs Harte’s intervention is a very significant factor in

  reducing the velocity and energy of Mr Harte’s fall. </p>
<p align="justify">(b)    The energy absorbed by the elastic tissues and

  muscles during the compression of the large stomach and the fleshy thighs of Mr Harte

  would also slow down the momentum of the fall. In a simulated fall impact experiment on

  trochanteric soft tissues, a total energy of 140 J was applied in each impact. The tissue

  energy absorption ranged from 8.4 to 81.6 J. (which corresponds to energy absorption of

  between 8% to 58%). Increased tissue thickness correlated strongly with increased tissue

  energy absorption capacity. See the paper on ‘<i>Force attenuation in trochanteric

  soft tissues during impact from a fall</i>’ by J Orthop in the Journal of Orthopaedic

  Research Nov 1995. Since Mr Harte had substantial fatty padding around his stomach, pelvis

  and thighs, they must account for a fair amount of energy absorption.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    The back muscles are huge muscle groups with

  strong ligaments. They must be stretched when the torso bends during the fall. The skin of

  the back also stretches, including the intervertebral discs and tissues at the spine.

  Together they would reduce the energy and momentum of the fall and the impact of Mr

  Harte’s torso on his thighs.</p>
<p align="justify">(d)    Loss of consciousness is not instantaneous. The

  body gradually loses its muscle tone and then collapses. Consequently, the fall might

  actually start from a lower angle than what would ordinarily be Mr Harte’s normal

  position when seated on a toilet bowl. The momentum generated from a fall from a lower

  angle is necessarily less.</p>
<p align="justify">(e)    The rigid segment analysis ignores the fact that

  the plaintiff’s body is made of multiple joints and a considerable amount of soft

  tissue padding. For a start, there are 26 joints alone between the head and the hip. But

  they are simulated by one rigid segment in the finite element programme. When a fall

  occurs, the 26 joints move together at different rates. The whole body of an unconscious

  man is much more wobbly than a rigid segment of a few joints. There will be shifts of body

  weights and forces during the descent, which is quite unlike a rigid model. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><u>ii. Inferences drawn from Computer Simulation</u></p>
<p align="justify">389.    In my judgment, the above interventions will

substantially reduce the momentum and energy of the falling torso. Hence, the so called

‘lift’ of the buttocks upwards in a circular arc about the knee and later about

the ankle, as observed in the computer simulation for 80 to 60 is significantly

reduced. </p>
<p align="justify">390.    As an indication of the effects of such

reductions, I studied in slow motion the fall characteristics as predicted by A/Prof

Lim’s dynamic finite element analysis. For fall angles of 50 to 30 , the

simulation predicts that the scrotum will actually impact on the toilet seat for the 40

and 30 fall angles, whereas the available clearance (i.e. gap between the toilet seat

and Mr Harte’s perineum) in the case of the fall angle of 50 has become fairly

small. These lower fall angles give a good indication of what the actual fall dynamics are

going to be, when the fall energy has been reduced by the intervention of Mrs Harte,

absorbed by the back muscles, abdomen, thighs and skin during stretching and so on. The

sum total of these multiple interventions is that the ‘dynamic lift effect’ seen

in the fall angles from 80 to 60 in fact may not be sufficient to lift Mr Harte’s

scrotum clear of the toilet seat to avoid any contusion. The common sense analysis is to

that extent corroborated by the dynamic model of A/Prof Lim.</p>
<p align="justify">391.    I am reinforced in my conclusion by the

undisputed evidence below that the energy and momentum in the fall is not as great as that

demonstrated for the fall angles from 80 to 60 and is in fact much closer to the other

end of the spectrum represented by A/Prof Ng’s static analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    The final positions predicted by the dynamic

  analysis for 80 to 60 angles appear to be too far away from the toilet seat. The model

  predicts a lively forward movement that thrust Mr Harte’s head so far forward as to

  be below the toilet sink with his buttocks a good half a metre away from the far edge of

  the toilet bowl. The final position of Mr Harte’s buttocks as enacted by Mr Daniel Xu

  based on the evidence of nurse Tan Sang Eng (who tried her best to reconstruct the final

  position of Mr Harte after the fall in the toilet) shows that Mr Harte’s buttocks

  were in fact much nearer the edge of the toilet seat. See photographs P40 A to C showing

  what would be the final position of Mr Harte viz a viz the toilet seat and the other wall

  structures in the toilet which were set up to scale in court. The toilet bowl was the

  actual one used by Mr Harte, which Gleneagles Hospital managed to preserve when the ward

  was renovated. The fact that the buttocks were fairly near the edge of the toilet seat

  suggests to me that the rate of fall must have been considerably slower than that

  predicted by the 80 to 60 fall angles. As expected, the fall angles of 80 to 60

  divorced from all the effects of the abovementioned interventions have wrongly postulated

  the position where Mr Harte landed on the floor. The true position is in my view more

  realistically predicted by fall angles of 50 to 30 , which do take account of the

  effects of the interventions and which give results approaching that of A/Prof Ng’s

  static model analysis. In short, after taking everything into consideration, I infer from

  the finite element modelling done by A/Prof Lim that there was a high probability of a

  contusion of the scrotum on the edge of the toilet seat rather than a trajectory that

  allowed an unconscious Mr Harte to ‘fly over’ the edge of the toilet seat in the

  course of the fall. An unconscious man cannot be expected to use his leg muscles to lift

  himself and hence, lift his scrotum clear of and away from the toilet seat to avoid any

  impact or contact with it.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    Most critically, if indeed the momentum and

  velocities of the fall were as great as predicted by the model for the fall angles of 80

  to 60 with his head hitting the floor first, most probably Mr Harte’s skull would

  have been cracked. However he escaped with a small reddish minor bruise and no swelling on

  his forehead, which later turned into a slight bluish bruise also with no swelling, and

  thus required no treatment whatsoever. This strongly suggests that his was a very low

  velocity impact. He did not crash onto the hard tiled floor in the toilet. It further

  suggests a ‘<u><b>crumbling</b></u>’ fall and a slow sliding off the toilet

  seat. This minor injury thus falls into its proper place. It is obvious to me that the

  80 to 60 finite element modelling gives a wrong result and must be rejected. Based on

  the evidence of the minor bruising on the forehead, I infer that the appropriate model

  should be much closer to the 30 to 50 finite element models, where the effects of the

  interventions are not ignored. Not surprisingly, A/Prof Lim’s model, though it is

  only a guide, has predicted a contusion of the scrotum on the toilet seat, which is

  exactly what I think is likely to have happened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><u>iii. Position of scrotum viz a viz the toilet seat</u></p>
<p align="justify">392.    Mr Hart was indeed very cooperative and had

allowed himself to be photographed without his clothes on and seated on the very same

toilet seat from which he fell. With Mr Harte seated on the toilet seat, there was hardly

any gap between his penis and the inner edge of the toilet seat. This is understandable as

the actual toilet seat he used in Gleneagles Hospital was small relative to his large size

and build. Photograph D 51B shows the position of his penis when Mr Harte was seated

normally on the toilet seat. It was estimated from the various scans taken that his

scrotum would be hanging down some 8 cm or more beneath the toilet seat after bending over

fully with his torso touching his thighs, which would have been the final position from

which he fell off the toilet seat. In that position, his scrotum should be most vulnerable

as it would be drooping deepest beneath the level of the toilet seat. Photographs D51D and

D51E give an idea of the extent by which the plaintiff’s scrotum was hanging. </p>
<p align="justify">393.    Consideration must be given to the fact that Mr

Harte’s atrophied testes were already much smaller and presumably lighter in weight

at the time the photographs were taken. Common sense tells me that his scrotum just before

the fall, containing two much larger and heavier testes and aggravated by the usual

swelling after a varicocelectomy, would necessarily droop even deeper into the toilet

bowl. Obviously, a larger scrotum hanging lower beneath the toilet seat is far less likely

to escape contusion in a fall off a toilet seat in an unconscious state when the legs no

longer retained any muscle control to lift the body, and consequently also the scrotum

safely clear of the toilet seat.</p>
<p align="justify">394.    Since Mr Harte fell from a most vulnerable

position when his slightly swollen scrotum after the operation was hanging deepest in the

toilet bowl, the forward movement of the body during the fall would push his penis and

scrotum to be jammed between the perineum and pelvic bone on the top, and the hard but

smooth upper surface of the toilet seat at the bottom, whilst hemmed in at the same time

by the inner thighs on both sides. The resultant effect is a fairly hard squeezing of the

testicles on all sides for a short duration when his heavy body moved forward and fell

eventually, pulling along with it and crushing the scrotum and testes as they passed over

the smooth edged toilet seat, which consequently resulted in the contusion injury. A close

analogy is the extraction of sugar cane juice by pulling sugar cane between two horizontal

rollers set at a gap smaller than the thickness of the sugar cane. The compression of the

sugar cane between the rollers causes the juice to be separated or squeezed out from the

sugar cane fibres. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p align="justify">395.    I fully sympathise with the condition of Mr

Harte. It was a most unfortunate accident. Regrettably, I come to the conclusion based on

the evidence that the mechanics of Mr Harte’s fall were in fact closer to that put

forward by A/Prof Ng than that suggested by A/Prof Lim. </p>
<p align="justify">396.    For all the reasons given, I find on a balance

of probability that both testes suffered contusion injury from the fall. The contusion was

not especially severe but it was sufficient to cause intratesticular microvascular damage

and haemorrhage, which eventually resulted in patchy and non-homogeneous damage to the

smaller testis on the left and much more severe damage to the larger testis on the right

as would be expected when both testes were contused at the same time. This easily explains

the bilateral nature of the damage which, had the cause been surgical in nature, would not

be that readily explainable. </p>
<p align="justify">397.    The contusion not only caused an intratesticular

haematoma, it also led to an extratesticular haematoma, which developed slowly as there

was similarly microvascular and microbleeding in the extratesticular tissues in the

scrotum on both sides of the septum. As the scrotal swelling increased, it also pushed the

scrotum to the size of a mango and added some more pressure on the already congested

testes labouring under their own separate intratesticular haematomas. The combined

pressure aggravated the whole situation, by forcing a serious but not total venous

shutdown within the testes, which led unfortunately to the high degree of vascular and

atrophic damage seen eventually on Mr Harte’s testes. </p>
<p align="justify">398.    I must record my appreciation to A/Prof Lim for

his extremely helpful computer modelling and the short program written on the Microsoft

Excel which enabled me to feed into it different parameters to study the overall effect of

Mrs Harte’s intervention. His dynamic analysis using the finite element modelling

with data from Dempster’s Tables helped me to better envisage the likely trajectories

that an unconscious man falling off a toilet seat might take. With A/Prof Lim’s

simulation, I am reinforced in my view that on a balance of probability, it was the fall

that contused and damaged his testes and not Dr Tan’s surgery. </p>
<p align="justify">399.    Exhibit P55 has a Zip Drive/CD-ROM containing

the computer simulation results. It also contains the Microsoft Excel Program to compute

the energy input from Mrs Harte for various degrees of intervention by her.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>Statistical analysis</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">400.    My conclusion also matches up with my

statistical analysis, which I shall elaborate below.</p>
<p align="justify">401.    If indeed the operation by Dr Tan had caused the

disastrous results, that would represent 2 negligent operations (because he botched up

twice, one on the left varicocelectomy and the other on the right) out of 200 previously

successful varicocele operations on other patients or an estimated average of 1/100 chance

of negligence. Dr Tan, a qualified and practising surgeon of many years, had in fact

performed other far more complicated operations without any reports of negligence. For the

purpose of this analysis, I shall ignore them. (If these other operations are included,

the average statistical probability of negligence on the part of Dr Tan will be further

diminished.)</p>
<p align="justify">402.    Clearly, the bilateral varicocelectomy operation

on Mr Harte comprised two separate and independent operations. To have botched up on both

sides means that Dr Tan was negligent in two consecutive varicocele operations. Prima

facie, that is statistically very remote because the mathematical probability is 1/100

multiplied by 1/100 giving a 1/10,000 chance of it happening consecutively. As Dr Notley

very rightly conceded, it is rare to have infarction and resulting testicular atrophy

after a varicocelectomy. It is even rarer for a bilateral testicular atrophy to take place

after a bilateral varicocele operation. </p>
<p align="justify">403.    Why must it be the case then that on the very

rare occasion (1 out of 10,000) when Dr Tan had botched up his two operations

consecutively, the patient was also found to have sustained a fall, an undisputed fact

before me? Just by statistical probabilities alone, the fact that the plaintiff’s

fall had to coincide with an extremely remote case of an alleged consecutive negligence

renders it statistically most unlikely that the operation was the cause of the bilateral

testicular atrophy. It would be far more likely for the fall to have caused the atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">404.    This statistical evaluation based on pure

probabilities and statistical reasoning is certainly evidence that has some probative

value and is part of the overall circumstantial evidence from which one may infer that it

was the fall and not the operation that had caused the damage. Even without support from

this statistical analysis, I am already satisfied on a balance of probability that the

fall was the cause of the atrophy. </p>
<p align="justify">405.    From the totality of the evidence in this case,

the plaintiff has failed to discharge the requisite burden placed on him by law to prove

on a balance of probability that Dr Tan had not discharged his duty of care to Mr Harte in

his operation. The legal burden of proof remains always with the plaintiff. It is not for

the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant to satisfy the court that he was not negligent. The 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant only has a ‘persuasive burden’ to ensure that the balance of

probability is not tilted against him. </p>
<p align="justify">406.    However, Dr Tan adduced so much evidence that he

managed to tilt the balance against the plaintiff and establish on a balance of

probability that the fall did cause the resultant damage. </p>
<p align="justify">407.    If I am wrong in this finding, I continue to

hold the view that Dr Tan has furnished more than sufficient evidence to discharge his

persuasive burden and rebut the plaintiff’s case sufficiently to the extent that the

plaintiff has not been able to prove to my satisfaction that Dr Tan was negligent in his

operation.</p>
<p align="justify">408.    The matter does not end here, as I have to be

certain that Dr Tan was also fulfilling his duty of care to his patient after the surgery,

which I shall refer to as his post-operative treatment, management and care of his

patient.</p>
<p align="justify"><b> </b></p>
<p>Post-operative negligence</p>
<p><i><b>(a) 1<sup>st</sup> day after surgery.</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">409.    Ms Magdalene Taye, the then clinic assistant

employed by Dr Tan, averred in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that she did not receive

any telephone call from the plaintiff (a) complaining of scrotum pain or swelling, or (b)

requesting for an early appointment. If she did, she would make sure that Dr Tan was

informed. Nothing could be found in the clinical notes to indicate that Mr Harte had

telephoned Dr Tan or the clinic. According to Ms Taye, it was the standard practice to

write down telephone messages for Dr Tan and to provide Dr Tan with the case notes in

relation to the caller. She was affirmative in her evidence that had she received any

complaints from Mr Harte on the telephone, she would definitely let Dr Tan know. If there

was anything else, she would definitely ask him to come back to see Dr Tan. </p>
<p align="justify">410.    There was a staff nurse, Ms Louise Lee Hui San,

who also worked for Dr Tan at that time. She was not called to testify. Ms Kamisah,

another of Dr Tan’s staff, also did not testify. It was not clear if they were the

ones who received Mr Harte’s telephone calls on the morning following the surgery

when Mr Harte desperately tried to contact Dr Tan.</p>
<p align="justify">411.    Dr Tan’s case was that Mr Harte never

called at all. I find that extremely hard to accept given the pain and swelling that Mr

Harte was experiencing the morning after the surgery. I accept Mr Harte’s evidence

that he managed eventually to speak to Dr Tan about his post-operative condition. </p>
<p align="justify">412.    When a doctor hears his patient making such

complaints on the morning after the surgery, what must he do? A/Prof Foo answering for

himself said that he would see the patient at the earliest convenient time. He might see

the patient the next morning if it was not too urgent and the complaint was received after

office hours. </p>
<p align="justify">413.    A/Prof Foo opined that it was not reasonable

post-operative care for a doctor to ignore the urgency and postpone seeing the patient

after learning that his patient had complained of pain and scrotal swelling. He should see

the patient. I agree entirely. Dr Tan should have asked Mr Harte to see him immediately. I

see no good excuse for his failure.</p>
<p align="justify">414.    Even if the telephone call from Mr Harte were to

be received by a nurse and that message was not brought to the attention of the doctor,

the doctor would still be vicariously responsible for the negligent act of his own nurse.

The doctor must be responsible for the management of his own clinic and ensure that there

is a system where important messages are promptly brought to his immediate attention.

Sometimes it may make the difference between life and death. </p>
<p align="justify">415.    In my judgment, Dr Tan had failed in his duty of

care when he did not arrange for Mr Harte to be examined as soon as possible, after having

been told of the extent of his unusual pain and swelling. Dr Tan was clearly negligent in

his post-operative care of Mr Harte. Even if he did not receive the messages from Mr Harte

because none of his nurses brought them to his attention, he would still be vicariously

liable nonetheless. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><i><b>(b) 4<sup>th</sup> day after surgery</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">416.    It is undisputed that the swelling was severe,

whether one goes by Mr Harte’s description of the size of a mango or that of a

grapefruit by Dr Tan. That severity of swelling must be of immediate concern and was

certainly abnormal for a bilateral subinguinal operation. </p>
<p align="justify">417.    Dr Tan testified that he could not palpate the

testicles through the swollen scrotum on 2 May 1997, which was the 1<sup>st</sup>

consultation 4 days after the surgery. Why did he not use the ultrasound machine in his

own office or the more sophisticated hospital CDUS facilities to investigate the condition

of Mr Harte’s testicles? This was very puzzling. Instead he prescribed more medicine

and sent Mr Harte home after reassuring him that the swelling would subside. Strangely, he

used his own ultrasound machine to examine the plaintiff’s scrotum several days later

on 9 May 1997 after the swelling had subsided and the testes were palpable, when one would

have expected him at least to have used his own ultrasound machine on 2 May 1997 for the

very reason that Mr Harte’s testes were not palpable then. </p>
<p align="justify">418.    A/Prof Foo opined that it was <u><b>dangerous</b></u>

to send the plaintiff home with some medication under those circumstances and that an

ultrasound should have been done first. If the ultrasound results show a pair of big

swollen testes, A/Prof Foo said, "<i>Yes, we might want to <u><b>explore and drain

the haematoma</b></u>, your Honour …. To reduce the pressure on the testes</i>."

In his opinion, it might be too late after 4 days, but some testicular tissue might still

be saved. He would have immediately drained the testis by cutting the tunica, and let the

blood and blood clots flow off. He would not have just prescribed medicine and sent him

home. According to A/Prof Foo, this was the "<u><i><b>minimum standard he would

expect of any other urologist in the same position</b></i></u>". </p>
<p align="justify">419.    A/Prof Li also agreed that he would use an

ultrasound machine to check the swollen and non-palpable scrotum. If done, I think the

CDUS would probably show up a dangerous and severe intratesticular swelling in both testes

requiring emergency treatment and drainage. </p>
<p align="justify">420.    I would regard the views of A/Prof Foo and

A/Prof Li as being representative of a body of responsible, reasonable and respectable

urologists as to what ought to or should have been done. I believe what was said is also

equally applicable in relation to the proper treatment that should have been given on 29

April 1997, had Dr Tan acted responsibly and examined Mr Harte on that very morning after

the surgery when he received complaints of unusual pain and swelling.</p>
<p align="justify">421.    An opinion that there is no necessity to explore

and drain the haematoma after discovering the dangerous and fairly substantial

intratesticular haematoma in both testes is to my mind not a reasonable or responsible one

that any respectable and competent urologist could honestly hold. It does not make any

sense not to try to do something to save the situation but let the dangerous and severe

bilateral intratesticular haematoma take its normal course, with the foreseeable and

likely result of bilateral atrophy if the dangerous intratesticular haematoma is not

alleviated immediately. Whether or not, the whole set of testes can be saved is

irrelevant. So long as there exists a reasonable chance of saving some portion of it, it

justifies and mandates the operative step to surgically explore and drain the

intratesticular haematomas, unless of course the patient himself, after being properly

informed, decides for himself that there is no necessity for such an invasive operative

procedure.</p>
<p align="justify">422.    In a 1989 paper "<i>Blunt Scrotal Trauma:

Emergency Department Evaluation and Management</i>", Munter and Faleski stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Blunt scrotal trauma can cause significant injuries which if not

  correctly diagnosed and treated may result in profound morbidity, including loss of a

  testicle…. Ultrasonography recently has become widely reported as a useful modality

  in the evaluation of blunt scrotal trauma… </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">423.    I would have thought therefore that any

reasonably competent urologist should have realised the importance of using ultrasound to

investigate a severe scrotal swelling particularly where the testes could not be palpated.

It is a breach of his duty of care simply to assume that there would not be any

intratesticular haematoma, and hence, dispense with an ultrasound. I would regard that

omission as one which any responsible and reasonably competent urologist in the shoes of

Dr Tan would not omit to do in the face of a scrotal swelling the size of a mango, with

the testes not palpable. Clearly, it was a poor exercise of medical and clinical judgment,

which I do not expect of a responsible and competent urologist.</p>
<p align="justify">424.    When the testes were not palpable through the

scrotal haematoma, there is all the more reason to order an ultrasound to check for

intratesticular haematoma, which Dr Tan as an experienced and competent urologist should

have known can be dangerous. His admission that he did palpate for the testicles to my

mind indicates that he wanted to check for intratesticular haematoma. Otherwise, why

palpate for the testicles in the first place? Dr Tan could not be heard to say that he did

not at that time realise the importance of checking for intratesticular haematoma. </p>
<p align="justify">425.    In my opinion, the clinical examination,

investigation and treatment by Dr Tan on 2 May 1997 were clearly not up to the appropriate

standard of post-operative treatment and care expected of a reasonably competent

specialist urologist. I also observe that Dr Tan failed to record in his clinical notes

the colour, shape or the size of the scrotal haematoma although he admitted that the size

of the swelling, its colour, his inability to palpate the testicles, tenderness of the

scrotum should all have been recorded. A lackadaisical attitude seems to have been taken

by Dr Tan over contemporaneous recording of important and significant details of clinical

observations and findings. I note also the extremely brief operation notes kept by Dr Tan.

Reliance on pure memory for such matters is certainly not good medical practice. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Record of ‘No pain’</u></p>
<p align="justify">426.    Looking at the drugs prescribed, Dr Tan appears

to have given the plaintiff strong drugs to resolve the inflammation. Dr Tan was

questioned why he had prescribed painkillers (i.e. Voltaren) when he asserted that the

plaintiff had not experienced any pain, as stated in his entry ‘No pain’ in his

clinical notes dated 2 May 1997. Interestingly in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Dr

Tan left out mentioning Voltaren from the list of medication he prescribed on 2 May 1997. </p>
<p align="justify">427.    Dr Tan maintained that he gave Voltaren for

inflammation, thereby suggesting that it was not prescribed because of the pain. When

confronted with the fact that he also prescribed Danzen, which is an anti-inflammatory

drug, he explained that he was using a ‘combination’ of anti-inflammatory drugs.

</p>
<p align="justify">428.    As a result of some exchange of letters between

the plaintiff’s and 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s solicitors over the question

whether the words ‘No pain’ in his clinical notes for 2 May 1997 were written

contemporaneously because of the different ink colour, Dr Tan conceded that the entry was

likely to be filled in later but he could not remember exactly when. Amazingly, Dr Tan

said that it was even possible that he could have inserted the words ‘No pain’

just before he submitted his report to the Singapore Medical Council but this would be

about 1 year and 3 to 4 months after his medical examination on 2 May 1997!</p>
<p align="justify">429.    If so, this must have been inserted as an

afterthought. It could hardly be regarded as anything close to a contemporaneous record of

his clinical findings on 2 May 1997. </p>
<p align="justify">430.    When his counsel asked him whether the plaintiff

suffered any pain on 2 May 1997, his evidence was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A: Under oath, I cannot be sure that he specifically said that he was

  not in pain. But I am sure that he did not say that he was in pain.</p>
<p align="justify">…..</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : Did you ask Mr Harte if he felt any pain on 2 May ’97?</p>
<p align="justify">A : I believe I did.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : What was his answer? </p>
<p align="justify">A : He must have said that it was not severe or nothing much at all.

  The reason I say this is that as I mentioned earlier that the unusual things or the

  abnormal things, or the specific things, or points raised to me, are things which I would

  record as soon as I can. In general, normal things or non-events, are not recorded, and

  this you can see from the rest of the notes which generally do not record normal findings.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : So therefore ‘No pain’ is not an abnormal finding?</p>
<p align="justify">A : ‘No pain’ is what I consider a non-event. … ‘No

  pain’ is a finding in relation to the haematoma, which should have been put in,

  including other details like size, colour, any inability to palpate the testicles through

  the haematoma and whether it was tender to palpate and the ensuing discussion on what to

  do next and the treatment plan for haematoma. All this in retrospect should have been

  included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">431.    If it was a non-event, then why did he take all

the trouble later to insert ‘No pain’ to his clinical notes subsequently? If he

felt that the size, colour and inability to palpate as well as ‘No pain’ should

have been put in because they were all in relation to the haematoma, it is remarkable that

he should decide to insert only the words ‘No pain’ in his clinical notes but

leave out the rest of the relevant details of the haematoma. Clearly, it was selective

insertion of relevant details by Dr Tan at work here.</p>
<p align="justify">432.    What is most telling was the way he tried to

explain away the rather unusual phenomenon of swelling without pain. He said that in his

experience, he had seen several scrotal haematomas following operations like herniagraphy,

vasectomy, orchidectomy, varicocelectomy where there is usually no pain in spite of the

scrotal haematoma because these haematomas stretch the scrotal skin and they look more

impressive than they are actually painful. His diagnosis at that time was that Mr Harte

had a scrotal haematoma but he did not suspect that he had intratesticular haematoma. Dr

Tan then said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A: … In retrospect, after asking myself what happened to him, I

  believe he had both types of haematoma [i.e. (a) scrotal haematoma or extratesticular

  haematoma and (b) intratesticular haematoma].</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u>Ct : In which case would he have pain?</u></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><u>A :Yes. He should have felt pain for the intratesticular

  haematomas.</u></b></p>
<p align="justify">Ct : So I ask you again, did the patient answer you that he felt

  pain…., you did ask him the question if he felt any pain on 2 May ’97?</p>
<p align="justify">A : I am relying on what I recollect on that day, and as I mentioned

  earlier I can remember him walking through the door, still able to joke about his

  condition – by saying he has got big balls. And as would be an automatic standard

  question, I would have asked him about pain. And I remember that pain on that day was not

  an issue. All I can recall is that he did not indicate to me that he was in severe pain.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : So he indicated to you that he was in some pain?</p>
<p align="justify">A : No. He allowed me to examine him and I palpated the haematoma, and

  it was not tender and I have no reason to suspect that what he had was nothing more than

  the normal scrotal haematoma.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : For the last time, when you asked him whether he felt any pain,

  what was his answer?</p>
<p align="justify">A : His answer was ‘No’.</p>
<p align="justify">Ct : So did you believe him?</p>
<p align="justify">A : I have no reason not to believe him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">433.    During this part of his evidence, Dr Tan was

particularly evasive. From the above evidence, I am inclined to believe that Dr Tan was

not truthful in his testimony. Obviously, Mr Harte must be suffering from a substantial

intratesticular haematoma in both testes in order to suffer from bilateral testicular

atrophy in the first place. That intratesticular haematoma stretching the tunica albuginea

must be painful for Mr Harte. It is inherently incredible that Mr Harte, upon being

questioned by Dr Tan whether he felt any pain, would have answered the opposite of what he

was feeling at that time. I find as a fact that Mr Harte had complained of pain in his

scrotum to Dr Tan on 2 May 1997.</p>
<p align="justify">434.    The fact that Voltaren, a painkiller, had been

prescribed corroborates the plaintiff’s evidence that he was in pain. In my judgment,

Dr Tan had lied that the plaintiff was not in pain on 2 May 1997. The words ‘No

pain’ were a fabrication inserted by Dr Tan to his clinical notes for reasons best

known to himself. Plaintiff’s counsel had submitted that the words were inserted just

before Dr Tan’s reply to the Singapore Medical Council to explain the mishap. </p>
<p align="justify">435.    Because of this false insertion of ‘No

pain’, Dr Tan had to tally up with his other story that he did not receive any phone

calls from Mr Harte prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> May 1997 complaining of the pain and swelling.

I did not believe Dr Tan that he had not received these calls. This brings me to my other

finding that his failure to instruct Mr Harte to come immediately to see him upon hearing

the plaintiff’s painful condition and swelling, knowing full well that a surgery had

been performed and that the substantial swelling was extremely unusual, was something that

a responsible and reasonably competent urologist surgeon would not have done. Plainly, Dr

Tan had not taken sufficient care by asking the plaintiff to come for a medical check-up

and he was dismissive of what the plaintiff had told him. He was overly confident that his

surgery had gone on well and hence, there was no need to call Mr Harte in to be seen

immediately despite all the complaints by Mr Harte on the telephone to him on the day

after the surgery.</p>
<p align="justify">436.    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Dr Tan,

having suspected that the operation had gone wrong, tried to cover up his tracks when he

finally saw Mr Harte on the 4<sup>th</sup> day after the surgery. Counsel for the

plaintiff mentioned several instances of Dr Tan’s conduct from which a cover-up by Dr

Tan could be inferred, but I do not find it necessary to deal specifically with them.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><b>Trespass or battery</b></p>
<p align="justify">437.    Having regard to my finding that the surgery was

not the cause of the damage, I need not address the question of trespass and battery. In

my opinion, this head of claim is unmeritorious and in any event, it was not pursued with

any vigour by counsel for the plaintiff. The plaintiff had in fact signed a ‘Consent

for operation’ form for his bilateral varicocelectomy on 28 April 1997. Once there is

consent in law, which I find there was for the operation, the operation itself cannot

constitute trespass or battery. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p><b>Vicarious liability of the 2nd defendants</b></p>
<p align="justify">438.    The plaintiff did not dispute that Dr Tan runs a

private medical practice at his own clinic. He was never employed by the hospital. In the

course of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff clarified that the vicarious liability of

the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants did not arise from employment but arose purely from an

agency arrangement. </p>
<p align="justify">439.    As I have found that Dr Tan’s negligence

during the surgery is not proven, the question of vicarious liability for the surgery

performed in the hospital does not even arise. The plaintiff’s claim against the

hospital must necessarily fail. Since the hospital has been dragged in purely on that

basis, it may well have an impact on the question of legal costs, in particular whether Dr

Tan must bear any part of the hospital’s costs in defending the plaintiff’s

suit. For this reason, I will state my finding on vicarious liability.</p>
<p align="justify">440.    Without going into the detailed reasons, it

suffices for me to say that Dr Tan was not an agent of the hospital. Neither had the

hospital held out Dr Tan as its agent for the purpose of the surgery. The hospital merely

supplies hospital facilities and certain nursing care services to independent surgeons

(including Dr Tan) who are free to choose any particular hospital where they have

admitting privileges to perform their surgery and treat their private patients. Gleneagles

Hospital has no control over how these independent surgeons privately treat and manage

their own patients, even when the hospital facilities are being used.</p>
<p align="justify">441.    I agree with counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants that the hospital is not vicariously liable to the plaintiff for any alleged

negligent acts or omissions of Dr Tan, which have nothing to do with the hospital

facilities and nursing care services provided. Mr Harte sought out and contracted with Dr

Tan directly to treat his infertility and operate on him. He never sought those services

from the hospital. Since the hospital never provided the services of a specialist surgeon

to operate on Mr Harte, the hospital was not under any duty in law to see that the

specialist surgeon engaged by Mr Harte himself had exercised due care. That appears to me

to be determinative of the issue of vicarious liability. If indeed there was any alleged

principal and agency relationship, the principal party treating, managing and operating on

Mr Harte appears to me to be Dr Tan himself and not the hospital. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Assessment of Damages</b></p>
<p align="justify">442.    First, I shall determine the damages on the

assumption that Dr Tan is liable for all the damage suffered by Mr Harte. Second, I shall

assess the chance, as best as I can, of Dr Tan saving some parts of his testes had he

asked Mr Harte to see him immediately on being told of the unusual swelling and pain on 29

April 1997 and treated him appropriately. The damages will then be discounted accordingly

on the basis that the degree of damage might have been far less catastrophic had Dr Tan

not been negligent post-operatively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><b>(a) General Damages for pain and suffering</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">The general damages for pain and suffering are assessed as follows: </p>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><b>
<p>(b) Special Damages </p></b></i>
<p>Expenses already incurred may be divided into 4 categories: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    Medical expenses incurred before the operation</p>
<p>(b)    Medical expenses incurred for the operation itself</p>
<p>(c)    Local medical expenses incurred after the operation</p>
<p>(d)    Overseas medical expenses incurred after the operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">443.    With my finding that Dr Tan was not negligent in

his operation, the medical expenses under (a) and (b) cannot be allowed. From the

evidence, it appears that Mr Harte was reimbursed for most of these expenses by his

insurance company in New York. </p>
<p align="justify">444.    Items (c) and (d) will be allowed in principle

as they comprise expenses incurred after the post-operative negligence of Dr Tan. Since Mr

Harte was on paid home leave, I consider it reasonable to seek advice and a second opinion

from the doctors in New York, and in particular Dr Dubin who had treated him previously.</p>
<p align="justify">445.    However, these expenses must be properly proved.

The legal burden is on the plaintiff to prove his special damages. But no supporting

documentary evidence was tendered in court for most of his expenses listed in his

statement of claim. It is also unclear whether he has obtained full reimbursement. He said

‘<i>I have to check all my records. The way health insurance works in U.S., not

everything is paid 100%. I certainly submitted the bills in the form of health claims and

I was certainly reimbursed for those costs.</i>’ When probed further, the plaintiff

clarified that he had received reimbursement of 30 to 50 % of his total medical bill

because there were deductions. From the statement of special damages served pursuant to

Order 18 Rule 12 (1A)(b) of the Rules of Court 1997, it appears that items (c) and (d)

total S$ 4992.70 and US $4982.08. </p>
<p align="justify">446.    Mr Lek for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants argued

that where there was reimbursement of those medical expenses by Mr Harte’s health

insurance provided either by the company or the Health Care Plan in the USA, Mr Harte

suffered no loss. As such, he could not submit a claim for damages in this suit as that

would be making a double claim. I disagree. </p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>i. Claims with reimbursement</u></p>
<p align="justify">447.    A defendant tortfeasor has no valid defence to a

claim of damages from an insured and reimbursed employee plaintiff. Such an insured and

reimbursed employee plaintiff has all the rights intact against the defendant tortfeasor.

The defendant tortfeasor’s liability to pay the plaintiff is not affected by any

reimbursement that the plaintiff has obtained from his employer or insurance. After the

plaintiff has received payment of the damages, it is a matter between him and his employer

or insurance whether the monies earlier paid by his employer or insurance are to be

recovered. The right of subrogation is separate from the issue before me whether the

defendant tortfeasor must pay for the damages suffered by the plaintiff. It need not

concern the court here.</p>
<p align="justify">448.    Medical expenses or health insurance policies

are normally regarded as indemnity policies, and thus attract the right of subrogation.

Subrogation applies to all insurance contracts, which are contracts of indemnity. The

doctrine of subrogation is of course, that the insured cannot make a profit from his loss

and that for any profit he does make, he is accountable in equity to his insurer.</p>
<p align="justify">449.    In <i>Napier v Hunter</i> [1993] 2 WLR 42 the

House of Lords was unanimous in holding that insurers have an equitable interest in money

received by the insured. The opinions contained reviews of the history of the doctrine of

subrogation, which indicate that at the very least, it developed in equity as well as at

common law. The principles establish that the insurers have an enforceable equitable

interest in the damages payable by the tortfeasor.</p>
<p align="justify">450.    The equitable interest of the insurers is to be

satisfied by saying that they have a lien or charge over the money in question, rather

than by saying that the money was impressed with a trust. Thus, if the insured who has

received the money goes bankrupt, the insurers can recover the money in priority to the

claims of other unsecured creditors; <i>Re Miller, Gibb &amp; Co</i> [1957] 1 WLR 703,

approved by the House of Lords in <i>Napier v Hunter</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">451.    As there is a clear listing of the

post-operative medical expenses with full particulars given (see statement of special

damages), I do not think that there can be much dispute that they were in fact incurred

although the supporting receipts were not produced. I do not think that I should penalise

the plaintiff and disallow his claim here simply because he had not produced the receipts

perhaps because they were given to the insurance company or his company to obtain

reimbursement, and hence were no longer available for production before me.</p>
<p align="justify">452.    I therefore allow in full the expenses under

items (c) and (d) incurred after the operation, which total <b><u>S$ 4,992.70</u> and <u>US

$4,982.08</u></b> respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>ii. Air Fares for overseas treatment</u></p>
<p align="justify">453.    No loss was suffered under items 1.3.1, 1.3.2

and 1.5.1 in the statement of special damages because the plaintiff never incurred any

expenses for the return airfares. His employer paid for the airfares between New York and

Singapore for his April and October 1998 trips, including his third trip in 1999, where he

took advantage of his home leave and a business trip to London, to seek medical

consultation in New York. These return trips were part of his perquisites under his

employment contract and were consumed principally either as his home leave or in the

course of work for the company, and not because of the medical treatment which I regard as

merely incidental. Clearly, medical consultation was not the primary reason for those

trips back home to New York. I therefore disallow Mr Harte’s claim for airfares

amounting to a total of US$23,100, which should not be mounted at all as they stand on a

completely different footing from the claim for his post-operative medical expenses for

which he had been partially reimbursed. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(c) Future Expenses</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">I classify the future expenses into the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    Cost of fertility treatment comprising two

  procedures viz TESE (testicular sperm extraction) and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm

  injection) at Cornell Medical Centre, New York. Microdissection TESE is the surgical

  removal of sperm from the testes or epididymis under optical magnification. ICSI

  encompasses the removal of ova (eggs) from the wife and then the laboratory injection of

  sperm into each ovum for fertilisation.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    Loss of earnings having to return to a lower

  paying job in New York because of the fertility treatment.</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    Cost of hormone replacement therapy</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">454.    I accept the principle that the plaintiff is not

allowed to claim any expense that would have been incurred regardless of the tort of

negligence committed against him: <i>Cutler v Vauxhall Motors Ltd</i> [1970] 2 All ER 56.

The plaintiff there was not entitled to recover damages for the surgery, as there was a

reasonable probability that even if he had not suffered the accident, he would not have

avoided the surgery for the severe varicose veins present in his legs even before the

accident. The court is therefore required to have regard to contingencies and their

probabilities when assessing the future expenses flowing from the tortuous act.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>i. Cost of fertility treatment</u></p>
<p align="justify">455.    The plaintiff had a pre-existing condition of

poor sperm quality even before he consulted Dr Tan. Despite trying for 3 years, the wife

could not conceive naturally. By then, she was 36 years of age. Apparently the poor

fertility of Mr Harte was compounded by some medical problems on Mrs Harte’s part.

She herself had a small cyst in her left ovary and it was explained to her by Dr Jones

that she would have irregular menses. </p>
<p align="justify">456.    Dr Dubin himself advised the couple to consider

IVF should his left varicocelectomy prove to be unsuccessful. Dr Dubin’s left

varicocelectomy operation did not help much. After the atrophy, Dr Dubin advised Mr Harte

in April 1998 to consider other options like donor insemination or adoption. He repeated

that advice on 27 October 1999. These to me are more realistic options.</p>
<p align="justify">457.    A/Prof Li Man Kay testified that ICSI -

‘Intracytoplasmic Sperm Insertion’ would have been the recommended method of

fertility treatment for the couple, <u><b>even before</b></u> the bilateral

varicocelectomy because the plaintiff had weak sperm and the chances that his sperm would

be able to penetrate the egg would be very low. Artificial insemination by injection of

sperm into the vagina and uterus and the test-tube baby method (where the egg would be

mixed with the sperms in a test-tube) were both not viable in Mr Harte’s case. </p>
<p align="justify">458.    Dr Schlegel said that he would have recommended

intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilisation (although he later said that he would

only have recommended sperm washing with medication for stimulation of the female partner

to produce eggs). This procedure of sperm washing and stimulation of the woman would cost

between US$300 to US$2000. It would take typically 2 to 3 attempts for a couple to achieve

a pregnancy, therefore costing a total between US$600 to US$9,000. For in vitro

fertilisation, Dr Schlegel said that the cost would be approximately US $13,000 per

attempt. Whereas in the case of the TESE and ICSI, the total cost for each attempt is

US$28,000, of which US$16,000 is for the ICSI and all portions of the in vitro

fertilisation, US$4,000 is for hospital fees, $1,000 for anaesthesia and approximately

US$7,000 is for testicular sperm extraction or the TESE component. </p>
<p align="justify">459.    Dr Notley also said that if he had been Mr

Harte, he would have tried intracytoplasmic sperm injection (i.e. ICSI).</p>
<p align="justify">460.    Based on the above evidence, it is most probable

that Mrs Harte will have to undergo an ICSI procedure in any case. Even with sperm

washing, his weak sperms will not likely fertilize his wife’s eggs. His inability all

these years to impregnate his wife is testimony to the fact that his sperms simply have no

ability to do what they are supposed to do. Any concentration by centrifuging the sperms

and making them more concentrated is not going to make much difference in my opinion.

Hence, the ICSI procedure will still be needed even if Mr Harte did not suffer any

testicular atrophy.</p>
<p align="justify">461.    Hence, based on the principle stated in <i>Cutler

v Vauxhall Motors Ltd,</i> I do not think that the cost of his wife’s ICSI procedure

should be included as part of the damages as it is not an expense that could be avoided at

all.</p>
<p align="justify">462.    As Mr Harte has returned to his hometown in New

York, it seems reasonable that he seeks treatment from Dr Schlegel, who now advocates the

microdissection TESE and ICSI procedure. There is some scepticism whether the

microdissection procedure is more effective than the standard TESE/ICSI procedure.

However, the couple firmly believes that Mr Harte’s condition necessitates the

special treatment by Dr Schlegel. I do not think they can be faulted if they pin their

hopes desperately on him. Given these circumstances, the comparatively cheaper cost of

alternative or similar treatment in Singapore is beside the point. </p>
<p align="justify">463.    Dr Fong Yang had testified that frozen sperm

could be stored indefinitely without any degradation in the sperm quality. This also

avoids the problem of degradation of sperm quality with age and the risk of multiple

testicular operations to remove testicular tissue to obtain fresh sperm each time. </p>
<p align="justify">464.    In the paper ‘<i>Physiological consequences

of testicular sperm extraction’</i> by Peter Schlegel and Li-Ming Su, the risk of

permanent devascularisation of the testicle whenever a TESE surgery is performed is

recognised. The authors said:</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to the transient effects of a biopsy on spermatogenesis,

  permanent devascularization of testis may occur after TESE procedures. …we postulate

  that multiple incisions in the tunica albuginea used to retrieve spermatozoa may result in

  interruption of a sufficient proportion of testicular arteries to devascularize the

  testis. Therefore, <b>avoiding multiple incisions in the tunica albuginea as well as

  minimizing repeated TESE attempts is important to avoid the risk of permanent ischaemic

  testicular injury from TESE</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">…….</p>
<p align="justify">We also recommend that at least 6 months elapse before a repeat TESE

  procedure is performed. <b>The banking of frozen testicular tissue or spermatozoa

  retrieved during TESE procedures is advised to decrease the need for repeat TESE attempts

  and minimize injury to the testis.</b>" </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">465.    However, the plaintiff inflated his claim by

computing damages based on 10 cycles of TESE/ICSI. In answer to the request for further

and better particulars, the following reasons were given for requiring as many as 10

attempts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    The treatment involves the extraction of sperm

  material from the left testis for storage of the same and subsequent use of the same to

  fertilise an egg to be extracted from the plaintiff’s wife.</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    Dr Schlegel and his medical team utilise a

  surgical technique that enables multiple attempts to be made at extracting sperm material

  from the left testis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a.    Even though viable sperm material may be extracted

    successfully on each attempt, the said sperm material may not successfully fertilise the

    egg obtained from the plaintiff’s wife. In such an instance, the extraction process

    will have to be repeated --</p>
<p align="justify">b.    Until a successful fertilisation takes place or</p>
<p align="justify">c.    Until no further sperm material can be found or</p>
<p align="justify">d.    Until no further eggs can be extracted from the

    plaintiff’s wife.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">466.    Nowhere was it stated that the 10 cycles were

required because Mr and Mrs Harte wanted to have a big family because they liked children

very much. To my mind, that evidence in court was an afterthought to bolster their

evidence that 10 cycles were needed. With Mrs Harte already at 38 years of age, I believe

that there is a limit to the number of pregnancies that she can safely have. There is also

a risk that multiple incisions on the tunica albuginea as well as repeated TESE attempts

may cause permanent ischaemic testicular injury. </p>
<p align="justify">467.    Considerable difficulties lay ahead for the

couple as shown by their first attempt in June 2000 in the Cornell University Centre for

Reproductive Medicine and Infertility. Mrs Harte failed to produce sufficient mature eggs.

She produced only 4 follicles (immature eggs). The whole procedure had to be called off.

Whether this expensive method is going to work at all for Mr and Mrs Harte is unclear. </p>
<p align="justify">468.    Dr Schlegel has testified that if he fails on

his first attempt to find any sperm, he will not make any further attempts. Dr

Dubin’s own opinion is extremely guarded for the procedure advocated by Dr Goldstein

and Dr Schlegel. </p>
<p align="justify">469.    Given these problems, I am already very generous

to allow 3 cycles of the invasive TESE procedure to obtain sperm for the ICSI procedure,

which is as far as I can reasonably go. Unused sperms should be frozen for future use as

stated by Dr Schlegel in his own paper instead of resorting to too many expensive TESE

operations with their attendant and not inconsiderable risks.</p>
<p align="justify">470.    I will use Dr Schlegel’s estimate that the

TESE component of his advocated procedure costs approximately US$7,000. 3 cycles thus add

up to US$21,000 plus an estimate of US $4,500 for the use of frozen-thawed sperms for any

attempts in between or thereafter. Since there will be further pain and suffering and

inconvenience from these 3 operations, I award a further US$1,500 x 3 for Mr Harte’s

pain, suffering and inconvenience during the TESE operations. Total award here is thus <u><b>US$30,000.</b></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>ii. Loss of Earnings</u></p>
<p align="justify">471.    Mr Harte testified that he gave up his job in

Singapore and returned to New York strictly for medical treatment. They decided to leave

Singapore after they found out about Dr Schlegel and his team. After some research, they

believed that they would have a reasonable chance of having children of their own using

the microdissection TESE–ICSI method practised by Dr Schlegel. Clearly, Mr Harte

wanted to portray an impression that he was forced to leave his well paid job behind and

leave Singapore because they badly wanted to get treatment from the best medical centre

for the TESE-ICSI procedure at Cornell University Medical Centre in order to have their

children of their own. So they decided to return to New York. </p>
<p align="justify">472.    Mr Lek rightly pointed out that the plaintiff

did not act on any reliable medical advice before deciding to undergo fertility treatment

in New York. The decision to leave Singapore was made <b>even before</b> any consultation

with Dr Schlegel. </p>
<p align="justify">473.    Mrs Harte testified that they decided to leave

Singapore after they obtained the biopsy result of 21 October 1998 from the Cabrini

Medical Centre. She did not relate that decision to the need to seek medical treatment in

New York. In her affidavit, she said that the full extent of her husband’s injury

only became apparent in October 1997. It left her sorely depressed. She found herself

crying uncontrollably every day without warning. She started to hate Singapore and

anything associated with it. She rarely left her house. She also admitted that she wanted

to leave Singapore. Her bad feelings about Singapore would have set in by

September/October 1997. In fact, Dr Tan informed them that Mr Harte would not be able to

father a child on 11 October 1997. Given her strong feelings against staying on in

Singapore and that the plaintiff was a person who would respect and give consideration to

her wishes, it is not likely in my opinion that the plaintiff would have extended his

contract to stay on in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">474.    In all probability, the plaintiff and his wife

had already decided to leave Singapore because they felt that Dr Tan’s surgery was

solely responsible for the bilateral atrophy. As a consequence of my finding, the basis

for that belief has turned out to be erroneous. Should I award damages founded on a course

of action flowing from the wrong basis? Perhaps I should not.</p>
<p align="justify">475.    Most importantly, they decided to leave

Singapore even before consulting Dr Schlegel. They had not even planned or decided how

they were going to afford the fertility treatments. </p>
<p align="justify">476.    The documents of E D &amp; F Man show that the

plaintiff was ‘assigned’ or ‘seconded’ by his employers, E D &amp;F

Man Inc, to E D &amp; F Man Cocoa (Singapore) Pte Ltd for only a period of 3 years

commencing on 1 August 1996 and after which period, it was stipulated that the Plaintiff

would have to return to the US. Mr Trevor Johnson could not recall if there was any

documentation showing that the plaintiff was to be employed in Singapore for longer than 3

years.</p>
<p align="justify">477.    Mr Johnson confirmed that he never made any

formal recommendation to the management committee of the cocoa division that the plaintiff

was to succeed him. </p>
<p align="justify">478.    If as the plaintiff claimed that they ‘only

decided to leave Singapore after [they] found out about Dr Schlegel and his team’,

this would have been at the earliest sometime after Dr Dubin’s letter to the

plaintiff dated 27 October 1999, wherein Dr Dubin suggested that Mr Harte might wish to

consult with Drs. Goldstein and Schlegel at the New York Hospital, who had reported being

able to remove sperm such as his and together with ICSI, achieve embryos and pregnancies.</p>
<p align="justify">479.    There should have been some documentary evidence

in E D &amp; F Man of an extension of the plaintiff’s contract to stay on but there

was none. His 3 year term ended on 31 July 1999. Instead, Mr Johnson said that he had

already recruited the plaintiff’s replacement (Mr Paul Hutchinson) from London, who

joined E D &amp; F Man (Singapore) in July 1999, which meant that he would have looked for

a replacement even before that date. The plaintiff was obviously lying in this regard. </p>
<p align="justify">480.    At the end of his 3 years’ secondment (plus

a few more months to help his successor acquaint himself with his job), the plaintiff left

for home as was the arrangement. A Form IR21 dated 15 November 1999, which E D &amp; F Man

Asia Pte Ltd submitted to the Comptroller of Income Tax (P12), stated the "Reason for

Cessation/Departure" as "CONTRACT EXPIRED". It is pertinent to note that

his employer E D &amp; F Man was also having some ownership changes and restructuring at

that time. The divestment exercise of the agricultural part of the business resulted in

some headcount reduction in the sugar trading office in Singapore although Mr Harte

maintained that there was no reduction in the cocoa trading office where he worked. </p>
<p align="justify">481.    If indeed his company wanted to extend his

contract, he could easily have stayed on in Singapore and still have his TESE done in New

York. I do not think his work would suffer on account of perhaps a short trip of about a

week a year to New York just for his TESE. It could also be timed to coincide with his

home leave, which could be extended by a week if Mr Harte were to be so calculative about

his leave. Given the speed and ready availability of air travel today, I do not think that

it would be so inconvenient to undergo day surgery treatment in New York for his part of

the TESE, and thereafter to fly back. </p>
<p align="justify">482.    Clearly the fertility treatment sought in New

York would not require him and his wife to be stationed permanently in New York. Dr Fong

Yang and A/Prof Li confirmed that both the TESE and ICSI are day surgeries. The male

patient’s presence is required for only 1 day and the female patient is required for

a period of 3 to 4 days according to Dr Fong Yang. The pre-operative medicine obviously

can be taken in Singapore if Mr Harte were to be based in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">483.    According to Dr Schlegel, the plaintiff would be

required in New York for only about a week (of which he would have to be available one or

two days beforehand because of the uncertainty of the timing of the ovulation, then he

would stay in hospital for approximately one day for the actual TESE procedure and another

three or four days for convalescence). Mrs Harte on the other hand would have to be in New

York for about 3 to 4 weeks for the ICSI procedure. She would be treated with hormones for

about 2 weeks and monitored for multiple egg production. After retrieval of her eggs, the

sperm extracted from Mr Harte using the TESE procedure would then be injected into them. 3

days later, the fertilised embryos would be transferred back to her and she would need to

stay in the hospital for several days to a week for additional monitoring. All this would

add up to about 3 to 4 weeks in New York for her. But Mrs Harte, who was not working in

Singapore at that time, should have no difficulty staying 3 to 4 weeks in New York if the

need arose. I did not consider the time needed for the TESE-ICSI procedure to be so

extravagant that Mr Harte could not hold his job in Singapore whilst undergoing this

fertility treatment by Dr Schlegel in New York. </p>
<p align="justify">484.    Given the risks of the procedure, Dr Schlegel

further said that the procedure should only be repeated not more than once every 6 months.

Since I am allowing only 3 procedures as a reasonable number, it is certainly not going to

be disruptive at all. Surely the day surgery TESE procedure for Mr Harte can be fitted

within his annual home leave of 25 days per year (and extended if necessary) if he really

wants to continue working in Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">485.    I do not believe at all that the need for

fertility treatment by Dr Schlegel was his sole or main reason to return to New York. He

has not proved on a balance of probability that he would have been able to stay on in

Singapore for the long term but for his need for fertility treatment in New York. </p>
<p align="justify">486.    In conclusion, I cannot accept that the TESE

treatment at Cornell would be so disruptive that Mr Harte is forced to give up his job in

Singapore. I do not find any cogent reason to justify the drastic measure by Mr Harte of

leaving a well paid job in Singapore for a much lower paying job in New York. Some

inconvenience there may be, having to go to New York each time for the TESE. But that is

not a sufficient reason. The plaintiff always has a duty to mitigate his loss. Instead of

trying to mitigate the loss, the plaintiff here increased his alleged loss without good

reason, if indeed the decision to resign from his position in Singapore was wholly his

(which I do not believe was the case in any event), and not because his services in

Singapore were no longer needed by the company after the expiry of his contract (which I

believe was more likely the case).</p>
<p align="justify">487.    In fact, I regard his resignation to take up a

lower paying job in New York so that he could go for a few day surgeries (spread out

perhaps over 2 or 3 years) as most unreasonable. I cannot allow his loss of salary to be

borne by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The plaintiff has to live with his own decision. </p>
<p align="justify">488.    I thus reject Mr Harte’s claim for his

alleged loss of earning amounting to S$2.4 million. </p>
<p> </p>
<p align="justify"><u>iii. Cost of hormone replacement therapy</u></p>
<p align="justify">489.    Mr Harte further claimed the cost of hormone

replacement therapy in New York at US$525 per month for 45 years based on a projected life

span of 78 years. Dr Futterwie did not testify to these expenses, which the plaintiff

computed at US$283,500. </p>
<p align="justify">490.    The cost of US$525 includes consultation and

blood test every month, presumably to monitor for any development of liver cancer as a

result of the hormone therapy. The actual cost of the ‘testoderm’ drug is

US$118.49 per month. </p>
<p align="justify">491.    Dr Jimmy Beng stated that Mr Harte would have to

be closely monitored with liver function tests but there was no hard and fast rule. In my

opinion, that monthly consultation (US$246.60 per consultation) and blood test (US$160 per

test) is extravagant. Two blood tests and consultations a year will be more than

sufficient for close monitoring having regard to the low incidence of liver cancer from

such therapy. Therefore, I allow a total cost of US$1,828.48 p.a. under this head of

claim.</p>
<p align="justify">492.    Mr Lek highlighted Dr Lei Chang Moh’s

testimony that some men around the ages of 50 and 60 might require hormone replacement

therapy in any event. </p>
<p align="justify">493.    Taking that into account together with the other

contingencies of life (e.g. death though illness and accidents), it may be appropriate to

compute on the basis of therapy up to 60 years. Capitalising the US$1828.48 p.a.

expenditure running for a 24 year period (as Mr Harte is presently 36 years of age) at a

discount rate of 5% p.a. (based on an estimate of future long term bank interest rates in

the United States), the lump sum payment when mathematically computed comes to US$25,230,

which I shall round up to <u><b>US$26,000.</b></u> If one wants to look at the calculation

from the ‘multiplier’ basis, then in effect the multiplier is 14.2 if the lump

sum is US$26,000. One cannot use a straight multiplication (based on 24 x US$1,828.48 =

US$43,883) because that fails to take account of the accelerated payment of a lump sum at

present value. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><i><b>(d) Likelihood of testicular salvage if treatment had been prompt</b></i></p>
<p align="justify">494.    It is extremely difficult to estimate the

probability of testicular salvage if Dr Tan had seen Mr Harte promptly on the morning

following the surgery. </p>
<p align="justify">495.    Suppose Dr Tan had asked him to come by his

clinic the next day after the surgery upon receipt of Mr Harte’s telephone calls.

Suppose Dr Tan ordered a CDUS immediately. It would still be several hours after 9.00 am

on the following morning before the CDUS results could be obtained. Counsel for Dr Tan

submitted that by then, more than 24 hours would have elapsed after the fall. The

testicles would still have atrophied. Any post-operative negligence would not have

resulted in more damage than would be the case without any post-operative negligence.

Since no damage had arisen from Dr Tan’s breach of his duty of care, no damage was

payable. Hence, Dr Tan would not be liable for any post-operative negligence.</p>
<p align="justify">496.    Dr Myinte Soe relied on the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Dr Schlegel testified that beyond 4 to 6 hours, permanent injury

  would set in for torsion injury. [My comment: As this was not with reference to contusion

  injury, I disregarded it.]</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Dr Clarence Lei felt that the testicle would be dead in 2 hours

  with no blood supply. [My comment: This is not quite the same for contusion injury, where

  some blood supply may still be continuing after the contusion.] </p>
<p align="justify">(c) Dr Tay Kah Phuan felt that if there was <b>severe</b> trauma

  causing tissue death, nothing much could be done. The tissue takes time to die but it will

  die. [My comment: Dr Tay appears to me to be much too pessimistic. In any event, his is

  based on severe trauma which is not so in our case of moderate trauma, where some tissues

  left uncontused might well be salvageable.]</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Dr Notley also did not appear hopeful. He said that not much could

  be done to save the testes disrupted by contusion. He said that one could operate on the

  testes to reduce the damaging pressure buildup and then hope for the best. [My comment:

  There is at least some hope.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">497.    Fournier, Laing and Mc Aninch in their paper

"<i>Scrotal Ultrasonography and the Management of Testicular Trauma</i>"

referred to a report by Del Villar, Ireland and Cass: Early exploration following trauma

to the testicle. A failure rate of 45 % was reported for non-operative management based on

a review of 20 years’ experience. Additionally, 45 % of those patients in whom

surgical exploration was delayed required removal of the testes as opposed to only 5 % of

patients who underwent exploration within 3 days of the injury. The results of this study

indicate that the views expressed by the abovementioned experts might be far too

pessimistic. In the absence of other evidence and data, I can only use those results in

that paper as a rough guide to assess the probable success rate in our case.</p>
<p align="justify">498.    Prof Li provided an educated guess that there

could be a 50% chance of saving Mr Harte’s testes had he been managed from the day

after the operation and perhaps with surgical exploration. Dr Tan could have immediately

drained the scrotum to relieve the pressure from the extratesticular swelling, which was

further compressing the already distended and taut testes. He could perhaps have gone

further by cutting the tunica albuginea to release some of the pent up pressure built up

within the testes from the intratesticular haematoma. Thus had he called Mr Harte to his

clinic immediately on 29 April 1997 instead of delaying by 4 days to 2 May 1997, I think

there would have been a fairly good chance of saving some amount of testicular tissue. Mr

Harte would probably not suffer the degree of damage he has now suffered due to lack of

proper treatment and post-operative care from Dr Tan. With such a large swelling, time

must surely be of the essence. </p>
<p align="justify">499.    Under the circumstances, I will say that with

prompt intervention by Dr Tan on the morning after the surgery, perhaps 60% of Mr

Harte’s testes may be saved from atrophy, bearing in mind that even today, Mr

Harte’s testes are not completely dead. Accordingly, I award him 60% of the damages

computed above. </p>
<p align="justify">500.    Since damage arising from Dr Tan’s breach

of his duty of post-operative care of Mr Harte has been established, the plaintiff has

therefore succeeded in proving that Dr Tan has been negligent in his post-operative care.

However, the plaintiff has failed to prove that Dr Tan was negligent in his bilateral

varicocele operation. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Judgment Sums, Interest and Costs</b></p>
<p align="justify">501.    The judgment sums are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) 60 % of General Damages of S$50,000 = S$30,000.00</p>
<p align="justify">(b) 60% of Special Damages of S$4,992.70 = S$ 2,995.62</p>
<p align="justify">(c) 60% of Special Damages of US$4,982.08 =US$ 2,989.25</p>
<p align="justify">(d) 60% of Future Fertility Treatment cost of US$30,000 =US$18,000.00</p>
<p align="justify">(e) 60% of Future Hormone Therapy cost of US$26,000 =US$15,600.00</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">502.    The total judgment sum awarded is S$32,995.62

and US$36,589.25. In Singapore dollars, the total awarded is approximately S$96,660 using

the exchange rate of S$1.74 to US$1. </p>
<p align="justify">503.    Interest is awarded on the general and special

damages at 3% p.a. for the amounts in Singapore dollars and at 5% p.a. for the amounts in

US dollars from the date of writ to date of judgment. No interest is allowed on the sums

for future loss. The usual statutory interest on judgment sums unpaid shall apply.</p>
<p align="justify">504.    I will hear the parties on costs on the basis

that the plaintiff’s claim against Dr Tan is allowed but the plaintiff’s claim

against the hospital is dismissed.</p>
