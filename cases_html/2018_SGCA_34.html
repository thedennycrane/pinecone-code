In 2003, he was convicted of five charges of cheating in a District Court and sentenced to 12 years’ preventive detention. On appeal by the Prosecution, the High Court enhanced his sentence to 20 years’ preventive detention: see <span class="font-italic">Pu</span><span class="font-italic">blic Prosecutor v Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 305. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Subsequently, between 2004 and 2008, the Applicant filed five criminal motions in the High Court, one criminal motion in the Court of Appeal and two criminal appeals. All these filings were aimed at reopening his conviction and sentence in 2003. Our courts dismissed all of these applications, issuing written reasons in four cases: see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh v Public Prosecutor</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 36 (“<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Documents)</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh </span><span class="font-italic">s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 632 (“<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh </span><span class="font-italic">s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] SGHC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Review)</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh </span><span class="font-italic">s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 105. It was expressly stated in two cases that the applications brought by the Applicant were vexatious and an abuse of process: see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span> at [18] and <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Review)</span> at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 20 February 2017, the Applicant filed CR 3 seeking (1) the quashing of his conviction and sentence, (2) the revision of his sentence of preventive detention and (3) an order that would “end the many cycles of miscarriage of justice” that he had allegedly suffered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 14 July 2017, the Judge heard and dismissed CR 3 on the basis that it was an abuse of process, being yet another attempt by the Applicant to reopen his conviction and sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Four months later, on 14 November 2017, the Applicant filed the present application for an extension of time to bring a criminal reference. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The application for leave to file supplemental affidavits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Applicant also applied for leave to file two supplemental affidavits. In these affidavits, he invited us to exercise our inherent power of review to reopen his conviction and sentence in 2003, and our decisions in Criminal Motion No 18 of 2004 and Criminal Appeal No 15 of 2004 (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Documents)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span>). We allow the application and admit the two supplemental affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 We now give our decision on the application for an extension of time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The application for an extension of time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It is settled law that in deciding whether to grant an extension of time, the court should consider “all the circumstances of the case, in particular (a) the length of the delay; (b) the sufficiency of any explanation given in respect of the delay; and (c) the prospects of the application”: see <span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 935 (“<span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han</span>”) at [2].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Having considered these factors, we are satisfied that there is no reason to grant an extension of time. The principal reason is that the application which the Applicant seeks an extension of time to pursue has, in our judgment, no prospects of success whatsoever. This is because the questions which the Applicant seeks to refer to this court did not arise in CR 3. The Judge did not determine any question of law in CR 3. Rather, he dismissed CR 3 on the basis that, on the facts, it was an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 It is evident from the Applicant’s affidavits and submissions here that his objective in filing this application is to reopen his conviction and sentence, which were finally determined more than 14 years ago in 2003. To his end, he sought to rely on our decision in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 3 SLR 135 where we recognised that this court has the inherent power to reopen a concluded criminal appeal to prevent a miscarriage of justice. The matter of whether the Applicant’s conviction and sentence may be reopened is strictly not before us in the present application for an extension of time. But in any event, we have considered the Applicant’s affidavits and submissions and wish to state that there is no new and compelling material indicating that the Applicant’s conviction and/or sentence amount to a miscarriage of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In sum, this application is a patent abuse of process. As we noted in <span class="font-italic">Chew Eng Han</span> at [3], the fact that the Applicant is a litigant-in-person “does not provide him with a warrant to engage in abusive conduct”. The abusiveness here is especially reprehensible because our courts have repeatedly pointed out, in dismissing the Applicant’s previous applications, that his attempts to reopen his conviction and sentence amount to an abuse of process (see [3] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the result, we dismiss this application. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong            Judith Prakash      Steven Chong<br/>Judge of Appeal             Judge of Appeal     Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The applicant in person;<br/>Christopher Ong and Lee Ti-Ting (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
