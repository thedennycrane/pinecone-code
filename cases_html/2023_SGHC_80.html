The divorce proceedings were concluded amicably with a consent order being made for custody and access, payment of maintenance and division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The division of matrimonial assets in the divorce proceedings left Sandy’s and Sam’s respective 50% shareholdings in a company known as Yangbum Engineering Pte Ltd (“Yangbum”) intact. It also did not deal with Sandy’s shares in three other companies: Ace Class Precision Engineering Pte Ltd (“Ace Class”), Apex Precision Engineering Pte Ltd (“Apex Precision”) and Qing Lian Precision Pte Ltd (“QL Precision”). In this judgment, I shall refer to these three companies collectively as the “Three Companies”. The Three Companies were subcontractors to Yangbum exclusively. Yangbum and the Three Companies are the subject-matter of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 HC/S 275 of 2020 (“S 275”) is Sandy’s claim against Sam and Yangbum. Sandy seeks relief under s 216 of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CA”), including an order that Sam buys her shares in Yangbum. Yangbum is largely a nominal defendant in S 275.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 HC/S 345 of 2020 (“S 345”) is Sam’s claim against Sandy, her current husband, Mr Zhang Shengqiang (“Zhang”), and the Three Companies. Sam claims that Sandy holds her shares in the Three Companies on trust for him and that Sandy has acted in breach of trust. Sam also claims that Zhang dishonestly assisted Sandy in her breaches of trust and that both Sandy and Zhang conspired to injure him. Finally, Sam claims that Sandy wrongfully withdrew S$188,000 from their joint account. The Three Companies are nominal defendants in S 345.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 S 275 and S 345 were heard together.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Prior to 1992, Sam worked for two different companies that were involved in precision metal machining and machine tools. In July 1992, Sam started a partnership known as Yangbum Industrial Services (“YIS”) with another partner. YIS’ core business was in precision metal machining component manufacturing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7  Sandy was a Chinese national who had come to Singapore as a student in 1992. In 1993, Sam met Sandy and started dating her. In September/October 1993, Sandy returned to China. Sam continued to court her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In May 1994, YIS was dissolved. On 21 June 1994, Sam registered a sole proprietorship known as Yangbum Engineering (“YE”).

It is also not disputed that she was aware of the seven deposits into the account. However, she claims that she did not know that the amounts deposited were payments of dividends. According to her, after her divorce from Sam, dividends were to be paid to her directly instead of being paid into the OCBC Joint Account.

It does not change the fact that her share of the dividends was deposited into the OCBC Joint Account. It is also not disputed that she had unrestricted access to the moneys in the OCBC Joint Account. In the circumstances, Sam cannot be said to have diverted Sandy’s share of the dividends to himself. It follows that Sam also did not falsify Yangbum’s payment vouchers with respect to the payments to Sandy of her share of the dividends.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I also note that based on Sandy’s own evidence, she would have used her share of the seven deposits into the OCBC Joint Account.

</div> Sandy had requested a S$1m loan from Yangbum on 14 April 2018. Subsequently, Sam arranged for the loan to be given by way of the Yangbum Loan and the Ken Precision Loan. It is illogical that the Repayment Agreement (which was allegedly made in mid-April 2018) would have applied only to the Yangbum Loan. It seems to me that Sandy very likely did not include the Ken Precision Loan in the alleged Repayment Agreement because she did not need to. She was able to argue that the proposed set-off against the Ken Precision Loan was improper because that loan was not owed to Yangbum. However, Sandy needed a reason to challenge the proposed set-off against the Yangbum Loan and she came up with the Repayment Agreement for that purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Third, the Repayment Agreement is a bare assertion by Sandy. There is no other evidence supporting the alleged agreement. In fact, Sandy’s request for the S$1m loan was made by way of a text message, to which Sam simply replied “Ok”.

</div> Sam started dating Sandy only in 1993. Sandy returned to China in September/October 1993 and came back to Singapore in June 1994, which was around the same time that YE was set up. Sandy had no experience or knowledge of the business that YE was in. Sandy became a permanent resident of Singapore about three months after she married Sam. After that, she worked in a child-care centre but resigned in less than a month. YE was registered as a sole proprietorship in Sam’s name instead of as a partnership in both Sam’s and Sandy’s names. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Based on the above facts, I find it unbelievable that Sandy would have been involved in any meaningful way in the setting up of YE. The fact that Sam married Sandy in July 1994 does not mean that Sandy was therefore involved as a business partner in the formation of YE. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Second, I reject Sandy’s claim that she was primarily in charge of production and book-keeping in YE. Sandy’s claim that she was in charge of production is a blatant exaggeration. Under cross-examination, Sandy admitted that in fact YE had no production work; Sam outsourced the production work and what Sandy did was to smooth the edges of the products and check the dimensions, and to type the delivery orders and invoices.

</div>
</div> As dealt with below, I find that the alleged Understanding is also a fabrication by Sandy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the alleged Understanding exists</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The alleged Understanding is that even though she resigned as a director, Sandy would continue to have joint authority and oversight of the use of Yangbum’s funds, and the withdrawal of substantial funds would require her consent (see [130(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In my judgment, the alleged Understanding is another fabrication by Sandy. First, the scope of the alleged Understanding is vague. Sandy’s pleaded case does not state how her alleged joint authority and oversight was to be exercised, or what “substantial funds” meant. In her oral submissions, Sandy referred to a veto right over the issuance of cheques, without any requirement that the cheques involve substantial funds. The lack of clarity as to the scope of the alleged Understanding and the fluidity of Sandy’s case regarding the same are strong indications that the Understanding is just a fabrication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Second, it is unrealistic that Sam would have agreed that the use of Yangbum’s funds for its business would be subject to Sandy’s consent. Sandy had not experience or knowledge of Yangbum’s business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Third, Sandy’s claim that she was to have oversight of cheques issued by Yangbum is contradicted by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From 21 July 1997 to October 2016, both Sam and Sandy were authorised signatories for Yangbum’s OCBC account. However, either one could sign cheques for amounts up to $20,000; Sandy’s joint signature was required only for amounts exceeding that. Transactions via internet banking (with a limit of $200,000 per transaction) required authorisation by both Sam and Sandy, but Sam held both his and Sandy’s tokens.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) From 17 October 2016 to 12 October 2019, both Sam and Sandy were authorised signatories for Yangbum’s UOB account (which in effect replaced the OCBC account). However, either one could sign cheques for amounts up to $20,000; Sandy’s joint signature was required only for amounts exceeding that. In addition, Sam was the sole authorised user for transactions via internet banking (with a limit of $200,000 per transaction).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) From 1999 to January 2018, both Sam and Sandy were authorised signatories for Yangbum’s SCB account. However, either one could sign cheques for any amount. Sam was also the sole authorised user for transactions via internet banking.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) From 29 September 2015 to 23 October 2019, both Sam and Sandy were authorised signatories for Yangbum’s CIMB account. However, either one could sign cheques for any amount. Sam was also the sole authorised user for transactions via internet banking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Sandy has not alleged that she objected to the above mandates for Yangbum’s accounts before October 2019, or adduced any evidence to that effect. Sandy’s implicit acceptance of the above mandates for the considerable period before October 2019 contradicts her case that the Understanding exists. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In October 2019, Sandy requested changes to the mandates. In her AEIC, Sandy says that she asked for the mandates to be changed because of the Understanding.

To spread out the operational risk, on 1 July 2008, Sam incorporated Ace Class and Apex Precision to perform work as subcontractors for Yangbum exclusively.

I agree with Sandy that this shows that Sam does not own the beneficial interest in the shares in the Three Companies. It is true that Liang Jian did transfer his shares in Ken Precision to Sam on 31 October 2018. However, in my view, this does not mean that Liang Jian had held the shares on trust for Sam. At that time, Sandy simply wanted the shares transferred to someone else (other than her). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Second, there is no reason why the shares in the Three Companies and Ken Precision would be held on trust for <span class="font-italic">Sam</span> instead of Yangbum. Ace Class and Apex Precision were set up to act as subcontractors to Yangbum exclusively. Although the impetus for setting up Ken Precision and QL Precision was Sandy’s desire to help her brother and cousin, these companies too acted as subcontractors to Yangbum. As a result, part of Yangbum’s operations (and profits) were to be shifted to these companies. The issues relating to MOM also did not require the shares in Ace Class and Apex Precision to be held on trust for Sam instead of Yangbum. In so far as QL Precision is concerned, LQL’s evidence does not support Sam’s claim that she held the shares in QL Precision on trust for him. LQL testified that she understood QL Precision to be owned by <span class="font-italic">Yangbum</span> and ultimately to Sam because she understood Yangbum to belong to Sam.

It is telling that she did not do so. Neither did she ask Sam to indemnify her against any losses that she might suffer by remaining a shareholder of these companies.

</div> In my judgment, Sandy’s reason as to why she did not exit the companies was yet another fabrication by her.

</div> However, I note that Yangbum, the Three Companies and Ken Precision also did not declare dividends for several years after they were incorporated. TL Precision and SH Precision were incorporated only in late 2016. More importantly, Sam was not cross-examined on this point. In my view, against the totality of the evidence, these two points do not prove Sandy’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In my judgment, what the evidence shows is that when the Three Companies and Ken Precision were incorporated, it was not intended that Sandy would own the beneficial interests (whether directly or through Liang Jian/LQL) in these companies. However, Sam and Sandy did not discuss who the beneficial owner of these shares was. This is also consistent with Sandy’s evidence that there was no discussion about the beneficial ownership of the shares in TL Precision and SH Precision. Had they thought about the question of beneficial ownership, they may well have agreed that Yangbum should be the beneficial owner of the shares in all six subcontractor companies; it would have been the most logical choice. However, I need say no more on this since the pleaded case is that Sandy held the shares in the Three Companies on trust for <span class="font-italic">Sam </span>and for his sole benefit.

Further, the resolutions to wind up the companies were passed on 12 March 2020, not 10 March 2020. The references to paras 3(c) and 7–9 of the Statement of Claim do not assist Sam either. They are referred to in support of the assertion that Sandy and Zhang were aware of Sam’s beneficial interests in the companies, and the contents of these paragraphs have nothing to do with the alleged agreement to injure Sam by liquidating the companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 As for para 29, that merely sets out the duties that Sandy is said to owe to Sam as trustee of the shares in Ace Class, Apex Precision and QL Precision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Second, Sam’s submission that Zhang agreed to participate in Sandy’s scheme on 10 March 2020 is not supported by any evidence. Sam relies on Sandy’s evidence in para 178 of her AEIC. However, para 178 of Sandy’s AEIC refers to a meeting on 10 March 2020 between Sandy and Mr Lau Chin Huat (“Lau”) and Mr Yeo Boon Keong (“Yeo”) of Technic Inter-Asia Pte Ltd. Lau and Yeo were eventually appointed as joint and several liquidators of the three companies. Zhang was not involved in that meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 I would add that Sam’s unlawful means conspiracy claim also fails for a separate reason. Sam’s unlawful means conspiracy claim rests on the premise that the actions to liquidate the Three Companies were unlawful because Sandy was acting in breach of trust.

</div> Neither answer explains why the US$1.7m should be excluded from his computations. The question is simply whether Sandy had received S$9.3m more dividends than Sam before Sandy made the S$188,000 Withdrawal. What Sam or Sandy chose to do with the dividends paid to each of them was irrelevant for this purpose. In my view, it is illogical to include the US$1.5m paid to Sandy but exclude the US$1.7m paid to Sam in Sam’s computation. Eventually, Sam admitted that he did not include the dividends paid to him in 2013 in his computations because “he did not think about it” and that he “perceived it in a different manner”.
