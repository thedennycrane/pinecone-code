</div> I was satisfied that Mr Kumazaki had the requisite authority to make an affidavit in support of this winding-up application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Sole Shareholder had locus standi to bring the winding-up application </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Another preliminary issue was the <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>of the Sole Shareholder to bring the winding-up application. Under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, a contributory has a standing to bring such an application. It was a non-issue that the Sole Shareholder was a contributory.  However, s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA sets out further requirements where a contributory brings a winding-up application based on s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA (as in the present case):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) a person mentioned in subsection (1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)] may not make a winding up application on any of the grounds specified in section 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) … unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the shares in respect of which the contributory was a contributory, or some of those shares —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A) were originally allotted to the contributory; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(B) have been held by the contributory and registered in the contributory’s name for at least 6 months during the 18 months before the making of the winding up application; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(C) have devolved on the contributory through the death or bankruptcy of a former holder; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 At the hearing on 19 January 2024, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) profile exhibited in Mr Kumazaki’s first affidavit was insufficient to establish s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA. The ACRA profile did not show whether the Sole Shareholder was the original shareholder of the Company or held its shares for at least six of the last 18 months prior to the making of this application. Consequently, I directed the Company to file a further affidavit to demonstrate that s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA was fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In Mr Kumazaki’s second affidavit, the Company exhibited a copy of the Register of Members retrieved from ACRA. This showed that the Sole Shareholder had held all the shares in the Company since 3 February 2020.

</div>
</div> Since the application was made on 20 December 2023, I was satisfied that the Company’s shares “have been held by the [Sole Shareholder] … for at least 6 months during the 18 months before the making of the winding up application” (s 124(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) IRDA). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ground for winding up under s 125(1)(a) IRDA was satisfied</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, the court may order a company to be wound up if “the company has by special resolution resolved that it be wound up by the [High] Court”. As noted in Walter Woon, <span class="font-italic">Woon’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Corporations Law</span> (Walter Woon gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2022) at para 557, it is “unusual” to invoke this ground, as a special resolution is usually the basis for a members’ voluntary winding up. There is no reported local decision that sets out the legal principles governing the application of this provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In <span class="font-italic">Chong Kok Ming and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Richinn Technology Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] SGHC 224 (“<span class="font-italic">Richinn</span>”), a winding-up application was brought under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) which is the predecessor provision of s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. However, the facts of <span class="font-italic">Richinn</span> did not require an in-depth analysis of this provision. The winding-up application was dismissed because, amongst others, what the company contemplated was a members’ voluntary winding up – there was “no special resolution by the members that the company would be wound up <span class="font-italic">by the Court</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Richinn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Given the lack of local case law and commentary on this provision, I turn to Australian authorities for guidance. Section 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of Australia’s Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Australian Corp Act”) is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA, with the latter adopting the same phrasing as the former. Like the present application, s 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Australian Corp Act was most frequently invoked by a sole shareholder. An example is <span class="font-italic">Hillig as Administrator of Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council v Darkinjung Pty Ltd</span> [2006] NSWSC 1371 (“<span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>”), which is the leading authority on this provision. After perusing the cases under s 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Australian Corp Act and its foreign equivalents, Barrett J laid down the following principles (<span class="font-italic">Hillig </span>at [35]–[36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[35]  … First, the body of shareholders has a statutory right to decide that their company should be wound up by the court, being a right exercisable by whatever procedures are sufficient, in the particular circumstances, to cause a special resolution to be passed. Second, the court has discretion whether or not to make a winding up order (being the discretion created by the word “may” at the start of s 461(1)) but <span class="font-italic">the discretion should not be exercised against the making of the order unless the shareholders’ decision, or some aspect of the surrounding circumstances, involves something unconscionable or inequitable (or some special consideration adversely affecting creditors indicates that there should be no winding u</span><span class="font-italic">p)</span>. Third, the availability to the shareholders of the alternative of initiating voluntary winding up by special resolution does not represent any reason for declining to make a winding up order. This last point is really no more than an aspect of statutory interpretation: if there had been some intention that the voluntary winding up mechanism should have primacy, s 461(1)(a) would not form part of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[36]  I am of the view that … [the sole member]’s reasons for preferring winding up by the court to voluntary winding up <span class="font-italic">do not appear to me to be something into which I need inquire</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Applying these principles, Barrett J held that the sole member had the standing to apply for a winding-up order, and in the absence of any unconscionable or inequitable element, the ground for winding up was established (<span class="font-italic">Hillig </span>at [36]). Further, there was no indication that winding up would be inconsistent with the creditors’ interests (<span class="font-italic">Hillig </span>at [37]). Following <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>, Australian courts have generally ordered a winding up where the procedural requirements (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the validity of the special resolution) are met. For instance, a winding-up order was made in <span class="font-italic">MFS Alternative Assets (in liquidation) v Angstrom Assets Pty Ltd </span>[2012] NSWSC 447 (“<span class="font-italic">MFS</span>”), as the sole shareholder’s winding-up application satisfied the formalities (at [5]), and there were no inequitable circumstances suggesting that an order should not be made (at [4] citing <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 An example of unconscionable circumstances can be found in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fernlake Pty Ltd</span> (1994) 13 ACSR 600 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fernlake</span>”) (cited in <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>), where the court exercised its discretion to refuse a winding-up order. There, the shareholders contracted to sell some of their shares to another buyer, such that those shares were held on trust for the buyer. Subsequently, without the buyer’s knowledge or consent, the shareholders proceeded to pass a special resolution for the company to be wound up by the court. The Supreme Court of Queensland noted that there were no technical irregularities surrounding the passing of the special resolution (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fernlake</span> at 607). Nevertheless, it was “clearly inequitable … to give effect to a resolution passed wholly [and knowingly] in breach of the trusts by which each shareholder was bound” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Fernlake</span> at 607). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Australian authorities have also identified factors in favour of the court making a winding-up order under s 461(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Australian Corp Act. One such factor is the lack of objection by the affected parties, such as the company itself and its creditors (see <span class="font-italic">MFS </span>at [4] and <span class="font-italic">Griffin Energy Group Pty Ltd v Griffin Windfarm Holdings Pty Ltd, Re Griffin Energy Group Pty Ltd (subject to Deed of Co Arrangement)</span> [2012] FCA 197 (“<span class="font-italic">Griffin</span>”) at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Another relevant factor is the lack of a functional board. In <span class="font-italic">Griffin</span>, all the directors were purportedly removed, making it appropriate for the company’s affairs to be placed in the hands of a provisional liquidator (at [20]). Of particular relevance to the present case is <span class="font-italic">Kala</span> <span class="font-italic">Capital Pty Limited</span> [2011] NSWSC 1253 (“<span class="font-italic">Kala</span>”). In making the winding-up order, Barrett J considered that the sole shareholder-director could not discharge her duties as a company’s director satisfactorily, as the ex-director had refused to hand over any books or financial records in his possession or control (<span class="font-italic">Kala</span> at [12]–[13]). This rendered her unable to ascertain the company’s condition, including its tax responsibilities and financial state (<span class="font-italic">Kala </span>at [12]). Barrett J also considered that the sole shareholder-director was predominantly based overseas, which ran afoul of the statutory requirement for a sole director to be ordinarily resident in Australia, further indicating instability in the company’s administration (<span class="font-italic">Kala </span>at [14]). Finally, in <span class="font-italic">CIC Insurance Ltd v Hannan &amp; Co Pty Ltd</span> (2001) 38 ACSR 245, the directors had resigned, and its sole shareholder was unable to find individuals willing to act as new directors (at [9]). As observed in <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>, the absence of all internal machinery militated against the possibility of convening a creditors’ meeting for voluntary winding up (at [33]). This made it necessary to rely on the court’s power to wind up the company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The case to allow the winding up has been made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I agree with the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>. There is a limited discretion to withhold winding up under s 125(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA. Unlike in a members’ voluntary winding up, other than as set out in this paragraph below, it is not for the court to question the shareholder(s)’s decision to pursue a compulsory winding up by the court over a voluntary winding up. If a special resolution has been validly passed, then the court should generally allow the winding-up application, subject to two considerations – the interests of the creditors and the presence of bad faith or other untoward circumstances (as per <span class="font-italic">Hillig</span>). With respect to creditors, relevant issues to consider would include any explicit objections from them, the list and scope of creditors (if available), and whether the winding up was aimed at undermining the creditors’ rights and would put the creditors in a worse position than if the company continued as a going concern. With respect to untoward circumstances, a company seeking to be wound up should be transparent and explain the circumstances behind the winding-up application. This would allow the court to properly understand the basis on which it is asked to exercise its discretion. Whilst the lack of transparency on its own should not be fatal to any application, in most circumstances, a proper explanation will help to dispel any concerns of such untoward circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 On the facts, there is no issue that a valid special resolution was passed by the Sole Shareholder for the Company to be wound up by this court. As to the creditors, I note that the Company was unable to list its creditors in Mr Kumazaki’s affidavits because the current management had no access to any accounting and financial records. However, I considered that none of the creditors had raised any objections since the advertisement of the winding-up application on 2 January 2024.

</div> The only party which attended the hearings (after having read the advertisement) was Resorts World at Sentosa Pte. Ltd., a contractual counterparty and potential claimant of the Company. It took no position on the winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further, nothing on the facts suggested any unconscionable or inequitable circumstances which justified withholding a winding-up order. During the hearing on 19 January 2024, I expressed my concern that Mr Kumazaki’s first affidavit failed to disclose sufficient background information relating to the making of this winding-up application. The full and frank disclosure of the circumstances set out in Mr Kumazaki’s second affidavit (see [3]–[6] above) armed me with sufficient information to grant the application.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In fact, I found that it was desirable to order a winding up. Similar to <span class="font-italic">Kala</span>, the mass resignation of the Company has made it difficult for the current management to conduct the Company’s affairs properly. Considering the lack of information on the Company, I agreed with Mr Kumazaki that there was a risk of insolvent trading, which would not be in the creditors’ best interests.
