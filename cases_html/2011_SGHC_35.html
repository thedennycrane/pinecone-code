<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This matter came before me as an appeal from an
                    assessment of damages carried out by the Assistant Registrar Ms Crystal Tan
                    (“the AR”). The assessment exercise was conducted in respect of
                    claims made by both the plaintiff and the defendant, and various sums were
                    awarded to each of them. The plaintiff, however, was not satisfied either with
                    the award in its favour or with the award in favour of the defendant and has
                    appealed against various components of both awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Kreuz Shipbuilding &amp;
                    Engineering Pte Ltd, whom I shall hereafter refer to as “the
                    shipyard”, carries on the business of providing ship docking and ship
                    repair services in Singapore. The defendant, whom I shall hereafter refer to as
                    “the owner”, was the owner of a vessel called <em>Rainbow Star</em> (“the vessel”) which was an oilfield
                    supply/towing vessel. In March 2008, the owner sent the vessel to the shipyard
                    for certain repair work to be effected. On 8 June 2008, whilst the shipyard was
                    carrying out work on the vessel, an explosion occurred and this was followed by
                    a fire. As a result, the vessel became a constructive total loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In September 2008, the shipyard commenced this
                    action in which it claimed the costs of the repair works that it had carried out
                    on the vessel prior to the fire. The owner, alleging that the explosion and fire
                    were caused by the negligence of the shipyard and its employees, put in a
                    counterclaim for the loss and damage caused to it thereby. In October 2009, by
                    consent, interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered in
                    respect of the claim and the counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The claim by the shipyard was for payment of
                    three invoices which it had issued to the owner between May and August 2008.
                    These were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The amount claimed was, however, only $570,612.90 as the shipyard
                    deducted an advance payment made by the owner and also a sum which it had
                    overcharged in respect of certain pipes it had supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The AR’s decision in respect of this claim
                    was as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in respect of invoice 5551 which the owner did
                            not dispute, the AR awarded the full sum of $128,253;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in respect of invoice 5593, the AR found that the
                            following amounts were due in respect of various works included in the
                            invoice:</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">for pipes of normal length,
                                    $13,132;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-2-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-2-Item">for pipes of in between sizes,

                            at all.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The AR then went on to consider the
                    owner’s counterclaim. Both parties had agreed that the vessel be regarded
                    and assessed as a constructive total loss. On this basis, the owner’s
                    counterclaim comprised the following items:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">costs, expenses and third party liabilities
                            incurred by the owner - $85,938.68 and Rp48,697,500;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">loss of profit under an aborted charterparty -

                            – US$1,750,000</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR allowed the claims under items (a) and (b) in full. As regards
                    item (c), the AR assessed the value of the vessel as being US$1.6m and awarded
                    that amount to the owner. The AR also awarded the owner interest at the
                    statutory rate on the value of the vessel from the date of the explosion
                    (8 June 2008) up to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The shipyard’s appeal on its own claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In its notice of appeal filed on
                    8 September 2010, the shipyard indicated that it was dissatisfied with the
                    following portions of the AR’s decision:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the award in respect of invoice 5593 which it

                            original sum claimed for after deduction of the amount that had been
                            overcharged for the pipes);</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the course of the hearing before me, counsel
                    for the shipyard indicated that it was not proceeding with its appeal in respect
                    of invoice 5630 ([7(b)] above). I will deal with each of the other grounds of
                    appeal in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Invoice 5593</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was common ground below that the work items
                    covered by invoice 5593 had actually been carried out by the shipyard. The owner
                    had, however, disputed various items set out in the invoice on the basis that it
                    had not agreed to the prices charged by the shipyard. The owner had only
                    admitted that work items amounting to $23,163 had been priced on the basis of
                    agreed rates set out in the first and second quotations (dated 12 February 2008
                    and 22 April 2008 respectively) which had been issued by the shipyard to the
                    owner and had subsequently been accepted by the owner. The AR found, on the
                    evidence, that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">nine subsequent quotations dated between 23 April
                            2008 and 6 June 2008 which the shipyard claimed to have sent to the
                            owner, had not been received or confirmed by the owner;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the owner had never been made aware of the
                            methods of charging by the shipyard and the prices set out in invoice
                            5593 had never been agreed; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the shipyard had not managed to establish that
                            the prices set out in invoice 5593 were reasonable.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The AR then went on to consider each of the disputed items and to fix
                    the rates payable by the owner for the same. I will give the basis of the prices
                    so fixed in more detail later in this judgment if necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The shipyard’s arguments on the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the appeal, the shipyard took the position
                    that it was entitled to the amounts claimed on the basis that they had been
                    agreed to, either specifically on this occasion or by reference to past
                    practice; alternatively, that since the work had been done, the owner had to pay
                    a reasonable amount for the same and the amounts that it charged were
                    reasonable. The owner’s response was that the amounts charged had not been
                    agreed to, and although it accepted that the shipyard was entitled to a
                    reasonable price for the work done, the onus lay on the shipyard to establish
                    that its prices were reasonable and this it had failed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Contractual basis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In relation to its contention that the amounts
                    claimed in invoice 5593 had been agreed to, the shipyard put forward three main
                    points. First, it argued that the invoice had been accepted by the owner and
                    therefore could no longer be challenged. The shipyard pointed out that there
                    were various “ticks” against the prices on the invoice and that
                    similar ticks had appeared on an earlier invoice, <em>viz</em>, invoice 5551, which the owner had accepted. Counsel
                    contended that no one would mark an item with a tick without giving due
                    consideration to them. He argued that Mr Juffri, the owner’s business
                    and development manager, who had dealt with the invoices on the owner’s
                    behalf, had not been able to explain the “ticks” or who made
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Secondly, the shipyard relied on past
                    practice. It noted that the quotations had been addressed to Permata Sari
                    Services (“PSS”), the former manager of the vessel, who had only
                    been replaced as manager by the owner itself in April 2008. From 2006 up till
                    2008, the shipyard had dealt with PSS and had charged for its work on the vessel
                    based on yard tariffs and past practices. In fact, the first quotation had been
                    addressed to PSS and this was a quotation that had been passed to the owner and
                    which the owner had specifically confirmed and accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Thirdly, the shipyard relied on the fact that
                    the actual work had in many cases been done before a quotation was issued. The
                    owner had not given full details of the work-scope. Therefore, upon completion
                    of the work, the repair manager of the shipyard would do a write-up and follow
                    that up with a quotation. If the owner had wanted a quotation to be issued and
                    accepted for a particular job before actual work was carried out, it could
                    easily have instructed the master and its superintendent not to allow the
                    shipyard to carry out such work until the relevant quotation had been issued and
                    accepted. As the owner allowed the shipyard to carry out work before there was
                    an accepted quotation, the shipyard was entitled to charge for the work based on
                    existing yard tariffs and past practice. The items that were charged by
                    reference to yard tariffs were, according to the evidence, items such as staging
                    works, engine room cleaning, tyre fender works, tank valves, spindle works and
                    tank cleaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Taking the first point relating to the
                    “ticks” on the invoice and the argument that these indicated
                    acceptance of the prices charged, the owner’s response was that there was
                    no evidence before the court as to the purpose or meaning of the
                    “ticks”. They had not been made by Mr Juffri so it was not
                    surprising he could not explain them. In any event, there was documentary
                    evidence that showed that he had queried the charges very soon after invoice
                    5593 was rendered. Thus, there was no basis on which to contend that this
                    invoice had been accepted. I agree with the owner that the “ticks”
                    in themselves did not prove that the prices were accepted. Their presence was
                    equivocal and could not lead to any inference of acceptance. They might equally
                    have meant that the person making the “ticks” wanted to query the
                    marked items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     When it came to the yard tariffs, I should
                    first of all state that because the vessel’s entry into the shipyard in
                    March 2008 was not its first call there, if the evidence supported it, I would
                    be inclined to rule that on the basis of past practice, the owner had agreed to
                    pay yard tariffs for items of work that were covered by tariffs issued by the
                    shipyard and customarily applied. However, as far as I can see, the shipyard did
                    not introduce any evidence as to what its yard tariffs were or that it had on
                    the vessel’s previous visits charged such yard tariffs which had been
                    accepted and paid for either by the owner or PSS. Further, looking at the two
                    quotations that were accepted by the owner in relation to the March 2008 work,
                    with one minor exception, neither of these bore any mention of the yard tariffs
                    at all. In fact, even the nine further quotations which were not seen by the
                    owner before the work was done had no reference to the yard tariffs. The minor
                    exception that I referred to above appears in the quotation dated 12 February
                    2008. Item 11 of this quotation refers to “Pipe Renewal Tariffs”
                    and sub-item i) states “Removal and refitting for access – 50% of
                    tariff rates”. This evidence, however, does not help the shipyard in that
                    it shows that the tariff rates were not applied across the board and could be
                    reduced either voluntarily by the shipyard or after negotiation. In the absence
                    of evidence establishing that the shipyard had published yard tariffs that
                    applied across the board to the items mentioned in the publication and in the
                    absence of evidence that such yard tariffs had been paid previously by the owner
                    or PSS, I cannot allow these charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As regards the third point, <em>ie</em>, that actual work had been done in advance of approval and
                    had to be so conducted in order not to hold up the ship, this argument does not
                    support an inference that the owner was agreeable to paying any amount that the
                    shipyard might subsequently charge for the work. The only inference that can be
                    drawn from the owner’s agreement that work be done before a quotation for
                    the same had been seen and accepted is that the owner was agreeable to paying
                    for the work on the basis that the charges therefor would be reasonable. It
                    would not be correct to draw the inference that by allowing the work to proceed
                    in advance of an accepted quotation, the owner was thereby agreeing to whatever
                    charges the shipyard might seek to impose at its discretion irrespective of
                    whether they were reasonable. Such an inference would not be consistent with the
                    usual understanding that applies when a person engages another to provide
                    services without specifically agreeing to the price for the same, which has led
                    to the long established legal principle that where price is not agreed between
                    parties, the price to be paid is a reasonable price having regard to the
                    circumstances of the case. This conclusion leads me to the next issue canvassed
                    by the parties which was whether the AR was correct in her decision that the
                    charges were not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Reasonableness of the charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The AR’s finding was that the shipyard
                    had not managed to establish that the prices in invoice 5593 were reasonable.
                    The shipyard had relied on evidence given by Graeme Noel Temple
                    (“Mr Temple”), the shipyard’s expert, who commented on
                    the prices in the invoices as well as those in quotations from two other ship
                    repairers – Drydocks World-Singapore Pte Ltd (“Drydocks
                    World”) and Jurong SML Pte Ltd (“JSML”). The AR rejected
                    his evidence. As she explained in [18] of her judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Mr Temple] testified that he considered the prices reasonable in the
                        context of the ship repair industry in Singapore. However, he admitted that
                        he <em>only</em> considered the [shipyard’s]
                        documents and did not provide in his report any comparative prices or quotes
                        from the industry. When asked to comment on Drydocks World quotation, he
                        testified that the unit prices for Drydocks World were more expensive than
                        the [shipyard’s] unit rates. However, no reference was made to the
                        type, nature of work and services carried out by Drydocks World. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the appeal, the shipyard argued that since
                    the owner did not engage an expert witness to give evidence on what would be a
                    reasonable sum payable to the shipyard for the cost of the repairs, the evidence
                    of the shipyard’s expert witnesses should be accepted. Its contention that
                    the charges in invoice 5593 were fair and reasonable was supported by the
                    evidence of Mr Temple. Mr Temple had surveyed the vessel to assess the
                    damage to it and the cost of repairs. He opined that the amounts charged under
                    invoice 5593 were fair and reasonable and were not unusual, they were not
                    “out of the ballpark”. As a surveyor, he stated his job was to
                    examine shipyard documents, casualties and breakdowns and he had provided his
                    opinion on the prices here based on his experience. He also stated that if he
                    had been analysing the bills for the underwriter, he would have come to the same
                    conclusion that the charges were fair and reasonable. Additionally, the unit
                    prices from Drydocks World and JSML (two other repairers who had been asked by
                    the owner to quote for the repairs after the fire) were significantly higher
                    than the shipyard’s prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The shipyard had the burden of proving the
                    quantum of its claim. See <em>Abe Isaac (Pte) Ltd v Marieta
                        Montalba Pacudan and Another</em> [2007] SGHC 46
                        (“<em>Abe Isaac</em>”). The shipyard
                    chose to discharge this burden by adducing the evidence of someone who it
                    considered had expert knowledge of charges in the ship repair industry in
                    Singapore. It was entitled to proceed in this way and the owner was equally
                    entitled to challenge the expert’s evidence by logic and analysis alone. I
                    do not accept the submission that simply because the owner did not produce any
                    expert of its own to put forward alternative figures it was not entitled to
                    dispute the reasonableness of the charges. Any expert’s evidence must be
                    tested and if it does not satisfy such testing, may be rejected, even though
                    there is no countervailing evidence from another expert before the
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the present case, counsel for the owner
                    contended that Mr Temple’s evidence was correctly rejected by the AR.
                    It pointed out, citing <em>Sim Ah Song and Anor v Rex</em>
                    [1951] MLJ 150 and <em>R v Abadom (Steven)</em>
                    [1983] 1 WLR 126, that a bare expression by an expert of his opinion
                    is of little evidential value. There must be some foundation for his opinion or
                    explanation how he arrived at his opinion so that the correctness of his opinion
                    can be examined. It is the duty of an expert to consider any material available
                    in his field and not merely draw conclusions based on his own
                experience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel also drew my attention to the
                    following material portions of the evidence given by Mr Temple. In
                    cross-examination, Mr Temple agreed that “reasonableness”
                    must be considered in the context of the ship repair industry in Singapore. He
                    said that he had compared the shipyard’s figures to general rates in the
                    industry for such work in Singapore. However, he also agreed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     he had not provided any comparative
                        prices or quotes in the report and there was no information in his report to
                        look at so as to evaluate whether the shipyard’s invoiced amounts were
                        fair and reasonable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     he considered only the shipyard’s invoice in isolation to come
                        to his conclusion. He conceded that he did not consider mark-up levels and
                        only looked at the figures contained in the invoice;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     the scope of his report did not
                        involve any contractual discussions before the vessel went into the yard and
                        hence he was not aware of the specifications given to the
                    shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Temple, however, shifted his position
                    in re-examination when he said that he had compared the unit rates in invoice
                    5593 to the quotations of Drydocks World, dated 6 September 2008, and JSML,
                    dated 2 September 2008, and concluded that the shipyard’s rates were lower
                    and thus reasonable. Counsel criticised Mr Temple’s conclusion
                    because of differences between the Drydocks World quotation and invoice 5593.
                    The Drydocks World quotation provided a unit rate for pipes and staging but no
                    rate for steel work. The shipyard’s invoices did not contain a unit rate
                    for staging. The charging methods and prices used by the shipyard in the invoice
                        (<em>viz</em>, historical pricing, yard tariffs and
                    mark-ups) were not reflected in the invoice so it was unclear how Mr Temple
                    was able to conclude that the rates in the shipyard’s invoice were lower
                    than those in Drydocks World’s quotation. Even if the shipyard’s
                    rates were lower than those of Drydocks World and JSML, that by itself would not
                    make them reasonable especially since Mr Temple had agreed that the
                    quotation from Drydocks World was excessive. It was also pertinent that the
                    nature and scope of work covered by the subsequent quotations were different
                    from those in invoice 5593. The invoice related to repair work for a class
                    survey while the quotations from Drydocks World and JSML were in respect of
                    post-casualty repairs to damage caused by fire. Thus, different considerations
                    and rates could apply. In any event, Mr Temple’s claim that he had
                    made such a comparison was not in his report and must have been an
                    afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In my judgment, the above criticisms of
                    Mr Temple’s evidence are valid. I agree with the AR that his evidence
                    that the shipyard’s charges were reasonable was a bare assertion which was
                    not supported by a proper study or analysis. His own admissions in the course of
                    cross-examination showed that he had considered the shipyard’s invoice in
                    isolation and had not provided information in his report which would help
                    substantiate his evaluation that the invoiced amounts were fair and reasonable.
                    Accordingly, Mr Temple’s evidence did not prove the shipyard’s
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The shipyard, however, also argued on appeal
                    that the various items in invoice 5593 could be justified even without reference
                    to Mr Temple’s evidence. For this portion of the appeal, the shipyard
                    followed the course taken by the owner before the AR which was to categorise the
                    various items in the invoice according with the manner in which the shipyard had
                    calculated its charges. This is because various methods of charging were used by
                    the shipyard. The evidence given by the shipyard’s witness, Mr Seet,
                    was that the prices in this invoice were calculated based on six different
                    methods: on a lump sum basis, in-between sizes for pipes, yard tariffs, a
                    mark-up on non-standard items bought off the shelf, labour charges and a mark-up
                    on sub-contractors’ prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">
<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">items charged on a lump sum basis (excluding steel work)</font>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     With respect to yard tariffs, labour charges
                    and other lump sum items, before the AR, the owner argued, on the authority of
                        <em>Abe Isaac</em>, that the shipyard had not produced
                    any evidence that the prices were reasonable and was therefore entitled to only
                    a nominal sum of $200. The AR accepted this argument and awarded nominal damages
                    of $100. Her reasons, as stated in [24] of her judgment, were:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [shipyard] argued vigorously however, that <em>Abe</em> Isaac was not applicable in the present case as there
                        was credible evidence that yard tariffs were relied on and known to the
                        former manager of the [owner], Chong. Mr Seet testified that Chong knew
                        but Juffri didn’t and that “he assumed he communicated with
                        [Chong]”. In my view, from the evidence adduced before me, it
                        appeared that though the fact of a loss had been shown by the [shipyard],
                        the necessary evidence as to its amount had not been given. The only
                        evidence that was given in the course of the hearing before me were
                        Seet’s bare assertions that the yard tariffs were known to Chong, but
                        it has to be pointed out that Chong was not even called as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the appeal, the shipyard did not make any
                    argument that the yard tariffs were reasonable. All it said was that certain
                    items were charged by reference to such tariffs and whilst the first quotation
                    of 12 February 2008 did not refer to such tariffs, it did not follow that
                    the shipyard could not put up charges on this basis. As I have said above, the
                    shipyard adduced no evidence as to the publication of its yard charges or
                    established that it had previously charged the owner on this basis and these
                    charges had been accepted on those previous occasions. I also note the
                    AR’s reasons for disallowing these items. I have no reason to disagree.
                    Accordingly, there is no basis on which to interfere with the AR’s
                    decision in this regard.</p>

<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">lump sum charge for steel work</font>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     During the appeal, the shipyard dealt
                    separately with the lump sum charges for steel work. Its argument was that with
                    regard to steel renewal, it was entitled to charge on a lump sum basis for
                    quantities of one tonne and below because item 12 of its quotation of
                    12 February 2008 read, <em>inter alia</em>, as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">This quotation had been accepted by the owner and it was therefore
                    reasonable for the shipyard to charge on a similar basis for quantities of steel
                    of one tonne and less used for work covered by the other quotations which had
                    not been accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The AR had agreed with the owner’s
                    approach regarding payment for steel work on the basis of the top rate of $6.20
                    per tonne (for one to five tonnes) plus any applicable surcharge due to the
                    dimensions of the steel involved, as set out in the first quotation. She
                    considered this a fair approach to take as it was consistent with the approach
                    in the first quotation. She therefore awarded $80,657.80 for steel
                work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The shipyard disputed this method of charging.
                    It argued strongly that it should be entitled on the basis of the first
                    quotation to charge for smaller quantities of steel on a lump sum basis. It
                    contended that this is really an issue of construction of the quotation. The
                    owner had agreed to be charged on a lump sum basis. The quotation did not say
                    that the shipyard could charge a lump sum to be agreed between the parties. All
                    it said was that the shipyard could charge a lump sum price. The shipyard was
                    therefore entitled to charge such lump sum as it considered reasonable without
                    referring back to the owner for agreement. The discretion lay with the shipyard
                    to fix the lump sum to be charged for these steel renewal items. Looking at the
                    sequence of the items chargeable in the quotation, the amount that it could
                    charge for steel renewals of one tonne and below on a lump sum basis had, the
                    shipyard argued, necessarily to be more than $6.20 per kg, on any view. Further,
                    the term “lump sum basis” was clear enough to those in the
                    business of ship repairs and it would have been understood by the owner that the
                    lump sum would be fixed by the shipyard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In my judgment, the shipyard’s argument
                    is correct. It was clear from the acceptance of the first quotation by the owner
                    that it was willing to pay the shipyard on a lump sum basis for the smallest
                    quantities of steel used in the renewal exercise (<em>ie</em>, one tonne and below). That meant that it would accept
                    whatever lump sum was charged by the shipyard unless the sum was exorbitant. The
                    owner did not qualify its acceptance of the quotation in any way. It did not
                    reserve to itself the right to agree on the quantum of the lump sum.
                    Accordingly, as far as this item is concerned, I think that rather than the onus
                    being on the shipyard to show that the lump sum charged was reasonable, in order
                    to avoid the amount charged, the onus would be on the owner to show that the
                    lump sum charged was unreasonable. The owner did not adduce any evidence on this
                    point. Since the owner was willing to accept the lump sum basis of charge in the
                    first quotation for the requisite quantities of steel, I can infer that it would
                    have accepted the same basis of charge for such quantities in the later
                    quotations. Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed on this issue and the
                    amounts to be paid by the owner for steel renewals of one tonne and below must
                    be as per the amounts shown for the same in invoice 5593.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The amount charged by the shipyard for this
                    item was $6,331. The AR accepted the owner’s argument that the
                    shipyard’s calculations were incorrect and the correct amount to be
                    charged was $4,506.66. Although the shipyard put in written submissions
                    challenging this decision, in the course of the oral arguments, counsel informed
                    me that it was not proceeding with its challenge on this amount. I therefore do
                    not have to deal with it.</p>

<font style="font-variant: small-caps;">mark-up on non-standard items bought off the shelf and mark-up on
                sub-contractors’ prices</font>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     During the course of the work, the shipyard
                    procured non-standard items from suppliers and also employed sub-contractors for
                    some of the works that needed to be done. In respect of these two items, the
                    shipyard did not simply pass on to the owner the amounts which it had paid the
                    suppliers and sub-contractors. Instead, it charged the owner for the same at
                    prices which included its own mark-up which often amounted to well over 35%. The
                    AR accepted the owner’s argument that the sub-contractors’ and
                    suppliers’ invoices should be taken as reflecting the reasonable prices
                    payable for the services and goods supplied. In the absence of evidence that the
                    shipyard’s mark-up was reasonable, the AR awarded only the amounts which
                    the shipyard had actually to pay its suppliers and
                sub-contractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Before me, the shipyard argued that the AR was
                    wrong to award these items at cost only. It said that there must be an element
                    of profit worked into the amount that the shipyard could charge. This was simple
                    business logic as otherwise there would be no point in the shipyard carrying out
                    the work and in such circumstances it would be better for the owner to engage a
                    sub-contractor directly. I must say that I do not accept this last argument
                    because any shipowner would engage a ship repairer on the basis that that ship
                    repairer has offered to do all of the work on the vessel that the shipowner
                    requires. The shipowner is not concerned with whether the repairer does the work
                    itself or employs sub-contractors to do so as long as the work gets done. There
                    is no way that any shipowner would know which part of the work the repairer
                    cannot do on its own and needs a sub-contractor for. In fact, if any ship
                    repairer were to go out and tell vessel owners that it would only do part of the
                    repairs and the owners would have to employ sub-contractors for the rest, such a
                    ship repairer is unlikely to get much business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the other hand, I do accept that whilst a
                    repairer may have to outsource some of its work and obtain some items from
                    others, it will incur costs in doing so and it would not be fairly remunerated
                    if it were only entitled to charge the exact price that it had to pay for such
                    goods and services. The question is: what is a reasonable mark-up? The problem
                    here is that there was no evidence on what a reasonable mark-up would be.
                    Mr Temple had testified that the amounts charged were reasonable but there
                    was no evidence as to whether he knew by how much each item had been marked-up.
                    The shipyard submitted that for the items listed in schedule 7 of the list it
                    had furnished to the AR, the mark-up was actually about 35% whereas the items
                    listed in schedule 9 had been marked-up by 29.2%. No explanation was given for
                    this difference and there was no evidence as to why such mark-up rates were
                    reasonable. The shipyard ideally should have furnished evidence as to the usual
                    rates of mark-up in the industry. In the absence of such evidence, whilst I
                    think it is incorrect not to allow the shipyard some element of profit, that
                    element cannot be as high as 29.2%, let alone 35%. In the circumstances, I would
                    vary the award by allowing the shipyard a mark-up of 10% to cover its
                    administrative costs in sourcing the supplies and supervising the
                    sub-contractors. I accept that this is a rather arbitrary figure but I think it
                    is not unfair in view of the lack of evidence justifying a higher
                    mark-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on invoice 5593</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I have accepted the shipyard’s
                    arguments, to some extent at least, in respect of two categories of items in
                    invoice 5593. Accordingly, the AR’s award has to be varied to reflect
                    this. I will see the parties to determine the exact sums which are payable to
                    the shipyard in the light of this decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The shipyard’s appeal on the owner’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The award in favour of the owner for loss of profit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At the time of the fire, the owner had entered
                    into a confirmed charterparty in respect of the vessel for a period of one year
                    with an option to extend for another year. The commencement of the charterparty
                    (originally scheduled for 21 May 2008) had been delayed by the fact that
                    the work on the vessel had not been completed, but, as at the date of the fire,
                    the charterparty was still in force and the owner expected that upon completion
                    of work, the vessel would immediately be on hire. The charter hire payable was
                    $5,900 per day. On 27 June 2008, the charterers terminated the charter
                    because the vessel was unable to perform the contract due to the damage caused
                    by the fire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The owner’s case before the AR was that
                    it was entitled to claim loss of profits arising out of the cancelled
                    charterparty for the confirmed contractual period of one year. The loss was
                    calculated by taking the total revenue that would have been earned under the
                    charterparty and deducting the expenses that would have been incurred in earning
                    that revenue for the period of one year. The shipyard contested this claim and
                    argued that the owner could not claim loss of hire for the full 12 months but
                    should only be awarded loss of hire for two months since its expert had
                    testified that the owner should have been able to replace the vessel within two
                    months. It also made arguments relating to the quantum of compensation. The
                    shipyard said that in any event, it was not likely that the vessel would be
                    fully utilised on the charter for 12 months and a utilisation factor of 85%
                    should be applied. Further, the shipyard questioned the owner’s costs of
                    operating the vessel (the owner had calculated these as being $411,688.42) and
                    submitted that the operational cost would instead amount to US$3,000 a day or
                    US$1,095,000 per year. The AR rejected all the shipyard’s arguments and
                    awarded the owner the amount that it had claimed. On the appeal, the shipyard
                    reiterated the arguments that it had made below. I will consider these in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What was the owner’s loss of profit?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There are three sub-issues that have to be
                    considered in relation to the calculation of the loss of profits suffered by the
                    owner by reason of the destruction of the vessel. The first relates to whether
                    the whole of the expected charter hire should be considered and if this is
                    decided in the affirmative, then the next two relate to what deductions should
                    be made from such charter hire to get the owner’s net loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">What are the relevant legal principles?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Relying on <em>The
                        Kate</em> [1899] P 165, <em>The
                        Racine</em> [1906] P 273 and <em>Owners of
                        Dredger Liesbosch v Owners of Steamship Edison</em>
                    [1933] AC 449 (“<em>The
                    Liesbosch</em>”), the AR accepted that it was established law that
                    where a profit-earning chattel is lost or destroyed, the owner is entitled to
                    claim putative profits lost as a result of the destruction. The shipyard
                    acknowledged the principle established in those cases but submitted that the
                    owner could only be compensated for loss of the charter hire up to the date on
                    which a substitute vessel could reasonably have been available for use. It
                    submitted that the case was not about mitigation (the AR having held that she
                    was not convinced that there was a reasonable opportunity for the owner to
                    mitigate its loss by acquiring an alternative vessel) but about awarding the
                    owner an amount in damages that properly and adequately compensated for its
                    loss. The shipyard further submitted that the measure of damages should reflect
                    the value of the vessel and for that purpose cited the following observation by
                    Lord Wright in <em>The Liesbosch</em> (at 464):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he measure of damages in such cases is the value of the ship to her
                        owner as a going concern at the time and place of the loss. In assessing
                        that value regard must naturally be had to her pending engagements, either
                        profitable or the reverse. The rule, however, obviously requires some care
                        in its application; the figure of damage is to represent the capitalized
                        value of the vessel as a profit-earning machine, not in the abstract but in
                        view of the actual circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should note at this stage, however, that that statement must also be
                    looked at in the light of the overarching principle which Lord Wright himself
                    had expressed earlier in the judgment (at 459) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The substantial issue is what in such a case as the present is the true
                        measure of damage. It is not questioned that when a vessel is lost by
                        collision due to the sole negligence of the wrongdoing vessel the owners of
                        the former vessel are entitled to what is called <em>restituto in integrum</em>, which means that they should recover
                        such a sum as will replace them, so far as can be done by compensation in
                        money, in the same position as if the loss had not been inflicted on them,
                        subject to the rules of law as to remoteness of damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As stated earlier, the shipyard submitted that
                    this was not an issue regarding mitigation. It was about awarding the owner an
                    amount in damages that properly and adequately compensated for its loss. Relying
                    on <em>The Liesbosch</em>, the shipyard was seeking to
                    establish not that the owner ought to have mitigated its loss but that the
                    measure of damages should reflect the value of the ship. The measure of damages
                    must be calculated in this way in order to ensure that the principle of
                        <em>restituto in integrum</em> was upheld. In order to
                    put the owner back into position, the true value of the vessel must be derived
                    and therefore some consideration must be given as well to the lost
                    vessel’s pending engagements. Such consideration was given in <em>The Liesbosch</em> as compensation for the “delay and
                    prejudice” caused to the pending engagements. Therefore, the shipyard
                    submitted, the correct heads of damage to which the owner was entitled
                    were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">market value of the vessel as the same had been
                            determined by its expert, Captain Meade; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">compensation for the delay and prejudice caused to
                            the pending charter (<em>ie</em>, loss of profits
                            until the vessel could be replaced – a period of two
                            months).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In order to consider the shipyard’s
                    submissions I will have to spend some time discussing the applicable principles
                    by which one can determine the appropriate measure of damages due to a claimant
                    who has lost his vessel by reason of the defendant’s negligence, where the
                    vessel was engaged under a prospective time charterparty. The general principle,
                    that of <em>restituto in integrum</em>, was, as noted
                    above, enunciated by Lord Wright in <em>The
                    Liesbosch</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Before referring the <em>The
                        Liesbosch</em> in more detail, it is useful to look at the two
                    preceding cases which were applied by it and which the AR also referred to. In
                        <em>The Kate</em>, the President (Sir
                    F. H. Jeune) stated at 168-9 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t would have appeared to me clear that in some way or other the
                        principles upon which damages are assessed would <em>require
                            account to be taken of the profitable character of the charterparty
                            under which the ship was at the time of her loss</em>. … It
                        may be nothing more than a question of statement of figures whether the
                        owner of a vessel, lost when under a profitable charterparty, is recouped
                        his loss by receiving her value at the conclusion of her voyage plus the
                        profits of her charterparty, or by receiving her value at the time of
                        collision, such value being enhanced by the fact that the ship at the time
                        was under a profitable charterparty. But unless in one or other of these
                        ways the owner gets the benefit of the profitable engagement of his ship, he
                        obviously fails to realize a <em>restituto in
                            integrum</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The learned President drew support from
                        <em>The Northumbria</em> (1869) LR 3 A &amp;
                    E 6 which considered the measure of damages to be awarded for a total loss of a
                    ship with cargo. In such a case, the damages included the value of the ship at
                    the end of the voyage and the value of freight that would have been earned less
                    operational expenses (<em>ie</em>, the net income); and if
                    no cargo was on board, then interest on the value of the ship from the day of
                    the collision (<em>ie</em>, the value of the ship as a
                    going concern). The judge then extended the principles from a ship with cargo to
                    a ship without cargo but under charter, and awarded the profits lost under the
                    charterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>The Racine</em>,
                    the defendants appealed to reduce the amount of damages awarded by the registrar
                    on a ground that the allowance of possible profit the plaintiffs would have made
                    on three successive charterparties was problematic and too remote, and the
                    arbitrary deduction of 10% for contingencies revealed the speculative character
                    of the calculation. This argument was rejected. The English Court of Appeal
                    followed <em>The Kate</em>, and upheld the
                    registrar’s award of the loss of profits on the <em>three</em> successive (one ongoing and two prospective) charters as
                    damages, less a reasonable percentage for contingencies. Fletcher
                    Moulton LJ said (at 281) that he saw no difference in principle between one
                    voyage and a chain of voyages under the same charterparty, or a chain of voyages
                    under <em>separate charterparties</em> which was the
                    situation in that case. Future profits were however subject to a discount
                    “by taking the possibility of accidents into consideration; and if [there
                    is a] chain of charterparties, of course the possibility of earning the profits
                    not being defeated increases with the lapse of time”
                    <em>per</em> Vaughan Williams LJ (at 278) and Fletcher
                    Moulton LJ (at 281).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Turning to <em>The
                        Liesbosch</em>, there the claimant’s dredger, which was required
                    by them for the performance of a contract, was sunk by the defendant. The case
                    differed from the earlier cases in that the dredger was not under charter, but
                    was “employed by owners in the normal course of their business as civil
                    engineers” (at 465). The House of Lords recognised that <em>if immediate replacement was possible</em>, the measure of
                    damages would be calculated by taking the market price of a replacement. But
                    because immediate replacement was a merely fanciful idea in the circumstances
                    (as a purchase would take time), the claimants were entitled to damages for the
                    delay and prejudice to their contract. It was in the context of his analysis of
                    the charterparty cases that Lord Wright uttered the observation which the
                    shipyard placed so much emphasis on and which I have cited as the first
                    quotation in <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Then, with respect to the measure of damages
                    that was applicable in the situation of the dredger working for the claimant to
                    perform services due from the claimant under a general contract for dredging, he
                    stated (at 468-9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he value of the <em>Liesbosch</em> to the
                        appellants, capitalized as at the date of the loss, must be assessed by
                        taking into account: (1.) the market price of a comparable dredger in
                        substitution; (2.) costs of adaptation, transport, insurance, etc. to Patras
                            [<em>ie</em>, the place of performance]; (3.)
                        compensation for disturbance and loss in carrying out their contract over
                        the period of delay between the loss of the <em>Liesbosch</em> and the time at which the substituted dredger
                        could reasonably have been available for use in Patras, including in that
                        loss such items as overhead charges, expenses of staff and equipment, and so
                        forth thrown away, but neglecting any special loss due to the
                        appellants’ financial position. On the capitalized sum so assessed,
                        interest will run from the date of the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The learned author of <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>McGregor</em>”) noted that the rule
                    in <em>The Liesbosch</em> fused the two heads of
                    conventional losses which are the normal measure and consequential loss: at
                    para 32-063, P 1188. This might lead to a duplication of damages
                    if the two heads are not viewed in relation to each other, a danger recognised
                    by Lord Wright who stated (at 464) of <em>The
                        Liesbosch</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The rule … requires some care in its application; the figure of
                        damage is to represent the capitalized value of the vessel as a
                        profit-earning machine, not in the abstract but in view of the actual
                        circumstances. The value of prospective freights <em>cannot
                            simply be added to the market value</em> but ought to be taken
                        into account in order to ascertain the total value for purpose of assessing
                        the damage, since if it is merely added to the market value of a free ship,
                        the owner will be getting pro tanto his damages twice over. The vessel
                        cannot be earning in the open market, while fulfilling the pending charter
                        or charters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, in cases where the vessel was under no ongoing or prospective
                    engagements, the measure of damages would simply be its value as a going concern
                    at the date of loss. The shipyard’s application of <em>The
                        Liesbosch</em> to the facts of this case does not take account of the
                    difference between the situation of the vessel here which had a prospective
                    engagement and that of the dredger which was simply engaged in general work
                    which could be performed by a substitute vessel although the shipyard did accept
                    that once the charterparty was cancelled, it could not be resuscitated and
                    performed even if a replacement vessel had been purchased by the owner in the
                    ensuing two months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Apart from <em>The
                        Liesbosch</em>, <em>The Kate</em> and <em>The Racine</em> were also applied in <em>The
                        Empress of Britain</em> (1913) 29 TLR 423. Unfortunately,
                        <em>The Liesbosch</em> did not refer to <em>The Empress of Britain</em>. In that case, the
                    plaintiff’s vessel, the <em>Helvetia</em>, was
                    employed under a charterparty dated 1909, which was to be in force from 1911 to
                    1917 unless the charterers cancelled it for any particular reason. The vessel
                    was sunk in 1912 by the defendant’s vessel. The plaintiff claimed
                    £24,320 for the loss of this charter for the unexpired period of 1912 and
                    the subsequent five seasons. Before the registrar, £2,000 was allowed as he
                    thought that <em>restituto in integrum</em> would be better
                    effected if loss of hire was allowed only up to 15 November 1912 “than to
                    endeavour to ascertain the value of the <em>Helvetia</em>
                    five years hence, and of the loss of hire with various deductions for
                    contingencies.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On appeal by the plaintiff, it was held that
                    the <em>whole</em> charterparty (<em>ie</em>, from 1912 till 1917) was to be taken into account in
                    assessing the damages. This included the contingencies and the
                    charterparty’s special terms such as the annual option to cancel. The
                    relevant part from the report is set out in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The learned Registrar had excluded from his consideration the benefit
                        accruing to the Helvetia from the fact that she was under this charterparty
                        not to run out except in certain events till 1917, and he had specifically
                        allowed loss of hire to November 15, 1912, only - the end of the
                        current season during which the Helvetia was sunk. Some date had to be
                        taken, and his Lordship had to say what that date ought to be. He did not
                        think the end of the season was the date, and there were only two other
                        possible dates - (1) February, 1914, the date at which another vessel like
                        the Helvetia could have been built. His Lordship did not think that date
                        would do, for it did not follow that if another vessel like the Helvetia was
                        ordered she would be engaged under <em>this charterparty or
                            in this business</em>, and without a charterparty of this kind it
                        was doubtful if any one would build a vessel like this. (2) The only other
                        date was November 15, 1917, when the charter expired. This was
                            <em>a date long forward of the time at which one had
                            arrived</em>, and his Lordship thought it might create difficulty
                        as to ascertainment, <em>but to that date the value of this
                            vessel had to be determined</em>, subject to all the contingencies
                        as to the charterparty which would exist and the special provisions as to
                        the terms of the charterparty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     
          <em>McGregor</em>
                    commented, in relation to <em>The Empress of Britain</em>:
                    “This goes a long way: one may suspect that there is this limitation,
                    namely that the period over which loss of profit is allowed does not extend
                    beyond the time when the claimant could reasonably have procured a substitute
                    vessel” (at para 32-061, P 1186-7). The shipyard relied on this
                    comment to argue that even in cases where it was <em>not
                        necessary</em> for a ship owner to seek a replacement vessel, loss of
                    profits <em>should still be limited</em> to the date by
                    which a replacement vessel could reasonably be obtained. In this case, citing
                    the evidence of Captain Meade that supply/towing vessels of the type of the
                        <em>Rainbow Star</em> were fairly easily obtainable in
                    the market and that a replacement could be located and purchased within two
                    months, the shipyard submitted that a reasonable time period for the replacement
                    of the vessel was two months and therefore no more than two months’ loss
                    of profit should be awarded to the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It would be noted that the shipyard’s
                    argument goes further than <em>McGregor’s</em>
                    comment. It is implicit in that comment that the procurement of a substitute
                    vessel must be held to be reasonable before the limitation applies. In any case,
                    I think that there are good reasons to reject the shipyard’s argument
                    which is based on <em>McGregor’s</em> comment which
                    itself is not an established principle of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     First, <em>McGregor</em>
                    did not explain when and why it considered such a limitation should be imposed.
                    If the length of the vessel’s engagement is to be the sole trigger for the
                    imposition of such a limitation, it would be impossible to avoid an arbitrary
                    application of the rule. If the underlying concern is to protect the defendant
                    from indeterminate liability, the existing rules of remoteness (<em>viz</em>, the test of “reasonable
                    foreseeability”) and causation (<em>viz</em>, the
                    “but for” test) are sufficient to do so. There is no need for an
                    additional limitation which is predicated on what the plaintiff ought to have
                    done subsequent to the defendant’s wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Secondly, even if <em>McGregor</em> meant something more specific, <em>viz</em>, “… beyond the time when the claimant could
                    reasonably have procured a substitute vessel [<em>to perform that
                        contract</em>]”, the limitation remains objectionable. It
                    assumes that the party who contracted with the claimant would be willing to keep
                    the contract alive so as to give the claimant time to obtain a substitute vessel
                    to perform the contract and that the claimant had the necessary wherewithal to
                    obtain such a vessel. Only if these two assumptions obtain would the claimant
                    have lost only the income over the period before the substitute vessel was
                    obtained, thus allowing the risk of overcompensation to materialise. However, if
                    the claimant’s contracting party terminated the contract immediately, it
                    is hard to justify why the claimant should purchase a substitute vessel. It is
                    not commercially realistic or fair to allocate the risk to the ship owner and
                    expect him to purchase a substitute vessel in contemplation of procuring a
                    similar engagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Thirdly, the words <em>McGregor</em> used - “when the claimant <em>could reasonably have procured</em> a substitute vessel”
                    (emphasis added) - bear strong resemblance to the rule of mitigation. But the
                    concept of mitigation contains several essential features which are inconsistent
                    with the shipyard’s contention. In this regard, as mentioned above, the
                    shipyard itself was at pains to argue that the concept of mitigation was not
                    relevant to the circumstances of the present case and that the AR had been
                    incorrect to invoke it. It is thus somewhat ironical that the textbook passage
                    it relied on should bear an essential similarity to the concept of mitigation
                    which I will briefly discuss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     A claimant must take reasonable steps to
                    mitigate the loss arising from the defendant’s wrong, and the claimant
                    will not be entitled to recover damages in respect of any part of the loss which
                    is due to his neglect to take such steps. However, the standard of
                    reasonableness must take into account the claimant’s characteristics:
                        <em>The “Asia Star”</em> [2010]
                    2 SLR 1154 at [31]. Also, the question of mitigation is a question of
                        <em>fact</em>. This means that what is reasonable must
                    be determined according to the circumstances the claimant is placed in:
                        <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR 623 at [27]. Hence, it cannot be
                    correct to impose a separate rule of <em>law</em> which
                    restricts the claimant to the damages he would have obtained had he mitigated,
                        <em>whether or not</em> the mitigation was reasonable
                    or even possible: <em>The “Asia Star”</em> at
                    [30]-[32].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As a matter of procedure and burden of proof,
                    the legal rule which the shipyard proposes is also at odds with the rules which
                    apply to mitigation. It is well-established that the issue of mitigation must be
                    pleaded and proved by the defendant seeking to rely on it: <em>Jia Min Building Construction Pte Ltd v Ann Lee Pte Ltd</em> [2004]
                    3 SLR 288 at [71] following <em>Geest plc v
                        Lansiquot</em> [2002] 1 WLR 3111 at [14] and [16]. However,
                    the shipyard’s proposition would enable a defendant to circumvent these
                    procedural rules entirely. Thus, it cannot be a tenable
                proposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The shipyard also relied on several cases
                    which involve vessels with no engagements (referred to as seeking ships). These
                    cases did not assist the shipyard because the vessel here had a prospective time
                    charter and did not fall into the category of a seeking ship. In <em>Voaden v Champion</em> [2001] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Reps 739 (“<em>The Baltic
                    Surveyor</em>”), the lost vessel was not under any engagement.
                    Despite that, the owner attempted to claim for loss of <em>potential</em> chartering income. Colman J after analysing <em>The Liesbosch</em> held, (at 76), that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he claim for loss of chartering profits advanced in the present case
                        is, in my judgment, wrong in principle. <em>BS</em>
                            [<em>ie</em>, the lost vessel] had no pending
                        charter commitments at the date of the loss, which was at the end of the
                        chartering season. She was currently in a position analogous to Lord
                        Wright’s seeking ship and, as such, her potential as a profit-earning
                        engine in future chartering seasons would be reflected in her replacement
                        value. If interest were to run on that sum from the date of the loss, the
                        owner would be sufficiently compensated …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be seen from that quotation that it was because the vessel was
                    a seeking ship that its future earning potential was said to be reflected in its
                    replacement value. This does not support the shipyard’s proposition that
                    the loss of charter income for the full period of one year should not be awarded
                    here because Capt Meade in valuing the vessel had regard to its future earning
                    potential.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>The Llanover</em>
                    [1947] P 80, although at the time of collision the claimant’s
                    ship was under a government charter for an indefinite period, it was <em>not</em> awarded damages more than such profit as the vessel
                    would have made if the voyage on which it was engaged at the time of its loss
                    had been completed. Pilcher J reversed the decision of the assistant registrar
                    who had treated the lost ship as “under a long-term charter and after
                    making deductions for contingencies and for wear and tear” awarded the
                    loss of profits on top of the market value of the ship: at 85. It may therefore
                    appear that the <em>entire</em> charter was not to be taken
                    into account when assessing the payable damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     
          <em>The Llanover</em>
                    was, however, a unique case. The incident took place during the Second World
                    War. Pilcher J found that, at 86:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">in March, 1942, any British shipowner selling or buying a British ship
                        would do so with the knowledge that his ship would, so long as she was kept
                        efficient, be <em>assured of profitable engagement</em>
                        probably at rates laid down by the Ministry of War Transport. If this were
                        so, it seemed to follow that <em>any enhanced value due to
                            the virtual certainty of profitable employment was already reflected in
                            the prices realized by the sales of comparable ships</em> and was
                        therefore already included in the sum allowed by the assistant registrar
                        under [the going concern value of the vessel].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the war time circumstances ensured that there were no seeking
                    ships and the value of the lost ship when assessed as a going concern had
                    already reflected the profitable engagements it had obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     On the other hand, in <em>Four
                        of Hearts (Owners) v Fortunity (Owners)</em> [1961]
                    1 WLR 351, Hewson J awarded the loss of profits that a
                    motorcruiser, hired out on the Broads, would have made <em>for
                        the whole of the 1959 season</em> had she not been sunk, although only
                    16 out of the 25 weeks of that season had been booked at the time of the
                    sinking. This result was based on the finding [at 354] that “[v]essels on
                    the Broads … are employed in one small defined area, whose seasonal
                    employment at scheduled rates, not subject to fluctuation, can be fairly
                    accurately determined by comparison with what actually occurred in the hiring of
                    other craft similarly employed by the same owners”. He drew a distinction
                    between ocean shipping engagements that were not already contracted for and
                    fixed which were too uncertain to be taken into consideration and the particular
                    engagements that the motorcruiser would have been assured of. Hewson J then
                    awarded £350 for the loss of <em>expected</em> net
                    profits on top of the vessel’s £2,200 market value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     These three cases highlight the significance
                    of the basis of valuation in determining whether or not to award the loss of
                    profits for certain engagements. Where the going concern value only accounted
                    for the <em>earning capacity</em>, but did not take into
                    account the vessel’s <em>assured engagements</em>,
                    the value of these engagements must be added because the ship owner can say for
                    sure that but for the defendant’s negligence, he would have been able to
                    perform them. In the present case, it was clear from Capt Meade’s report
                    that he considered the earning capacity of a vessel of the same type as
                        <em>The Rainbow Star</em> in the prevailing market
                    conditions but without regard for the confirmed charter that <em>The Rainbow Star</em> was due to embark on immediately the repair
                    work had been completed. He stated in his report that on or about
                        10<sup></sup>June 2008 (expected date of completion of repairs and work done)
                    upon successful completion of her repairs and class survey, he would have valued
                    the vessel at around US$1.75m. He based this valuation partly on the cost of
                    completing the special survey which he estimated (including ship
                    repairer’s bills) as being in the region of US$1m. He also noted that a
                    similar vessel of this size, type and age, when “out of survey”,
                    would have been worth US$650,000 to US$750,000. Capt Meade observed, “It
                    is also fair to state that the ‘special survey’ would ‘add
                    value’ to the vessel almost on a $ to $ basis of total cost of the survey
                    to value added”. Plainly, in valuing the vessel at US$1.75m, Capt Meade
                    did not have regard to the expected profit from the charterparty that had been
                    fixed for it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Accordingly, I must reject the
                    shipyard’s submissions. The AR was correct to use the charter hire the
                    vessel would have earned for the whole of the confirmed period of the charter as
                    the basis of calculation of the owner’s loss of profits by reason of the
                    fire.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">What utilisation factor should be applied to the vessel?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The shipyard contended before the AR and again
                    on appeal that the utilisation level of the vessel during the charter would only
                    have been 85% (<em>ie</em>, that the vessel would have been
                    off-hire for 15% of the charter period) and therefore any loss of profit would
                    have to be adjusted according to this factor. This argument was based on the
                    evidence of Capt Meade who said that because of its age and condition, the
                    vessel could not be fully utilised during the charter as it would break down and
                    require both repairs and routine maintenance work. The AR rejected this argument
                    on the basis that Meade’s figure of an 85% utilisation rate was not
                    supported by any evidence or analysis. Moreover there was no evidence to show
                    that the vessel had had repair or maintenance issues during prior charters with
                    the same charterers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On the appeal, the shipyard reiterated its
                    arguments. It again emphasised the vessel’s age and Capt Meade’s
                    assertion that it would break down from time to time. The shipyard further
                    pointed out that the principle of applying a discount to profit was recognised
                    in <em>The Racine</em>. There the English Court of Appeal
                    had upheld a discount of 10% from the net freights which the claimant had
                    lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The owner responded by supporting the
                    AR’s reasoning and by pointing out that during cross-examination, Capt
                    Meade had agreed that there was no evidence to show that repairs or maintenance
                    issues had arisen during the vessel’s prior charters. Capt Meade had
                    further considered that the vessel had undergone extensive repairs and would
                    have commenced the new charter in good condition. Thus, he agreed that it was
                    not certain that the vessel would break down during the charter. It submitted
                    that on the evidence, Capt Meade’s figure of 85% was without any objective
                    basis and the AR was correct to apply a utilisation figure of
                100%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The owner did not seriously argue that
                    contingencies that might have arisen to prevent him from earning his full net
                    income even if the vessel had been able to carry out the charter should not be
                    accounted for. Its point was that there was no basis for the 85% figure, and
                    without evidence as to what contingencies might arise and for how long they
                    would put the vessel off-hire, it would be too speculative to reduce the income
                    by any amount. The authorities are clear, however, that contingencies must be
                    provided for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The difficulty resides in identifying such
                    contingencies, which are speculative by nature, in order to prevent
                    overcompensation whilst at the same time respecting the principle of <em>restituto</em>. Whilst a majority of the reported cases have
                    dealt with voyage charterparties, this does not stand in the way of making
                    deductions for contingencies arising in time charterparties, as <em>The Empress of Britain</em> illustrated. Similarly, in
                        <em>The Racine</em>, three successive voyage
                    charterparties were taken into consideration and a discount of 10% was given for
                    contingencies which was upheld on appeal. The assessment of contingencies in
                        <em>The Racine</em>’s engagement was arguably
                    fraught with even greater speculation than a straightforward year-long
                    charterparty. In any event, Lord Wright while acknowledging the speculative
                    nature of this task did not think it ought to prevent the entirety of the
                    assured engagement or engagements from being considered. He stated in <em>The Liesbosch</em> (at 464):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he present valuation for a future charter becomes a matter of
                        difficulty in the case of <em>long charters</em>, such
                        for instance as that in the <em>Lord Strathcona Steamship Co.
                            v. Dominion Coal Co</em>. [1926] 1 AC 108 which was for
                        ten St. Lawrence seasons, with extension at the charterers’ option for
                        further eight seasons. The assessment of the value of such a vessel at the
                        time of loss, <em>with her engagements</em>, may seem
                        to present an <em>extremely complicated and speculative
                            problem</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     What contingencies any particular vessel may
                    meet would be a question of inference and probabilities depending on the age and
                    condition of the vessel, the type of work it performs and the geographical
                    routes it can be expected to undertake. In this case, the contingencies
                    mentioned by Capt Meade were the breakdowns and routine maintenance works that
                    he thought a vessel of this age would encounter. However, as he himself
                    admitted, in view of the repair works conducted by the shipyard, it was
                    uncertain whether these would materialise. I cannot, however, disregard the
                    likelihood of breakdowns entirely nor can I disregard the possibility of an
                    accident like a collision with a fixed or floating object occurring during the
                    term of the charter. However, since the charter term was only for a year, the
                    likelihood of such an incident would be proportionally reduced. In the
                    circumstances of this case, I think it would be fair to allow a 5% discount for
                    contingencies. I would therefore fix the utilisation level at 95%. That would
                    mean that over a period of 365 days, I assume that the vessel would be on hire
                    for approximately 347 days and off hire for 18 days. I think that it is a
                    reasonable approximation bearing in mind that in <em>The
                        Racine</em>, the utilisation level chosen was 90% over three voyages
                    which could have extended to a year or somewhat more in duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">What operational costs should be deducted from the total charter hire
                earned?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Before the AR, the owner accepted that the
                    costs of operating the vessel during the one year confirmed charter period had
                    to be deducted from the charter hire. The owner’s evidence, given by
                    Mr Juffri, was that its operational costs would have amounted to
                    $411,688.42. The AR accepted this figure and rejected Capt Meade’s
                    evidence for the shipyard that the operational costs would be US$3,000 a day.
                    She held that Capt Meade’s evidence was not substantiated and was also
                    speculative in part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On the appeal, the shipyard reiterated Capt
                    Meade’s opinion that operational costs for this type and style of vessel
                    would be around US$3,000 per day. The owner’s contention that its
                    operational costs would be $411,648.42 for one year or $1,127.80 per day was not
                    realistic since it was so much lower than Capt Meade’s figure. I see no
                    reason to accept the shipyard’s contention in this regard. Capt Meade had
                    admitted that his estimation of the operational costs was based only on general
                    “empirical experience”. On the other hand, the owner had based its
                    calculation on costs paid previously including the wages established by the
                    employment contracts of the crew. Where the owner differed from Capt Meade was
                    that it made no allowance for repair and maintenance costs but this was
                    reasonable because the vessel would have completed extensive repairs when it
                    commenced the charter and would have been on good condition. Further, it had a
                    store of spare parts and two engineers on board to do routine repairs and
                    maintenance without incurring additional costs. Thus, the likelihood of the
                    vessel needing repairs during that one year costing US$450 a day, as estimated
                    by Capt Meade, was extremely low. The AR’s holding must be
                upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on loss of earnings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the reasons given above, the AR’s
                    order must stand except that the calculation of the gross earnings from the
                    charterparty for the confirmed one-year period should be reduced by five
                    percent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The AR awarded the owner interest on the value
                    of the vessel from the date of accrual of the cause of action, <em>ie</em>, 8 June 2008 up till the date of payment. The
                    shipyard argued that interest should only have been awarded from the date that
                    the owner filed its counterclaim in this action, 31 October
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The argument was based on the long established
                    rule in admiralty that where a vessel has become a total loss by reason of a
                    collision, interest on value would be awarded from the date of destruction since
                    the interest is for the loss of use of the vessel. However, this argument is
                    varied in the case where the vessel concerned is carrying cargo at the time of
                    the collision. In that situation, interest would be awarded on the value of the
                    ship plus the value of the freight from the date on which the vessel was
                    expected to conclude the voyage, which is taken to be the date when the freight
                    would have been paid (see para 32-056 of <em>McGregor</em>). The shipyard noted that this principle was extended to
                    ships under charter by <em>The Racine</em>. It argued that
                    interest was awarded in this way because by allowing for freight, interest would
                    already be given for the use of the vessel during the interval between the
                    collision and her expected arrival in port.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Following the shipyard’s argument to its
                    logical conclusion, I would expect it to claim that interest should be awarded
                    on the value of the ship from the end of the one year charter term because if
                    the owner recovered charter hire for one year, it would already be in effect
                    obtaining interest for the use of the vessel during that period. However, it was
                    content to argue for interest to accrue from the date when the owner filed its
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The owner relied on <em>The
                        Berwickshire</em> [1950] P 204 in which the court in
                    awarding interest from the date of collision held (at 217) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he true principle underlying the award of interest in Admiralty is that
                        in very £’s worth of damage in respect of which interest is
                        ultimately awarded, the interest has accrued potentially from the moment
                        when the damage was suffered until the liability has been adjudged and the
                        amount finally ascertained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It therefore argued that the date to be taken had to be the date of
                    the loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     
          <em>The
                    Berwickshire</em>, however, concerned a French fishing vessel which was
                    sunk with a cargo of cod fish during the Second World War and the main issue was
                    whether interest could be awarded from the date of the casualty to
                    13 October 1944 which was the date when France was liberated from
                    German occupation. Prior to that date, it was impossible for the owners of the
                    fishing vessel to sue the owners of <em>The
                        Berwickshire</em> or for the latter to admit liability and pay
                    compensation because this would have been against the <em>Trading
                        with the Enemy Act, 1939</em>. The usual principles applicable to the
                    award of interest in admiralty cases were not in issue in that case and,
                    further, in the course of his judgment, Lord Merriman P cited, without
                    demur, the judgment of Sir Robert Phillimore in <em>The
                        Northumbria</em> in which the latter had observed, <em>inter alia</em>, that under the rule of <em>restituto
                        in integrum</em>, the cargo carrying vessel did not obtain interest
                    from the date of the collision because she received it in the shape of the
                    freight at the port of delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Having regard to the authorities and the
                    rationale for delaying the award of interest, I think it was not correct to
                    award the owner interest on the value of the vessel from the date of the loss
                    since the AR had also awarded the net amount of charter hire for one year that
                    the owner lost by reason of the fire. The owner was therefore doubly
                    compensated. Since the shipyard only asked for interest to be awarded on the
                    value of the vessel from 31 October 2008, I vary the award so that
                    interest will accrue from that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Agency fees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The owner claimed agency fees of $1,050 per
                    month which it had paid AMM Ships Pte Ltd from 22 June 2008 to
                    22 January 2010. The AR awarded the owner $21,000 under this head. On
                    appeal, the shipyard submitted that the amount should be reduced by
                    $3,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The figure of $1,050 per month comprised $850
                    for agency fees, $100 for communications and $100 for inland transportation. The
                    shipyard pointed out that during cross-examination, Mr Juffri had said that
                    he was only claiming the agency fees of $850 per month. During re-examination,
                    however, he changed his evidence to say that the fees were $1,050 per month. The
                    shipyard argued that prior to the repatriation of the crew in August 2008, it
                    was reasonable to incur fees for communications and transportation. Once all the
                    crew had been repatriated, however, these services were no longer required.
                    Moreover the vessel was under arrest from 22 September 2008. The amount
                    awarded should be reduced by $3,400 (being 17 months’ charges for
                    transportation and communications) to $17,600.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In response, the owner said that its case was
                    that the agency fees had to be paid as long as the vessel was anchored in
                    Singapore regardless of whether there was a crew on board. Mr Temple had
                    agreed in court that when a vessel is in Singapore it needs to have an agent,
                    and port dues and agency fees would have to be paid. The owner submitted that
                    the sum of $1,050 charged by AMM Ships Pte Ltd was the latter’s basic
                    charge which included minimum charges for inland transportation and
                    communication. This was supported by the invoices from AMM Ships Pte Ltd which
                    were adduced in evidence. The owner had paid these invoices and was simply
                    claiming what it had paid its agent. During cross-examination, Mr Juffri
                    also clarified his error in stating that the fees paid were $850 only and his
                    corrected evidence was consistent with the invoices from AMM Ships Pte
                    Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The invoices showed the amounts paid by the
                    owner to AMM Ships Pte Ltd. The shipyard did not produce any evidence that the
                    amounts charged were unreasonable. The AR considered that these expenses were
                    reasonably incurred. There is therefore no reason for me to differ from her
                    finding or to upset her award in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     For the reasons given above, the appeal must
                    be allowed in part. I will see the parties in order to formulate the exact terms
                    of the order so as to reflect the decisions that I have made above on how the
                    amounts awarded by the AR should be adjusted. Further, although the shipyard has
                    been partially successful in its appeal it has also failed in relation to
                    substantial portions of its claim and the owner’s counterclaim.
                    Accordingly, I think it necessary to hear the parties on what the appropriate
                    order as to the costs of the appeal should be.</p>
