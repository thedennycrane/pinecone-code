<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by Coöperatieve Centrale
                    Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, trading as Rabobank International, Singapore
                    Branch (“Rabobank”) against the decision of the trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) in setting aside a total payment of US$2,775,149.37
                    made by Jurong Technologies Industrial Corporation Ltd (under judicial
                    management) (“JTIC”) to Rabobank on 22 December 2008 (
                    “the Payment”) on the ground that it was an unfair preference
                    under s 227T of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“CA”), read with s 99 of the Bankruptcy Act
                    (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) (“BA”) (see <em>Jurong Technologies Industrial Corp Ltd (under judicial management) v
                        Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank
                        International, Singapore Branch</em>) [2011] 2 SLR 413
                    (“the GD”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The background facts of this case are as
                    follows. JTIC was an investment holding company which carried on the business of
                    providing electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) through
                    wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. Its principal operating subsidiary was
                    Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management)
                    (“JHTI”). Most of the business operations of JTIC and JHTI
                    (collectively, “the Companies”) were carried out by
                JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       JTIC’s business activities were financed
                    by loans from Rabobank and other banks (“Creditor Banks”), which
                    included ABN AMRO Bank NV (“ABN-AMRO”), Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
                    UFJ (“BTMU”), KBC Bank NV (“KBC”), DBS Bank Ltd
                    (“DBS”), Malayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”),
                    Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (“OCBC”), RHB Bank Berhad
                    (“RHB”) and United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”). All
                    the bank facilities, including those granted by Rabobank to the Companies, were
                    unsecured, but each Creditor Bank was given a negative pledge and a <em>pari passu</em> undertaking. Except for BTMU, Maybank and
                    RHB, which had granted facilities solely to JTIC, all the other Creditor Banks
                    granted facilities to the Companies jointly and severally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Rabobank was not the first Creditor Bank to
                    grant facilities to the Companies. When it first offered credit facilities to
                    the Companies, initially of up to US$13m to JTIC in September 2004, the
                    Companies had already given their existing Creditor Banks negative charges and
                        <em>pari passu</em> undertakings with respect to the
                    unsecured facilities. Rabobank agreed to grant facilities on the same terms.
                    Additionally, Rabobank also granted receivables financing of up to US$20m under
                    a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement on 15 February 2007 (“the
                    MRPA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       When Ms Joyce Lin Li Fang
                    (“Ms Lin”), a founding member of JTIC and a director since
                    26 April 1986, and also a director of JHTI since 26 August 2003, was
                    appointed Chairman of JTIC in March 2006, she began to be concerned with the
                    level of the Companies’ debts to the Creditor Banks. Sometime in April or
                    May 2008, Ms Lin made a presentation to DBS of the Companies’
                    financial position and told DBS that some of the Companies’ assets could
                    be “monetised”, <em>ie</em>, sold, to reduce
                    the Companies’ loans. These assets included the Companies’ EMS
                    business, shares in MAP Technology Holdings Limited (“MAP”) and
                    shares in Min Aik Technology Co Ltd (“the Min Aik Shares”). From
                    September 2008 to November 2008, the other Creditor Banks, including Sumitomo
                    Mitsui Banking Corporation, were also informed of the possible sale of these
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       By 30 June 2008, the Companies’ total
                    borrowings had reached the level of S$340m, of which about S$87m was owing to
                    DBS, S$70m to UOB, S$60m to OCBC and the remainder to the other Creditor Banks.
                    In July 2008, JHTI deposited with ABN-AMRO at its request 18.6m of the MAP
                    shares which it (JHTI) held. They were subsequently released to JHTI for
                    conversion into scripless shares. JHTI acquired more MAP shares, bringing its
                    total investment to 74,411,620 MAP shares (slightly below 20% of the paid-up
                    capital of MAP). Between August and October 2008, ABN-AMRO requested that the
                    74,411,620 MAP shares (“the MAP Shares”) be put in a custodian
                    account with it. The October 2008 request was made as a “non-negotiable
                    condition” for ABN-AMRO to refrain from recalling its facilities. JHTI
                    refused to do so for the reason that, as stated by Dr Chung Siang Joon
                    (“Dr Chung”), JTIC’s executive director of finance,
                    “this can trigger off and become a risk factor should the other
                    [Creditor] Banks come to learn about it”. He pleaded for support:
                    “I do hope you can understand my difficulty and obligation to the other
                    [Creditor] Banks”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       From September 2008 onwards, the Companies
                    encountered significant financial difficulties, due primarily to the global
                    recession and credit crunch, which had resulted in reduced orders from their
                    customers. During this period, the Companies’ trade creditors were chasing
                    for payment of their debts, and so were all the Creditor Banks. The Companies
                    could only make payments in the ordinary course of business from trade
                    receivables or by drawing on credit lines. The Companies continued to promise
                    the Creditor Banks that they would pay their loans and facilities from the
                    proceeds of sale of the MAP Shares, the Min Aik Shares and the EMS business.
                    Although the Companies were defaulting in the payment of debts due to the
                    Creditor Banks, they continued to roll over the debts. The Creditor Banks really
                    had no choice but to wait for the Companies to sell their assets in order to pay
                    their debts to the Creditor Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 11 September 2008, Rabobank requested
                    that the Companies reduce the amount of invoices sent for discounting to avoid
                    exceeding the MRPA’s limit of US$20m. On 22 September 2008,
                    Rabobank’s relationship manager, Mr Richard Lee Seow Hong
                    (“Mr Lee”), informed Ms Lin that the bank wished to exit
                    from financing non-core markets (<em>ie</em>, the
                    telecommunications and electronics sectors) and to end its relationship with the
                    Companies in an orderly fashion. Ms Lin then requested that Rabobank reduce
                    or cancel the banking facilities gradually and allow the Companies to pay
                    according to the maturity dates of those facilities. After the limit was reached
                    by the end of September 2008, no further invoices were sent to Rabobank for
                    discounting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Companies first defaulted on their
                    facilities with Rabobank on 7 October 2008, when they failed to pay over
                    receivables that were due to be paid by Motorola Electronics
                    (“Motorola”) to JHTI on that date. Besides this, JHTI failed to
                    make payment on other amounts, including invoices under the MRPA facility and
                    trade bills which had fallen due for payment in early October 2008. When the
                    Companies failed to settle trust receipts which were due on 16 October
                    2008, Rabobank force-debited JHTI’s current account, causing it to be
                    overdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Sometime in November 2008, Mr Lee asked
                    Ms Lin whether the MAP Shares could be placed in an escrow account with
                    Rabobank, but Ms Lin said that this could not be done and that the loans
                    due to Rabobank could be repaid instead from the sale proceeds of the Min Aik
                    Shares. Later that month, Mr Lee told Ms Lin that Rabobank wanted the
                    Min Aik Shares to be placed in an escrow account with it to ensure that the sale
                    proceeds of those shares would be paid to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 17 November 2008, Rabobank demanded
                    from JHTI payment of the unpaid receivables under the MRPA facility. On
                    25 November 2008, Ms Lin signed and issued a letter of undertaking to
                    set up an escrow account with Rabobank to hold the Min Aik Shares and to credit
                    the sale proceeds of the Min Aik Shares directly to the escrow account. However,
                    the escrow account was not set up, nor were the Min Aik Shares deposited with
                    Rabobank. In November and December 2008, Mr Lee sent numerous e-mails and
                    made various telephone calls to the Companies’ officers to ask them to
                    sell the Min Aik Shares and remit the proceeds to Rabobank. There were also
                    meetings between Rabobank and the Companies where the bank made the same
                    demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 14 October 2008 JTIC signed a
                    non-binding term sheet with Global Emerging Markets (“GEM”) to
                    sell part of JTIC’s EMS business (“the GEM Deal”). The
                    announcement made by JTIC the next day on the Singapore Exchange was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Board of Directors of [JTIC] wishes to announce that [JTIC] has
                        received and signed a non-binding term sheet with [GEM] … pursuant to
                        which GEM, together with various investors … have proposed the
                        formation of a special purpose vehicle… to acquire a significant
                        interest in selected electronic manufacturing services businesses and assets
                        … for cash consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Shareholders should note that the Proposed Disposal will be subject to,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, the negotiation and execution
                        of definitive agreements and the conduct of a due diligence ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Creditor Banks were informed that the GEM Deal could bring in as
                    much as US$160m. Two officers from GEM had visited Singapore in October 2008 to
                    evaluate the deal, and KPMG was to conduct the necessary due diligence in
                    January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     During this period, the Companies were in
                    default in paying certain short-term loans given by DBS, which continuously
                    pressed for payment by the deadline of 14 November 2008 from the proceeds
                    of sale of the MAP Shares, as Ms Lin had promised. On 13 November
                    2008, at a meeting with DBS, Ms Lin signed a security document which
                    created a charge on the MAP Shares in favour of DBS (“the
                    Charge”). The security document was fully executed on 17 November
                    2008. The validity of the Charge as an unfair preference has been considered in
                    the judgment of the High Court reported in <em>Tam Chee Chong and
                        another v DBS Bank Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR 310 and the judgment of
                    this court in Civil Appeal No 230 of 2010 (see <em>DBS Bank
                        Ltd v Tam Chee Chong and another (judicial managers of Jurong Hi-Tech
                        Industries Pte Ltd (under judicial management))</em> [2011] SGCA 47
                        (“<em>DBS Bank v Tam Chee
                    Chong</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 8 December 2008, JTIC made a public
                    announcement that its audit committee had commenced an investigation into
                    alleged irregularities in the administration of the receivables financing
                    facilities extended by Rabobank and OCBC to the Companies. On 9 December
                    2008, KordaMentha Pte Ltd, JTIC’s financial advisers, called a meeting of
                    all the Creditor Banks and informed them of JTIC’s outstanding debts. On
                    10 December 2008, DBS registered the particulars of the Charge with the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. By the end of December 2008, the
                    Companies had received letters of demand from KBC (on 7 November 2008),
                    Maybank (on 2 and 22 December 2008), ABN-AMRO (on 18 December 2008),
                    OCBC (on 26 December 2008) and BTMU (on 29 December 2008).
                    Additionally, the Companies had also received letters of demand from their trade
                    creditors, some of whom had filed actions in court as early as 12 December
                    2008 to recover their debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the meantime, JTIC was making preparations
                    to sell the Min Aik Shares, the proceeds of which Rabobank continued to make
                    demands for. On 17 December 2008, Rabobank sent a letter to the Companies
                    which demanded the payment of US$2m and S$0.8m within five business days, and
                    reserved the right to demand payment of other debts of US$12.3m and S$10.9m. On
                    the same day, Mr Lee continued to press for the immediate sale of the Min
                    Aik Shares. On 18 December 2008 and 7 January 2009, JTIC sold the Min
                    Aik Shares for a total of US$2,819,093.03, part of which, <em>ie</em>, the Payment, was remitted to Rabobank on 22 December
                    2008 in two tranches. By way of a letter dated 26 December 2008, Rabobank
                    informed JTIC that the Payment had been set off against the moneys due and owing
                    by the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 19 January 2009, DBS applied to court
                    to place JHTI under judicial management. Subsequently, four Creditor Banks (not
                    including Rabobank) applied to court on 3 February 2009 to place JTIC under
                    judicial management. These applications were granted by the Judge on
                    20 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 29 June 2009, JTIC applied to recover
                    the Payment from Rabobank on the ground that it was an undue preference under
                    s 227T of the CA, read with s 99 of the BA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     JTIC’s case was that it had been
                    influenced in deciding to make the Payment to Rabobank by a desire to produce
                    the effect of putting Rabobank in a position which, in the event of JTIC’s
                    insolvency, would be better than the position that Rabobank would have been in
                    if the Payment had not been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Rabobank took the position that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     JTIC did not possess the requisite
                        state of mind envisaged under the unfair preference regime as it did not
                        know that it was actually or imminently insolvent at the material
                        time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     JTIC had
                        not proved that it had, at the material time, the requisite desire to
                        improve Rabobank’s position in the event of its (JTIC’s)
                        insolvency. Furthermore, even if JTIC had possessed the requisite desire,
                        this desire was not operative in its mind in making the decision to make the
                        Payment; rather, the Payment was made in response to the commercial pressure
                        exerted by Rabobank on JTIC’s management for the repayment of its
                        facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In a reserved judgment delivered on
                    9 December 2010 (<em>ie</em>, the GD), the Judge
                    allowed JTIC’s application, holding that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Payment was an unfair preference
                        under s 227T of the CA, read with s 99 of the BA
                        (“Finding (a)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     JTIC was insolvent on the basis of the balance sheet test
                        and the liquidity test at the time when it made the Payment;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     JTIC’s
                        directors knew that the company was facing imminent liquidation by
                        22 December 2008 (the date on which the Payment was made) as it had
                        already received letters of demand from KBC, Maybank, ABN-AMRO and various
                        trade creditors, which letters of demand had not been fully met
                        (“Finding (c)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In respect of Finding (a), the Judge said
                    at [41]–[44] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    It was Ms Lin’s clear evidence given on
                            behalf of [JTIC] that she had agreed to pay the proceeds of the sale of
                            the Min Aik Shares to [Rabobank] as she had felt that [Rabobank] had
                            been supportive of the Companies. Despite her initial concern that
                            Rabobank would terminate the banking facilities extended to [JTIC] and
                            demand immediate repayment, [Rabobank] had continued to finance the
                            Companies and allowed for gradual reduction of the
                        facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    Ms Lin’s subjective view that [Rabobank]
                            had been supportive of the Companies is also objectively borne out by
                            the surrounding circumstances. Despite the Companies’ defaults,
                            [Rabobank] continued to invite the Companies to roll over the term loans
                            and refrained from withdrawing the facilities, even assuring [JTIC] that
                            it would exit the relationship gradually in an orderly and responsible
                            fashion. According to [Mr] Lee’s evidence on
                            cross-examination, the First Letter was either a
                            “friendly” letter of demand, or even “not a letter
                            of demand”. Even if [Rabobank] had indeed intended it to be a
                            letter of demand, doubts were raised as to whether [JTIC] ever received
                            it. Furthermore, when asked on cross-examination whether
                            [Rabobank’s] conduct could reasonably be viewed as supportive,
                            [Mr] Lee agreed that it could be so construed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    Not only was it clear that [Rabobank’s]
                            treatment of [JTIC] in the midst of its financial difficulties was less
                            threatening than the treatment by most of its other [Creditor Banks], it
                            was also clear that [JTIC] had treated [Rabobank] more favourably. Even
                            though the Companies had informed all their creditors in various
                            presentations that they would be raising funds to repay or reduce their
                            outstanding loans through the sale of the EMS business, the MAP Shares
                            and the Min Aik Shares, [JTIC] chose to pay the proceeds from the sale
                            of the Min Aik Shares to [Rabobank] alone. This is despite the fact that
                            the other [Creditor Banks] were also pressing for repayment from the
                            Companies. In fact, the other [Creditor Banks] had served formal letters
                            of demand on [JTIC], threatening to cancel the facilities forthwith.
                            Moreover, the knowledge that the payment of the sale proceeds of the Min
                            Aik Shares to [Rabobank] would have caused [JTIC] to be in breach of its
                            obligations under the negative pledge and <em>pari
                                passu</em> clauses in the facilities with the other [Creditor
                            Banks] did not deter [JTIC] from making the Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    All these indicate that the decision to make the
                            Payment was influenced by [JTIC’s] subjective desire to prefer
                            [Rabobank] in the event of the former’s insolvency by putting the
                            latter in a better position than it would be in if the Payment was not
                            made. [Rabobank] maintained, however, that whatever desire [JTIC] had to
                            prefer [Rabobank] was vitiated by the pressure that it had placed on
                            [JTIC] to repay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the question of whether JTIC’s desire
                    to prefer Rabobank was vitiated by the pressure put on it by Rabobank, the Judge
                    was of the view that commercial pressure could provide a good defence to a claim
                    of unfair preference, but that (at [48]
                    of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    … in my view, there must be a limit to the
                            defence of pressure exerted by creditors. In <em>Insolvency</em> vol 2 (Peter Totty and Gabriel
                            Moss QC ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 1986, August 2008
                            release) at para H4-08, it was suggested that the limit is provided
                            by a reference to commercial purpose. Thus, in circumstances where the
                            directors of a debtor company bow to creditor pressure in order to act
                            in the commercial interests of the company as a viable going concern,
                                <em>ie</em>, for “proper commercial
                            considerations” (see <em>Re [MC] Bacon</em>
                            ... at 336 and <em>Re Fairway Magazines Ltd; Fairbairn v
                                Hartigan</em> [1993] BCLC 643 at 649), the requisite desire
                            will not be established. <em>Conversely, if there is no
                                commercial benefit to the company at all in paying any creditor,
                                then the court should be extremely slow to find that pressure from
                                the creditor is a defence to the claim of unfair
                                preference</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In respect of Finding (c), the Judge said
                    at [32] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    ... In [<em>Amrae Benchuan Trading
                                Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Tan Te Teck Gregory</em> [2006]
                            4 SLR(R) 969  ], Menon JC was of the view (at [56])
                            that the lack of knowledge or expectation on the part of the
                            company’s controllers that it would be wound up imminently,
                            coupled with the fact that the impugned transaction had occurred
                            “a little less than two years before a petition for the winding
                            up of the plaintiff was in fact presented”, <em>pointed away from the probability</em> that those making the
                            payment were doing so with the relevant desire. In other words, lack of
                            knowledge of the company’s imminent winding up could be one factor
                            to be considered in deciding whether the statutory presumption has been
                            rebutted. I find nothing in his judgment that makes knowledge of the
                            company’s imminent winding up a <em>requirement</em> to be satisfied in order for an unfair
                            preference to be made out. If, however, that was the intended effect of
                            Menon JC’s judgment, I respectfully differ. [emphasis in

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on unfair preference</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Before we consider the parties’
                    arguments on the issues canvassed in this appeal, we set out below the
                    principles of law applicable to unfair preferences under s 227T of the CA,
                    read with s 99 of the BA, which we have summarised in our judgment in
                        <em>DBS Bank v Tam Chee Chong</em>. These principles
                    restate the law as enunciated by Millett J in <em>Re MC
                        Bacon Ltd</em> [1990] BCLC 324 (“<em>MC
                        Bacon</em>”), a judgment which has been approved and followed
                    in a number of decisions of the Singapore courts. They are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The test is not whether there is a
                        dominant intention to prefer, but whether the debtor’s decision was
                        influenced by a desire to prefer the creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     The court will look at the desire (a subjective
                        state of mind) of the debtor to determine whether it had positively wished
                        to improve the creditor’s position in the event of its own solvent
                        liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     The requisite desire may be proved by direct evidence or its existence may
                        be inferred from the existing circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     It is sufficient that the desire to
                        prefer is one of the factors which influenced the decision to enter into the
                        transaction; it need not be the sole or decisive factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     A transaction which is actuated by
                        proper commercial considerations may not constitute a voidable preference. A
                        genuine belief in the existence of a proper commercial consideration may be
                        sufficient even if, objectively, such a belief might not be
                        sustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In this appeal, Rabobank has not raised the
                    issue as to whether an unfair preference is a void, as distinguished from a
                    voidable, transaction under s 227T(1) of the CA: see s 329 of the CA.
                    We assume that this omission was a deliberate decision by reason of the fact
                    that the former Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 1985 Rev Ed), which had
                    created such a distinction, was repealed on 15 July 1995 by the new
                    Bankruptcy Act No 15 of 1995 on the same day that the then equivalent of
                    s 329 of the CA was amended to refer expressly to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the then equivalent of s 99 of the BA. In other words,
                    the retention of the distinction in s 329 between a void transaction and a
                    voidable one was a drafting oversight (see the apt comments of Lim Teong
                    Qwee JC in <em>Buildspeed Construction Pte Ltd (in
                        liquidation) v Theme Corp Pte Ltd and another</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 287 at [50]–[52] and
                    also our decision in <em>DBS Bank v Tam Chee Chong</em> at
                        [15]–[17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The main issue in this appeal is whether the
                    finding of the Judge that JTIC, in deciding to make or in making the Payment,
                    was influenced by the desire to prefer Rabobank to the other Creditor Banks is
                    correct. The sub-issues arising in this appeal are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Judge erred in holding
                        that JTIC was not required to prove that its controllers had knowledge of

                        (“Sub-Issue (a)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the time at which the existence and influence of
                        the requisite desire is to be determined is the time when the alleged
                        preference was actually granted, or the time when the decision to grant the
                        alleged preference was made (“Sub-Issue (b)”);
                    and</p>

                        showed that Rabobank had applied pressure on JTIC to repay its facilities

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the sub-issues raised in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We shall consider, first, the sub-issues of
                    law (<em>ie</em>, Sub-Issue (a) and
                    Sub-Issue (b)) for the reason that it is Rabobank’s case that its
                    submissions on these sub-issues, if accepted by this court, would negative any
                    argument by JTIC that it had, at the material time, the desire to prefer
                    Rabobank, which decision had influenced its decision to make or its making of
                    the Payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-Issue (a): Knowledge of the prospect of insolvency</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether it is a legal requirement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Rabobank’s argument before this court on
                    Sub-Issue (a) is a reiteration of the argument which the Judge rejected.
                    The argument is that knowledge by the company giving the alleged preference
                    (referred to hereafter as “the debtor” for convenience) of its
                    impending or actual insolvency at the material time is a legal requirement which
                    must be established in all claims of unfair preference by reason of the phrase
                    “in the event of the [debtor’s insolvency]” in
                        s 99(3)(<em>b</em>) of the BA. According to
                    Rabobank, s 99(4), read together with s 99(3)(<em>b</em>), requires that the decision to enter into the transaction
                    must have been influenced by a desire to produce the relevant effect. It is
                    argued that the rationale is that knowledge of the debtor’s impending or
                    actual insolvency will apprise the debtor’s directors that because of the
                    insufficiency of the debtor’s assets, the effect of the transaction would
                    be to prefer the creditor. Reference was made to the decisions in <em>Re Beacon Leisure Ltd</em> [1992] BCLC 565 and <em>Amrae Benchuan Trading Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Tan Te Teck
                        Gregory</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 969, where the lack of knowledge of
                    the debtor’s directors was the key reason, or one of the reasons, for the
                    court’s finding that the statutory presumption of a desire to prefer had
                    been rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Counsel for Rabobank also contends that the
                    trilogy of cases relied on by the Judge, <em>viz</em>,
                        <em>Katz &amp; Ors v McNally &amp; Ors</em> [1999] BCC
                    291, <em>Wills and another v Corfe Joinery Ltd (in
                        liq)</em> [1998] 2 BCLC 75 (“<em>Wills v
                        Corfe Joinery</em>”) and <em>Re Libra Industries
                        Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation)</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 205, are
                    distinguishable in that they involved the operation of the statutory presumption
                    of a desire to prefer; therefore, proof of knowledge on the part of the debtor
                    would have been unnecessary in those cases. Counsel pointed out that in the two
                    cases which did not involve associates (and which therefore did not involve the
                    aforesaid statutory presumption), <em>viz</em>, <em>Re Living Images Ltd</em> [1996] BCC 112 and <em>Re Agriplant Services Ltd</em> [1997] BCC 842 (which the
                    Judge also cited), it was held that the debtor’s knowledge of its imminent
                    insolvency was “instrumental” in proving the requisite
                    desire.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This argument was rejected by the Judge at the
                    following passages of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    ... To my mind, Wright QC in <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em> merely found that the
                            statutory presumption had been rebutted by the directors’ denials,
                            backed by their lack of knowledge of the debtor company’s imminent
                            winding up, that they had the relevant desire. There was no necessity
                            for the learned deputy judge to make a positive finding that the
                            directors knew of their company’s imminent winding up because the
                            requisite desire had been presumed against them. To my mind, both
                                <em>Re Beacon Leisure</em> and <em>Amrae Benchuan</em> ... are examples of how the lack
                            of knowledge of the debtor company’s insolvent state of affairs is
                            one of the factors that should be considered in deciding whether the
                            statutory presumption under s 99(5) has been rebutted, but the
                            converse proposition, that knowledge of the company’s winding up
                            is required before unfair preference is made out, has <em>not</em> been laid down as a rule by the
                        courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    … In my judgment, to require the judicial
                            manager to prove that the company’s controllers must have known
                            that the company was insolvent or imminently insolvent at the material
                            time before a transaction can be avoided as an unfair preference would
                            place too onerous a burden on the judicial manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Indeed, the English Court of Appeal in <em>Katz &amp; Ors v McNally &amp; Ors</em> [1999] BCC
                            291 made it clear (at 296) that it is “not necessary to establish
                            that the directors of the company knew or believed that it was
                            insolvent” in order to prove unfair preference. It is sufficient
                            that the directors were influenced by the desire to put the creditor
                            into a position “which in the event of the company going into
                            insolvent liquidation” would be a better position than if no
                            payment was made. In another English case, <em>Wills and
                                another v Corfe Joinery Ltd (in liq)</em> [1998] 2 BCLC
                            75, Lloyd J held (at 79) that it is not necessary, in order to show
                            such desire, to demonstrate that the directors knew that the company
                            would go into insolvent liquidation, or when it would do so.
                            Lloyd J’s judgment was cited with approval by Kan Ting
                            Chiu J in <em>Re Libra Industries Pte Ltd</em>
                            [1999] 3 SLR(R) 205 at [43].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We agree with the Judge’s view as set
                    out at [36]–[37] of the GD and disagree with
                    counsel’s argument. The decisions involving the statutory presumption
                    cited by Rabobank are relevant in the present context. As pointed out by counsel
                    for JTIC, the statutory presumption merely reverses the burden of proof and does
                    not alter the substantive elements of a claim of unfair preference. In our view,
                    as was pointed out by Lee Eng Beng in “The Avoidance Provisions of
                    the Bankruptcy Act 1995 and their Application to Companies” (1995) SJLS
                    597 at p 616, a literal interpretation of s 99(4) of the BA provides
                    that “the desire to prefer relates to the producing of the effect of a
                    preference and has nothing to do with knowledge of one’s own
                    insolvency”. In other words, s 99(4) only requires that there must
                    be a desire on the debtor’s part to improve the creditor’s <em>absolute</em> position <em>at the time the
                        preference is granted</em> (which would be the case if, <em>eg</em>, the creditor obtains cash payment or a security
                    interest – from that point onwards, he is better off, regardless of what
                    happens afterwards to the debtor).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevance of knowledge of insolvency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In our view, the critical question for the
                    court is whether or not the relevant desire existed and influenced the
                    debtor’s decision to enter into the impugned transaction. An inference of
                    the requisite desire should not be drawn too readily from the <em>presence</em> of knowledge of insolvency because such knowledge
                        <em>in itself</em> will not be sufficient to support
                    that inference, given that desire is subjective in nature: see <em>MC Bacon</em> at 335E–336A. However, it is also
                    possible that the relevant desire existed and influenced the debtor’s
                    decision despite the lack of actual knowledge, <em>eg</em>,
                    where the desire was to improve the creditor’s <em>absolute</em> position <em>at the time that the
                        preference was granted</em>. As Lloyd J pointed out in <em>Re Conegrade Ltd</em> [2003] BPIR 358 at 372H, if the debtor
                    did desire a particular result, it matters not that it thought that bankruptcy
                    was a remote risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-Issue (b): The material time to determine the influence of
                the requisite desire </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em>
                    Sub-Issue (b), Rabobank has argued that the relevant time to determine the
                    existence of a desire to prefer which influenced the debtor’s decision is
                    either the time when the decision to give the alleged preference was made (which
                    would be 25 November 2008 in the present case) or the time when the alleged
                    preference was actually given (which would be 22 December 2008 in the
                    present case). Rabobank does not take a view as to which should be the correct
                    time for the purposes of s 99(4) of the BA as its argument is that there
                    was no requisite desire on either date. With respect to 25 November 2008,
                    the only Creditor Bank which had served a letter of demand as at that date was
                    KBC (which received US$1m subsequent to the demand). With respect to
                    22 December 2008, JTIC’s balance sheet as at 30 September 2008
                    and 31 December 2008 clearly showed that JTIC was solvent then, and its
                    directors had signed solvency statements to that effect. Furthermore, it is
                    argued, the GEM Deal was still in the pipeline at that time and was envisaged to
                    fetch US$160m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In our view, as a general principle, the
                    relevant time to determine whether a debtor had the requisite desire to prefer
                    is the time when the creditor received the preference, and not when it was
                    promised the preference. In the case of a promise or commitment to pay money, it
                    is the time of payment that is material. The reason is that the debtor may
                    change its mind at any time prior to making payment. In the case of a promise or
                    commitment to create a security, it is the time of the creation (or the first
                    act of creation, <em>eg</em>, Ms Lin signing the
                    security document which created the Charge in the case of <em>DBS
                        Bank v Tam Chee Chong</em>) of the security that is relevant, unless
                    the execution of the security is done pursuant to a prior promise or commitment
                    to do so. In <em>MC Bacon</em>, Millett J held (at
                    336E) that the relevant time was the time when the decision to create the
                    debenture in issue in that case was made (and not the time when the debenture
                    was actually created). However, he also said that on the facts, it did not
                    matter which point in time was taken as the relevant time because if “the
                    requisite desire was operating at all, it was operating throughout”,
                        <em>ie</em>, from the time of the agreement to create
                    the debenture to the time of the execution of the debenture. In <em>Re Fairway Magazines Ltd; Fairbairn v Hartigan</em> [1993]
                    BCLC 643 (“<em>Re Fairway Magazines</em>”) at
                    649H, Mummery J accepted Millett J’s proposition. In <em>Wills v Corfe Joinery</em>, Lloyd J held (at
                    77G–78C) that the relevant date for considering the mental state of the
                    debtor was the date on which the preference was actually granted because that
                    was the effective time when the decision to prefer was made. In our view, it
                    stands to reason that the critical time cannot be the time when the decision to
                    prefer was made unless the desire operates throughout (as in <em>MC Bacon</em>). In a case where the debtor’s liquidator or
                    judicial managers may not be able to prove the requisite desire on the date of
                    the decision to give a preference, there is no reason why they are prevented by
                    the terms of s 99 of the BA from proving the existence of the requisite
                    desire at the date when the preference was actually granted. That will be
                    sufficient to establish this element of an unfair preference. In the present
                    case, the Payment was promised on 25 November 2008, but actually made on
                    22 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sub-Issue (c): The commercial pressure exerted by Rabobank on
                JTIC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Rabobank’s submission on
                    Sub-Issue (c) is that the courts have accepted that a crucial factor which
                    shows that the debtor was not influenced by a desire to prefer is commercial
                    pressure. The greater the pressure (<em>eg</em>, if it is
                    backed by a threat to take action which might jeopardise the survival of the
                    debtor), the less likelihood there is of a desire to prefer. The rationale is
                    that the giving of a preference predicates an act of free will and pressure
                    negates free will. Reference was made to para 1256 of the Report of the
                    Review Committee on Insolvency Law and Practice (Cmnd 8558, 1982) (which
                    recommended the abolition of the requirement of a dominant intention to prefer),
                    which stated that genuine pressure by a creditor should continue to afford a
                    defence to a preference claim on the practical basis that “[t]he creditor
                    who is active to obtain payment of his own debt ought in principle to be allowed
                    to retain the fruits of his diligence. He ought not to be made to refund them
                    for the benefit of others who were less diligent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Judge did not disagree with these
                    statements as, at [46]–[47] of the GD, he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46    That is not to say
                            that commercial pressure will never provide a good defence to a claim of
                            unfair preference. Since Lord Mansfield’s judgment in
                                <em>Thompson and Others, Assignees of Jane Wiseman v
                                Freeman</em> (1786) [1 TR 155;] 99 ER 1026 where his
                            Lordship held (at [157;] 1028) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A bankrupt when in contemplation of his bankruptcy cannot by his
                            voluntary act favour any one creditor; but if under fear of legal
                            process he gives a preference, it is evidence that he does not do it
                            voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been a principle of English law that preferential transactions
                        entered into because of pressure will not be set aside. In <em>Re [MC] Bacon</em> ..., Millett J found (at 337)
                        that the debtor company’s decision to grant a debenture to its bank
                        creditor had been made as part of the directors’ decision to
                        “continue trading in a genuine belief that the company could be
                        pulled round” and they had “no choice but to accede to the
                        bank's request for a debenture”. In <em>Re
                            Ledingham-Smith (a bankrupt), ex parte the trustee of the bankrupt v
                            Pannell Kerr Forster (a firm)</em> [1993] BCLC 635, Morritt J
                        held (at 642) that “[i]t may be that pressure does not displace
                        desire in the way that it formerly displaced a dominant intention to prefer
                        but it can certainly affect the question of desire”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    In Andrew
                            R Keay, <em>McPherson’s Law of Company
                                Liquidation</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009)
                            …, it is explained (at para 11.035) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The reason why pressure prevents a transfer from being a voidable
                            preference is that a preference predicates an act of free will and
                            pressure negatives free will. It has been held that as long as pressure
                            is genuine and not fraudulent then no transfer can be regarded as a
                            preference. It could be said that if there is pressure then the debtor
                            company, in granting a preference, could not have been influenced by a
                            desire to benefit the creditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Accordingly, it seems to us that what Rabobank
                    is contending here is that the commercial pressure in the present case was so
                    overwhelming or preponderant that the Judge should have inferred that JTIC could
                    not and did not have the requisite desire to prefer Rabobank. This is, however,
                    a question of fact, in respect of which the Judge has found against Rabobank on
                    the evidence before him, particularly, the testimony of Ms Lin that she
                    wanted JTIC to make the Payment because Rabobank had been good to the Companies.
                    We shall consider this issue later to determine whether the Judge was wrong in
                    making this finding of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Rabobank has also submitted that the Judge was
                    wrong in law to have held (at [48] of
                    the GD) that there must be a limit to the defence of pressure exerted by
                    creditors, and that that limit is provided by reference to commercial purpose.
                    It is submitted that a commercial purpose (or a good commercial reason) would be
                    a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition to rebut a desire to prefer. We
                    agree with this submission. However, in our view, the Judge’s view is also
                    the same. All that the Judge meant by his statement (at [48] of the GD) that there must be a limit to
                    the defence of pressure by creditors is that, in his own words, “if there
                    is no commercial benefit to the [debtor] at all in paying any creditor, then the
                    court should be extremely slow to find that pressure from the creditor is a
                    defence to the claim of unfair preference” (see [48] of the GD (reproduced at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, although the Judge found
                    as a fact that the Payment was not made for proper commercial considerations, he
                    did not hold that that was, <em>ipso facto</em>, sufficient
                    to show that JTIC had the desire to prefer Rabobank to the other Creditor
                    Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Payment was influenced by the requisite desire to
                prefer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Rabobank submits that the pressure which it
                    put on JTIC to repay its facilities was preponderant. By the time the Payment
                    was made on 22 December 2008, Rabobank’s general manager in Singapore
                    and its regional head of Telecommunications, Media and Internet had both become
                    personally involved in applying pressure on Ms Lin to obtain repayment.
                    Furthermore, Rabobank had discovered irregularities in the way in which the
                    Companies had conducted business in relation to the set-off arrangements between
                    JHTI and Motorola, and the double-financing of the receivables by Rabobank and
                    OCBC. The GEM Deal was still on and the Companies expected to obtain US$160m,
                    enough to pay about two-thirds of the Companies’ debts to all the Creditor
                    Banks. Ms Lin had no reason to expect that the GEM Deal would fall through
                    or that the Companies’ insolvency was inevitable. The Companies owed
                    Rabobank about S$40m, and Ms Lin agreed that JTIC would make the Payment to
                    forestall any drastic action and to avoid scuttling the GEM Deal. Ms Lin
                    became personally involved in ensuring that the Min Aik Shares were sold
                    promptly and that the sale proceeds were transmitted to Rabobank. Rabobank had
                    definitely put pressure on the Companies as it had sent letters of demand on
                    13 November 2008 and 17 December 2008 to demand repayment of its
                    loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We agree with Rabobank’s submission that
                    it did put pressure on the Companies to repay their loans. But, so did the
                    following other Creditor Banks, which had issued letters of demand to the
                    Companies before 22 December 2008, <em>viz</em>,
                    (a) KBC (on 7 November 2008 for US$12.3m and S$2m to be paid by
                    11 November 2008); (b) Maybank (on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, 2 December 2008 for S$15.25m to be paid by
                    16 December 2008); and (c) ABN-AMRO (on 18 December 2008 for
                    S$17.75m to be paid by 20 December 2008). Furthermore, by 22 December
                    2008, the Creditor Banks, including Rabobank, would have known that DBS had
                    obtained a charge over the MAP Shares (<em>ie</em>, the
                    Charge as defined at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) to secure
                    the Companies’ debts to it in breach of the Companies’ negative
                    pledges, and Ms Lin would not have expected the Creditor Banks not to do
                    anything and to allow the Companies to continue to carry on business as usual.
                    It was in those circumstances that Ms Lin directed that the proceeds of
                    sale of the Min Aik Shares be paid to Rabobank to honour her earlier agreement
                    on 25 November 2008 to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     During this period, <em>viz</em>, from 25 November 2008 to 22 December 2008, the
                    great pressure put on JTIC to sell the Min Aik Shares and pay the proceeds to
                    Rabobank, as Ms Lin had earlier agreed JTIC would do, would have been much
                    attenuated by the fact that so many other Creditor Banks were also demanding
                    payment of their debts. Any expectation that Ms Lin had that the Payment
                    would save the Companies was probably unrealistic. Just as in the case of DBS,
                    Ms Lin wanted to honour her promise to Rabobank that JTIC would pay the
                    proceeds of sale of the Min Aik Shares to Rabobank. She did honour her promise,
                    but, at the same time, she consistently said that JTIC made the Payment to
                    Rabobank because the latter had been very supportive of the Companies in giving
                    them indulgence after indulgence to pay their long overdue debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Judge found as a fact that JTIC did have a
                    desire to prefer Rabobank because the latter had been supportive of the
                    Companies, and that this was partly why Ms Lin agreed that JTIC would pay,
                    and did cause JTIC to pay, the proceeds of sale of the Min Aik Shares to
                    Rabobank. The Judge did not find that Rabobank did not put any pressure on JTIC
                    because, clearly, the bank did; but, at no time did Rabobank actually threaten
                    to recall all its facilities if JTIC did not agree to sell the Min Aik Shares
                    and pay the proceeds to the former. What the Judge found was that other Creditor
                    Banks had put equal or even greater pressure on the Companies and, yet, JTIC had
                    paid the proceeds of sale of the Min Aik Shares to Rabobank despite promising to
                    monetise the Companies’ assets (including the Min Aik Shares) to pay all
                    the Creditor Banks. The Judge held that these circumstances were inferential
                    evidence that JTIC had desired to prefer Rabobank, and that this inference was
                    consistent with the direct evidence of Ms Lin, which he
                accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Judge’s findings suggest that he
                    applied the principle that so long as there is some evidence that a debtor had
                    the requisite desire to prefer, even though it was under some or great pressure
                    from a creditor to pay its debts, the influence of such desire is sufficient to
                    support a claim of unfair preference under s 99 of the BA. If the preferred
                    creditor is unable to show that its commercial pressure was overwhelming or that
                    the commercial pressure was “proper”, in the sense that it had
                    some value to the debtor (or that the debtor believed that it had some value to
                    it), then such pressure cannot negate the requisite desire, even though the
                    desire may, relatively speaking, be weaker than the pressure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We accept this principle. In <em>Re Fairway Magazines</em>, Mummery J said (at
                    649G–H): “If a desire to prefer is present, however, it is
                    sufficient that it influences the decision. It does not have to be the sole or
                    decisive influence on the decision.” In our view, this was precisely the
                    situation here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Having regard to all the circumstances leading
                    up to the Payment and, in particular, the Judge’s acceptance of
                    Ms Lin’s testimony of JTIC’s desire to prefer Rabobank, we are
                    of the opinion that there were insufficient grounds to overturn the
                    Judge’s finding of fact that the making of the Payment was influenced by
                    the requisite desire.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our observations on the negative pledges and the <em>pari passu</em> clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In concluding our judgment in <em>DBS Bank v Tam Chee Chong</em>, we made some observations (at
                        [48]–[54]) on the relevance of
                    the negative pledges and the <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertakings given by the Companies in proceedings by JHTI’s judicial
                    managers to set aside the Charge on the basis that it was an unfair preference
                    under s 227T of the CA, read with s 99 of the BA. Those observations
                    are equally apt to apply to the present case as Rabobank was fully aware of the
                    existence of both of these contractual terms, which bound JTIC not to prefer any
                    one Creditor Bank to any other Creditor Bank in terms of giving security and
                    repaying existing debts in circumstances where the Companies were insolvent and
                    were facing imminent liquidation or the prospect of being put into judicial
                    management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     However, in the present case, as no security
                    was granted to Rabobank, only the <em>pari passu</em>
                    undertaking would be engaged. In our view, for the reasons given in <em>DBS Bank v Tam Chee Chong</em>, any inducement by Rabobank of
                    the breach of this undertaking by JTIC would likewise amount to an unlawful
                    interference with the contractual rights of the other Creditor
                Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Hence, we cannot help but observe the irony in
                    this case (an observation which we also made in <em>DBS Bank v
                        Tam Chee Chong</em> at [55]), where, even if Rabobank had succeeded in
                    defending the validity of the Payment on the ground that it was not an unfair
                    preference, it might nonetheless have had to forego the benefits of the Payment
                    under the overall contractual framework of the <em>pari
                        passu</em> undertakings it had agreed with the Companies, in the light
                    of the undertakings of the latter to the other Creditor Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the above reasons, the appeal is dismissed
                    with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
