The Applicant has been in remand since his arrest on 15 August 2023. At a bail review hearing on 29 September 2023 in a District Court, the Applicant was denied bail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In Criminal Revision No 6 of 2023, the Applicant prays for the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers under s 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and revoke the District Court’s order denying him bail, and to grant him bail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Applicant was arrested on 15 August 2023 as part of an investigation into money-laundering and forgery offences. Between 16 August 2023 and 6 September 2023, the Applicant was remanded for investigations by orders of a District Court under s 238(3) of the CPC. Each order resulted in the Applicant being remanded for a period of eight days at a time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 29 August 2023, the Applicant filed Criminal Revision No 4 of 2023 (“CR 4”), praying, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers under s 401 of the CPC to revoke the District Court’s orders of 23 August 2023 and 30 August 2023 which led to him being further remanded for investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 5 September 2023, I dismissed CR 4. My reasons for dismissing CR 4 can be found in <span class="font-italic">Vang </span><span class="font-italic">Shuiming v Public Prosecutor</span> [2023] SGHC 248 (“<span class="font-italic">Vang </span><span class="font-italic">Shuiming (No 1)</span>”). Briefly, I found that the District Court’s orders were not palpably wrong such that there was serious injustice which warranted the exercise of the High Court’s powers to revoke the said orders of remand and substitute the orders with an order that the Applicant be granted bail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Thereafter, at a hearing in a District Court on 6 September 2023, the Prosecution stated that it was not seeking a further remand of the Applicant for investigations. Instead, the Prosecution sought for bail to be refused to the Applicant. In support of its position, the Prosecution relied on an affidavit of the lead investigator, Mr Teh Yee Liang (“Mr Teh”), dated 5 September 2023. At the hearing, counsel for the Applicant stated that time was required to take instructions from the Applicant and have an affidavit by the Applicant filed in order to make full arguments on the issue of bail. Given this position, in the interim, the District Court refused to grant the Applicant bail at the hearing on 6 September 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 A bail review hearing was subsequently fixed on 29 September 2023 in a District Court. The Applicant requested bail to be granted to him and filed an affidavit dated 20 September 2023 in support of his request. A further affidavit of the lead investigator, Mr Teh, dated 25 September 2023 was filed by the Prosecution to respond to the points made by the Applicant in his affidavit. After considering parties’ submissions, the District Judge (“DJ”) denied the Applicant bail at the hearing on 29 September 2023.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The applicant is dissatisfied with the DJ’s decision to deny the Applicant bail at the bail review hearing on 29 September 2023. He prays for the High Court to exercise its revisionary powers under s 401 of the CPC to revoke the DJ’s order denying him bail, and to exercise its powers to grant him bail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The general principles governing the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers are trite. In <span class="font-italic">Ang </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 929, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) stated at [17] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Similarly, Yong CJ stated in <span class="font-italic">Knight Glenn </span><span class="font-italic">Jeyasingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 196 at [19] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The court’s immediate duty is to satisfy itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any order passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court. However, this is not sufficient to require the intervention of the courts on revision. The irregularity or otherwise noted from the record of proceedings must have resulted in grave and serious injustice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Specifically in the context of an application seeking the High Court’s exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction to grant bail where bail has been refused in the court below, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Feroz Khan bin Abdul Kader v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] SGHC 287 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Feroz Khan</span>”) (at [18]) that the High Court would exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to grant bail only where it is satisfied that the decision of the court below would give rise to a serious injustice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Having considered the Applicant’s arguments as well as the Prosecution’s submissions, I do not find that the threshold of serious injustice has been met such that the court should exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to grant bail. I consider each of the Applicant’s arguments below and explain why I am unable to agree with the Applicant’s arguments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Applicant’s argument that the DJ erred in finding that the Applicant was a flight risk based on the Prosecution’s bare assertions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 First, the Applicant argues that the DJ erred in relying on the Prosecution’s bare assertions in support of its position that the Applicant was a flight risk.

This is precisely the type of evidence which the Prosecution is relying on, being the evidence of the lead investigator, Mr Teh. While the Applicant argues that the Prosecution must further produce <span class="font-italic">corroborative evidence</span> beyond the affidavit evidence of Mr Teh, this appears to be an unduly onerous obligation which is unsupported by the precedents cited by the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, and more crucially, I fail to see how the assertions of the Prosecution can be said to be bare assertions. Let me explain:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) It is undeniable that the Applicant faces charges which relate to “serious offences”. While the Applicant seeks to highlight that fines could possibly be imposed for the CDSA charges he faces, as has been correctly noted by the Prosecution, it is trite that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence: see <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 4 SLR 892 at [60].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, the affidavit evidence clearly shows that there is a risk of collusion. While the Applicant contends that the Prosecution’s assertions are overstated and vague because there are no co-accused persons named in the Applicant’s charges and the Prosecution has not disclosed the names of the individuals the Applicant is stated to have connections with, this fails to appreciate that the broader investigations are <span class="font-italic">ongoing</span>. In light of the ongoing investigations, it would be reasonable for the Prosecution to withhold certain sensitive information at this stage since this could impede their investigations. I, therefore, do not accept the Applicant’s contention that the Prosecution’s assertions of a risk of collusion are overstated and vague.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 For the reasons above, I do not find that there was anything palpably wrong in the order made by the DJ such that serious injustice has been caused as a result of the Applicant being denied bail. As I have explained above, the arguments made by the Applicant before the DJ and in this application are unmeritorious and do not support his position for bail to be granted. As the threshold for the High Court’s revisionary power under s 401 of the CPC to be exercised has not been met, I dismiss the Applicant’s application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In conclusion, I think it is useful to remind the Applicant that while the option remains open to him to seek another bail review or file further applications to the High Court to exercise its powers to grant bail, he must ensure that there are proper grounds to support his applications to the High Court for bail to be granted. As set out in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Razip and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [1987] SLR(R) 525 (at [17]) and reaffirmed by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Feroz Khan </span>(at [16]), once an application for bail has been rejected, the court would be extremely reluctant to grant bail where subsequent applications are filed to the same court, unless there has been a material change in circumstances or new facts have since come to light.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Wong Hin Pkin Wendell, Andrew Chua Ruiming, Dorothy Grace Tan Jun Wen and Yang Xinyan (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the applicant; and</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">David Koh <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
