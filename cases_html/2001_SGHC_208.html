<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. On the question of dismissal for cause, various reasons were given

by the Defendants in their letter dated 19 May 2000 to dismiss the Plaintiff. 5 reasons

were given:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) The Plaintiff’s failure to fulfil her obligations to prepare

  accounts for PT NSP for December 1999 and January 2000 (‘the 1<sup>st</sup>

  reason’).</p>
<p align="justify">(b) and (d) can be read together. They relate to a note dated 2

  February 2000 (PBD 118) written by the Plaintiff and a note dated 25 February 2000 written

  by her assistant Linda Lim (PBD 125) (‘the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>

  reasons’).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(c) This relates to an urgent fax from Ernst &amp; Young on 25 January

  2000 (PBD 113). It was alleged that the Plaintiff did not bring the fax to the

  Defendants’ attention until the Plaintiff’s note dated 2 February 2000 although

  the Plaintiff knew the contents and the importance of the matters stated in the fax

  (‘the 3<sup>rd</sup> reason’).</p>
<p align="justify">A 5<sup>th</sup> reason was stated. This relates to the

  Plaintiff’s legal action against Mr Nishide for defamation in total disregard of

  procedure and respect to the Defendants and to Mr Fujii, the President of Komatsulite

  Manufacturing Co Ltd (‘Komatsulite’) of which the Defendants are a subsidiary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. I would add that although the letter of 19 May 2000 was a letter of

dismissal, it also informed the Plaintiff that she would be paid one month’s salary

in lieu of notice.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. On the 1<sup>st</sup> reason, I am of the view that it was part of

the duty of the Plaintiff to prepare accounts for PT NSP and she had in fact been doing

so. However the Plaintiff should not be expected to do so in Bahasa Indonesia and Rupiah

currency, which were subsequent requirements, without more help. There was no misconduct

on the part of the Plaintiff in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> reason.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> reasons, the Plaintiff

should not have simply said that she did not want to do the accounts nor, as I find,

encourage her subordinate to write directly to Mr Nishide in those terms. However although

the Plaintiff’s conduct was wanting, it was not so bad as to warrant a dismissal for

cause.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    (a) As for the 3<sup>rd</sup> reason, I find that

the Plaintiff did bring the Ernst &amp; Young fax dated 25 January 2000 to Mr

Nishide’s attention. Accordingly, she did not fail to bring it to the

Defendants’ attention until 2 February 2000 as Mr Nishide can be said to be

representing the Defendants for the purpose of receiving information about the Ernst &amp;

Young fax.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        (b) In any event, Mr Kondo

appeared to have been aware of the fax before 2 February 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        (c) The Defendants’

allegation that the Plaintiff did not explain the fax to Mr Kondo is an allegation made in

closing submission by the Defendants for the first time and is a different complaint from

that stated in the letter dated 19 May 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        (d) There was no misconduct

by the Plaintiff regarding the 3<sup>rd</sup> reason.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    (a) As for the 5<sup>th</sup> reason, the

Defendants did not lay down any procedure to be followed if an employee of the Defendants

wants to sue someone elsewhere.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">       (b) While the Plaintiff should

have consulted Mr Kondo (the MD) or Mr Teo (the GM) before initiating the suit against Mr

Nishide, bearing in mind that the suit might cause problems for Komatsulite, of which the

Defendants are a subsidiary, she was not obliged to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">       (c) The omission by the Plaintiff

to consult and the initiation of the defamation action against Mr Nishide did not amount

to misconduct to justify a dismissal for cause.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. When the Plaintiff refused to withdraw her defamation action against

Mr Nishide notwithstanding Mr Kondo’s and Mr Teo’s request to her to do so, this

was the straw which broke the camel’s back. Accordingly, the Defendants issued the

letter of dismissal dated 19 May 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. Taking into account all the reasons advanced by the Defendants in

the letter dated 19 May 2000 and the circumstances, the Defendants have not established

that the Plaintiff’s conduct was so bad as to justify a dismissal without cause,

although the Plaintiff’s conduct was wanting.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. However, the Plaintiff could not seriously expect to be retained in

the Defendants’ employment, especially when she continued with her action against Mr

Nishide notwithstanding that Mr Kondo and Mr Teo had made it clear to her that her action

was hurting the relationship between Mr Nishide’s employers Asahi Bank and

Komatsulite.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.The Defendants did not agree to nor had they led the Plaintiff to

believe that she would be employed on a permanent or lifelong basis until retirement. The

statement, "We look forward to your continued support and contribution for many more

years to come" in letters from the Defendants to the Plaintiff does not amount to any

such representation. It is a statement of appreciation and encouragement but nothing more.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Also, letters of confirmation or promotion, without more, do not

amount to any such representation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Accordingly the Defendants were entitled to exercise and did

exercise their rights under clause 15 of the employment agreement dated 17 May 1989 to

terminate the Plaintiff’s employment by giving one month’s salary in lieu of one

month’s notice of termination. The Defendants have validly terminated the

Plaintiff’s employment, see <i>Delaney v Staples</i> <nobr>[1992] ICR 483</nobr>, p.488 to 489.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. Even if the Defendants had initially omitted to give one

month’s salary in lieu of notice, the extent of the Plaintiff’s damages would be

the amount which she would have received until her employment was lawfully terminated, see

<i>Alexander Proudfoot Productivity Services Co Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Hua Ngee Alvin</i>
<nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 494</nobr> and <i>Latham v Credit Suisse Boston </i><nobr>[2000] 2 SLR 693</nobr>. This would have been the one month’s

salary in lieu of notice. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. The issue about the rules of natural justice is not relevant as

such rules do not apply to a termination of employment in accordance with the terms of a

contract, even if, for the sake or argument, they apply to a dismissal under ordinary

contracts of employment where there is no prescribed procedure for a dismissal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. In any event, the Plaintiff knew about the concerns of the

Defendants especially about her legal action against Mr Nishide and would not budge from

her position.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. The issue about bad faith is a red herring as the Defendants were

entitled to terminate the Plaintiff’s employment by paying one month’s salary in

lieu of notice. In any event, the Plaintiff has failed to establish bad faith.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. There is no valid issue of retrenchment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. The Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. I will hear parties on costs.</p>
