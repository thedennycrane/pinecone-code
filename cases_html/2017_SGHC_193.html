However, the issue submitted by the parties for the Tribunal’s determination, in relation to PI-1325, was whether the payment term imposed by Midea breached the parties’ prior practice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, the Tribunal’s interpretation of cl 4.2 was clearly inconsistent with the position taken by the parties on cl 4.2. First, both Midea and Tornado were in agreement that Midea had the discretion under cl 4.1 of the MBA to fix the payment terms, although Tornado also submitted that the discretion had to be exercised reasonably and in accordance with prior agreement or established practice.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Before me, Tornado tried to explain that its use of the word “overriding” in its opening submissions was not intended to mean the same thing as the “long stop date” stated by Midea. According to Tornado, it had meant that if no agreement was reached on payment terms in the PO or PI, then cl 4.2 would apply as the default payment term. In my view, Tornado’s explanation was an afterthought and I rejected it. There would have been no agreed sale if no agreement had been reached on the payment terms in the PO or PI. The terms in the PI (including the payment term) were subject to Tornado’s acceptance. Further, Tornado’ own conduct contradicted its explanation. Tornado did not agree with the payment terms stated in PI-1325 and PI-2014. These payment terms became matters of dispute. Yet, Tornado never claimed that cl 4.2 applied as the default payment term. No sale took place in respect of PI-1325 and Tornado accepted PI-2014 under protest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I should add that in its closing submissions in the Arbitration, Tornado did submit that cl 4.2 “at the very least, implies that parties did not envisage the situation where payments would be made 100% upfront/before delivery or shipment”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Tornado referred me to <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>. In that case, the buyer signed two agreements for the purchase of two vessels. The seller issued a Notice of Readiness (“NOR”) for both vessels. The NOR meant that the buyer had to take delivery of the vessels. The buyer rejected the NOR on the ground that the vessels were not physically ready for delivery. The buyer then commenced arbitration against the seller seeking the refund of the deposits it had paid for the vessels. In the arbitration, the buyer argued that the NOR was not valid because the vessels were not certified by the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) with dynamic positioning system 1 (“DP-1”) class notation and the DP-1 system was not functioning and operational, as required under the agreements. The seller referred to cl 11 of the agreements which required the vessels to be delivered physically ready. The seller contended that it was not required to deliver the vessels in a fully operational condition and that it was only required to deliver the vessels in the same condition and with the same certificates as when the vessels were first inspected. The seller further submitted that in any event, its failure to deliver the vessels with the requisite class certificate and fully functioning DP-1 systems amounted at most to a breach of an intermediate term, not a condition. Accordingly, the buyer might be entitled to damages but it was not entitled to refuse to take delivery of the vessels. The arbitrator held that cl 11 was not a condition or condition precedent, but a collateral warranty. Accordingly, the arbitrator held that the buyer was not entitled to rely on cl 11 to reject the NOR.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Before the High Court, the buyer argued that whether cl 11 was a condition which if breached entitled the seller to terminate the agreements, was not an issue before the arbitrator. The buyer submitted that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority in finding that cl 11 was not a condition. The court disagreed with the buyer as it was clear from the parties’ submissions in the arbitration that the nature of cl 11 was in issue (at [57]). The buyer had conceded in its submissions before the High Court that whether cl 11 was a condition or an innominate term was an issue before the arbitrator (at [67]). The seller’s submissions in the arbitration made it clear that its case was that cl 11 was not a condition but either a warranty or an innominate term which had the effect of a warranty (at [68]). Thus, it was expressly part of the seller’s case that the breach of cl 11 did not entitle the buyer to terminate the contracts because cl 11 was a warranty (at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 However, the court also reasoned that since the parties had asked the arbitral tribunal to determine whether the buyer’s refusal to accept the NOR was a repudiatory breach, it was open to the arbitrator to “take the view that he ought to determine whether cl 11 was a condition because that would have a bearing on the question whether [the buyer] had repudiated the [agreements]” (at [57]). In the present case, Tornado sought to rely on this alternative ground in <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>. Tornado’s argument went as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The parties had, pursuant to Issues (5) and (8) of the ALOI, asked the Tribunal to determine whether Midea was entitled to terminate the MBA by reason of Tornado’s failure to achieve the 2013 Annual Sales Target under the MBA. Issue (5) was whether Tornado was in breach of its Half-Year Sales Target and Annual Sales Target for 2013. Issue (8) was whether Midea was entitled to terminate the MBA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Therefore, it was open to the Tribunal, in reading Issues (5) and (8) of the ALOI, to take the view that it ought to determine the “antecedent/underlying question” as to whether Tornado was excused from performing its obligation to achieve the 2013 Annual Sales Target.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I disagreed with Tornado’s submission. Implicit in Tornado’s submission was the proposition that the Tribunal was free to decide Issue (8) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether Midea was entitled to terminate the MBA) on any ground that it could find regardless of the issues expressly submitted to it by the parties. Such a broad proposition was untenable. The policy of minimal curial intervention has to be balanced against the parties’ right to define the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Parties have the right to define the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal at any level of specificity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Such a broad proposition was also not supported by <span class="font-italic">TMM</span>. The alternative ground in <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>was not as broad as Tornado suggested. In my view, the reason for the alternative ground in <span class="font-italic">TMM </span>was that determining the question whether cl 11 was a condition was a necessary step in determining whether the buyer had repudiated the agreements. The seller had relied on cl 11 in support of its case that the NOR was valid. In the present case, the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2 was completely unnecessary for the determination of Issues (5) and (8) of the ALOI. The relevant issue submitted by the parties to the Tribunal in respect of PI-1325 was whether Midea had breached prior practice in imposing the payment term that it did in PI-1325. The parties had defined the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by reference to this issue. Tornado did not rely on cl 4.2 for its submission that the Termination Notice was invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Tornado also referred me to <span class="font-italic">Grant Thornton International Ltd v JBPB &amp; Co (A Partnership) </span>[2013] HKCFI 523, in which the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region stated as follows<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [44]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, the words “decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration” under s 89(2)(d)(ii) [of the Arbitration Ordinance (Cap 609)] should be construed narrowly to only include those decisions which are <span class="font-italic">clearly unrelated to</span> or not reasonably required for the determination of the subject disputes, matters or issues that have been submitted to arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my view, the use of the words “clearly unrelated to” may be too narrow because the converse – that any decision “related” to an issue that has been submitted to arbitration would then fall within the scope of the arbitration – would seem to be too broad. In any event, in my view, the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2 was clearly unrelated to and not reasonably required for the determination of Issues (5) and (8) of the ALOI for the same reasons set out at [57] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a need to show prejudice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I agreed with Midea that as the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction by addressing matters beyond the scope the submission to arbitration, there was no further requirement for Midea to show that it had suffered “real or actual prejudice”. The observation in <span class="font-italic">CRW </span>(at [32]) that “real or actual prejudice” has to be shown was made in the context of a tribunal failing to address matters properly before it for determination.

The ALOI was prepared and submitted by the parties pursuant to Procedural Order No 1 (“PO1”) issued by the Tribunal. PO1 stated (at para 8.5) that “[a]s a general principle, no Party shall be permitted to advance any new factual allegations or any new legal arguments at the Oral Hearing, unless expressly permitted by the Tribunal”.

</div> It was clearly envisaged that the dispute would be decided within the framework of the ALOI. The Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2 was a radical departure from the ALOI. In my view, the first three requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">AMZ </span>had been met. The fourth requirement was irrelevant; Midea had no opportunity to object during the proceedings since the issue of a breach of cl 4.2 did not arise at all during the arbitral proceedings.

The Tribunal’s breach was clearly connected to the making of the Award as its finding on cl 4.2 was the basis upon which the impugned findings in the Award (including the finding that Midea was not entitled to terminate the MBA) were made.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Tornado referred to para 8.24 of the Award, which stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.24 Whilst Clause 4.1 of the [MBA] does not set out in what proportion payment is to be made by TT or LC or whether an initial deposit is required and if so, in what amount, it is clear from the record of [the Arbitration] that [Midea] in the course of the Parties’ approximately ten year relationship, had at no time prior to 25 September 2013 requested that payment be made on a “<span class="font-italic">30% TT + 70% LC at sight</span>” basis as it had in respect of PI-1325 … The Tribunal notes that [Midea] does not dispute that prior to 25 September 2013 (i.e. when PI-1325 and OEM PIs 1326 to 1328 had been issued), it had only requested an initial deposit of up to 10% of the amount involved with the balance to be paid by letter of credit payable within 90 days of the bill of lading date.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I disagreed with Tornado. There was no finding made by the Tribunal in para 8.24. If, as Tornado suggested, the Tribunal would have found a breach of the parties’ prior agreement and practice, it would have been easy for the Tribunal to make that finding in its Award. After all, that was the issue expressly submitted to the Tribunal for its determination. However, the Tribunal did not deal with Tornado’s claim that Midea had breached the parties’ prior agreement and practice. Instead, the Tribunal chose to make its finding on cl 4.2 despite the fact that a breach of cl 4.2 was never an issue in the Arbitration. In my view, it could not be said that the Tribunal could not reasonably have arrived at a different result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Tornado also submitted that even if Midea had full opportunity to make its arguments on the construction of cll 4.1 and 4.2 of the MBA, it would not have made a difference to the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2. I disagreed. The interpretation that the Tribunal gave to cl 4.2 and the question of a breach of cl 4.2 were never raised or argued in the Arbitration. As noted earlier (see [44]–[47] above), the Tribunal’s interpretation of cl 4.2 was contrary to the parties’ own interpretation of cl 4.2. Tornado’s submission that it would not have made a difference was highly speculative. In my view, it could not be said that the Tribunal could not reasonably have arrived at a different result. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the circumstances, I concluded that Midea had suffered real or actual prejudice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other findings tainted by the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Midea submitted that the rest of the Tribunal’s findings set out in [33] were tainted by the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2 and should be set aside as well. Tornado argued that the Tribunal’s findings in three paragraphs in the Award did not depend on the Tribunal’s finding on cl 4.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 First, Tornado submitted that the Tribunal’s finding in para 8.31 of the Award – that Midea’s termination of the MBA was invalid – was supported by its “alternative finding” that Midea hastened fulfilment of the condition for termination under cl 2.2 of the MBA.
