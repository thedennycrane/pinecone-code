The Wife is 56 and the Husband is 60 years old. The parties have three children, all of whom have attained the age of majority. The children are 37, 34 and 28 years old respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Wife became a homemaker shortly after parties married. The Husband, who is a director in a listed company (“the Company”), was the main fee-earner throughout the marriage. First an odd job labourer, he later started the Company with a few business partners. In time, the Company became publicly listed. His assets are essentially derived from the success of the Company. Unfortunately, the fortunes of the Company have been in decline since 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 27 March 2013, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband premised upon his behaviour. The divorce was uncontested. Interim Judgment was granted on 14 May 2013. The issues before me in the ancillaries on 22 February were as follows: (1) division of the matrimonial assets; (2) maintenance for the Wife; and (3) costs (together, “the issues”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 After hearing the parties, I gave oral judgment in relation to the ancillary matters on 2 March 2016. In brief, I ordered an equal division of the matrimonial assets valued at $5,200,670 and, in keeping with the need for a clean break, that a lump sum maintenance of $171,517 be paid to the Wife by the Husband. The parties have appealed, and I now set out the reasons for my decision in relation to the issues.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Division of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Delineation of pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The asset pool was determined from the joint table of assets prepared by counsel for the Husband and the Wife.

</div> In the premises, I used the value pinned on the Matrimonial Home by the Wife, as it was supported by evidence that was not, in any sense, undermined by the Husband during the proceedings. I highlight for completeness that the Husband was able to provide the latest documents for one of the Wife’s insurance policies (see S/No. 8 of Table 1), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, AIA LXXXXXX640. In the hearing on 22 February 2016, counsel for the Wife, Mr Irving Choh (“Mr Choh”), agreed that the value in the document produced by the Husband should be used in the computation of the Wife’s insurance policies.

</div> The Wife adduced no evidence to support her position. In fact, during the hearing on 22 February 2016, Mr Choh acknowledged that the Wife had not stated how the proceeds were taken by the Husband despite the fact that she was both the owner and beneficiary of the AIA Policy. The Husband’s case was that the Wife took the proceeds from the AIA Policy because the proceeds would have been paid to her when the AIA Policy was surrendered. Given the lack of evidence adduced by the Wife to support her position, I agree with the Husband.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 There was the second issue of the proceeds in relation to the GE Policy. The Wife contended that she surrendered the GE Policy to maintain herself, because <span class="font-italic">after she commenced divorce proceedings</span>, the Husband stopped paying the premiums in relation to those policies. She said that the proceeds from surrendering the GE Policy were used to supplement the $2,000 monthly expenses that the Husband used to pay her before she commenced the divorce proceedings. Counsel for the Husband, Ms Lim Poh Choo (“Ms Lim”), pointed out that the Husband had not stopped paying maintenance to the Wife at the material time when the GE Policy was surrendered. He only stopped paying maintenance in July 2015 when the Wife left the Matrimonial Home with the Daughter. In fact, the Husband only cancelled the supplementary credit card and the automatic teller machine (“ATM”) card for the parties’ joint account with POSB Bank at the end of 2012. In the face of these facts, Mr Choh conceded that no explanation had been adduced by the Wife as regards the proceeds in relation to the GE Policy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(b) Proceeds from the sale of a jointly-owned apartment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The parties at one time jointly owned an apartment at the Interlace at 208 Depot Road (“the Interlace Apartment”), which was purchased in August 2009. The Husband sold the Interlace Apartment in January 2013. The sale price was $1,129,800. As noted from the completion accounts prepared by the Husband’s solicitors in relation to the sale transaction, the Husband received $331,058 (“the Sale Proceeds”) after, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, redeeming the mortgage on the Interlace Apartment.

At the same time, the Wife pointed out that the Husband had not assisted with discovery in this regard. He failed to comply fully with a court order to disclose complete sets of his account statements between July 2011 and July 2014.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I noted that the Daughter was not a high earner – her last drawn salary at the Company was $1,500 a month; by her own admission she could not pay for her car instalments of $700 a month, and had not been earning enough to pay income tax. Having considered the evidence, I was of the view that <span class="font-italic">some proportion</span> of the Withdrawn Sum must have come from the Wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Mr Choh mounted an alternative argument to address the legal effects that, in his view, should flow from a finding that the Wife must have deposited monies into the POSB Account from the parties’ joint account. He submitted that the presumption of advancement applied to such monies deposited into the POSB Account by the Wife, such that the monies belonged to her. His argument assumed that the Wife would be thus free to channel the money onward to the Daughter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Mr Choh relied on <span class="font-italic">In re Eykyn’s Trusts</span> (1877) 6 ChD 115 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Eykyn’s Trusts</span>”). The court there had to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, decide whether the presumption of advancement operated in relation to certain investments transferred by the husband to the wife. The court held (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Malins VC) that the investments were advancements for benefit of the wife. Malins VC made clear (at 118) that the presumption only applied <span class="font-italic">where</span><span class="font-italic"> the property is held in the sole name of the wife</span>, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law of this Court is perfectly settled that when a husband transfers money or other property <span class="font-italic">into the name of his wife only</span>, <span class="font-italic">then the presumption is, that it is intended as a gift or advancement to the wife absolutely at once</span>, subject to such marital control as he may exercise. And <span class="font-italic">if a husband invests money, stock, or otherwise, in the names of himself and his wife, then also it is an advancement for the benefit of the wife absolutely</span> <span class="font-italic">if she survives her husband</span>, but if he survives her, then it reverts to him as joint tenant with his wife. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As noted in the decision of the House of Lords <span class="font-italic">Pettitt v Pettitt</span> [1970] AC 777 (“<span class="font-italic">Pettitt v Pettitt</span>”) (at 815) <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Upjohn, when the property is held jointly and not in the sole name of one party, “the presumption is in effect no more than a joint beneficial tenancy”. Lord Upjohn summarised succinctly the legal position as follows (at 815):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So that, in the absence of all evidence, if a husband puts property into his wife's name he intends it to be a gift to her, but if he puts it into joint names, then (in the absence of all other evidence) the presumption is the same as a joint beneficial tenancy. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I note also the case of <span class="font-italic">In re Young</span> (1885) 28 ChD 705 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Young</span>”). In that case, the spouses, who died within five days of one another, had opened a joint account mainly contributed to by the wife. The husband drew out monies from the account to make investments for himself. It was held (at 708) <span class="font-italic">per</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>Pearson J that the joint account belonged beneficially to the spouses jointly and so passed to the survivor by survivorship but that the investments purchased by the husband in his own name belonged to his estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The decision in <span class="font-italic">In re Young</span> may be explained by reference to <span class="font-italic">In re Bishop, decd</span> [1965] Ch 450 (“<span class="font-italic">In re Bishop</span>”) (endorsed along with <span class="font-italic">In re Young</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Pettitt v Pettitt</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 815). The husband in that case drew on the joint account with the wife to make investments in his own name and in the wife’s own name. It was held (at 456) <span class="font-italic">per</span> Stamp J that <span class="font-italic">as long as it can be treated that the spouse drawing out money from the account has the authority of the other</span>, an asset purchased by that party in his or her own name belongs to him. In my view, <span class="font-italic">In re Bishop</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>makes a very important point. The question of whether the presumption of advancement applies in relation to monies drawn out from a joint account depends on whether it can be ascertained if the spouse drawing out money had the authority of the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 This approach is in keeping with the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”). In that case, the Court of Appeal held (at [56]) that a presumption of advancement must <span class="font-italic">first</span> be premised on a gift that, outside of the relationship, would result in the operation of the presumption of a resulting trust. The issue of a resulting trust could only arise if the Wife had the authority to withdraw the Withdrawn Sums from the joint account in order to create the second account. Since, in this case, the Husband was totally unaware of the second account, there could be no question of authority having been given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the facts, it was likely, on balance, that the Wife would not have had the authority to withdraw the Withdrawn Sum from the matrimonial assets, which she did just three weeks before she commenced the divorce proceedings. Therefore, the presumption of advancement did not apply. The Withdrawn Sum was not hers to deal with as she pleased. The Court could put this sum back into the matrimonial pool for division. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Husband made an argument in his affidavit and his Fact and Position Sheet that he wished to go one step further to assert an interest in the Daughter’s flat. I did not think this argument had any merit. First, the Daughter was not party to the divorce proceedings. There were no pleadings and no evidence led to trace the amounts given by the Wife (even if we assume for one moment that these amounts came <span class="font-italic">solely</span> from the joint account held by the Husband and Wife) to the Daughter’s flat. The Husband would have to ventilate these matters in separate civil proceedings. Second, as a matter of law, there will be serious difficulties in employing the common law tracing rules to trace monies into the Wife’s joint bank account with the Daughter, as there would have been a mixture of funds (see <span class="font-italic">Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson</span> [1989] 3 WLR 1367 at 1382 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Millett J (as he then was) affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1991] 1 Ch 547). I note also that the presumption of advancement would apply in respect of the sum of money passing from the Wife to the Daughter; the Wife would have intended to make a gift to the Daughter who was setting up a new home. The short point is that <span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">he issue of the Wife taking money without authority out of the matrimonial assets</span> could not create a claim for the Husband <span class="font-italic">on the </span><span class="font-italic">Daughter’s property</span>. The Husband’s tangential averment that he should be entitled to a share in the Daughter’s flat was misplaced.

</div>
</div>
</div> Given my decision that the Withdrawn Sum was taken without authority and thus could be returned to the matrimonial pool for division and observations on why the Husband’s arguments were unsustainable, the Husband has no basis for a separate claim on the Daughter’s property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the above context, I was mindful that the presumption of advancement traditionally applies between father and child. However, I note the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> (at [67]) that the categories where the presumption of advancement applies are not treated as closed. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tso Fong v Kwok Wai Sun</span> [2008] HKCFI 385, the High Court of Hong Kong held (at [17]) that the presumption of advancement applied equally between mother and child as it did between father and child. I note also that the fact that the child is an adult would not be fatal to the<span class="font-italic"> prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>operation of the presumption of advancement. In this regard, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah and others v Low Geok Khim and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 (at [46]) that the presumption of advancement was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> applicable as between a father and an adult son in relation to certain bank accounts.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the Disputed Assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 To summarise, there were allegations on both sides that money ought to be returned to the pool because of dissipation of assets by the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As noted, I found that the Wife had retained, without satisfactory explanation, the proceeds which she obtained on surrendering the AIA Policy and the GE Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It was also clear that some part of the monies in the POSB Account that were then applied by the Daughter to purchase the flat must have come from money within the matrimonial pool. In the premises, at the very least, part of the Withdrawn Sum would have formed part of the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 At the same time, on the Husband’s part, I noted that Sale Proceeds in relation to the Interlace Apartment were deposited into the EasiSave Account in March 2013; however, the bulk was withdrawn by July 2013. This was a joint account to which both parties had access, and the proceeds were not strictly accounted for. Instead, the Husband’s case appeared to be that over the course of time, he has spent at least the same amount of money on failed ventures (one of which involved $200,000 in a business with his younger son) and car, insurance, assistance with a home purchase and other expenses for the three children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Husband and Wife both had merit in their respective contentions about money each had taken. One option would be to take the final sum outstanding after reconciling the three unexplained sets of assets, and make the Husband liable for another $113,805 within the pool. There were two reasons why I did not do so. First, from the affidavits, it seemed that the Husband did not keep good accounts throughout the marriage. He was not well educated and his expertise was in construction. Viewing the parties’ accounts of their lives together, the Husband’s contention that he did not have a full ledger of his failed ventures was not a surprising one. For example, this was also the case<span class="font-italic"> vis-à-vis</span> his household money or money given to the Wife, who had free access to the safe deposit box at home and on one occasion in 2003 appears to have taken $180,000. He had not queried the insurance proceeds in 2007 or 2010, and was not even aware when the Wife took out the Withdrawn Sum from their joint account for the Daughter’s benefit. A second important consideration was that his contention that his new investments had failed was also not surprising. It appeared, on balance, that the Husband was not a sharp businessman or investor. He had worked his way up the Company, and the family wealth was accumulated through his years there. The Company is a publicly listed one and the change in management and falling share price have been publicly documented. In line with the Company’s ailing health, he had been pushed out of the management of the Company, hence his attempts to build up new businesses, which had unfortunately failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I accepted the Husband’s evidence that he was not in possession of any other hidden sums. The money has been spent in his attempts to build a new life in the light of his planned departure from the Company. <span class="font-italic">The question </span><span class="font-italic">which arises is whether it should be returned</span>. In my judgment, it would not be equitable to do so on the facts of this case. Between the parties, throughout the time they were married, there seemed little expectation that they would each hold the other to precise line items and balance sheets. In the good years, large cash sums were kept at home. The Wife had full access to the Husband’s safe deposit box, from which she had taken various sums, and in addition he gave her substantial sums in cash from time to time. The parties also owned a joint account from which the Wife had free access for household use through the issuing of cheques (and an ATM card for many years). The Husband contended that the Wife had a history of overspending, which required him to sell Interlace. Viewing all the facts of this case in their totality, with particular reference to how parties conducted their joint lives and dealt with their joint accounts, I concluded that no adverse inference need be drawn nor any notional sum be added back into the pool. It was just and equitable to use the known and undisputed asset pool remaining at the end of their marriage (see Table 1) for the purposes of division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In this context, I draw a distinction between cases where the court <span class="font-italic">excludes a </span><span class="font-italic">known asset</span> from the pool, and cases where the court is asked to <span class="font-italic">add a sum</span> to the pool. In the first category, there exists <span class="font-italic">an asset</span> amenable to division. For this category, the Court of Appeal has given guidance that generally, assets ought not to be excluded from the pool although one party may have a larger or smaller share in the division, depending upon the equities of the situation (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee v Tan Cheng Guan and another appeal and another matter </span>[2012] 4 SLR 785 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41]). In the second category, where there is no specific asset, the court may be asked to <span class="font-italic">add</span> a sum to the pool. Again, two different scenarios arise here. One could be circumstances where an adverse inference has been drawn and the court is asked to infer that the sum exists and has been squirrelled away. In such a case, it follows that <span class="font-italic">the asset exists</span>, and thus the Court of Appeal’s guidance must still apply. Where the money has been <span class="font-italic">spent</span>, on the other hand, the role of the Court is to decide whether the party who has spent the money <span class="font-italic">ought to account for it</span>. In effect, the Court is penalising that party, as the party thus held accountable would do so <span class="font-italic">out of his share of the assets</span>. Where there has been clear misconduct, this would be reasonable. In the present case, however, I did not think it equitable to take the Husband to task for the extra notional sum, given the context of their joint lives and all the circumstances of the case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Division of the pool </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Court of Appeal set out the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) (at [22]–[26]) to work out a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets.

In his analysis, the monies given by the Husband to the Wife absolutely would form gifts. The Wife took as her financial contribution the money saved from sums given to her. The Husband, on the other hand, contended that most – if not all – of those amounts originated from money he had provided to the Wife. The nub of the issue was how the contributions as regards inter-spousal gifts should be <span class="font-italic">allocated</span> in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 A starting point for considering this argument would be the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“<span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>”) (at [40]) that the law treats the matrimonial assets as community property and to that extent is <span class="font-italic">agnostic as to ownership</span> in deciding whether the <span class="font-italic">asset is liable to be divided</span> under s 112 of the Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee and another appeal and another matter</span> [2012] 4 SLR 405 (“<span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span>”) subsequently<span class="font-italic"> </span>drew a distinction between inter-spousal gifts and gifts that emanate from a third party. It noted (at [40]) that a “pure” inter-spousal gift should be included in the matrimonial pool and should not be denied recognition, as it involved the initial effort expended by the donor spouse in the original acquisition of the gift. Thus, (at [41]) “pure” inter-spousal gifts were not “gifts” for the purpose of s 112(10) of the Charter, as it was, by its very nature, always acquired by one spouse during a marriage, and thus fell to be divided as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Charter, which encompasses assets which are acquired by one party during the marriage or by both parties during the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal re-affirmed its position in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee </span>and held (at [30]) that “pure” inter-spousal gifts may be divided at the end of the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It follows from these authorities that gifts of money that the Husband gave to the Wife that remained in her accounts ought to be attributed as the Husband’s direct contribution in the Step 1 analysis. A distinction ought to be drawn, nonetheless, between, first, the assets currently in the Wife’s name that the Husband had paid for; and second, money given to her which she had channelled into the Matrimonial Home. For the former, it followed from the approach in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span> that these “pure” inter-spousal gifts <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> embodied the Husband’s financial contribution, as he paid for the insurance policies and arranged for her shares and CPF. In this regard, it was not disputed that the assets in the Wife’s sole name (see Table 1 above) were acquired by the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The monies from the Wife in relation to the purchase of the Matrimonial Home, however, stood on a different footing. When these monies were given by the Husband to the Wife absolutely for her consumption, the money had been at the Wife’s disposal. She could have spent it on the household or herself, but she chose instead to save it in order to alleviate the Husband’s financial burden of purchasing the Matrimonial Home. It could be said that by so doing she converted the gift into a direct financial contribution to the Matrimonial Home. This approach is consonant with that of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>, the parties were married for almost 30 years with two children. The wife was predominantly a home-maker, while the husband was a successful banking executive. In the High Court, the wife was awarded a 40% share of the assets. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found (at [20]) that apart from her caring for the household, the wife had managed to amass a sizable sum of close to $500,000 from her investments (albeit from the monies given to her by the husband for household and miscellaneous expenses). The Court of Appeal, in revising the wife’s share of the assets to 50%, stated that “[the wife] must be given due credit for this <span class="font-italic">direct financial contribution</span> in the division of matrimonial assets” (at [41]) [emphasis added]. The Court of Appeal here was referring to the investment gains amassed by the wife. In my judgment, I found that there was merit to the Wife’s argument that the monies she applied to the Matrimonial Home should be recognised as her contributions to the Matrimonial Home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As regards the Wife’s direct contributions under Step 1, I was left with two figures in parties’ submissions: 19.6% suggested by the Wife and 8.8% by the Husband

Both parties were unable to argue with credible evidence how much cash the Wife contributed to the Matrimonial Home (which was essentially the only asset she contributed to in the Asset Pool). On a “<span class="font-italic">rough and ready approximation</span>” (see <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> (at [17])) on the exercise of discretion in relation to Step 1, I set the direct contribution ratio for the pool at the mid-mark: 14:86 in favour of the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 2: Indirect contribution ratio </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 This was a very long marriage that had lasted 35 years up to the time of the Interim Judgment. The Wife’s submissions focused on how she devoted herself completely to the management of the family and three children, while the Husband worked extremely long hours. The Husband had done well for himself, progressing from an odd-job labourer to a businessman of not insubstantial means. The Wife submitted that their division of dominion – the Husband’s in the corporate sphere and hers in the domestic – allowed the Husband to focus on his career. The Wife thus argued that recognition had to be given to her indirect contributions. The Wife proposed a ratio of 25:75 in her favour in relation to Step 2.

</div>  He then however decided to spectacularly dilute this figure to a Step 2 ratio of effectively 35:65 in his favour by assigning 100% of indirect non-financial contributions to himself. He also pointed out that the Wife had the assistance of a maid since 1997 to do household chores and argued that this, in addition to various gifts he made to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, his sons, should be taken into account in reducing the Wife’s contribution ratio in Step 2.

At the beginning of the marriage she also contributed her savings from prior to the marriage when she worked part time as a carpenter’s help while studying. By the Husband’s own admission, he worked from dawn to dusk and the home was left entirely to the Wife. Even taking the Husband’s case that the maid was appointed in 1997 and not 2003 as claimed by the Wife, the Wife managed without a maid for about 20 years. Additionally, even with the maid, the Wife would have to give instructions and co-ordinate the household. In this regard, the Court of Appeal has held on numerous occasions that ensuring the smooth running of the household by training, managing and supervising the execution of duties assigned to maids is at least as essential and important as the direct performance of the chores itself (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span> at [89]; <span class="font-italic">Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 at [20]).

In the present case, the Husband’s financial contributions and the Wife’s non-financial contributions were made consistently, in an unstinting manner and over a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">very long</span> period of time; therefore, an equal division was appropriate in keeping with the parties’ understanding that each will take sole charge respectively of the financial and non-financial aspects of running the entire family unit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Observations on the way the case was argued and contingent analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Ms Lim stated in her written submissions that the ratio allocated to the Wife under Step 1 should be 8.8%. As noted, I fixed the ratio at middle mark between the figures proposed by the Husband (8.8%) and Wife (19.6%) in relation to Step 1 at 14%. It is noteworthy that Ms Lim’s analysis of the Step 1 ratio appears to not take into account the entire Asset Pool. It is unclear why this was the case. On the one hand, it could be an acknowledgement by the Husband that a startlingly low figure cannot be ascribed to the Wife’s direct contributions, given that she did contribute to the Matrimonial Home and her commitment to alleviate the Husband’s financial burden. To that extent, the Husband might be attempting to put before the court a palatable division via the application of <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>. Of course, this could also be an omission on counsel for the Husband’s part. Fortunately, the outcome of the division <span class="font-italic">in this case</span> does not depend on these contingencies; the streams converge on either analysis. Let me elaborate with a contingent analysis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Taking instead the 14% as the Wife’s contributions to the Matrimonial Home, the Wife’s direct contribution figure to the Asset Pool would be about 8%. Under that scenario, the Step 1 ratio would then have been 8:92 as between Wife and Husband respectively. With such a low percentage awarded under Step 1 to the Wife, as a matter of law, the weightage under Step 3 would need to be reviewed and increased to reflect the full extent of the Wife’s indirect contributions to this very long marriage (see discussion below from [59]–[68] below). Moving modestly from the 60% weightage to about 62% (the band of Step 3 weightages for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">very long</span> marriages, in my judgment, being 60–65% in favour of the Step 2 ratio) <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> Step 3 adjusted ratios would be almost the same</span>; that is, 49.5:50.5, albeit swapped in favour of the Husband. An equal division would therefore have still have been appropriate on this contingent analysis of the parties’ submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In long marriages, with the extended passage of time under scrutiny, the evidence would not give a precise answer as to financial contribution; non-financial contribution would be even more difficult to quantify with exactitude. Just as an example, if the Wife’s figures as to direct contribution to the Matrimonial Home had been used and the original 60% weightage applied, the adjusted ratio would be 50.6:49.4 for the Husband and Wife respectively. Ultimately, the framework is a <span class="font-italic">guide</span> that must remain sensitive to the factual circumstances of each case. The deeper point I make is that one must appreciate that <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>v <span class="font-italic">ANK </span>places in the hand of the Court a very robust and dynamic tool that must be used in a nuanced manner. An analysis of contingent scenarios, as outlined above, when dealing with the submissions of the parties therefore both anchors the court’s analysis and gives the Court a sense of the ultimate division. Nevertheless, as the Court of Appeal concluded in <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span><span class="font-italic">v</span> <span class="font-italic">ANK </span>(at [30]): “The controlling principle has always been and remains that the court must approach the exercise with broad strokes based on its feel of what is just and equitable on the facts of the case.” </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Comparison with previous cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I analysed the division derived from the application of <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> with the previous cases, which I now elaborate upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Ms Lim relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”). In that case, over the course of the 49-year marriage, the husband was the breadwinner while the wife was a full-time homemaker. They had four children all of whom had grown up by the time of the divorce. The High Court awarded the wife 35% of the assets to the wife. On appeal the wife sought half the assets. The Court of Appeal highlighted (at [80]) that it would only exercise its direction to disturb the division of the High Court if the judge erred in law or had taken into account irrelevant considerations and failed to take into account relevant considerations. On the facts, the Court of Appeal found no specific basis to question the division made in the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Of note was the Court of Appeal’s observation (at [2]) of the exceptional feature of the case: the pool of matrimonial assets was <span class="font-italic">exceptionally large</span>, estimated at about $69m (at [71]). In my view, the sheer quantum in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin </span>made it a very different case from the present. That case could not be used to advance a general proposition that a home-maker wife in a long marriage should be awarded 35% of the assets. In a post-<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> <span class="font-italic">v ANK</span> scenario, the weightage in that case in deriving the Step 3 adjusted ratio would have been adjusted in favour of the direct contribution because of the substantial size of the asset pool.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Mr Choh relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span> (which the Court of Appeal also referred to in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>). I found this case, where the matrimonial assets were worth about $6.5m, relevant. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span>, the parties were married for 28 years and the husband was the sole bread winner throughout the marriage. The High Court awarded the wife 50% of the matrimonial assets. The Court of Appeal’s illuminating observations as regards the trend of “approximating equality for the homemaker for long marriages with children” (which it endorsed) were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">85 Although it has been stated by this court that equality in division is not the starting point or the norm in the division of matrimonial assets between spouses (see <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v </span><span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Chye</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“<span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span>”) at [57]), it also remains true that the “courts would nevertheless not hesitate to award half (or even more than half) of the matrimonial assets if such a decision is justified on the facts” (<span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span> at [58]). This is especially so in long marriages where “the law acknowledges the equally important contributions of the homemaker to the partnership of marriage” (see <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> at [41]), as the academic commentators above (at [82]–[83]) have helpfully observed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The husband in <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span> argued on appeal that the wife should be awarded merely 14.3% of the overall total assets, as she was a home-maker. The Court of Appeal disagreed (at [82]) with the husband’s contention that the wife should be awarded merely 14.3%. While the wife did not work and therefore provided no direct financial contributions, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s equal division. In this regard, the court took into account the marriage having lasted 28 years, over which the wife made significant non-financial contributions to the household. She managed the household and took care of the children, especially when the husband was at work or away. The court found this to be so even though the family had a maid (see observations at [50] above). On the other hand, the Court of Appeal found that there was little to show that the husband made significant non-financial contributions at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 <span class="font-italic">Tan Hwee Lee</span> is not a single precedent standing in the Wife’s favour, but a recent example of a long line of Court of Appeal cases which recognise the importance of intangible contributions made to the home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai</span>”), the Court of Appeal in stated (at [14]) that non-financial contributions can be just as important as financial contributions, depending on the circumstances of the case. More recently, in <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun</span> (at [50]), the Court of Appeal, while deciding that there was no starting point of equality, stated that the “<span class="font-italic">fullest</span> effect” must be given to non-financial contributions. Both Court of Appeal decisions endorsed the approach in <span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chen Kai Buan </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 (“<span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan</span>”), the facts of which bear some resemblance to the case at hand<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 <span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan </span>concerned a successful businessman husband whose wife was predominantly a homemaker who did some work in the husband’s business. The High Court judge considered that the marriage was long and that the parties had built themselves up from scratch with very little educational qualifications. While the husband had capitalised on his skills to develop the business, the wife was totally and unstintingly committed to the marriage and the household. The judge emphasised that a party’s financial contributions towards the acquisition of any particular matrimonial asset could not be primarily determinative of how it was divided. She therefore disagreed with the district judge’s great emphasis on the husband’s role as an income generator. The judge considered that an equitable division in the circumstances was an equal division. She held (at [43]) that in a marriage, “partners often have unequal abilities whether as parents or income earners but as between them, this disparity of roles and talent should not result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made consistently and over a long period of time”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In <span class="font-italic">AYQ v </span><span class="font-italic">AYR </span>[2013] 1 SLR 476, when deciding that indirect contribution ought to be considered at the end of the marriage, the Court of Appeal held (at [23]) that this approach was adopted in order not to <span class="font-italic">undervalue</span> the indirect contribution, explaining:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…This approach would accord with the view of the marital enterprise being a partnership of efforts of both spouses and that, during the course of marriage, the spouses contribute to the betterment of it in ways that they can without consciously accounting with mathematical precision as regards the quantum and type of their respective contributions.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> (at [17] and [26]) the Court of Appeal reiterated the guidance of <span class="font-italic">Lim Choon Lai </span>(at [14]) and <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [41]) that spousal contributions in both the economic and homemaking spheres are equally fundamental to the well-being of a marital partnership. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Closing observations on the final ratio used </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In this particular case, neither party was well educated. The Wife was a carpenter’s helper who gave up work after marriage and the Husband was an odd-job labourer when they married. The assets within the pool had been entirely built up in their years together. While the Husband concentrated on his employment, the Wife’s domain was the home. In their good years, the parties shared a joint account and neither expected the other to explain how they spent money. They fully cooperated in the joint enterprise of their lives together, each doing their role in providing for their children. In my judgment, this was a marriage where spouses had contributed in a partnership of efforts. These were therefore circumstances where their overall contributions to the marriage had to be <span class="font-italic">weighed equally</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I should mention two final matters. The first is that in the course of oral submissions, Ms Lim suggested that <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> had rendered the matrimonial jurisprudence in relation to long marriages irrelevant: in her view, <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> changed the law. I have sought to show here that <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not overturn a long established line of Court of Appeal authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The second, in closing, is that the power of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> structured analysis<span class="font-italic"> </span>is that it ensures a logical flow in deciding a division. This is important because the division the court makes is fundamental to the family that the case brings to the attention of the court: thus, arbitrariness ought to be minimised and a principled approach used as far as possible. At the same time, while the court follows structured steps, its singular statutory duty is to ensure that the final result, weighing up all relevant factors, brings a just and equitable closure to parties’ joint lives and allows them a sensible future. Arising from this, the steps of the process are not disparate, but connected in their purpose: the delineation of the asset pool and its division are linked by the final objective that the allocation achieves. Thus, in excluding the outstanding sum from the Husband at [34] above, I also bore in mind that I would adjust the Step 3 weightage in favour of the Wife, and that the Husband would have the final burden of liquidating the assets as necessary. The object, in the final result, was to set a just and equitable division: fair to both parties in the context of how they had ordered their joint lives, and, at the same time, a sound basis upon which they could reasonably move forward, their shared partnership of efforts having now come to an end. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allocation of the assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Half the Asset Pool was $2,600,335. Each party was entitled to this amount. In order to implement the division, I deducted the assets held in the Wife’s name (see Table 1) from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets and found that $1,826,883 remained payable to the Wife, who will return her CPF monies with interest to her CPF account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I gave the Husband the first option to purchase the Matrimonial Home. The property was to be sold if the Husband did not wish to do so or did not have sufficient means to ensure that the Wife receives her stipulated share of the pool. The Wife’s outstanding share of the Asset Pool would then be taken out of the proceeds of sale.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Maintenance for the Wife</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Husband is now 60 years old, and is on a contract with the Company, the share values of which have been plummeting for some years. In line with recovery efforts at the publicly listed company, a new management team had been put in place. His employment (at $8,000 a month for this year) was therefore not secure beyond the end of this year. The Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">AYM v AYL and another appeal </span>[2014] 4 SLR 559 (at [18]) that a lump sum payment allowed a clean break in the marriage and should be used whenever feasible. I determined that a lump sum payment was suitable in the present case, taking into account the Husband’s projected income stream in the future and his assets at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In her submissions, the Wife asked for $4,000 a month to be paid for 19 years to her. In this regard, the Wife tabulated a long list of monthly expenses which slightly exceeded $4,000.

</div>
</div> Ms Lim on the other hand submitted in the hearing that the Husband should be asked to provide monthly maintenance of $800, as the Wife received allowances from the children. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Having considered all the relevant factors, I determined that it was appropriate to quantify the lump sum maintenance at $3,000 for five years. Calculated on the basis of an annual effective interest rate of 2%, the present value at the date of payment of this lump sum which was payable to the Wife was $171,517. In fixing this lump sum, I took into account that the Husband stopped giving the Wife maintenance after she moved out of the Matrimonial Home with the Daughter’s family in July 2015 (although she had possession of one of his two cars and access, via the use of cheques, to their joint account).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the present case, the object of the decided sum was to give the Wife a sufficient amount to weather the transition of the divorce. Three factors were in play. The first was the desirability of a clean break through a lump sum payment. The second was the declining fortunes of the Husband and the Company. In <span class="font-italic">NI v NJ</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75, the Court of Appeal cautioned (at [16]) that the statutory directive in s 114 of the Charter, which the court considered in awarding maintenance, had to be applied in “a commonsense holistic manner that accords with and takes into account the new realities that follow a failed marriage”. Here, both parties would have to make adjustments as one household transitioned into two. It would not be tenable for the Husband to pay a lump sum calculated over 19 years as suggested by the Wife. The third, as highlighted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span> [2016] SGCA 2 (at [33]), is that the power of the court to order maintenance is <span class="font-italic">supplementary</span> to that to order a division of matrimonial assets. In this case, the total financial provision for the Wife would amount to about $2.8m. On the assumption that the Wife would not be expected to seek employment, this amount, if wisely invested, was sufficient to secure her future. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Having regard to the circumstances, I made no order on costs of the ancillaries. As for the costs of the divorce, previously adjourned into chambers by the judge granting the divorce, this was initiated by the Wife arising from the Husband’s behaviour. I ordered costs of $2,000 to the Wife.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In summary, I made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Upon the Husband’s transfer of $1,826,883 to the Wife within four months of 2 March 2016, the Wife will do all that is necessary to transfer her rights, title and interest in the Matrimonial Home to the Husband, with the Wife responsible to return the sum owing to her CPF account with interest.
