The appellant, Ms Ten Leu Jiun Jeanne-Marie (“Ms Ten”) previously brought action against the respondent, the National University of Singapore (“NUS”). This suit was dismissed on 9 July 2018: <span class="font-italic">Ten Leu </span><span class="font-italic">Jiun Jeanne-Marie v National University of Singapore </span>[2018] SGHC 158 (the “Judgment”). In the OS, Ms Ten seeks to set aside the Judgment on the premise that it was tainted by fraud because of perjury on the part of NUS’s witnesses. Having heard parties and considered their arguments, I now dismiss the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Suit 667 and the Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Ms Ten commenced proceedings against NUS on 8 August 2012 (“Suit 667”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The detailed facts giving rise to Suit 667 can be found at [7]–[91] of <span class="font-italic"> </span>the Judgment. For the purposes of this appeal, the following brief facts are relevant. Commencing 7 January 2002, Ms Ten was a candidate for the degree of Masters of Arts (Architecture) by research at the School of Design and Environment of NUS. It was a requirement that Ms Ten complete a thesis in order to graduate from the course. Dr Wong Yunn Chii (“Dr Wong”) was Ms Ten’s sole supervisor for her thesis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Ms Ten raised a complaint about Dr Wong’s conduct with NUS. She dealt with a number of NUS officers regarding the complaint, including Professor Lily Kong (“Prof Kong”) and Professor Ang Siau Gek (“Prof Ang”). A Committee of Inquiry (“COI”) was set up to look into Ms Ten’s complaint. The COI concluded that, amongst other things, Dr Wong had failed to comply fully with his duties as Ms Ten’s supervisor, and recommended that he be censured for this failure. When conveying the findings of the COI to Ms Ten, Prof Kong did not mention this finding of the COI. Communication between Prof Kong and Ms Ten continued, with Ms Ten complaining that the COI’s process was inadequate and lacked transparency. There were further disagreements between Ms Ten and NUS about the requirements that she needed to fulfil to receive her degree. Eventually, on  4 September 2006, NUS terminated her candidature with immediate effect before she obtained her degree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Ms Ten brought suit against NUS to award her the degree and claimed damages for breach of contract, misfeasance in public office, intimidation and negligence. Ms Ten was dissatisfied with the way NUS had handled her complaint against Dr Wong. She felt that NUS and its officers were trying to cover up Dr Wong’s misconduct, and had thus retaliated maliciously. In particular, she alleged that Prof Kong and Prof Ang had put obstacles in her way to prevent her from obtaining her degree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 9 July 2018, all of Ms Ten’s claims were dismissed by Woo Bih Li J (as he then was): the Judgement at [301]. Woo J also ordered costs against Ms Ten.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 More than two years later, on 11 August 2020, Ms Ten filed an application (“OS 25”) to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal against the Judgment. The Court of Appeal noted that the delay was substantial, and that Ms Ten had failed to provide good reasons for it.

</div> The Court of Appeal also considered that Ms Ten’s appeal had little prospect of success. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal dismissed Ms Ten’s application for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal both in respect of the Judgment and Woo J’s consequential costs order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Prior to OS 25, on 27 December 2019, NUS had served a statutory demand on Ms Ten in respect of debts arising from costs orders made against Ms Ten during Suit 667. On 9 January 2020, Ms Ten filed an application to set aside the statutory demand (“OSB 3”). After OS 25 was dismissed, AR James Low (“AR Low”) dismissed OSB 3.

</div> Ms Ten’s appeal against AR Low’s decision was later dismissed by Andre Maniam JC (as he then was) on 25 January 2021 (“RA 316”). Maniam JC noted that Ms Ten’s submissions in OSB 3 were by and large premised on her dissatisfaction with the Judgment and the Court of Appeal’s decision in OS 25. These were decisions which she could no longer appeal against.

</div>
</div> As such, Maniam JC found that the debt that was the subject of OSB 3 was not disputed on grounds which appeared to be substantive and he was not satisfied that there were other grounds on which the statutory demand ought to be set aside.

</div>
</div> NUS could not, however, point to a specific finding or determination in the Judgment on the issue of perjury or dishonesty of NUS’s witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31  In this regard, Menon JC in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>drew a distinction between issues which are “no more than steps in a process of reasoning” and those which are “so cardinal” that the decision “cannot stand without them” (<span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [37] citing <span class="font-italic">Blair v Curran </span>(1939) 62 CLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Blair</span>”). As stated by Dixon J in <span class="font-italic">Blair </span>at 532, “nothing but what is <span class="font-italic">legally indispensable</span> to the conclusion is thus finally closed or precluded” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, the Judgment contains no specific determination on Ms Ten’s allegations because such a determination was not necessary to the court’s decision. NUS argues that it would not have been possible for Woo J to have found in their favour on the tort of misfeasance without making determinations on Ms Ten’s allegations on perjury. To address this argument, I use the requirements for the tort which Woo J set out at [115] of the Judgment:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the act is done maliciously or with knowledge that it is <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> the power of the public body;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) it is foreseeable that the act would cause damage to the plaintiffs; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the act actually does cause damage to the plaintiffs.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The requirement which potentially relates to the credibility of NUS’s witnesses is the one at (a). Woo J concluded at [252] of the Judgment that there was clearly no malice or knowledge that they were acting <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> on the part of Prof Kong or other officers of NUS. For this reason, he found that Ms Ten’s claim on the tort of misfeasance in public office failed. In particular Woo J made the following findings: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Ms Ten contended that NUS had deliberately concealed the terms of reference of the COI in relation to her complaint against Dr Wong, because the terms of reference were vague, and did not reflect the true nature of her complaint. Woo J found that NUS’s omission to give Ms Ten information about the identity of all the members of the COI and the terms of reference, or to answer her questions did not constitute deliberate conduct. Neither did the terms of reference suggest any deliberate conduct of Prof Kong to be vague: at [147] of the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Ms Ten contended that Prof Kong covered up the COI’s findings against Dr Wong and misled her into believing that the COI had completely exonerated Dr Wong, despite the fact that the COI had recommended that Dr Wong be censured for his failure to properly supervise Ms Ten. Woo J found that Prof Kong’s incomplete summary of the COI’s conclusions was not inadvertent, but was not malicious or done with knowledge that it was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>. The omission was also not an illustration of prejudice on the part of Prof Kong, who was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> focused on proceeding with moving the examination of Ms Ten’s thesis along: [153], [157] and [159] of the Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Prof Kong and Prof Ang had not acted deliberately against Ms Ten: the Judgment at [166] and [177]–[179].</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Ms Ten alleged that Prof Kong had imposed as a condition for awarding her degree, that she accept the COI’s findings. Prof Kong denied imposing such a requirement. While Woo J found that Prof Kong did impose the requirement, he held that she did not do so maliciously or with knowledge that it was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>: [230] and [252] of the Judgment. This conclusion was reached after a holistic examination of her conduct and a consideration of the relevant correspondence: [235] and [242] of the Judgment. </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34  NUS’s argument on issue estoppel rests on the logic that Woo J’s findings that are detailed above must have indicated disagreement with Ms Ten’s allegations of perjury. This is because Ms Ten’s perjury contentions were premised on Prof Kong’s dishonesty. While this may be true as a matter of logic, the logical connection falls short of establishing identity of subject matter for the purposes of issue estoppel. Any disagreement by Woo J with Ms Ten’s perjury allegations was implicit rather than expressed in a determination that could be said to be cardinal to his conclusion on the tort of misfeasance. Further, while the concepts of malice, dishonesty and perjury are related, they are not strictly the same. As an illustration, it would be theoretically possible to conclude, on the totality of the evidence, that Prof Kong had acted honestly at all times when dealing with Ms Ten regarding her complaint and the awarding of her degree, while at the same time holding the view that she was not a completely honest witness at trial. Thus, I conclude that an implicit determination, if any, by Woo J on the specific allegations which Ms Ten raises in the OS was “no more than [a step] in [the] process of reasoning” (see [31] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The view that Woo J did not specifically determine Ms Ten’s allegations of perjury in the Judgment is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s approach when the allegations were raised by Ms Ten in OS 25. While seeing no issue with the merits of Woo J’s findings on each of the causes of action, the Court of Appeal dealt with Ms Ten’s perjury allegations as if they <span class="font-italic">arose from </span>Woo J’s findings in the Judgment and concluded that they were “unsubstantiated”.

In other words, the issue was central to <span class="font-italic">her</span> case, even though it did not turn out to be fundamental to the Judgment. In the light of the fact that it was fundamental to her case, she ought to have brought forward her whole case in that proceeding. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>(1843) 3 Hare 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Henderson</span>”), at 114–115:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a Court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which [the] parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Ms Ten makes the argument that the <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> doctrine only applies to cases where an issue was not raised in an earlier proceeding. She refers to <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF</span> [2020] 1 SLR 1296 at [53] (“<span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF</span>”), where the Court of Appeal referred to the <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> rule as one “that a litigant may not make a case in litigation which might have been, but was not, made in previous litigation”. Her point is that because the perjury issue was repeatedly raised by her and her counsel, it could not be subject to the <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> rule as framed by the Court of Appeal.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, she has misunderstood the Court of Appeal’s remarks, and those of the other High Court decisions she referred to. The <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> rule is often referred to as the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> because it <span class="font-italic">extends</span> the breadth of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. It applies to a wider range of scenarios for policy reasons which I return to at [62] below. Thus, for example, for issue estoppel to apply, it is a requirement that the issue was referred to and was the subject of argument: <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [38]. However, there is no such requirement when it comes to the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or abuse of process<span class="font-italic">.</span> This was what the Court of Appeal alluded to in <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF</span>. The Court of Appeal was not suggesting that a matter <span class="font-italic">must </span><span class="font-italic">have</span> not been raised in earlier proceedings for the doctrine of abuse of process to apply. This would lead to legal absurdity because a litigant could thereby escape the ambit of the extended doctrine by simply raising irrelevant issues in litigation which are, for obvious reasons, eventually not determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Coming to the case at hand, issue estoppel does not apply because the issue in question was not fundamental to the decision in the Judgment. Nevertheless, as may be seen from the extract from <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> at [38] above, what Ms Ten has raised before, she is not permitted to raise again. As the plaintiff in the earlier case, she had raised issues pertaining to the honesty of NUS’s witnesses, and is now, again as a plaintiff, raising the issues raised earlier. In <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> at [102], the Court of Appeal explained that the purpose behind the extended doctrine is to limit <span class="font-italic">abusive and duplicative litigation</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Returning to the relevant considerations at [53] of <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>(summarised at [37] above), the issue of perjury not having been decided in her favour, the extended doctrine operates as a bar to the OS unless there are matters of fresh evidence that warrant re-litigation, or other <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why Ms Ten should be allowed to advance this argument again. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this respect, it must also be noted that the notion of there having been fraud perpetrated in Suit 667 is not new. It was already once pursued after the Judgment, in the context of the application for an extension of time to appeal. On the evidence presented in that application, the Court of Appeal noted that the allegations were unsubstantiated. In their remarks, the Court of Appeal directly addressed one of Ms Ten’s concerns about the inconsistency between Woo J’s findings and Prof Kong’s evidence on the witness stand, as follows:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Applicant’s overarching submission that the Respondent had obtained judgment by fraud because its witnesses had committed perjury is unsubstantiated. For example, the Applicant claims that Vice-Provost Kong perjured herself by not admitting that she had required the Applicant to accept the decision of the Committee on Inquiry on the plagiarism issue, when the Judge found that such a condition was indeed imposed on the Applicant (see <span class="font-italic">Ten Leu </span><span class="font-italic">Jiun Jeanne-Marie v National University of Singapore</span> [2018] SGHC 158 at [230]). However, the Judge reached this conclusion having found that Vice-Provost Kong’s letter of 11 August 2006 was ambiguous from an objective viewpoint. He therefore applied the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span> rule in the Applicant’s favour (at [226]). His finding is not inconsistent with the fact that Vice-Provost Kong did not <span class="font-italic">subjectively</span> intend to impose that condition on the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the OS, Ms Ten has similarly not brought any new evidence forward. She has again sought to establish fraud by pointing to the documentary evidence that was before the court in Suit 667, and the findings in the Judgment itself. The primary purpose of the OS is to advance a case that Suit 667 was wrongly decided <span class="font-italic">on the evidence that was before it</span>. Ms Ten was frank as to this purpose and motivation:

It is apt to this case and I set it out here: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">First</span>, the essence of the action is fraud. As in all actions based on fraud, <span class="font-italic">particulars of the fraud claimed must be exactly given</span> and the allegations must be established by the <span class="font-italic">strict proof</span> which such a charge requires: <span class="font-italic">Jonesco</span><span class="font-italic"> v Beard</span> [1930] AC 298 at 301; <span class="font-italic">McHarg v Woods Radio Pty Ltd</span> [[1948] VLR 496 at 497].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Secondly</span>, it must be shown, by the party asserting that a judgment was procured by fraud, that there has been a <span class="font-italic">new discovery of something material</span>, in the sense that fresh facts have been found which, by themselves or in combination with previously known facts, <span class="font-italic">would provide a reason for setting aside the judgment</span>: see Lord Selborne LC in <span class="font-italic">Boswell v </span><span class="font-italic">Coaks (No 2)</span> (1894) 6 R 167 at 170, 174: 86 LT 365 at 366, 368: <span class="font-italic">Cabassi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Vila</span> (1940) 64 CLR 130 at 147; <span class="font-italic">McDonald v McDonald</span> (1965) 113 CLR 529 at 533; <span class="font-italic">Everett v Ribbands</span> (1946) 175 LT 143 at 145, 146; <span class="font-italic">Birch v Birch</span> [1902] P 130 at 136, 137–138; <span class="font-italic">Ronald v Harper</span> [1913] VLR 311 at 318. This rule has an ancient lineage: see, eg, <span class="font-italic">Shedden</span><span class="font-italic"> v Patrick</span> (1854) 1 Macq 535 at 615, 622; <span class="font-italic">Halsbury Laws of England</span>, 4th ed, par 560 at 285. It is based upon a number of grounds. There is a public interest in finality of litigation. Parties ought not, by proceeding to impugn a judgment, to be permitted to relitigate matters which were the subject of the earlier proceedings which gave rise to the judgment. Especially should they not be so permitted, if they move on nothing more than the evidence upon which they have previously failed. If they have evidence of fraud which may taint a judgment of the courts, they should not collude in such a consequence by refraining from raising their objection at the trial, thereby keeping the complaint in reserve. It is their responsibility to ensure that the taint of fraud is avoided and the integrity of the court’s process preserved.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Thirdly</span>, mere suspicion of fraud, raised by fresh facts later discovered, will not be sufficient to secure relief. <span class="font-italic">Birch v Birch</span> [[1902] P 130 at 136, 139]; <span class="font-italic">McHarg v Woods Radio Pty Ltd</span> [[1948] VLR 496 at 498]; <span class="font-italic">Ronald v Harper</span> [[1913] VLR 311 at 318]. The claimant must establish that the new facts are so evidenced and <span class="font-italic">so material</span> that it is reasonably probable that the action will succeed. This rule is founded squarely in the public interest in finality of public litigation and in upholding judgments duly entered at the termination of proceedings in the courts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Fourthly</span>, although perjury by the successful party or a witness or witnesses may, if later discovered, warrant the setting aside of a judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud, and although there may be exceptional cases where such proof of perjury could suffice, without more, to warrant relief of this kind, <span class="font-italic">the mere allegation, or even the proof, of perjury will not normally be sufficient to attract such drastic and exceptional relief as the setting aside of a judgment</span>; <span class="font-italic">Cabassi</span><span class="font-italic"> v Vila</span> [(1940) 64 CLR 130 at 147, 148]; <span class="font-italic">Baker v Wadsworth</span> (1898) 67 LJ QB 301; <span class="font-italic">Everett v Ribbands</span> [(1946) 175 LT 143 at 145, 146]. The other requirements must be fulfilled<span class="font-italic">. In hard fought litigation, it is not at all uncommon for there to be a conflict of testimony which </span><span class="font-italic">has to be resolved by a judge or jury. In many cases of contradictory evidence, one party must be mistaken. He or she may even be deceiving the court. The unsuccessful party in the litigation will often consider that failure in the litigation has been procured by false evidence on the part of the opponent and the witnesses called by the opponent. If every case in which such an opinion was held gave rise to proceedings of this kind, the courts would be even more burdened with the review of first instance decisions than they are. For this reason, and in defence of finality of judgments, a more stringent requirement than alleged perjury alone is required.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Fifthly</span>, it must be shown by admissible evidence that the successful party was responsible for the fraud which taints the judgment under challenge. The evidence in support of the charge ought to be extrinsic: cf <span class="font-italic">Perry v </span><span class="font-italic">Meddowcroft</span> (1846) 10 Beau 122 at 136–139; 50 ER 529 at 534, 535. It is not sufficient to show that an agent of the successful party was convicted of giving perjured evidence in the former proceeding, the result of which it is sought to impeach. It must be shown that the agent, in so acting, was in concert with the party who derived the benefit of the judgment. <span class="font-italic">Ronald v Harper</span> [[1913] VLR 311 at 318]; <span class="font-italic">Sheddon</span><span class="font-italic"> v Patrick</span> [(1854) 1 Macq 535 at 643].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Sixthly</span>, the burden of establishing the components necessary to warrant the drastic step of setting aside a judgment, allegedly affected by fraud or other relevant taint, lies on the party impugning the judgment. It is for that party to establish the fraud and to do so clearly. <span class="font-italic">In summary, he or she must establish that the case is based on newly discovered facts; that the facts are material and such as to make it reasonably probable that the case will succeed; that they go beyond mere allegations of perjury on the part of witnesses at the trial; and that the opposing party who took advantage of the judgment is shown, by admissible evidence, to have been responsible for the fraud in such a way as to render it inequitable that such party should take the benefit of the judgment.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> illumines how exceptional fresh evidence must be in order to raise, in a new action, the contention that an earlier judgment was tainted by fraud and in particular, perjury on the part of witnesses. In this regard, the present case must be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Takhar v </span><span class="font-italic">Gracefield Developments Ltd and others </span>[2019] 2 WLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Takhar</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Su </span><span class="font-italic">Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673, authorities on which Ms Ten relies. In both of these cases, fresh material evidence arose after their conclusion, and fraud had not been raised in the proceedings leading to the judgment sought to be set aside. In both cases, expert evidence was adduced concerning the authenticity of signatures on transfer documents for properties that were key to the dispute at the earlier trials. At the hearing, Ms Ten sought to liken Prof Lewis’s opinion to that of the expert dealing with the authenticity of the signature of the claimant in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span>. However, Prof Lewis’s opinion is in an entirely different category. His report does not pertain to any scientific or technical fact. It would not be admissible evidence under the Evidence Act 1893. There was therefore no fresh evidence that Ms Ten sought to rely on in the OS. The principles that the UK Supreme Court cited in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span>, at [56], referring to <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Highland Financial Partners </span><span class="font-italic">lp</span> [2013] 1 CLC 596 at para 106, are apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principles are, briefly: first, there has to be a ‘conscious and deliberate dishonesty’ in relation to the relevant evidence given, or action taken, statement made or matter concealed, which is relevant to the judgment now sought to be impugned. Secondly, the relevant evidence, action, statement or concealment (performed with conscious and deliberate dishonesty) must be ‘material’. <span class="font-italic">‘Material’ means that the fresh evidence that is adduced after the first judgment has been given is such that it demonstrates that the previous relevant evidence, action, </span><span class="font-italic">statement or concealment was an operative cause of the court’s decision to give judgment in the way it did.</span> <span class="font-italic">Put another way, it must be shown that the fresh evidence would have entirely changed the way in which the first court approached and came to its decision.</span> Thus the relevant conscious and deliberate dishonesty must be causative of the impugned judgment being obtained in the terms it was. Thirdly, the question of materiality of the fresh evidence is to be assessed by reference to its impact on the evidence supporting the original decision, not by reference to its impact on what decision might be made if the claim were to be retried on honest evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 These authorities align with the analysis set out in <span class="font-italic">Ong</span><span class="font-italic"> Cher Keong</span>: see [18] above. Similar to <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul</span>, <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span> emphasised that finality is important, citing (at [44]) <span class="font-italic">The Ampthill Peerage</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1977] AC 547 at 569: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any determination of disputable fact may, the law recognises, be imperfect: the law aims at providing the best and safest solution compatible with human fallibility and having reached that solution it closes the book. The law knows, and we all know, that sometimes fresh material may be found, which perhaps might lead to a different result, but, in the interest of peace, certainty and security it prevents further inquiry. It is said that in doing this, the law is preferring justice to truth. That may be so: these values cannot always coincide. The law does its best to reduce the gap. But there are cases where the certainty of justice prevails over the possibility of truth (I do not say that this is such a case), and these are cases where the law insists on finality. For a policy of closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended with safeguards: so the law allows appeals: so the law, exceptionally, allows appeals out of time: so the law still more exceptionally allows judgments to be attacked on the ground of fraud …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 By Ms Ten’s own assertions, she sought to make the same arguments that her counsel pressed in Suit 667.

</div> While the police report and the expert opinion did arise after the Judgment, they do not relate to any of the material events considered in Suit 667 and therefore certainly are not evidence of matters which <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> would be a reason for setting the decision in Suit 667 if they were established by proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Ms Ten’s approach was summed up in her written submissions, which made patent that she did not seek to rely on any new evidence that was not before the court in Suit 667:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I emphasise that, in deciding whether or not Lily Kong committed perjury (as I have alleged), the Court in OS 226 should be able to make this finding merely by examining the written records of Lily Kong’s own words, as recorded in a few key contemporaneous documents which are described in great detail in my Affidavit for OS 226 that I filed on 10 March 2021, especially (a) pages 94-112 of the Court’s official transcript of Lily Kong’s sworn testimony during cross-examination at trial on 21 August 2017, (b) paragraphs 121, 122, 199, 204, 205, 208, 210, 211, 213 and 218 of Lily Kong’s AEIC for Suit 667 (as I have detailed in my Affidavit for OS 226 that I filed on 10 March 2021), (c) paragraphs 10 and 11 of the email that Lily Kong sent to Tan Chorh Chuan on 2 September 2006 (at 2AB 1182) and (d) the one-paragraph email that Lily Kong sent to Sitoe Yew Kok, Ang Siau Gek and Lai Ai Lee on 9 January 2007 (at 2AB 1237), as well as (e) the one-paragraph ‘in toto’ email that NUS Registrar Ang Siau Gek sent to NUS President Tan Chorh Chuan on 12 January 2009 (at 3AB 1378).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Given that Ms Ten has not raised any fresh material evidence in the OS, it must be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As a final matter, I deal with Ms Ten’s mode of commencing this claim. Fraud allegations carry a high threshold of proof and affidavit evidence is usually not sufficient to lead to a finding of fraud: see <span class="font-italic">Yee Heng </span><span class="font-italic">Khay (alias Roger) v Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd and another matter </span>[2022] SGHC(A) 20 at [19]. A writ action is the appropriate mode of commencement where factual matters require resolution: O 5 r 2 of the ROC. For completeness, I highlight that even though I could have allowed the appeal and converted the matter to a writ action if any of Ms Ten’s arguments required a trial, I did not think any of her arguments were of sufficient materiality to be tested in an action converted to a writ. Ms Ten’s view, in any event, as seen from the extract at the [51] above, is that no new factual issues needed to be determined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Prayers 3, 4 and 5</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Prayers 3 and 4 are specific requests for Woo JAD and Maniam J not to hear the OS. Prayer 5 is a specific request for Chan SJ to hear the OS. These prayers are now irrelevant as I dismiss the appeal against the striking out of the OS. As I will explain, these prayers are also legally and factually unsustainable and are therefore frivolous and vexatious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Prayers 3 and 4 contain allegations of apparent bias. The law on apparent bias was definitively restated in the case of <span class="font-italic">BOI</span><span class="font-italic"> v BOJ </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1156 at [103]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">The general test is an objective one</span>: whether there are circumstances that would give rise to a <span class="font-italic">reasonable suspicion or apprehension</span> of bias in the fair-minded and informed observer.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">“Reasonable suspicion or apprehension”</span>:<span class="font-italic"> </span>there is a reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias when an observer would think, from relevant circumstances, that bias is possible. This belief cannot be fanciful, and it must be a reasoned one, capable of articulation with reference to the evidence presented.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">The observer’s perspective</span> <span class="font-italic">is that from which matters are to be judged</span>: such an observer would be informed of all relevant facts that are generally capable of being known by members of the public, including the traditions of integrity and impartiality that the administrators of justice have to uphold. The observer must also be fair-minded, and cannot be unduly complacent, sensitive or suspicious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Prayer 3 alleges apparent bias on the premise of [302] of the Judgment. At [302], Woo J observed as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although I have some sympathy for the Plaintiff, she has only herself to blame. She allowed her view and distrust of Dr Wong to cloud her judgment in her interaction with those she complained to. I agree with the DCS (at para 17) that she viewed the views of others who did not agree with her with irrational suspicion and distrust and perceived them as signs of wrongdoing and/or conspiracy against her. While quick to criticise others, she could not see her own prejudices and how difficult she appeared to others. Her repetitive complaints about the examination process even after the successful outcome of the examination is perhaps one of the best illustrations of her jaundiced perception. Her inability to differentiate between her complaints about Dr Wong and the requirements she had to comply with has led her to the unfortunate situation she finds herself in. Attempts to resolve or mediate the dispute have failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 An objective reading of [302] does not yield any reasonable suspicion or apprehension of bias. It was a specific finding of fact made in the context of a factual matrix established at trial and based on a trial judge’s consideration of witnesses assessed at trial. When the paragraph is read in the context of the judgment as a whole, it is clear that Woo J’s observation at [302] was a conclusion drawn from facts as found earlier in the judgment. A fair-minded observer would not thereby conclude that Woo J would be biased in any future proceedings tried before him that involved Ms Ten. The mere fact that a judge has previously made adverse comments or findings against a litigant is, on its own, not sufficient for a recusal application to succeed: <span class="font-italic">TOW v TOV</span> [2017] 3 SLR 725 at [42]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Prayer 4 prays for Maniam J’s recusal on the ground of apparent bias as Maniam J was previously a lecturer at the Singapore Management University where Prof Kong was Vice Provost. This information does not give rise to any reasonable suspicion of bias. An oral application to this effect was also made in the course of RA 316, which Maniam JC (as he then was) dismissed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">BOI v BOJ</span> on such matters at [141] remains apt:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, we cannot emphasise enough how extremely serious allegations of judicial bias are. Indeed, such allegations can be utilised not only as a weapon of abuse by disgruntled litigants but also waste valuable court time and resources in the process. We would imagine that, by their very nature, such allegations would be rare in the extreme. Should such proceedings arise before the court in the future and be found to be unmeritorious, there may be serious consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Finally, coming to Prayer 5, there is no legal basis for a litigant to pray for any specific judge hear her case, and for good reason. Prayers 3 and 4 concern unfounded contentions for judges to be recused. Prayer 5 is a prayer for a specific judge to hear the OS. Both categories of requests are forms of “judge shopping”, which “is not to be condoned as it is insidious, and undermines and weakens the administration of justice”: see <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Chin and another v Attorney-General </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 541 at [10]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">AR’s costs order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The AR ordered costs of $8,000 against Ms Ten, inclusive of disbursements. This was a reasonable order and I do not disturb it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on RA 351 of 2021</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The nature of litigation is such that plaintiffs who lose their cases may find they disagree with a trial court’s decision, and further down the road, the appellate court’s decision. Rather than to ask another court to adjudicate the issue again, better closure may be found in accepting that the chosen forum for dispute resolution has a responsibility to be fair to all parties that come before it. As explained by Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 760 at [44]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to us that the common thread linking the decisions relating to the doctrine of abuse of process is the <span class="font-italic">courts’</span><span class="font-italic"> concern with managing and preventing multiplicity of litigation so as to ensure that justice is achieved for all</span>. In our judgment, the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>is applicable where some connection can be shown between the party seeking to relitigate the issue and the earlier proceeding where that essential issue was litigated, <span class="font-italic">which would make it unjust to allow that party to reopen the issue</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis removed; emphasis added]</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The appeal is dismissed.
