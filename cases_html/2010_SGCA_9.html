        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal concerned the decision of the High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) in Registrar’s Appeal No 225
                    of 2009 (“RA 225”) and Registrar’s Appeal No 228
                    of 2009 (“RA 228”) (see <em>Main-Line
                        Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2009]
                    SGHC 212 (“the GD”)). In his decision, the Judge reversed the
                    decision of an assistant registrar (“the AR”), who ordered United
                    Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”), on the application of Main-Line
                    Corporate Holdings Ltd (“Main-Line”), to make an interim payment
                    of $1,962,424.30 into court. At the conclusion of the hearing before us,
                    Main-Line’s appeal was allowed and the interim payment order made by the
                    AR was restored, with the modification that the interim payment was to be made
                    directly to Main-Line rather than into court. We now give the detailed reasons
                    for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The subject of the present appeal had its
                    genesis in the decisions of the High Court in <em>Main-Line
                        Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007]
                    1 SLR(R) 1021 (“<em>Main-Line HC</em>”)
                    and this court in <em>First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main-Line
                        Corporate Holdings Ltd</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 335
                        (“<em>Main-Line CA</em>”) on the
                    substantive dispute between Main-Line, UOB and First Currency Choice Pte Ltd
                    (“FCC”) (which was not a party to this appeal). The proceedings
                    that dealt with the substantive dispute will collectively be referred to
                    hereafter as “the main proceedings” for convenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Main-Line, a company incorporated in Ireland, is
                    the registered proprietor of Singapore Patent No 86037 (WO 01/04846
                    A1) titled “Dynamic Currency Conversion for Card Payment Systems”
                    (“the Patent”), which provides for a method to determine the
                    operating currency in which to process a transaction for a payment card
                    (including credit cards, debit cards, etc) at the point of sale between a
                    merchant and the holder of the card. FCC was the creator and proprietor of the
                    First Currency Choice System (“the FCC System”). UOB, a leading
                    local bank, entered into a Multicurrency Exchange Agreement (“the
                    MEA”) with FCC for the use of the FCC System. Main-Line alleged that the
                    FCC System infringed the Patent, and instituted an action that subsequently led
                    to the main proceedings. In the main proceedings, Tay Yong Kwang J, the
                    trial judge, found in favour of Main-Line (see <em>Main-Line
                        HC</em>), and his decision was upheld by this court (see <em>Main-Line CA</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       One of the orders made by Tay J was for an
                    inquiry to be held by a registrar on damages or an account of profits, and that
                    Main-Line had to elect, at or before the stage of directions for the inquiry,
                    whether it preferred that there be an assessment of damages or an account of
                    profits for the infringement of the Patent (see <em>Main-Line
                        HC</em> at [85])). Before making its election, Main-Line applied by
                    way of Summons No 5347 of 2007 for pre-election discovery of documents. In
                    response to Main-Line’s application, Ms Gan Ai Im
                    (“Ms Gan”), a senior vice president of UOB, filed an
                    affidavit on 6 March 2008, where the following was stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    … UOB does not have a specific amount or
                            breakdown of the costs associated with the operation of the FCC System.
                            However, in order to provide a fair basis for [Main-Line] to make its
                            election, annexed hereto and marked “<b>GAI-4</b>” is a computation of the <u>net</u> profits that were generated from the
                            operation of the FCC System from May 2002 to December
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    As shown in “<b>GAI-4</b>”, the revenue earned by UOB from the
                            operation of the FCC System from May 2002 to December 2007 was the
                            amount of commissions received by UOB from FCC for that period.
                            UOB’s expense/income ratios for the financial years from 2002 to
                            2006, as published in UOB’s annual reports are then applied to
                            derive the net profits earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC
                            system from May 2002 to December 2007. In this regard, I should explain
                            that as the expense/income ratio for financial year 2007 has not been
                            published yet, the expense/income ratio for financial year 2006 is used
                            as a proxy instead. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining and emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According to Ms Gan’s affidavit filed on
                    6 March 2008, the total revenue of UOB arising from the operation of the
                    FCC System, which infringed the Patent, was $3,135,236.40 – this being the
                    total amount of the commissions paid by FCC to UOB. However, UOB did not have a
                    precise breakdown of its costs in earning the revenue of $3,135,236.40.
                    Therefore, to provide Main-Line with a basis for election, UOB disclosed its
                    general expense/income ratios for financial years 2002 to 2006. These ratios
                    were found in UOB’s annual reports. By applying the ratio for each
                    financial year in question to the commissions received in that financial year
                    (with the ratio for financial year 2006 used as a proxy for the ratio for
                    financial year 2007), the sum of $1,999,285.28 was derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On the basis of the information given by UOB
                    (including the above), Main-Line elected, on 16 July 2008, for an account
                    of profits as against UOB but for an assessment of damages as against FCC. On
                    13 August 2008, in a hearing before an assistant registrar, UOB and FCC
                    successfully applied (by way of Summons No 3347 of 2008) to set aside the
                    notice of election on the ground that Main-Line had to elect for the same remedy
                    as against both Main-Line and FCC. Main-Line successfully appealed to a High
                    Court judge against this decision (see <em>Main-Line Corporate
                        Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 189).
                    UOB did not file a further appeal to this court, and this effectively meant that
                    the notice of election given by Main-Line was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 14 May 2009, Main-Line applied, pursuant
                    to O 29 rr 10, 11 and 12 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), for an order for UOB to
                    pay Main-Line the sum of $3,135,236.40 (or such sum as deemed fit by the court)
                    as an interim payment (in relation to the account of UOB’s profits). This
                    application formed the subject matter for the present appeal. For the purposes
                    of this application, Main-Line proceeded on the basis that the commissions paid
                    by FCC was the only revenue earned by UOB, although it was of the view that
                    UOB’s revenue was not confined solely to the commissions
                earned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In response to Main-Line’s application,
                    Mr Cheang Kok Chew (“Mr Cheang”), a vice president of
                    UOB, filed an affidavit on 2 June 2009, which stated the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    To run the FCC [S]ystem in tandem with UOB’s
                            overall system, UOB incurred costs and expenses such as operating and
                            infrastructure costs. However, as explained by Ms Gan in her affidavit
                            filed on 6 March 2008, UOB did not have a specific amount or
                            breakdown of the costs associated with the FCC [S]ystem.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Ms Gan has, however, provided in her affidavit
                            filed on 6 March 2008 an estimate of the costs and expenses incurred by
                            UOB in using the FCC [S]ystem during the period of UOB’s liability
                            from May 2002 to December 2007 …. The estimate was derived at by
                            applying UOB’s expense/income ratio[s] (as reflected in
                            UOB’s Annual Reports) for each of the financial years from 2002 to
                            2007 to UOB’s gross revenue which arose from the infringement,
                                <em>i.e</em>., the FCC commissions, for the
                            respective years. The computation of the estimated costs and profits can
                            be seen from exhibit “GAI-4” found in Ms Gan’s
                            affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    Annexed hereto and marked “CKC-1” is
                            a revised computation of the estimated costs and profits. …
                            [T]his revised computation is based on the abovementioned exhibit
                            “GAI-4” and the revision was for the purpose of correcting
                            certain errors in the sums stated as the commissions earned in the
                            period of May to December 2002 [and] in year 2007. Further, the revised
                            computation in “CKC-1” also reflects the actual
                            expense/income ratio for year 2007 as stated in UOB’s Annual
                            Report 2007. At the time of preparing the original computation in
                            “GAI-4”, UOB’s Annual Report 2007 had not yet been
                            released and hence the expense/income ratio for year 2007 had not yet
                            been released and hence the expense/income ratio for year 2007 was
                            assumed to be the same as the expense/income ratio for year
                        2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    It can be seen from “CKC-1” that the
                            estimated profits earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC System
                            during the period of May 2002 to December 2007 is
                        S$1,962,424.30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As may be observed, Mr Cheang’s evidence was
                    substantially similar to that of Ms Gan’s. However, Mr Cheang
                    revised the estimated profits to take into account certain errors and the
                    expense/income ratio for financial year 2007. That ratio was not available at
                    the time when Ms Gan filed her affidavit. Thus, the sum of $1,962,424.30
                    was derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 4 June 2009, pursuant to O 29 r 12
                    of the Rules, the AR ordered UOB to pay the sum of $1,962,424.30 into court as
                    interim payment. Both Main-Line and UOB appealed against this decision.
                    Main-Line appealed (in RA 225) against the quantum of the interim payment
                    granted and the direction for payment to be made into court. UOB’s case
                    (in RA 228) was that the application for interim payment should have been
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 13 July 2009, the Judge allowed
                    UOB’s appeal and set aside the order of the AR granting interim payment
                    (and dismissed Main-Line’s appeal), for the main reason that Main-Line had
                    not satisfied the court that “there is an amount below which the
                    assessment of profit will not go” (see GD at [12]). This decision in turn
                    prompted the present appeal to us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">This appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The main issues raised in this appeal
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Judge erred in law or
                        fact in exercising his discretion against an order for interim payment;

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The contentions of the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Main-Line submitted that the minimum
                        amount of profits that would have to be accounted for would be
                        $3,135,236.40, or, in the alternative, $1,962,424.30, and there was no
                        reason for payment not to be made to Main-Line instead of into court as it
                        would be Main-Line’s minimum entitlement at law. UOB submitted that it
                        should be presumed that the Judge had correctly exercised his discretion,
                        Main-Line had not shown evidence of hardship, and Main-Line had not shown
                        evidence of an irreducible sum. In addition, UOB submitted that any interim
                        payment should be made into court, due to the risk of non-recoverability of
                        any excess amount.</p>

                        Assurance Co Ltd v Wong Cherng Yaw</em> [2009] SGHC 89
                        (“<em>AIA HC</em>”), Andrew Ang J ruled
                    that the test to determine whether an order for interim payment should be made
                    involves a two-stage process, stating (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the court must be satisfied that one of the grounds stated in the
                        sub-paragraphs [of O 29 rr 11 and 12] is established. … If
                        the court is so satisfied, it has the <em>power</em> to
                        grant an order for interim payment. The court then moves on to consider, at
                        the second stage, whether it ought to exercise its discretion to do so and
                        to determine the quantum of such payment. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">An appeal against this decision was dismissed by this court in
                        <em>American International Assurance Co Ltd v Wong Cherng
                        Yaw</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1117 (“<em>AIA
                        CA</em>”). In the present case, it was not in dispute that the
                    requirements of O 29 r 12(<em>a</em>) were
                    satisfied (the first stage), and, therefore, the key issue was whether the court
                    should exercise its discretion in favour of ordering interim payment (the second
                    stage).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Under O 29 r 12 of the Rules, the
                    discretion is left to the court as to whether to grant an order for interim
                    payment. In determining whether a case is “fit” for the court to
                    make such an order, case law has established that, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, it would not be appropriate to invoke O 29 r 12
                    where the factual issues raised in the case are complicated, or where difficult
                    points of law are raised therein. However, the fact that there are sufficient
                    complex issues of fact or law will not prevent the court from ordering an
                    interim payment in respect of part of a complex claim where there is evidence
                    establishing, with “reasonable certainty”, a minimum sum which is
                    likely to be recoverable (see <em>AIA CA</em> at
                    [22]–[23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The role of an appellate court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is trite law that where a decision involves
                    an exercise of judicial discretion, an appellate court should not disturb that
                    decision unless it can be shown that the judge had exercised his or her
                    discretion erroneously <em>vis-à-vis</em> law, principle,
                    or fact, or that he or she took irrelevant matters into account, or that the
                    decision reached was “outside the generous ambit within which a
                    reasonable disagreement is possible” (see the decision of this court in
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053 at [34]). The starting presumption
                    should be that the judge below had exercised his or her discretion correctly
                    (see the decision of this court in <em>Westacre Investments v The
                        State-Owned Company Yugoimport SDPR</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 166 at
                    [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s exercise of discretion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Judge’s exercise of discretion
                    turned largely on the evidence relating to the sum of $1,999,285.28 (that was
                    subsequently revised to $1,962,424.30 (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above)). The Judge found that Ms Gan had not conceded that
                    the sum of $1,999,285.28 was the “net profit” and that the figure
                    was only a “rough estimate” (see GD at [9]). The Judge further
                    iterated that in making an application for interim payment, Main-Line
                    “must satisfy the court that there is an amount below which the
                    assessment of profit will not go” and that the “raw
                    estimate” furnished by Ms Gan and Mr Cheang was not sufficient
                    for an order to be made (see GD at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The rationale for this prudent approach was
                    presumably to reduce the risk that the court might err in paying out too much at
                    the interim stage. While such an approach would, in a general sense, be fair and
                    reasonable, it should not be used as an excuse to deny interim payment to an
                    applicant – especially in a case where all the relevant information and
                    particulars needed to ascertain the amount due are in the exclusive possession
                    of the respondent as in the present case. This was an aspect which, we thought,
                    the Judge had inadvertently not borne in mind. Main-Line had already obtained
                    judgment in the main proceedings, and UOB had admitted that it had received
                    commissions amounting to $3,135,236.40 from the operation of the FCC System in
                    breach of the Patent. The main contention of UOB, in resisting Main-Line’s
                    application for interim payment, was that it had incurred expenses or costs in
                    earning the said commissions. But on these facts, it was abundantly clear that,
                    at the very least, a good portion of the sum of $3,135,236.40 would be pure
                    profits earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC System.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Ms Gan, in her affidavit filed on
                    6 March 2008, deposed (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) that UOB
                    did not have separate records which showed the expenses incurred in earning the
                    commissions. However, Ms Gan did say that by applying the expense/income
                    ratios of UOB for financial years 2002 to 2006, the net profits for the
                    operation of the FCC System would be $1,999,285.28 (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). In our
                    view, to deny Main-Line any interim payment completely just because the exact
                    dollars and cents could not as yet be ascertained would be to reward UOB for the
                    inadequacy of its own administrative process to the prejudice of Main-Line. This
                    would be wholly unjust. In such circumstances, the court would be entitled to,
                    and indeed should, adopt the “estimated” figures as the proper
                    basis to order interim payment. In this connection, it is salient that O 29
                    r 12 empowers the court to order “interim payment of such amount as
                    it thinks just”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     There was one further point which was germane
                    to the issue at hand. As noted by this court in <em>AIA
                        CA</em> at [24], O 29 of the Rules also provides for the
                    contingency of overpayment. This can be found in O 29 r 17, which
                    accords the court with wide powers to make the necessary adjustments in the
                    final judgment or order; in particular, the court may order the applicant for
                    interim payment to repay all or part of the interim payment received (<em>per</em> O 29 r 17(<em>a</em>)). Thus, in balancing the interests of the parties in an
                    application for interim payment, the court only requires that there is <em>reasonable certainty</em> that the proposed interim payment
                    amount is likely to be the minimum sum recoverable. The Judge, however, appeared
                    to have insisted on a higher standard of certainty, <em>viz</em>, <em>absolute</em> certainty, as seen
                    by his declaration that Main-Line “must satisfy the court that there is
                    an amount below which the assessment of profit will not go” (GD at [12]),
                    and this, in our view, was an error of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At this juncture, it would already be clear
                    that the Judge had erred in his exercise of discretion, and that the decision to
                    not grant interim payment had to be revisited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision to not grant interim payment revisited</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ascertainment of a minimum sum with reasonable certainty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     From the affidavits of both Ms Gan and
                    Mr Cheang (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above) it could not be disputed that revenue, in the form of commissions, was
                    earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC System. The uncertainty related to
                    the expenses which ought to be deducted from that revenue for the purposes of
                    ascertaining the net profit made by UOB. Main-Line, which was not confining its
                    claim for profits to the commissions received by UOB, contended that the sum of
                    $3,135,236.40 (<em>ie</em>, the total amount earned from
                    commissions) was the minimum sum that would be accounted for because UOB did not
                    incur any costs in offering and using the FCC System. In the alternative,
                    Main-Line contended that the sum of $1,962,424.30 (<em>ie</em>, the sum derived after applying the income/expense ratios for
                    the financial years in question to the amount of commissions earned) was clearly
                    the minimum sum which was payable to Main-Line.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We were in agreement with UOB that the sum of
                    $3,135,236.40 was not the minimum sum ascertainable (with absolute or reasonable
                    certainty). It would be reasonable to assume, at this stage of the proceedings,
                    that some costs would have been incurred by Main-Line to earn the commissions.
                    For one, cl 5.2 of the MEA indicates that UOB was contractually bound to
                    ensure, at its own cost, that its banking online system was fully compatible and
                    be able to interface with the FCC System, and similarly ensure that the
                    terminals at the merchants’ premises would be fully compatible and be able
                    to interface with UOB’s banking system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As for the alternative sum of $1,962,424.30,
                    UOB contended (and the Judge agreed) that it would be unsafe to rely on the
                    income/expense ratios to conclude that the sum of $1,962,424.30 was the minimum
                    sum ascertainable (see GD at [9]–[12]). This was because Ms Gan’s
                    affidavit was filed for the limited purpose of providing Main-Line with adequate
                    information to make an election – either for an assessment of damages or
                    an account of profits. Second, the income/expense ratios were general in nature,
                    and bore no specific relation to the costs incurred in the operation of the FCC
                    System. Before this court, UOB further contended that the affidavit was filed
                    shortly after the conclusion of the main proceedings, and therefore it was made
                    without the benefit of any detailed computation of the costs
                breakdown.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the reasons set out at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, and as further elaborated below, we
                    were satisfied, with reasonable certainty, that the sum of $1,962,424.30 would
                    be the minimum payable by UOB to Main-Line following an account of profits
                    earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC System. As we saw it, the Judge had
                    placed insufficient weight on the indicative value of the sum of
                    $1,962,424.30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     First, although UOB sought to downplay the
                    relevance of the income/expense ratios which were used by it to generate an
                    indicator of its profit margin, the fact of the matter was that it could not
                    point to any other basis which was likely to give a more accurate figure. As
                    deposed to by Ms Gan, UOB did not maintain a separate record from which a
                    more accurate determination could be made as to the precise net profit of UOB in
                    operating the FCC System (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>–<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). In the
                    absence of evidence pointing to the contrary, it was unlikely that Ms Gan
                    or Mr Cheang would give a figure which would depart substantially from the
                    actual profits earned by UOB. In this regard, we would underscore the fact that
                    the information provided by Ms Gan (which included the total amount of
                    commissions received by UOB and the income/expense ratios) was intended to
                    enable Main-Line to “have a fair basis for making its
                        election”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Although UOB contended that
                    this meant that Ms Gan’s affidavit was filed for a limited and
                    specific purpose, it was clear to us that Ms Gan would not have provided
                    information which would be far from the truth. The court would be entitled to
                    assume that Ms Gan did not set out to mislead Main-Line in order that the
                    latter would not make the right election. On the contrary, it would be fair to
                    infer that the income/expense ratios would give Main-Line a fairly close
                    indication of the true state of affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Second, the burden was on UOB to show that the
                    sum of $1,962,424.30 was not a reasonably ascertained sum due to Main-Line. As
                    earlier stated at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, all the
                    information relating to the commissions earned, and the expenses incurred, in
                    operating the FCC System was within the exclusive possession of UOB. Main-Line
                    would not have any knowledge of these matters. In <em>AIA
                        HC</em> and <em>AIA CA</em>, an insurance company
                    sold certain investment-linked policies to certain investors. Subsequently, the
                    insurance company discovered that it had made a mistake in valuing the funds,
                    and brought an action against the investors for unjust enrichment and
                    conspiracy, alleging that they had knowingly exploited the mistake to their
                    advantage. The investors’ investments were liquidated and held in a joint
                    stakeholder’s account pending the resolution of the suit. The investors
                    then brought an application for interim payment of certain sums of money from
                    the stake, which the High Court granted pursuant to O 29
                        r 12(<em>c</em>). It was not disputed that the
                    capital investment in the stakeholder’s account belonged to the investors.
                    What was uncertain, however, was whether the insurance company had a genuine
                    claim on those moneys. In those circumstances, this court held (<em>AIA CA</em> at [24]) that the burden was on the insurance
                    company to satisfy the court why it should not order interim payment of any sum
                    that was repayable in law to the investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Here, as UOB had conceded that the profits
                    from the commissions were owed by it to Main-Line, and that the sum of
                    $1,962,424.30 was an estimate of the profits earned, the burden would be on UOB
                    to show why that sum did not satisfy the test of reasonable certainty. The mere
                    assertion, without more, that the figure was only an estimate, rather than an
                    exact figure, would not mean that the sum was not a reasonably ascertained sum.
                    As UOB had not maintained distinct records on the breakdown of the expenses
                    incurred in the operation of the FCC System, it was unlikely that UOB would be
                    able to work out those expenses more accurately and there was no indication that
                    UOB would be able to do so with more time (see, also, <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> below). It would be wholly unjust that merely because UOB
                    was unable, or worse still, unwilling, to give a more accurate breakdown of its
                    costs/revenues, Main-Line should be denied its entitlement to interim payment.
                    Looking at the situation objectively, and even assuming that there was no desire
                    on the part of UOB to delay matters, we could not see any reason why Main-Line
                    should suffer on account of the inadequacy of UOB’s own recording system.
                    It seemed to us that it would be entirely just to adopt the figure given by
                    Mr Cheang to be the reasonably certain amount of what would at least be due
                    to Main-Line. The test for determining the amount that should be ordered as
                    interim payment, it should be reiterated, is based on <em>reasonable</em> certainty rather than absolute certainty. Other than
                    stating that the sum of $1,962,424.30 was only an estimate, UOB could not even
                    begin to show why that sum could not be the minimum reasonably ascertainable sum
                    due to Main-Line.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Third, although more than a year had elapsed
                    between the filing of Ms Gan’s affidavit on 6 March 2008 and the
                    filing of Mr Cheang’s affidavit on 2 June 2009, other than
                    taking into certain errors and the income/expense ratio for financial year 2007
                    (following the publication of the UOB’s 2007 annual report) into
                    consideration, which explained the slight difference in the estimated net profit
                    as deposed to by the two of them, UOB was unable to furnish any further
                    information as to how the expenses incurred by it could be better ascertained
                    (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). It was disingenuous of UOB
                    to claim that Main-Line should be denied interim payment on the ground that
                    Main-Line was unable to furnish the court with a more precise profit
                    figure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Fourth, in our opinion, precisely because of
                    the lack of specific breakdowns, it was reasonable to assume that when filing
                    their affidavits, both Ms Gan and Mr Cheang were likely to have offered
                    conservative estimates of the profits earned, in the interest of reducing the
                    risk of over-payment by UOB. It was therefore highly unlikely that the sum of
                    $1,962,424.30 would be substantially greater (if at all) than what would
                    eventually be ascertained to be the amount due to Main-Line following the
                    account of profits inquiry, <em>ie</em>, the actual net
                    profits earned by UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In coming to our decision, we noted that the
                    present case had been ongoing since 2004. Although Main-Line had been successful
                    in the main proceedings, given that discovery applications were still ongoing,
                    and, having regard to the stances taken by Main-Line and UOB, it seemed to us
                    that the taking of accounts, which would also involve an assessment of profits,
                    would likely be of some complexity, and we were not confident that the exercise
                    would be concluded anytime soon. In the meanwhile, all of the profits owed to
                    Main-Line would remain with UOB, unless interim payment was
                awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     UOB also contended that Main-Line had not
                    suffered any hardship because legal costs had already been paid to them.
                    However, we could not see how the payment of legal costs could affect
                    Main-Line’s entitlement to interim payment. This argument was a <em>non sequitur</em>. Instead, we should clarify that while need
                    or prejudice may be the usual basis upon which an interim payment is sought, it
                    does not follow that an applicant for interim payment must show such need or
                    prejudice before an interim order may be made. In <em>Schott Kem
                        Ltd v Bentley and Others</em> [1991] 1 QB 61, Neill LJ said (at
                    74):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not satisfied, however, that there is any restriction implicit in the
                        rules which prevents an interim payment order being made in the absence of
                        evidence of need or prejudice. By the use of the words “if it thinks
                        fit” both rules 11 and 12 confer a discretion on the court
                        whether to order an interim payment at all. Moreover the amount of the
                        payment is expressed to be “of such an amount as [the court] thinks
                        just,” with the additional limitation in the case of damages that the
                        amount is not to exceed “a reasonable proportion of the damages which
                        in the opinion of the court are likely to be recovered by the
                        plaintiff” after taking into account the matters specified. For my
                        part I can see no basis for any further limitation on the jurisdiction of
                        the court to order interim payments other than those set out in Order 29
                        itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would therefore reject the argument that it is necessary for Schott Kem
                        to produce evidence of need or prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We also bore in mind that where liability has
                    already been established, it is generally appropriate and just to make an
                    interim order where there will be some delay until the final disposal of the
                    case (see <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey
                    Pinsler SC gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 29/11/3).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on interim payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the above reasons, it was our view that an
                    interim payment of $1,962,424.30 was appropriate. Parenthetically, we should add
                    that it surprised us that there was no offer at all from UOB of any sum as
                    interim payment when clearly a good part of the commissions should be due to
                    UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Payment into court or to Main-Line</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Since the objectives of interim payments would
                    include mitigating hardship (as in <em>AIA HC</em> and
                        <em>AIA CA</em>), or, as in the present case,
                    preventing a party from being kept out of money owed to it for an extended
                    period of time (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above), an order
                    that payment be made into court would not have served much
                purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     UOB contended that as Main-Line was a foreign
                    party, there was a real risk that UOB might not be able to get back that part of
                    the interim payment which was paid in excess to Main-Line. However, we saw no
                    reason to doubt Main-Line’s ability to make a repayment, if required,
                    pursuant to an order under O 29 r 17 of the Rules. Moreover, for the reason
                    alluded to at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above, there was a
                    minimal likelihood that there would be significant overpayment if an interim
                    payment in the sum of $1,962,424.30 was ordered to be made. We therefore
                    directed that the interim payment be paid to Main-Line instead of into
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the result, we allowed the appeal with the
                    usual consequential orders and ordered UOB pay to Main-Line a sum of
                    $1,962,424.30 as interim payment. As requested by UOB, we gave three weeks for
                    payment to be made.</p>
