</div> The Notice of Objection was disputed by Mitsui, following which, the Sheriff directed that DBS apply to the Court for an order to release the attached debt.

DBS’s objection to the attachment of the monies in the Account stemmed solely from the CAD Order made pursuant to section 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC which it received on 10 January 2023. The CAD Order directed that DBS was not to “<span class="font-italic">allow any dealings with (</span><span class="font-italic">i.e. freeze) the moneys [in the Account] … except with prior instruction of the Police</span>” for the purposes of investigations.

On the other hand, a debt is attachable under O 49 of the ROC 2014 if the debt is “due or accruing due”. Notwithstanding the difference in language, it was not disputed that the law on attachment of debts under the ROC 2021 is in substance the same as the law on garnishee proceedings under ROC 2014. I agreed. In my view, O 22 is merely a simplification of O 49. It seeks to explain what “due or accruing due” has come to mean as case law has developed: <span class="font-italic">Art Ask Agency SL v Person(s) Unknown (“LXS-WL STORE”) </span>[2023] SGHCR 14 at [55].

Put another way, for a debt to be attachable, it is essential that the relationship of creditor and debtor should exist between the enforcement respondent and the non-party: Cavinder Bull S.C.

Until and unless the contingency occurs, there is no obligation between the enforcement respondent and the non-party that can be attached. It is for that reason that contingent debts cannot be garnished under O 49 of the ROC 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As I mentioned at [21] above, the key for a debt to be attachable under O 22 of the ROC 2021 is that there must be a present and existing obligation to pay a sum of money, without which, there is simply nothing to be attached. Accordingly, contingent debts are similarly not attachable under O 22 of the ROC 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 With these principles in mind, I returned to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">A Present Obligation Exists </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 DBS’s position was that the monies in the Account could not be attached because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no longer any property of Neptun in the hands of DBS in view of the CAD Order (i.e. there was no debt due or accruing due or no debt due immediately or at some future date); and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The CAD Order and the ongoing investigations rendered the monies in the Account owed by DBS to Neptun a contingent debt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I disagreed and dealt with each of them in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of the CAD Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Whether there was any property belonging to Neptun in the hands of DBS to be attached depended on the effect of the CAD Order.

If any person such as the account holder wished to deal with the property during this period, he or she must then apply for an order to “release” the property pursuant to ss 35(7) and (8) of the CPC which provide:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(7) A court may – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(a)</span> subsequent to an order of a police officer made under subsection (2); and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(b)</span> on the application of any person who is prevented from dealing with property,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">order the release of the property or any part of the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(8) The court may only order a release of property under subsection (7) if it is satisfied that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(a)</span> such release is necessary for the payment of basic expenses, including any payment for foodstuff, rent, the discharge of a mortgage, medicine, medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums and public utility charges;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(b)</span>  such release is necessary exclusively for – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the payment of reasonable professional fees and the reimbursement of any expenses incurred in connection with the provision of legal services; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) the payment of fees or service charges imposed for the routine holding or maintenance of the property which the person is prevented from dealing in;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(c)</span> such release is necessary for the payment of any extraordinary expenses;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(d)</span> the property is the subject of any judicial, administrative or arbitral lien or judgment, in which case the property may be used to satisfy the lien or judgment, provided that the lien or judgment arose or was entered before the order was made under subsection (2)<span class="font-italic">(b)</span>; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(e)</span> such release is necessary, where the person is a company incorporated in Singapore, for any day-to-day operations of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 On a plain reading of s 35(2) of the CPC, it is clear that the CAD Order merely prohibits the disposal of or dealings with the property in question. The seizure pursuant to s 35(2) of the CPC allows the police to conduct its investigation without fear that the property connected with a suspected offence would be disposed or dealt with. In my view, a seizure under s 35(2) of the CPC is not intended to and does not change the legal or beneficial ownership of the property, or to alter the existing legal relationship between the financial institution and the account holder. It merely prohibits the said property from being disposed of or dealt with temporarily for the duration of the CAD order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 On this note, I found it helpful to refer to the astute observations made by the late Professor Tan Yock Lin, citing s 35 of the CPC and the corresponding provision governing the procedure relating to seizure of property (s 370 of the CPC) in his footnotes, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Possession may also be acquired by distress, execution and as a result of public necessity or for public purposes. Taking by distress for instance is provided as a remedy to a lessor who is owed accrued rent. He may in order to recover the rent in arrears distrain on the goods of his lessee, sell them and pay himself the rent that is owing out of the proceeds of sale. Taking by execution is a common step in the enforcement of a judgment against a defendant. If the judgment debtor will not or cannot satisfy the judgment out of his other funds, the plaintiff may sue out of a writ of seizure and thereby execute judgment against any of the assets of the defendant that he can seize. <span class="font-underline">Taking may also be justified by public necessity or for public purposes. Thus, police officers are empowered to seize property suspected of having been involved in the commission of an offence or of being stolen or appropriated by a thief or criminal appropriator.</span> In some cases, it is not only possession that is authorised but also ownership may be acquired. So it must be determined whether only possession or ownership is acquired and with it, the right to possession. Thus, in the event of a person’s bankruptcy, legal title of ownership vests in his trustee in bankruptcy by operation of law. This is taking of ownership, and not merely possession. <span class="font-underline">But in the case of seizure of objects of a crime by the police, there is a taking only of possession. This taking moreover serv</span><span class="font-underline">es the purposes of criminal investigation and will not justify what is not necessary for those purposes.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis added in underline)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">Personal Property Law </span>(SAL Academy Publishing: 2014) at [03.061])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Given that the effect of the CAD Order is merely to temporarily prohibit the monies in the Account from being disposed of or dealt with and not to alter the existing legal relationship between DBS and Neptun, notwithstanding the CAD Order, the monies in the Account continue to be owned by Neptun (i.e. Neptun and DBS remain in a creditor-debtor relationship). While it would be an offence for the monies in the Account to be paid out while the CAD Order was in force pursuant to s 35(6) of the CPC, as things stood, the monies continued to belong to Neptun and were payable at some point in the future. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Relying on the test that a debt must be an actionable debt for the debt to be attachable (i.e. due or accruing due) as mentioned at [22] above, DBS also argued that there was no actionable debt that Neptun could immediately and effectively sue DBS in view of the CAD Order. DBS referred to <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion </span>(at [23] above) and argued that for there to be a debt accruing due to Neptun, Neptun had to be legally entitled to, and there had to be no ‘legal impediments’ to Neptun’s right to the monies in the Account. DBS’s position was that the CAD Order gave rise to such ‘legal impediments’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I disagreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23] above, a company had entered into certain leveraged foreign exchange and leveraged commodity transactions (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Transactions</span>”) with its customers. The Transactions were all speculative contracts that traded on differences. During the initial stage of the Transactions, the customer would take a position in the market known as the “open position”. As long as the customer’s position remained open, the customer would still be speculating and exposed to movements in the market. If the movement of the underlying currency or reference bullion favoured the customer, the customer would have “Unrealised Profits” corresponding to the value of the open position for that particular day. If the movement of the market was against the customer’s bet, the customer would have “Unrealised Losses”. The customer could choose to close his position, and when he did so, he would no longer be speculating. At that point, his profits or losses from the Transactions would be realised or crystallised. If the position was closed at a profit to the customer, this would give rise to a sum reflected as the “Forward Value” in the customer’s statement. When the position is closed, the company would also issue a trade confirmation stating a “Value Date”. On the “Value Date”, the sum reflected as the “Forward Value” would be credited to the customer’s ledger balance. The customer would then be able to request a withdrawal of a sum amounting to the value of the ledger balance which includes the “Forward Value”. One of the issues that arose was whether the “Forward Value” were sums that were “accruing” to the customers under the Commodity Trading Regulations 2001 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CTR</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Court of Appeal, having considered the various other legal contexts in which the words “accrue” or “accruing due” were used, including the term “debt due or <span class="font-italic">accruing </span><span class="font-italic">due</span>" used in O 49 of the ROC 2014, held that the sums representing the “Forward Value” did accrue to the customers: at [41] and [46]. In doing so, the Court held that sums could be said to be “accruing to” a customer within the meaning of reg 21(1)(a) of the CTR when the customer concerned was <span class="font-italic">legally entitled </span>to the sum in question: at [37]. In this regard, the Court was of the view that for the customer to be <span class="font-italic">lega</span><span class="font-italic">lly entitled </span>to the sum concerned, there must be no ‘legal impediments’ which may put the customer’s legal right to the sum in question (e.g. the sum representing the “Forward Value” had not been eroded by crystallised losses, or the customer had not occasioned some breach of contract): at [46]. The Court was of the view that the customers were <span class="font-italic">legally entitled </span>to the sums representing the “Forward Value” as the underlying transaction had already been closed or concluded. This was notwithstanding the fact that the customers could not withdraw the sums until the “Value Date” had arrived. The Court drew a distinction between the customer’s <span class="font-italic">legal entitlement</span> and the concept of <span class="font-italic">payment</span> and stated at [46] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]e are of the view that the sums that represent the Forward Value do indeed “accru[e] to” the Customers notwithstanding the fact that the Value Date has not yet arrived. This is because, as just stated, the Customers had <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">already </span><span class="font-italic">become legally entitled </span>to the sums that represent the Forward Value, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">notwithstanding </span><span class="font-italic">the fact that they could not withdraw the sums until the Value Date had arrived. </span>With respect, the Judge <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conflated </span>the concept of “accrual” with that of “payment”. “Accrual” within the meaning of the Regulations means that which the customer concerned is <span class="font-italic">legally entitled </span>to and is distinct from the concept of “payment” (as we have noted above at [37]). These are quite different concepts and, in the present context, the former precedes the latter but does not cease to lose its quality (of legal entitlement or “accrual”) simply because the Customers cannot (physically) draw down on or receive the sums that represent the Forward Value until the Value Date has arrived.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis above are the Court’s in <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span>) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the ‘legal impediment’ that the Court in <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span> referred to was the impediment that would extinguish the legal entitlement of a party to the sum of money. It did not refer to the impediment to the ability to (physically) withdraw the sum (i.e. actual payment). In the present case and applying the distinction drawn in <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span>, the effect of the CAD Order merely created an impediment to Neptun’s ability to have the monies paid to it now but it did not extinguish Neptun’s legal entitlement to the monies in the Account. It could well be that Neptun’s legal entitlement might be affected depending on the outcome of any subsequent disposal inquiry or proceedings. However, as things stood, and on the basis of the CAD Order alone, there was nothing that extinguished or altered this legal entitlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Following from the above, I was of the view that the CAD Order in the present case would not preclude Neptun from being able to sue for the return of the monies as the ability to do so concerned Neptun’s legal entitlement, which has not been extinguished by the CAD Order. Having said that, practically speaking, if such proceedings were indeed commenced despite the CAD Order, an application that the proceedings be stayed pending further order would likely be taken out. However, as this was not an issue I had to consider, I did not express any comment on the merits of such an application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Accordingly, I did not accept DBS’s argument that there was no property belonging to Neptun with DBS that was available for attachment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No contingent debt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 DBS’s next argument was that the ongoing investigations rendered the monies in the Account owed by DBS to Neptun a contingent debt. DBS said that the debt was contingent upon (i) the lifting of the CAD Order and/or (ii) the outcome of any disposal inquiry. DBS argued that until and unless those conditions are fulfilled, the debt owed to Neptun had not crystallised especially if it turns out subsequently that the monies are to be paid to third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I disagreed and explain by discussing the cases that have considered the concept of a contingent debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I first discuss <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span>, the facts of which have been set out at [37] above. In that case, another issue that the Court had to consider was whether the “Unrealised Profits” were sums that were “accruing” to the customers under the CTR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Court held that the “Unrealised Profits” were not sums “accruing to” the customers but were contingent debt obligations: <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion </span>at [45]. In arriving at its decision, the Court noted that the Transactions were structured such that, until the customer closes his or her position, any profits that were recorded in the form of “Unrealised Profits” were nothing more than a hypothetical position of what would be the profit if the position had been closed out: <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion </span>at [45]. As long as the customer’s position remained open, the customer was still speculating and it was impossible to tell if he or she would eventually make a profit or a loss: <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion </span>at [45]. Accordingly, until and unless the customer closes out his position, his or her profits would remain uncrystallised (i.e. a contingent debt) and could not be said to have “accrued to” him or her: <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion </span>at [45].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 <span class="font-italic">O’Laughlin</span> was another case which involved a contingent debt. In that case, the first and fifth defendants were ex-spouses and had entered into a consent order in the interim judgment for divorce (“<span class="font-weight-bold">IJ</span>”). The IJ provided <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> that the first defendant’s 30% share in the matrimonial property shall be sold by the first defendant to the fifth defendant. The plaintiffs then filed a garnishee application against the fifth defendant seeking to attach the sum of money that would arise out of the sale of the first defendant’s share in the matrimonial property to the fifth defendant. One of the issues that arose was whether there was an attachable debt arising out of the IJ that could be the subject matter of the garnishee order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Court held that there was no attachable debt as the debt that arose from the IJ was a contingent debt: <span class="font-italic">O’Laughlin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]. The Court was of the view that while the IJ contemplated a sale of the first defendant’s share in the matrimonial property to the fifth defendant, until and unless there is a sale, there was no obligation of payment. Accordingly, the Court discharged the provisional garnishee order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 From the above cases, it is clear that a contingent debt is a debt that has not yet crystallised or come into existence until the contingency happens. Until and unless the contingency happens, there is no obligation for the debtor to pay over the debt. Without an existing obligation, there is nothing that an attachment order can attach to. This is the reason contingent debts are not available for attachment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 However, the present case is different and presents a reverse scenario. Here, a debt is already in existence. While the outcome of any disposal inquiry or other separate proceedings may lead to the monies eventually being paid to someone else, the fact is that an obligation exists <span class="font-italic">now</span> and unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Vintage Bullion</span>, the monies standing in Neptun’s Account are not merely hypothetical.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 A contingent debt is one where the contingency must happen for there to <span class="font-italic">be</span> a debt. It is not one where the contingency happens for there <span class="font-italic">not to be</span> a debt. Until and unless it is determined that the debt is <span class="font-italic">not</span> owed to Neptun, the obligation continues to exist, which remains available for attachment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The impact of DBS’ argument is that when the CAD Order was made, it had the effect of destroying the creditor-debtor relationship which was already in existence between DBS and Neptun. However, for the reasons that I have set out earlier above at [28] to [34] that the CAD Order did not change or alter the creditor-debtor relationship between DBS and Neptun but merely suspended Neptun’s right to dispose of or deal with the monies in the Account, I did not accept DBS’ argument. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Attachment vs Release</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having come to the view that the monies in the Account were available for attachment, I turned to the order sought by Mitsui, which was to hold the attachment in abeyance pending the lifting of the CAD Order and/or the outcome of any potential disposal inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Generally, garnishee or attachment orders are viewed as a single enforcement process. The purpose is to have monies that are owed by third parties to the judgment debtor paid to the judgment creditor instead. However, at a conceptual level, it may be broken down into two stages: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Stage 1: Attachment</span>. This refers to the capture of the obligation that is owed to the judgment debtor. At this stage, the Court considers whether there is a “debt due or accruing due” (under O 49 of the ROC 2014) / debts due “immediately or at some future date or at certain intervals in the future” (under O 22 of the ROC 2021)<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>or if the debt is a “contingent debt”. In other words, at this stage, the Court is concerned with determining whether there is an existing obligation owed to the judgment debtor. If there is, the debt or obligation will be attached.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Stage 2: Release</span>. After the debt has been attached, the monies need to be released. At this stage, the judgment creditor is able to realise the obligation that has been captured or attached into actual monies by having the monies that were attached being paid or released to him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(see <span class="font-italic">Société Eram Shipping Co Ltd v Cie Internationale de Navigation</span> [2004] 1 AC 260 at [62] (cited in <span class="font-italic">O’Laughlin</span><span class="font-italic"> Industries</span> at [18]))</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The distinction between the attachment and release stages finds support in the ROC 2021. In this regard, O 22 r 13 of the ROC 2021 envisages that upon the application of a party liable under any Court order (e.g. the judgment debtor), the Court may make an order maintaining an attachment of a debt while directing the Sheriff not to take further action on the enforcement order and provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for stay of enforcement (O. 22, r. 13)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The party who is liable under any Court order may apply for stay of enforcement or stay of any enforcement order or any part of the order if there is a special case making it inappropriate to enforce the Court order immediately.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The Court may order a stay of enforcement or stay of an enforcement order, for a specified period or until the occurrence of a specified event.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where the Sheriff has seized properties or attached a debt under the enforcement order before the Court orders a stay, the order may give directions to the Sheriff to withdraw the seizure or attachment <span class="font-underline">or to maintain the seizure or attachment without taking further action on the enforcement order</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis added in underline)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55  Clearly, it is possible for an attachment of a debt to be maintained while not being released.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In the present case, I was of the view that the CAD Order affected only the second stage (i.e. the release of the monies). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As discussed at [28] to [51] above, the CAD Order does not render the monies in the Account unattachable. The CAD Order merely prohibited the disposal of or any dealings with the monies which included prohibiting DBS from releasing the monies to Mitsui under the Enforcement Order. While the CAD Order remains in force, the monies may only be released on a court order made pursuant to ss 35(7) and (8) of the CPC. Put simply, while the CAD Order that is in force does not prevent the attachment, the monies cannot be released until a further court order is made.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 DBS referred me to a recent decision of the Magistrates’ Court in <span class="font-italic">Chng Zhun Teck Jackson v Public Prosecutor</span> [2023] SGMC 87 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jackson Chng</span>”) for the proposition that the CAD Order prevents the attachment of debts. In that case, customers of two companies, Tradenation Pte Ltd and Tradeluxury Pte Ltd had obtained default judgment against <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> those two companies. The customers wanted to enforce the judgment against the companies and brought an application for the release of funds that have been seized by the CAD pursuant to section 35(7) and 35(8)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC. The Court dismissed the application and refused to order the release of the seized properties. In doing so and in the context of explaining the differences between a seizure under ss 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the Court made a passing remark that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under both the ROC 2014 and ROC 2021, the judgment creditor (or enforcement applicant) such as the applicants in this case would be able to attach a debt which is due from a non-party – like a financial institution- to the judgment debtor for the amount in the latter’s bank account. This enforcement mechanism would have been available to the judgment creditor but for the order prohibiting disposal under s 35(2)<span class="font-italic">(b)</span>, made after the judgment was obtained. In such a situation, a release may be allowed to avoid undue hardship to the judgment creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my view, this did not assist DBS. <span class="font-italic">Jackson Chng </span>was a case involving an application for the “release” of monies under the CPC. It did not involve garnishee or attachment proceedings and the court most certainly did not have to deal with the issue of whether the debt could be attached. Seen in that context, the court was simply referring to the “enforcement mechanism” at the release stage. Unlike the case of <span class="font-italic">Jackson Chng</span>, Mitsui was not seeking a release of the monies at this stage. Instead, it sought to merely attach the monies that were standing in Neptun’s account with any release to be made only after the CAD Order is lifted or pending the outcome of any disposal inquiry. I see no reason why this cannot be done.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fair and Practical Outcome</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Finally, I was of the view that allowing the attachment to be maintained or held in abeyance would be in line with the Ideals in the ROC 2021. In particular, I was of the view that such an order would achieve a fair and practical outcome that suited the needs of the parties: O 3 r 1(e) of the ROC 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 There was no dispute that Neptun has monies in its account with DBS, and but for the CAD Order, DBS would have been obligated to release the same to Neptun if it decided to withdraw the monies. The CAD Order did not extinguish the debt owed by DBS to Neptun but merely prohibited the release of the monies. Insofar as DBS was concerned, an order allowing attachment pending the lifting of the CAD Order and/or the outcome of any disposal inquiry would achieve the result – to not allow the monies to be released. If it subsequently turns out that the monies do not actually belong to Neptun, there will be nothing for the Enforcement Order to attach to and the monies may be released from attachment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 DBS argued that such an order would put it at risk of having to pay the monies twice – once to third party victims (assuming that a subsequent Court determines that the monies belong to third party victims), and the second to Mitsui as a result of the Enforcement Order which attaches the same set of monies. I disagreed. In view of the CAD Order, conditions could be imposed on the enforcement against the monies in the Account. The conditions would make it clear that the Enforcement Order merely attached to the monies at this point and is subject to <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, further order. If it turns out to be the case that the monies are determined by a subsequent Court to belong to third party victims, the monies can be released from attachment. DBS would not be at risk of having to pay the monies twice or to dip into its own pockets to make the necessary payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 DBS also argued that Mitsui was free to apply for another enforcement order once the investigations are complete and that it is determined by the courts that the monies do belong to Neptun. In my view, that missed the point. While that may be an available and possibly the option with the least resistance, if Mitsui is legally entitled to attach the monies now (which in my view, it was), why should it not do so at this stage? From Mitsui’s perspective, there were good practical reasons for it to attach the monies as soon as possible. For example, while Mitsui could do its best to monitor the outcome of the police investigations or criminal proceedings (if brought), there was always the risk that if the investigations revealed that the monies did belong to Neptun, Neptun knowing that there are judgment creditors coming after it, may instruct DBS to allow it to withdraw all the monies and empty out its bank account. Without an attachment order, DBS would be obligated to honour Neptun’s instructions, leaving Mitsui without recourse. Seen in this light, allowing Mitsui to attach the monies pending investigations and outcome of any criminal proceedings would be the fair and practical outcome for the parties involved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed DBS’s application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, in view of the CAD Order, I ordered that the monies that have been attached shall not be paid by DBS to the Sheriff or Mitsui, until and unless: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the CAD Order has been lifted or has expired; or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the outcome of any disposal inquiry concerning the monies in the Account has been determined, including any appeals therefrom (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Disposal Inquiry Proceedings</span>”), and the Court finds that the monies in the Account are to be paid to Mitsui or Neptun.
