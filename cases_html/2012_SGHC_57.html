        Steven Chong J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case arose from the alleged mismanagement
                    of a company by a director who was also its 20 percent shareholder. There were
                    only two directors at the material times, and the other director owns the
                    balance 80 percent shareholding. This case gives new meaning to the phrase
                    “family-run business”. It is alleged by both directors that each
                    had placed their wives, daughter and son and even a mistress on the
                    company’s payroll even though none of them were ever truthfully employees
                    in the strict sense of the word.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       So what brought about the disharmony which led
                    to this action? In or around March 2009, the minority shareholder informed the
                    majority shareholder that the company needed a bank loan to secure a performance
                    bond for a potential project as the funds of the company were running low and
                    that the company’s expenses had increased. This prompted the majority
                    shareholder to look into the company’s finances as he had always been
                    under the distinct impression that the company’s finances were healthy.
                    Certified public accountants, BDO LLP (“BDO”) were engaged to
                    conduct a forensic examination of the accounts. The investigations eventually
                    exposed many alleged financial misdeeds by the minority shareholder, including
                    the fact that his wife was paid salaries for 17 years, even though she had never
                    reported for work. When the minority shareholder was confronted that his wife
                    was a “<em>phantom</em>” employee who has
                    been receiving salaries from the company without any proper basis, he retorted
                    by alleging that the majority shareholder had likewise placed his wife and even
                    his mistress on the payroll albeit over a shorter period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As the salary payments were made over 17 years,
                    not unexpectedly, limitation of action became a key <em>legal</em> issue in this dispute. In this regard, it is common ground
                    between the parties that if the minority shareholder/director is found to be in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties in causing the company to pay salaries to the
                        “<em>phantom</em>” employee, the claim
                    against him would not be statute barred. However, it is contended by the
                    minority shareholder’s wife who received the salary payments that she
                    would nonetheless be entitled to invoke the limitation defence, notwithstanding
                    that limitation may not be available to her husband. This raises an interesting
                    question of whether there is any rational basis to justify the availability of
                    the limitation defence to an accessory in circumstances when the principal
                    wrongdoer is unable to rely on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff, Panweld Trading Pte Ltd
                    (“Panweld”), is a local private company and is in the business of
                    manufacturing spray painting booths as well as other repair and engineering
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,
                    Yong Kheng Leong (“Mr Yong”), was appointed as a director of
                    Panweld on or around 15 May 1985 and remained so until his resignation on
                    21 May 2009. There is some dispute as to whether he was Panweld’s
                    Managing Director, which he denies<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, but nothing really turns on his
                    disputed status as Managing Director. However, it is not disputed that
                    Mr Yong was at least its General Manager.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant,
                    Lim Ai Cheng (“Mdm Lim”), and the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> defendant, Yong June Meng Gary, are the wife
                    and son of Mr Yong respectively, while the 4<sup>th</sup>
                    defendant, Sanware Engineering Services (“Sanware”), was one of
                    Panweld’s suppliers of spare parts and machinery. All dealings between
                    Sanware and Panweld were conducted through Mr Yong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The third party, Mr Loh Yong Lim
                    (“Mr Loh”), was and still is a director of Panweld and the
                    majority shareholder, who owned 80 percent of the shares in Panweld until
                    December 2001, when he transferred 20 percent of his shareholding to his son,
                    Mr Loh Chiang Tien. Mr Loh’s son was also appointed a director
                    of Panweld in April 2002. The balance 20 percent was and still remains held by
                    Mr Yong. The Third Party claim was brought by Mr Yong against
                    Mr Loh on the basis that if he is found to be liable to Panweld for the
                    salary payments to Mdm Lim, he should be entitled to an
                    indemnity/contribution from Mr Loh because the payments were made with his
                    knowledge and approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Third
                    Party action would logically be a non-starter if I find that Mr Loh was not
                    aware and/or did not approve the salary payments to Mdm Lim. In my view,
                    the Third Party action was ill-advised because if Mr Loh had approved the
                    payments, Mr Yong would not be liable. On the other hand, if there was no
                    approval, there can be no recourse against Mr Loh for any indemnity. In
                    either event, there is no merit in the Third Party action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the course of the trial, the claim against
                    the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendant for the wrongful payment of a
                    month’s salary was sensibly dropped as it only involves a very small sum
                    of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the conclusion of the trial, the claim
                    against Sanware was amicably settled in circumstances which I will elaborate
                    upon below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     When the trial started, Panweld pursued five
                    independent heads of claim against the various defendants. All heads of claim
                    arose from the alleged mismanagement of Panweld by Mr Yong. The largest
                    claim relates to salaries paid to Mdm Lim from 1992 to 2009 amounting to
                    the total sum of $873,959.20. Panweld claims that Mdm Lim was a
                        “<em>phantom</em>” employee and was
                    therefore wrongfully paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The other four claims comprise:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the sum of $226,636 being rental
                        paid by Panweld’s tenant, Sun Power Engineering, which were wrongly
                        credited to Mr Yong’s director’s account with
                        Panweld;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        sum of $178,810.01 being unauthorised expenses claimed and paid to
                        Mr Yong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the sum of $35,238.68 being secret commissions purportedly paid by
                        Mr Yong to Panweld’s customers; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     the sum of $95,261 being the amount which was
                        refunded and received by Mr Yong in respect of inflated invoices raised
                        by Sanware on the instructions of Mr Yong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the close of the trial on 9 February
                    2012, the parties reached a settlement on the above four claims, without
                    admission of liability, on the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     Panweld shall retain the sum of
                        $265,000 which was paid by Mr Yong to Panweld <em>prior</em> to the commencement of the action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Yong withdraws his
                        counterclaim in this action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Yong relinquishes all his rights in respect of
                        the balance sum standing in his director’s account with
                        Panweld;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     as a
                        consequence of the above settlement, Sanware is released from all further
                        liabilities with no order as to costs against Sanware;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     the costs in
                        respect of the four claims shall follow the event of the remaining claim for
                        the salaries paid to Mdm Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Salaries paid to Mdm Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     This decision will therefore only deal with
                    the remaining claim of the salaries which were paid and received by
                    Mdm Lim. It is not in dispute that for 17 years, from 1992 to 2009,
                    Mdm Lim was paid a total sum of $873,959.20 as a “marketing
                    executive” of Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Mdm Lim’s
                    salary payments were duly recorded in Panweld’s monthly payroll records.
                    In addition, payments for Mdm Lim’s Central Provident Fund
                    (“CPF”) contributions were regularly made by Panweld. Further,
                    income tax returns (“IR8A”) were also prepared by Panweld’s
                    accountants, Mr Quek Siew Ping (“Mr Quek”) and his
                    predecessor, the late Mr Michael Loh, on behalf of Mdm Lim in respect
                    of her salaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Panweld claims that Mdm Lim was a
                        “<em>phantom worker</em>” in the sense
                    that she was not an employee of Panweld as she had never reported for work at
                    the office, nor rendered any service to Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Panweld claims that Mr Yong
                    had acted in breach of his fiduciary duty as a director of Panweld in
                    channelling funds belonging to Panweld in the guise of the salary payments to
                        Mdm Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Panweld also claims that, by reason
                    of Mdm Lim’s knowing receipt of the wrongful salary payments and/or
                    dishonest assistance in Mr Yong’s breach, she holds those sums on
                    constructive trust for and on behalf of Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Both Mr Yong and Mdm Lim deny
                    liability on several grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Lim was employed as a
                        marketing executive of Panweld with the knowledge and approval of
                            Mr Loh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mdm Lim had in fact rendered services to
                        Panweld as a marketing executive<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     the bulk of Mdm Lim’s
                        salary was in fact paid from Mr Yong’s salary increments, car
                        allowance and bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     At the close of the trial on 9 February
                    2012, Counsel for Mr Yong and Mdm Lim, Mr Singa Retnam
                    (“Mr Retnam”) accepted that, in the event that the salary
                    payments are found to have been paid in breach of Mr Yong’s fiduciary
                    duties, the claims against Mr Yong would not be barred by the Limitation
                    Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Limitation Act”). This
                    is certainly the correct position to take, as will be elaborated upon later.
                    However, Mr Retnam argued that even if Mr Yong is found to have acted
                    in breach of his fiduciary duties, Mdm Lim is nonetheless entitled to avail
                    herself of the defence of limitation under s 6 of the Limitation Act,
                        <em>ie</em>, even if Mdm Lim is found to be liable
                    to account as a constructive trustee, time had begun to run against Panweld from
                    the dates of each payment and, consequently, the bulk of the claim against her
                    is time barred, except for the last six years preceding the commencement of this
                    action from 2004 to 2009. In this connection, it is agreed by both parties that
                    if Mdm Lim is found not to fall within s 22(1) of the Limitation Act,
                    the recoverable amount would be restricted to $338,410 instead of
                    $873,959.20.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evolving defences raised by Mr Yong and
                Mdm Lim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It is perhaps apposite to commence this
                    inquiry by first examining the pleaded defence of Mr Yong and Mdm Lim
                    and to see how it has evolved over time. It is pertinent to highlight that the
                    defence, which was jointly filed by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim, underwent
                    several changes. When the defence was first filed on 11 March 2010,
                    Mr Yong claimed that Mr Loh had placed his wife
                    (“Mrs Loh”) and mistress (“Sook Min”) on the
                    payroll in March 1995, even though neither of them were employees of Panweld in
                    any meaningful way.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> When Mr Yong expressed
                    concern over the employment of Mrs Loh and Sook Min, Mr Loh suggested
                    that Mdm Lim be included in the payroll as well in 1995.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore the essence of the original defence was that Mdm Lim was included
                    in Panweld’s payroll <em>at the suggestion</em> of
                    Mr Loh, in reaction to Mr Yong’s concern over the employment
                    status of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. I shall refer to this as the
                    “reaction theory”. For ease of reference, I shall refer to
                    Mdm Lim, Mrs Loh and Sook Min as “the three wives”
                    collectively. Implicit in this defence is that all three wives were placed on
                    the payroll even though they were not required to render any service to
                    Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     However, this defence morphed when it was
                    amended on 13 April 2011. Mr Yong claimed that Mdm Lim was
                        <em>genuinely</em> employed on a temporary basis to
                    assist him in Panweld from 1992 to 1994, and thereafter, from 1995 on a
                    full-time basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> It is apparent that by this
                    amendment, Mr Yong had effectively abandoned the original “reaction
                    theory” given that he accepts that Mdm Lim was placed on the payroll
                    albeit on a “temporary basis” from 1992, well <em>before</em> Mrs Loh and Sook Min in 1995. It did not escape my
                    attention that the defence was amended some time <em>after</em> Panweld’s Reply denying the alleged agreement and
                    highlighting the fact that Mrs Loh and Sook Min were only placed on the
                    payroll long <em>after</em> Mdm Lim had started
                    receiving salary payments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defence underwent a further change on
                    26 May 2011. For the first time, Mr Yong alleged that the employment
                    of Mrs Loh and Sook Min was to reduce taxes payable by Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Mr Yong now claims that
                    Mdm Lim’s part-time salary from 1992 to 1994 was paid from
                    Mr Yong’s bonuses and unused annual leave pay and that her full-time
                    salary comprised of three components, one being her fixed salary of $1,125, the
                    second being the transfer of Mr Yong’s car allowance of $1,000 and
                    the balance from Mr Yong’s annual increments and/or
                        bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Mr Yong alleged that
                    Mdm Lim’s fixed salary component of $1,125 was derived from 25
                    percent of the collective salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. The underlying
                    rationale for the fixed component of $1,125 was that based on
                    Mr Yong’s 20 percent shareholding in Panweld, Mdm Lim should
                    therefore be paid 20 percent of the salaries paid to Mr Loh’s wife
                    and mistress (20 percent of Mr Loh’s 80 percent).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is therefore apparent that
                    Mr Yong’s and Mdm Lim’s defence to a rather
                    straightforward claim had undergone several inexplicable amendments. The pleaded
                    defence, even in its final form, is confusing and bizarre:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     It claims that Mdm Lim was
                        employed on a <em>part-time</em> basis from 1992 to
                        1994 with the approval of Mr Loh but her salary was in fact paid from
                        Mr Yong’s bonuses. In other words, she worked for <em>free</em> as far as Panweld was concerned in that the
                        financial burden of Mdm Lim’s salary was borne by Mr Yong
                        and not by Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     More than a year later, the defence was amended to claim that
                        Mdm Lim’s salary was made up of three components, a point which
                        was not previously raised. Apart from the fixed component of $1,125, the
                        balance was in fact paid from Mr Yong’s car allowance and
                        bonuses. In other words, he continued to bear the bulk of the financial
                        burden in employing Mdm Lim <em>full-time</em> for
                        Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        convoluted components to make up Mdm Lim’s elaborate salary
                        structure do not lend credence to her employment status as an ordinary
                        “marketing executive”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In all the different versions of the defence,
                    the common denominator is that the employment of Mdm Lim was with the
                    express approval of Mr Loh. This is the principal <em>factual</em> issue before me. This was flatly denied by
                        Mr Loh.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Before examining the evidence as
                    to whether Mr Loh had in fact approved Mdm Lim’s employment, it
                    is important to explain the relevance of Mr Loh’s approval in the
                    context of Mdm Lim’s employment. It is necessary to first state at
                    the outset that there is no requirement in law that the employment of an
                    employee such as a marketing executive must be approved by the board of
                    directors or by all the shareholders. This is a matter typically decided by the
                    person or persons vested with the management of the company, such as a managing
                    director or general manager. It was admitted by Mr Loh in his Affidavit of
                    Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) that Mr Yong was “in charge
                    of and made all key decisions and exercised full authority and control over the
                    hiring of [Panweld’s] employees”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Whether Mr Yong had acted in breach of
                    his fiduciary duties would depend on the court’s determination of whether
                    Mdm Lim was paid a salary, even though she neither reported for work nor
                    performed any service for Panweld over the extended period when she was on the
                    payroll. If I find that Mdm Lim was not an employee of Panweld in any
                    meaningful sense of the word, it would follow that Mr Yong would have acted
                    in breach of his fiduciary duties in causing Panweld to pay Mdm Lim’s
                    salary for 17 years. On the other hand, if I find that Mdm Lim had in fact
                    provided services to Panweld as a “marketing executive”, the
                    absence of Mr Loh’s approval, even if proved, becomes moot. However,
                    if I find otherwise, then Mr Loh’s approval would be relevant to
                    establish that the salary payments to Mdm Lim were regularly made by
                    Panweld with the approval of all shareholders (comprising Mr Yong and
                    Mr Loh), even though she may not in truth be an employee, or that the
                    breach by Mr Yong had been waived or “barred by acquiescence”
                    as pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was Mdm Lim really an employee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It must be borne in mind that it is the
                    current pleaded defence that Mdm Lim had <em>in
                        fact</em> performed services as a “marketing executive”
                    to Panweld. It has not been suggested that she was entitled to receive the
                    remuneration <em>solely</em> because she was listed as an
                    employee on Panweld’s payroll. This defence in itself contradicts the
                    original defence that all three wives were to be paid even though they were not
                    really employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In her AEIC, Mdm Lim describes her work
                    in Panweld as conducting surveys and market research of the prices of goods sold
                    by competitors, sourcing for new products and performing duties as
                    Mr Yong’s personal assistant including typing and filing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    Mdm Lim also claims that she had accompanied Mr Yong to meet
                    Panweld’s customers both during and after office hours.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Her evidence as to the nature and
                    scope of her work in Panweld was very general and when probed for supporting
                    documents such as survey reports, brochures and catalogues for the new products
                    to establish her alleged nature of work, she was unable to produce
                        any.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> When asked what new products she
                    had introduced to Panweld, Mdm Lim initially referred to spray painting
                        equipment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> However, when she
                    was reminded that spray painting equipment was already an <em>existing</em> business, she had to concede that she did not introduce
                    any <em>new</em> product to Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Two employees of Panweld, Mr Quek and
                    Ms Choong Shu Fong (“Ms Choong”), testified that they
                    had never seen Mdm Lim in Panweld’s office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Given that Mr Quek
                    and Ms Choong had been working in Panweld since the early 1990s, the
                    likelihood of them not seeing her working in the office throughout her alleged
                    17 years of service in Panweld was highly improbable if she had in fact worked
                    in the office. When Mdm Lim was cross-examined on whether anyone in Panweld
                    had ever seen her doing typing and filing work, she accepted that no one had
                    seen her in Panweld’s office as she was always “<em>locked in [Mr Yong’s] office</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Mdm Lim added that she had
                    regularly visited Panweld’s office on Saturdays, Sundays and public
                    holidays and she further claimed rather incredulously that when she visited the
                    office during working days, none of the staff ever saw her in the office for 17
                    years although she claimed to have seen the staff members from inside the locked
                    office of Mr Yong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In re-examination, when
                    Mdm Lim was asked to identify a staff of Panweld whom she had met on
                    Panweld premises, she could only name one Mr Sunny Ong of Sun Power
                    Engineering who happened to be a tenant and not an employee of
                        Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> He apparently met
                    Mdm Lim at Panweld’s premises on a weekend in the context of inviting
                    Mdm Lim to his daughter’s wedding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This could hardly constitute
                    evidence that she was “working” in Panweld’s office on
                    weekends, as she alleged. It was only when she was reminded that Mr Sunny
                    Ong was not a staff of Panweld when she said she also recalled meeting
                    Ms Choong, Mr Loh and one Alice in the office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Mdm Lim was unable to call any
                        <em>independent</em> witness to corroborate her
                    employment status in Panweld even though she claims to have worked in Panweld
                    for 17 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     When she was asked in re-examination to name
                    some of Panweld’s competitors in relation to her evidence that her job
                    scope involved market research of the prices of goods sold by Panweld’s
                    competitors, she rattled off a few names without explaining their
                        relevance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Astonishingly, she identified
                    Singapore Airlines as one of Panweld’s competitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> It seems to me that she was merely
                    repeating names, which she had memorised without understanding their
                    significance. I found her testimony about her alleged employment status and the
                    nature of her alleged work to be entirely unsatisfactory and wholly unreliable.
                    It should not be overlooked that Mr Yong claims that his wife was hired in
                    1992 because he had difficulty finding suitable secretarial
                        assistance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> If this was so, then there can be
                    no conceivable or acceptable explanation for such a peculiar working
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Lim’s salary structure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The fact that Mdm Lim could not have been
                    a legitimate employee becomes even clearer when Mr Yong’s and
                    Mdm Lim’s evidence on the determination of her salary is carefully
                    scrutinised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mdm Lim claims to have commenced her
                    part-time work in 1992.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> It is
                    perhaps helpful to begin this analysis by reviewing the circumstances of
                    Mdm Lim’s first “<em>pay
                    cheque</em>”. Her salary payment for 1992 can be traced to a
                    handwritten document dated 13 May 1992 wherein Mr Yong gratuitously
                    declared for himself leave pay of $20,000, of which $15,000 was to be paid to
                    Mdm Lim for her monthly salary of $3,000 from April to June, and sales
                    commission ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 for the same period.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This payment of $15,000 to
                    Mdm Lim was in fact reflected in the May 1992 payroll record. Given that
                    Mr Yong’s monthly salary at that time was only $4,500, leave pay of
                    $20,000 would have been equivalent to about 4.5 months of leave. There is no
                    evidence before the court that he had accumulated or was entitled to such a
                    generous leave when he declared the leave pay for himself. It is also extremely
                    odd for a part-time employee to be paid in a lump sum for three months’
                    work in arrears. Further, there is no material to suggest that Mdm Lim had
                    done any sales to justify any commission payments. Such an unusual pay
                    arrangement leads me to the irresistible conclusion that she could not have been
                    a <em>bona fide</em> employee of Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As stated earlier in <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, Mdm Lim claims that her part-time salary was in
                    fact paid by Mr Yong from his unused leave and bonuses. From 1995 to 2009,
                    she was paid on a full-time basis and her salary curiously changed to
                    incorporate three components, one being the fixed component of $1,125 and the
                    balance being transferred from Mr Yong’s bonuses and his alleged car
                    allowance of $1,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> I shall refer to this as the
                    “transfer salary” theory. The immediate observation I make about
                    this rather bizarre salary arrangement is that if Mdm Lim was in fact
                    performing proper services as an employee of Panweld, there could be no
                    legitimate reason why part or all of her part-time salary should be funded by
                    her husband, Mr Yong, instead of Panweld. In addition, it would be a
                    misnomer to describe her “employment history” as <em>part-time</em> from 1992 to 1995 and thereafter <em>full-time</em> from 1995 to 2009, given that she was never
                    seen in the office by any staff member of Panweld throughout the 17 years. In my
                    view, this is a wholly contrived explanation in a hopeless attempt to disguise
                    the fact that Mdm Lim was never truthfully an employee of Panweld. In her
                    AEIC, Mdm Lim made her case even more unconvincing by alleging that her
                    “salary was being paid from [Mr Yong’s] salary and there was
                    no loss to [Panweld]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. In cross-examination, she
                    clarified that she meant to say that her entire salary over the years was paid
                    from Mr Yong’s bonuses and unused leave.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> She was in effect saying that she was
                    employed by Mr Yong at his own expense. Such an arrangement runs entirely
                    contrary to her alleged <em>bona fide</em> employment by
                    Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     One of the building blocks of the
                    “transfer salary” theory is that Mr Yong was entitled to a
                    monthly car allowance of $1,000 which he had unselfishly transferred to
                    Mdm Lim to make up for her “<em>low
                        pay</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> However, in his own AEIC, he
                    claimed, in the context of justifying his car related expenses, that he did not
                    receive any car allowance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> Mr Yong’s alleged car
                    allowance was also never stated in any of the payroll records of Panweld.
                    Further, the “transfer salary” theory is at best a <em>zero sum game</em>. If it was transferred from Mr Yong
                    to Mdm Lim, such transfer should be evidenced by a corresponding decrease
                    in his remuneration. According to Mr Yong, this “transfer
                    salary” started in 1995. However, both the payroll and
                    CPF contributions records for Mr Yong’s 1995 income do not show
                    any corresponding decrease of $1,000 from his monthly salary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Yong had to concede that the payroll
                    records of Panweld also do not reflect his car allowance
                        entitlement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> When challenged in
                    cross-examination, Mr Yong changed his evidence and claimed that the $1,000
                    was paid for his “productivity bonus” instead of car
                        allowance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As explained in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, the fixed component of $1,125 was allegedly based on
                    25 percent of the combined salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min. Mrs Loh
                    was paid $2,500 while Sook Min was paid $2,000. If this was the arrangement, it
                    would have been implemented from day one, and not three years after the
                    commencement of Mdm Lim’s alleged part-time employment. This could
                    not have been the arrangement from inception simply because the commencement
                    dates for their respective employment were different. That was precisely the
                    reason why Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim had to concoct this fallacious wage
                    computation (introduced by way of a further amendment to the defence) to fit in
                    with Mdm Lim’s actual salary payments over the years. Further, as
                    rightly pointed out by Counsel for Panweld, Mr Foo Maw Shen
                    (“Mr Foo”), the conduct of Mr Yong and Mdm Lim
                    belies any such agreement because Mdm Lim continued to receive this fixed
                    component up to the time she stopped receiving salary in 2009, even though Sook
                    Min and Mrs Loh had ceased receiving salaries from Panweld since 1999 and
                    2003 respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> If there was indeed such an
                    agreement to benchmark Mdm Lim’s salary, the fixed component, being
                    25 percent of the combined salaries of Mrs Loh and Sook Min, would have
                    commensurately decreased. But this did not happen. There is some dispute over
                    whether Mrs Loh continued to receive her salary after 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> This will be dealt with
                    below, but even if this is correct, it still does not add up because there is no
                    dispute that Sook Min had ceased receiving any salary after 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr Foo further submitted that there is no
                    truth that Mdm Lim’s balance salary was funded from
                    Mr Yong’s bonuses. He drew the court’s attention to the fact
                    that according to the IR8A forms submitted by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim,
                    both of them were paid not insignificant bonuses for the years 1995, 1996, 1997,
                    2000, 2001, 2006 and 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Specifically, Mr Foo
                    cross-examined Mr Yong on the minutes of the Annual General Meeting
                    (“AGM”) of Panweld for 2007 and 2008 in which the total
                    remuneration of Mr Yong was declared.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Mr Yong could not provide any
                    reasonable explanation as to why his declared incomes for income tax purposes
                    for 2007 and 2008 were higher than the amounts approved at the AGM other than to
                    allege that the AGM minutes were not accurate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> He, however, conceded that he could
                    not produce any evidence to show that he was in fact entitled to receive more
                    remuneration than that stipulated in the AGM minutes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> If so, how could there have been
                    any transfer? He was already paid more than his entitlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In his AEIC, Mr Loh stated that in
                    contrast to his constant base salary of $2,000 from 1996 to 2009,
                    Mr Yong’s salary increased from $6,700 (as of 1998) to $9,500
                    (as of 2008).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Mr Retnam relied on
                    Mr Loh’s AEIC to support the transfer salary theory since
                    Mr Yong only received $7,000 in 2009. Consequently, he argued, the
                    difference of $2,500 must have been transferred to Mdm Lim as part of her
                        salary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> It was not
                    clear to me how Mr Loh derived Mr Yong’s 2008 monthly salary as
                    $9,500. It was unfortunate that it was not put to Mr Loh that the balance
                    $2,500 would therefore have been transferred to Mdm Lim. In any event,
                    Mr Yong’s salary at $9,500 does not gel with the 2007 and 2008 AGM
                    minutes, which approved Mr Yong’s annual salary as $82,816 and
                    $89,074 respectively. If, in fact, Mr Yong’s monthly salary was
                    $9,500 as at 2008, his annual salary would be at least $114,000. The
                    evidence does not support such a sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In the premises, I find that there is no truth
                    whatsoever in any transfer of Mr Yong’s bonuses, salary increments or
                    car allowance to make up Mdm Lim’s monthly salary payments. In fact,
                    the evidence is to the contrary. This finding is in addition to the inherent
                    absurdity of the transfer salary theory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of fiduciary duties, knowing receipt and dishonest
                assistance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It was accepted that Mr Yong owed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the following duties to
                    Panweld:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a duty to act in the best interest of the
                            company; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a duty to use his powers for a proper
                            purpose.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Given my finding that Mdm Lim was paid
                    salaries over 17 years even though she was never <em>in
                        truth</em> an employee of Panweld, it cannot seriously be disputed
                    that Mr Yong, in causing the salaries to be paid to her under these
                    circumstances, had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to
                Panweld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It follows from my primary finding that
                    Mdm Lim could not have had any expectation to receive the monthly salaries
                    from Panweld over the 17 years. The payments were made to her bank account.
                    She would have known that she was not a legitimate employee of Panweld and that
                    the only reason she has been receiving the salaries was because her husband,
                    Mr Yong, had wrongfully caused Panweld to make the payments to her without
                    any proper basis. On this basis, I find that liability based on knowing receipt
                    has been made out, since there was (a) a disposal of Panweld’s assets
                    in breach of Mr Yong’s fiduciary duty; (b) beneficial receipt by
                    Mdm Lim of assets which are traceable as representing Panweld’s
                    assets; and (c) knowledge on Mdm Lim’s part that the assets she
                    received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty. See <em>George Raymond Zage III and anor v Ho Chi Kwong and anor</em>
                    [2010] SGCA 4; [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<em>George Raymond Zage III</em>”) at [23].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Panweld also argued that Mdm Lim
                    facilitated Mr Yong’s breach of duty by acting as a convenient
                    conduit through which Mr Yong could siphon money out of Panweld with
                        impunity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> Based on my findings, the claim
                    based on dishonest assistance has also been made out given that
                    (a) Mr Yong, as Panweld’s director, was trustee <em>vis-a-vis</em> Panweld’s assets; (b) Mr Yong
                    breached such trust when he misapplied monies belonging to Panweld;
                    (c) Mdm Lim facilitated Mr Yong’s breach by allowing her
                    bank account to be used for such purposes; and (d) dishonesty on
                    Mdm Lim’s part in that she knew full well that she was not entitled
                    to the salaries paid to her over 17 years. See <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, Vol <em>9(2)</em> (LexisNexis, 2003) (“<em>Halsbury’s </em><em>Vol 9(2)</em>”) at [110.588] and <em>George
                        Raymond Zage III</em> at [20].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Approval by Mr Loh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As I have explained in <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above, the question of Mr Loh’s
                    approval becomes relevant for consideration if I find, as I have, that
                    Mr Yong had breached his fiduciary duties in causing Mdm Lim to be
                    paid salaries over 17 years, even though she did not perform any meaningful
                    service as an employee of Panweld. At the material time (the relevant date being
                    1992 or 1995 when the alleged agreement was reached), there were only two
                    shareholders and two directors of Panweld, <em>ie</em>,
                    Mr Loh (80 percent) and Mr Yong (20 percent). Mr Loh’s
                    approval <em>in his capacity as shareholder</em> of Panweld
                    is relevant on two fronts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">shareholders may by resolution <em>prospectively</em> release Mr Yong from his fiduciary
                            duty; and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">shareholders may by resolution <em>retrospectively exonerate</em> Mr Yong from the
                            consequences of his breach of duty.</div>

                            (2010 Reissue) (“Halsbury’s </em><em>Vol 6”)</em> at [70.275].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In this regard, it is not disputed that no
                    shareholders’ resolution was ever passed to approve the salary payments to
                    Mdm Lim. However, the lack of such a resolution would not be fatal if all
                    the shareholders, <em>ie</em>, Mr Yong and
                    Mr Loh, had in fact assented to a particular course of action which a
                    general meeting of Panweld could have carried into effect. In such a case, the
                    assent is as binding as a resolution of the shareholders would be. See <em>Halsbury’s </em><em>Vol 6</em> at [70.203], <em>Jimat bin Awang and

                        (“<em>Duomatic</em>”). This principle
                    applies even if assent was given by different parties at different times. See
                        <em>Tayplan Limited (in Administration) v Alan Smith and Lee

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To the extent that these expenses are not reasonably incidental to the

                        company could carry into effect, the assent was as binding as a resolution

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Both counsel were <em>ad
                        idem</em> that the <em>Duomatic</em> principle
                    would apply if Mr Loh had in fact approved the salary payments to
                    Mdm Lim. However during oral closing submissions, Mr Retnam further
                    submitted that the <em>Duomatic</em> principle would also
                    apply even if Mr Loh was not aware of the salary payments since
                    Panweld’s accountant, Mr Quek, was fully aware at all material times.
                    I disagree. First, as a matter of pleadings, Mr Yong’s original
                    defence was that the payments were approved by Mr Loh. It was subsequently
                    amended on 13 May 2011 to state that the payments were <em>also</em> approved by Mr Quek. There is, however, no alternative
                    case that the payments were proper <em>even if</em>
                    Mr Loh had not approved them on the premise that Mr Quek was aware of
                    the same. Secondly, as a matter of law, the <em>Duomatic</em> principle is intended to regularise acts or payments on
                    the basis that a shareholders’ resolution would have been passed to
                    approve the acts or payments in question had it been tabled. It therefore has no
                    application if Mr Loh, as the majority shareholder, was unaware and would
                    not have approved the payments. For this reason, the fact that Mr Quek had
                    all along prepared the IR8A forms for Mdm Lim and had arranged for the
                    payment of her CPF contributions based on Mdm Lim’s salaries does not
                    change the position in law. The income tax declarations and CPF contributions
                    were merely acts carried out <em>in furtherance
                        </em><em>of</em> the salary payments to
                    Mdm Lim. Such acts do not translate into consent or approval by Mr Loh
                    if none otherwise existed. That is a separate and independent inquiry that I
                    will address below. If Mr Retnam is right in his alternative submission, it
                    would follow that a breach of fiduciary duty by a director can be
                    “cured” because another employee of the company was aware of it.
                    That cannot be right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I should add that the mere fact that Panweld
                    might have been managed like a family-run business, in the usual sense of the
                    phrase, should not make a difference. As was observed in <em>Tayplan</em> at [24]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This therefore was a family enterprise from which, had it remained
                        solvent, the family, and only the family, would have been likely to benefit,
                        the benefit being distributed in such way as the individual family members
                        wished. However, the vehicle through which this family chose to conduct its
                        business was a registered company. That brought with it certain advantages,
                        most notably the incorporation of a company with a personality distinct from
                        its members and consequently limited liability, but also the requirement to
                        observe certain disciplines designed to protect not only the members but
                        also those who dealt with the company. The Lord Ordinary found that the
                        defenders, as directors and company secretary, and therefore the persons
                        responsible, did not observe these disciplines. In contravention of section
                        221 of the Companies Act 1985 [similar to s 199 of the Singapore
                        Companies Act (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev Ed)], they failed to keep sufficient
                        accounting records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In any event, there is no dispute that the
                    burden to establish Mr Loh’s knowledge and approval rests with
                    Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim. I begin by examining the pleaded defence as
                    regards this alleged approval. When the defence was first pleaded, Mr Yong
                    claimed that Mr Loh agreed to place Mdm Lim on the payroll in
                        <em>reaction</em> to Mr Yong’s concern over
                    Mrs Loh’s and Sook Min’s employment in Panweld. Although this
                    has since been amended, I have noted that there is no truth whatsoever in the
                    “reaction theory” because Mdm Lim was placed on the payroll
                    in 1992, long before Mrs Loh and Sook Min in 1995. If such an agreement had
                    been reached, they would all have been placed on the payroll <em>together</em> in 1992. This point was alluded to by Panweld in its
                    Reply filed on 25 March 2010, which led to the amendment to the defence
                        <em>a year later</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     During the investigations by BDO in October
                    2009, prior to the commencement of the action, Mr Yong had provided his own
                    handwritten note to BDO stating that “Mr Loh [had] employed his wife
                    and his girlfriend in 1995 without [his] knowledge”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Clearly, the essence of any
                    agreement must necessarily entail both Mr Yong’s and
                    Mr Loh’s knowledge of the salary arrangements of the three wives. In
                    cross-examination, Mr Yong could not provide any explanation for his
                    contradictory stance other than to say that he might have written it down
                    wrongly on the handwritten note.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In his amended defence, Mr Yong claims
                    that the payment of the three wives’ salaries was to reduce the tax burden
                    of Panweld. However, in cross-examination, he again shifted his position, saying
                    that it was instead to lighten his <em>own</em> tax
                        liability.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Finally, when Mr Yong was first
                    confronted by Mr Loh on or about 25 June 2009 about
                    Mdm Lim’s salary payments, the transcript of the taped recorded
                    conversation appears to suggest that Mr Yong was informing Mr Loh for
                    the first time. In response, Mr Loh told Mr Yong “[t]hat I
                    don’t know <em>lah</em>”. Conspicuously,
                    Mr Yong did not claim that Mr Loh was aware of the payments all along
                    and had in fact approved them. This is in fact consistent with
                    Mr Yong’s own position that he was not aware of the salary payments
                    to Mrs Loh and Sook Min. For the above reasons, I find that Mr Yong
                    has failed to discharge the onus of proving that Mr Loh was aware and had
                    approved the salary payments to Mdm Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It leaves me now to consider the points raised
                    by Mr Yong and Mdm Lim that the salary payments were properly approved
                    by Mr Loh. As a starting point, Mr Yong relied on the salary payments
                    to Mrs Loh and Sook Min.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> However, it is essential to
                    bear in mind that the reliance on the salary payments to Mrs Loh and Sook
                    Min is to support the alleged agreement. It is not their defence that
                    Mdm Lim was entitled to be paid merely because Mrs Loh and Sook Min
                    were likewise receiving salaries. For the reasons set out in <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> to <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>
                    above, I have determined that Mr Yong has failed to prove the alleged
                    agreement. Further, the comparison of the flexible working arrangements of
                    Mrs Loh and Sook Min with that of Mdm Lim is not particularly helpful
                    because that does not address the issue of whether such an agreement existed or
                    whether Mdm Lim was in truth an employee. In the course of the proceedings,
                    I had observed, on a number of occasions, to both counsel that “two
                    wrongs do not make a right”. It may well be that the payments to
                    Mrs Loh and Sook Min were not proper either. Although that issue is
                    strictly not before me, Mr Foo had informed the court that Mr Loh is
                    prepared to refund the salaries paid to Mrs Loh and Sook Min if ordered to
                    do so by the court. I do not believe this is the correct forum for me to make
                    such an order of refund, particularly since neither Mr Yong nor
                    Mdm Lim had made any such submission on the matter. They could not make
                    such a submission before me since it would undermine their defence based on the
                    alleged agreement. That is a separate matter for Mr Yong, as 20 percent
                    shareholder of Panweld, to take up if he is so advised. However, for
                    completeness, I should add that evidence was adduced in court that, unlike
                    Mdm Lim, staff members of Panweld had seen Mrs Loh and Sook Min on
                    Panweld’s office premises.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Further, both Mrs Loh and
                    Sook Min testified that they did some administrative and secretarial work in the
                    office and translation work for Mr Loh during meetings with Panweld’s
                        customers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>
                    I do not accept that the three wives were employees of Panweld in any meaningful
                    sense of the word. The distinctions highlighted by Mr Foo as regards the
                    nature of the work performed by Mrs Loh and Sook Min are not significant
                    enough for me to arrive at a different conclusion from that reached with regard
                    to Mdm Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Mr Retnam relied on various documents to
                    establish that Mr Loh was aware of the salary payments to Mdm Lim.
                    First, Mr Retnam referred to Panweld’s monthly payroll records.
                    However, there is no evidence that Mr Loh had ever examined the payroll
                    records of Panweld. In fact, according to the evidence of Mr Yong, he too
                    claimed that he had never reviewed the payroll records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Obviously, if Mr Yong,
                    who was managing Panweld, whether as Managing Director or General Manager, had
                    never seen the payroll records, it is not at all surprising for Mr Loh as
                    the inactive director not to have read them. As regards the monthly management
                    accounts, although Mr Loh would have been provided with copies, it does not
                    advance the defence since the accounts on their face do not disclose the names
                    of the employees on the payroll.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The only document which Mr Yong was able
                    to identify, which could <em>possibly</em> point to
                    Mr Loh’s knowledge of the salary payments, was a handwritten monthly
                    account dated 12 March 1998 (“the account”) prepared by
                    Mr Quek. Mr Retnam cited Mr Quek’s testimony during
                    cross-examination to suggest that the account was provided to the
                    “directors”, <em>ie</em>, both Mr Yong
                    and Mr Loh. The account stated, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    “[directors’] wives salaries (3 persons)”. In order to
                    fully understand the evidence of Mr Quek in its proper context, it is
                    necessary to set out his testimony on this point in its entirety<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     From the above transcript, it is clear to me
                    that the account was prepared at the behest of Mr Yong. When Mr Quek
                    agreed with Mr Retnam that the account was provided to the <em>directors</em> (in plural), it appeared to me that
                    Mr Quek did not appreciate that the question was expressed in plural. In
                    any event, Mr Retnam did not clarify with Mr Quek that he was also
                    referring to Mr Loh when he agreed that the account was provided to the
                        “<em>directors”</em>, given his earlier
                    answer that it was prepared for Mr Yong. This was, however, clarified by
                    Mr Quek in re-examination when he confirmed that the account was <em>only</em> provided to Mr Yong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> I
                    accept Mr Quek’s evidence that the account was not provided to
                    Mr Loh. I should add that it is odd that Mr Yong, having trawled
                    through the voluminous documents disclosed in this action, was only able to
                    identify one solitary document, the account, in his somewhat desperate attempt
                    to pin knowledge and approval on Mr Loh. I say this is odd because the
                    salary payments to Mdm Lim were made over 17 years and yet he was only at
                    best able to point to one document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Next, although Mr Loh claimed that
                    Mrs Loh had stopped receiving salary from Panweld since 2003,
                    Mr Retnam explained that this was contradicted by Panweld’s balance
                    sheet from 1 July 2007 to 31 October 2007 (“2007 balance
                    sheet”) which showed that Mrs Loh continued to receive salary of
                    $2,500 as at October 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> Her salary was credited to
                    Mr Loh’s director’s account with Panweld. The fact that
                    Mr Loh’s director’s account was credited with a monthly sum of
                    $2,500 was not disputed. In fact, it was accepted by Mr Foo that the $2,500
                    monthly credits to Mr Loh’s director’s account were made from
                    at least January 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Quek, in explaining the status of the
                    directors’ accounts in response to Mr Yong’s queries, had
                    provided some handwritten remarks on the 2007 balance sheet that $2,500 was
                    credited into Mr Loh’s director’s account representing
                    Mrs Loh’s salary. Mr Quek admitted that the handwritten remarks
                    were indeed his but claimed that he was forced by Mr Yong to deliberately
                    falsify the entry as representing Mrs Loh’s salary when it was
                    actually reimbursement for Mr Loh’s China expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> I
                    did not believe his explanation. There was no reason in <em>2007</em> for Mr Yong to “force” Mr Quek to
                    falsify the nature of the payment given that the investigations against
                    Mr Yong were only initiated in or around April <em>2009</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Loh also sought to explain in
                    cross-examination that the description by Mr Quek in the 2007 balance sheet
                    was erroneous in that the payments were in fact reimbursement of his monthly
                    expenses incurred for his China trips on behalf of Panweld.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Likewise, I did not accept
                    Mr Loh’s explanation. There is no documentary evidence to support
                    Mr Loh’s alleged monthly China expenses. Further, it is odd that the
                    expenses were fixed at $2,500 every month for reimbursement purposes even though
                    Mr Loh admittedly did not travel to China every month. Mr Loh’s
                    explanation that this was rounded up for convenience does not address the
                    complete absence of documentary evidence to support the reimbursement
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Although I did not accept both
                    Mr Quek’s and Mr Loh’s testimony on this point,
                    ultimately, this finding offers no assistance to Mr Yong’s or
                    Mdm Lim’s defence. For the reasons set out in <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a> above, the fact of the salary payments by
                    Panweld to Mrs Loh and Sook Min in itself does not bear out the defence of
                    an alleged agreement between Mr Yong and Mr Loh to place the three
                    wives on Panweld’s payroll. All that it establishes is that Mr Yong
                    was not alone in arranging unauthorised salary payments to his
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Can Mr Yong and/or Mdm Lim invoke the limitation
                defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>, Mr Retnam rightly accepts that, in the event that the
                    salary payments are found to have been paid in breach of Mr Yong’s
                    fiduciary duties, the claims against Mr Yong would not be barred by the
                    Limitation Act (which will be referred to as “the Act”, or
                    “our Act” when discussed together with the English equivalents).
                    Why Mr Retnam’s concession is correct will be explained
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     With regard to the claim against Mdm Lim,
                    Mr Retnam argues that, given that Mr Loh had consented to
                    Mdm Lim’s employment, Panweld is barred by acquiescence from
                    maintaining their claims against Mdm Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> In light of my finding that
                    Mr Loh did not know of Mdm Lim’s “employment”, the
                    argument based on acquiescence becomes moot. Mr Retnam also submitted that
                    even if liability is made out, part of the claim against Mdm Lim would be
                    time barred pursuant to ss 6(1)(a), 6(1)(d) and 6(2) of the Act<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>. Section 6 of the Act provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In response, Mr Foo argues that no time
                    bar applies because the claim against Mdm Lim falls within s 22(1) of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Limitations of actions in respect of trust

                            action accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I should state at the outset that
                    Mdm Lim’s reliance on ss 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(d) of the Act appears
                    misplaced since those provisions relate to claims based on contract, tort or
                    “an action to recover any sum recoverable by virtue of any written
                    law.” Her reliance on s 6(2) of the Act is also inappropriate, since
                    an “action for an account” can only be maintained where there is a
                    fiduciary relationship between the parties as to raise an obligation to account,
                    and where the amount due is uncertain and unliquidated (<em>Black’s Law Dictionary</em>, 9th<sup></sup>Ed, 2009 and <em>Attorney General v
                        Cocke</em> [1988] Ch 414, 420), <em>eg</em>, s 6(2) of the Act was applied to an action for an order
                    for account and inquiry into a partnership’s finances in <em>Toh Kim Chan v Toh Kim Tian</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 839 at [36]–[37]. The
                    claim for the return of salaries paid and received by Mdm Lim is not an
                    “action for an account”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As will be discussed (at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> to <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>
                    below), there are, for purposes of limitation, two classes of constructive
                    trusteeships. Class 1 constructive trusteeships fall within s 22(1) of the
                    Act and are never time barred. Class 2 constructive trusteeships, on the other
                    hand, are subject to the limitation defence. In a number of decisions such as
                        <em>Peconic Industrial Development Ltd v Lau Kwok Fai and
                        ors</em> [2009] HKCFA 16; [2009] 2 HKLRD 537 (“<em>Peconic</em>”), <em>Dubai Aluminium Co
                        Ltd v Salaam and ors</em> [2002] UKHL 48; [2003] 2 AC 366
                        (“<em>Dubai Aluminium</em>”) and
                        <em>Paragon Finance plc v D B Thakerar &amp; Co (a
                        firm)</em> [1999] 1 All ER 400 (“<em>Paragon Finance</em>”), where the courts have ruled
                    that the claims against Class 2 constructive trustees, <em>eg</em>, dishonest assistants and knowing recipients, fall outside
                    the equivalent of s 22(1) of the Act, they did not go on to identify the
                    applicable limitation provision which operated to bar the claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In my view, claims based on dishonest
                    assistance and knowing receipt are claims for equitable relief (see <em>Paragon Finance</em> at p 413 and <em>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock and ors (No 3)</em>
                    [1968] 1 WLR 1555 (“<em>Cradock</em>”) at p 1582), and are governed by s 6(7) of
                    the Act: Report of the Law Reform Committee on the Review of the Limitation Act
                    (Cap 163) (February 2007) (“<em>LRC Report
                        2007</em>”) at p 8. Why such claims do not fall under
                    s 22(2) will be explained later (at <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a> to <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>). As
                    s 6(7) of the Act is expressly subject to s 22, the question that must
                    ultimately be answered is whether s 22(1) of the Act applies, as
                    Mr Foo argues, such that the whole of Panweld’s claim against
                    Mdm Lim remains alive notwithstanding the lapse of six years. Although
                    s 6(7) of the Act was not specifically pleaded by Mr Yong and/or
                    Mdm Lim, in my view, there is no prejudice to Panweld since it was fully
                    aware of the limitation defence and, more significantly, the focus on the
                    limitation contest was on the applicability of s 22(1) of the Act, to which
                    both parties have made substantial submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Pursuant to s 2(1) of the Act,
                    “trust” and “trustee” have the same meanings as
                    under the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed), which include
                    “implied and constructive trusts”. See s 3 of the Trustees
                    Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). Was Mdm Lim a “constructive
                    trustee” within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">“Constructive trusts” under the English equivalent of
                s 22</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     What constitutes “constructive
                    trust” for the purpose of limitation has been the subject of much
                    jurisprudential discussion. As s 22 of our Act was modelled on s 19 of
                    the Limitation Act 1939 (UK) (“the 1939 UK Act”) (see Sing
                        <em>Parliamentary Debates</em>, Vol 11,
                    col 587 (2 September 1959) (Mr K M Byrne, Minister for Labour and
                    Law) and <em>LRC Report 2007</em> at p 4), English
                    authorities on this point are highly relevant and will be discussed in some
                    detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The English authorities distinguish between
                    two broad classes of “constructive trusts” for limitation
                    purposes. The line is drawn based on whether the trust in question arose
                        <em>before</em> the occurrence of the transaction
                    impeached, or whether it arose <em>by reason of</em> that
                    transaction. See <em>Soar v Ashwell</em> [1893]
                    2 QB 390 (“<em>Soar</em>”),

                        Alford</em> [2008] EWHC 32 (Ch) (“<em>Statek</em>”) at [106]. The distinction was neatly stated by
                    Ungoed-Thomas J in the following terms (<em>Cradock</em> at p 1579):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is essential at the outset to distinguish two very different kinds of
                        so-called constructive trustees: (1) Those who, though not appointed
                        trustees, take upon themselves to act as such and to possess and administer
                        trust property for the beneficiaries, such as trustees de son tort.
                        Distinguishing features for present purposes are (a) they do not claim
                        to act in their own right but for the beneficiaries, and (b) their
                        assumption to act is not of itself a ground of liability (save in the sense
                        of course of liability to account and for any failure in the duty so
                        assumed), and so <em>their status as trustees precedes the
                            occurrence which may be the subject of claim against them</em>.
                        (2) <em>Those whom a court of equity will treat as trustees
                            by reason of their action, of which complaint is made.</em>
                        Distinguishing features are (a) that such trustees claim to act in
                        their own right and not for beneficiaries, and (b) no trusteeship
                        arises before, but only by reason of, the action complained of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     While trusts falling under the former category
                    (“Class 1”) come within “trust” in s 22(1) of
                    the Act, those falling under the latter category (“Class 2”) do
                    not, and thus, could be time barred. See JJ. <em>Harrison</em> at [37],
                        <em>Gwembe Valley</em> at [111], <em>Dubai Aluminium</em> at [141] and <em>Halton
                        International</em> at [10],
                        [26].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The distinction between Class 1 and Class 2
                    constructive trusteeships was illustrated in the recent decision of <em>Halton International</em> (at [13]–[15]) by
                    juxtaposing two cases involving breach of directors’ duties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In [<em>JJ Harrison (Properties) Ltd v. Harrison</em>
                        [2002] 1 BCLC 162], the claimant was a family property company, of which the
                        defendant was a director. In 1985 a property owned by the company was valued
                        at £8,400, but in a side letter the valuer said that it “may
                        have some development potential” and that the valuation did not take
                        this into account. The side letter was not disclosed to the company, but the
                        director was aware of it. In 1986 he bought the property from the company
                        without disclosing the side letter. He later sold it for a very substantial
                        profit. More than six years later the company sued him for an account of the
                        proceeds of sale of the land. His limitation defence failed in the Court of
                        Appeal on the ground that the claim was within class 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In [<em>Gwembe Valley Development Co. Ltd v
                            Koshy</em> [2004] 1 BCLC 131], the defendant was managing
                        director of the claimant company, GVDC, and a shareholder in it. He also
                        owned a majority of the shares in and controlled another company, Lasco,
                        which lent money to GVDC. He arranged the loans...The case against the
                        defendant was that he did not disclose to the board of GVDC his interest in
                        Lasco, or the profit that Lasco made on the loans to GVDC. It was held that,
                        apart from fraud, the claim would have been time-barred, because his
                        liability to account for the secret profit was not within class 1, and
                        therefore the exception provided by section 21(1)(b) did not apply. (The
                        claim ultimately succeeded, on the basis that the defendant had fraudulently
                        concealed from GVDC his interest in Lasco and the true cost of the kwacha
                        lent to GVDC.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the director in JJ. <em>Harrison</em>
                    had a pre-existing “trustee-like” responsibility <em>vis-a-vis</em> the property which was the subject of the
                    action, the liability of the director in <em>Gwembe
                        Valley</em> to account for undisclosed profits did <em>not</em> depend on any such pre-existing responsibility, and thus,
                    could not be brought within the English equivalent of s 22(1)(b) of our
                    Act. See <em>Gwembe Valley</em> at [119] and <em>Halton International</em> at [16]). Therefore, but for the fact that the fraudulent nature of
                    the non-disclosure brought the director’s breach in <em>Gwembe Valley</em> within the English equivalent of s 22(1)(a)
                    of our Act, the director would have been able to plead limitation in defence.
                    See <em>Gwembe Valley</em> at [120],

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Indeed, Mr Foo relied on JJ.
                        <em>Harrison</em> to bring the claim against
                    Mr Yong within s 22(1) of the Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Retnam accepts this position, and I find, rightly so. Although there was
                    no express trust, Mr Yong was a fiduciary of Panweld, and as director,
                    stood in a trustee-like position <em>vis-a-vis</em>
                    Panweld’s assets (see <em>Cradock</em> and <em>Halsbury’s </em><em>Vol 9(2)</em> at [110.588], fn 2), <em>ie</em>, he was a trustee of the monies before he wrongfully paid
                    them to Mdm Lim. This brought his breach within Class 1 constructive
                    trusteeship and thus disentitled him from raising the limitation defence. It
                    follows that it is no longer necessary for me to deal with Mr Foo’s
                    alternative submissions that the limitation period for the claim against
                    Mr Yong had been extended pursuant to s 26(2) of the Act, due to
                    Mr Yong’s acknowledgment of Panweld’s claim in May

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Background to the distinction between the two classes of
                “constructive trusts”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The genesis of s 19 of the 1939 UK Act,
                    on which s 22 of our Act was modelled, may be traced back to developments
                    in England prior to the 1890s. Before 1890, when the Trustee Act 1888 (UK)
                    (“the 1888 UK Act”) came into operation in England, the Court of
                    Equity developed the general rule that, in the absence of laches or
                    acquiescence, a claim against an express trustee shall be perpetual. See
                        <em>Soar</em> at p 395. The rationale was not
                    based on culpability, but <em>deemed possession</em>; the
                    legal fiction adopted was that the possession of an express trustee was never by
                    virtue of any right of his own, but was deemed, from the outset, to be taken for
                    and on behalf of his beneficiary, and thus, time did not run in his favour
                    against the beneficiary. See <em>Taylor</em> at
                    pp 650–651, <em>Cradock</em> at 1579,
                        <em>Paragon Finance</em> at pp 408–409 and
                        <em>Halton International</em> at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     To ameliorate the harshness visited on
                    trustees who could remain liable indefinitely for innocent breaches of trust,
                    when even common law actions for fraud were subject to a six-year time bar,
                    s 8 of the 1888 UK Act (which scheme was adopted by s 19 of the 1939
                    UK Act, and consequently, s 22 of our Act) introduced a six-year limitation
                    period for claims for breach of trust. Two situations were, however, excepted
                    from s 8 of the 1888 UK Act, <em>viz</em>,
                    (a) where the claim was founded on fraud; and (b) where the proceeds
                    were still retained by the trustee or had previously been received by the
                    trustee and converted to his use. See <em>Paragon
                        Finance</em> at p 410.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Before this statutory scheme came into place,
                    however, courts developing the general rule that claims against express trustees
                    were perpetual, extended the meaning of “express trustee” to
                    include persons who were, technically, implied or constructive trustees. Those
                    who fell within this expanded meaning of “express trustee” were
                    not allowed to raise the limitation defence. See Michael Franks, MA, <em>Limitation of Actions</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995) at
                    p 64. In <em>Soar</em>, trustees entrusted the trust
                    fund to their solicitor, Ashwell, to be invested in an equitable mortgage by
                    deposit of title deeds. Instead of accounting to the trustees for the sums
                    received upon the mortgage being paid off, Ashwell retained a portion of the
                    monies for himself. The English Court of Appeal held that Ashwell was an
                    “express trustee” to whom no limitation period applied because he
                    was trustee of the funds <em>before</em> he committed the
                    alleged wrong (<em>ie</em>, Class 1 constructive
                    trusteeship). In other words, the classification of “express
                    trustee” in <em>Soar</em> also included certain
                    types of constructive trusts, specifically, those falling within Class 1.
                    Lord Esher MR held (at pp 393–395) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Was Ashwell...such a trustee as a Court of Equity will not allow to rely
                        on the Statutes of Limitation? <em>If there is created in

                            proof of such facts, will not allow him to vouch a Statute of Limitation
                            against a breach of that trust. Such a trust is in equity called an

                        Equity treats the defendant as a trustee become so by construction, and
                            <em>the trust is called a constructive trust; and against

                        not falling strictly within either of those thus enunciated, some of which
                        have been treated by the Courts of Equity as within the class in respect of
                        which a Statute of Limitations will not be allowed to be vouched, and some

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     There is sound policy underlying the
                    distinction made between express trusts (in the expanded sense, which includes
                    Class 1 constructive trusts) and Class 2 constructive trusts for the purposes of
                    limitation. Class 2 constructive trusteeships are contingent on proof of the
                    defendant’s contemporaneous acts by reason of which the constructive trust
                    arose. Such evidence may be more prone to conflicts and destruction over time,
                    as compared to proof of the existence of an express trust or pre-existing
                    fiduciary relationship. As such, considerations of fairness require that time
                    should run in favour of such defendants. See <em>Soar</em>
                    at p 396 per Bowen LJ, and p 400 per Kay LJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Following the enactment of the 1888 UK Act,
                    which by s 1(3) extended the definition of “trustee” to
                    constructive and implied trustees, the judicial exercise of distinguishing
                    between the two categories of constructive trusts persisted. See <em>Taylor</em> at pp 651–653. However, the label
                    “express trust” need no longer be stretched to include Class 1
                    constructive trusts as both express trustees and Class 1 constructive trustees
                    could be precluded from relying on the limitation defence where the requirements
                    of s 8 of the 1888 Act are met. See JJ. <em>Harrison</em> at [34].
                    Indeed, the distinction also survived the subsequent enactment of the 1939 UK
                    Act, upon which our Act was modelled. In connection with this, Millett LJ (as he
                    then was) listed ten reasons justifying the distinction, <em>inter alia</em> (<em>Paragon Finance</em> at
                    pp 412–413):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) If [the 1939 UK Act] was intended to abrogate the former distinction
                        between the two kinds of constructive trust...It can hardly have done so
                        merely by adopting the definitions of “trust” and trustee in
                        the Trustee Act 1925, since these are not materially different from those in
                        [the 1888 UK Act]. <em>If anything, the use of the
                            definitions in [the Trustee Act 1925] points in the opposite direction,
                            for that Act is concerned exclusively with the powers and duties of
                            trustees properly so called. It is not concerned with persons whose
                            trusteeship is merely a formula for giving restitutionary
                            relief.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...(4) As a matter of statutory construction the question turns on the
                        meaning of the opening words of [s 22(1) of our Act]...these are not apt to
                        cover constructive trusts of the second kind...because they refer to
                        “...an action by a beneficiary under a trust...to which the
                            trustee”...<em>these words would appear to be
                            prima facie applicable only to those whose trusteeship precedes the
                            occurrence which is the subject of the claim against them</em> and
                        not those whose trusteeship arises only by reason of that occurrence. (5)
                        ...[T]he distinction between the two kinds of constructive
                            trusts...<em>was the distinction between an institutional
                            trust and a remedial formula – between a trust and a catch
                            phrase</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...(8) Although at first sight the distinction...appears to be merely
                        chronological, <em>it marks a real difference between
                            trustees (whether or not expressly appointed as such) who commit a
                            breach of trust (however created) and persons who are not trustees at
                            all but who are described as trustees for the purposes of enabling
                            equitable relief to be granted against them</em>. Actions founded
                        on tort are barred after six years, and there is no exception for actions
                        founded on fraud, though the start of the limitation period may be deferred
                        in such cases. There is no logical basis for distinguishing between an
                        action for damages for fraud at common law and the corresponding claim in
                        equity for “an account as constructive trustee” founded on the
                        same fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It must be recognised that Class 2
                    “constructive trusts” are not, in fact, “trusts” in
                    the true sense of the word. It is nothing more than a formula for equitable
                    relief; a court applying equitable principles finds that the defendant ought to
                    be made liable in equity, and thus, imposes a constructive trust for this
                    purpose. See <em>Cradock</em> at p 1582. In the words
                    of Millett LJ in <em>Paragon Finance</em> at p 409
                    (which were echoed in <em>Dubai Aluminium</em> at
                    [141]–[142] and <em>Cradock</em> at
                    p 1575):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the first class of case, however, the constructive trustee really is a
                        trustee...the plaintiff does not impugn the transaction by which the
                        defendant obtained control of the property. He alleges that the
                        circumstances in which the defendant obtained control make it unconscionable
                        for him thereafter to assert a beneficial interest in the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second class of case is different...In such a case <em>[the defendant] is traditionally though I think unfortunately described
                            as a constructive trustee and said to be “liable to account as
                            constructive trustee.”
                        </em><em>Such a person is not in fact a trustee at all,
                            even though he may be liable to account as if he were</em>. He
                        never assumes the position of a trustee, and if he receives the trust
                        property at all it is adversely to the plaintiff by an unlawful transaction
                        which is impugned by the plaintiff. In such a case the expressions
                        “constructive trust” and “constructive trustee”
                        are misleading, for <em>there is no trust and usually no
                            possibility of a proprietary remedy;</em> they are “nothing
                        more than a formula for equitable relief”: <em>Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd. V Cradock</em> [1968]
                        1 WLR 1555 at p 1582 <em>per</em>
                            Ungoed-Thomas J...<em>They were not in reality
                            trusts at all, but merely a remedial mechanism by which equity gave
                            relief for fraud</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This use of “remedial” in relation to Class 2
                    “constructive trusts”, which restricts the plaintiff to a
                        <em>personal</em> remedy must, of course, be
                    distinguished from “remedial” in the sense which is used in the
                    United States and Canada, where a “remedial constructive trust”
                    may be imposed as a <em>discretionary proprietary
                        remedy</em>. Under English law, constructive trusts arise based on
                    legal rules, and the court’s role in this connection is purely
                    declaratory. See Hayton &amp; Mitchell, <em>The Law of Trusts and
                        Equitable Remedies</em>, 12th Ed (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2005)

                            to vouch a Statute of Limitations against a breach of that trust. Such a
                            trust is in equity called an express trust...If the breach of the legal

                            and long established...A constructive trust is one which arises when a
                            stranger to a trust already constituted is held by the Court to be bound

                    Furthermore, while Bowen LJ referred to a time bar in relation to constructive
                    trusts, his description of constructive trustees, being strangers to the trust,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     With the benefit of hindsight, drawn from the
                        <em>Paragon Finance</em> and <em>Dubai
                        Aluminium</em> line of cases, it would certainly seem regressive for
                    our courts to retreat to the pre-20<sup>th</sup> century English
                    position of denying reliance on the limitation defence only in cases of express
                    trusts. Indeed, the Court of Appeal had the opportunity to deal with a related
                    point in <em>QBE Insurance Ltd v Sim Lim Finance Ltd</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 23 (“<em>QBE
                    Insurance</em>”) which was decided before <em>Paragon Finance.</em> The respondent, Sim Lim Finance, entered into a
                    hire-purchase agreement with Highlight Industry whereby the latter acquired on
                    hire purchase 74 sets of industrial sewing machines and agreed to pay Sim Lim
                    Finance monthly instalments totalling $105,000. Highlight also took out a fire
                    policy with the appellant, QBE Insurance, in relation to the machines. Following
                    the destruction of the machines in a subsequent fire, Sim Lim Finance wrote a
                    letter to Highlight, carbon-copied to QBE, claiming an interest in the machines,
                    and requesting Highlight to instruct QBE to pay the insurance proceeds to Sim
                    Lim Finance. When QBE did not acknowledge or reply to the letter, Sim Lim
                    Finance sued Highlight, its directors, and QBE for compensation and damages
                    arising from conspiracy, breach of trust and negligence. After QBE filed its
                    defence, the action went to sleep for approximately four years before Sim Lim
                    Finance gave notice of its intention to proceed with its claim. QBE then applied
                    to dismiss the action for want of prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     QBE’s application was dismissed in the
                    High Court which held, <em>inter alia</em>, that Sim Lim
                    Finance’s claim based on fraudulent breach of trust against QBE as
                    constructive trustees had not been time barred. On appeal, QBE argued that
                    Highlight insured the machinery on their own account, and not as trustees for
                    Sim Lim Finance, and that even if there was a claim based on constructive trust,
                    such action did not fall within s 22(1) of the Act. In dismissing
                    QBE’s appeal, the Court of Appeal held (at [28] and [32])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The next submission of counsel for the appellants
                            was that any claim based on constructive trust would have been barred
                            after six years on the ground that s 22(1) of the Limitation Act
                            (Cap 10) had no application to constructive trusts: he cited

                            relied on a passage in the judgment of Bowen LJ (at 395–396)
                            where his Lordship drew a distinction between an express trust

                            faith and in conscience by the trust in consequence of his conduct and
                            behaviour) and that “time is no bar in the case of an express
                            trust, but that it will be a bar in the case of a constructive
                            trust...”. <em>In our view, counsel’s
                                argument was based on a partial reading of Bowen LJ’s
                                judgment.</em> His Lordship (at 396) recognised and drew
                            attention to the “variety and inconsistency both in the language
                            used about constructive trusts and in the line of demarcation that has
                            been drawn between the cases of express and constructive
                            trusts”...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    ...[C]ounsel’s contention that statutory
                            limitation applies to all constructive trusts was again too wide. In the

                                constructive trust, if any, has been determined by the trial
                                judge.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Thus, it would appear from the observations by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>QBE Insurance</em> that not

                    within s 22(1) of the Act. Consistently with the subsequent line of English
                    cases including <em>Paragon Finance</em> and <em>Dubai Aluminium</em>, the Court of Appeal recognised that
                    whether a claim is subject to a time bar depends on the <em>nature</em> of the constructive trust in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Strangers to the Trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I have held (at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>) that Mr Yong is a constructive trustee falling within
                    s 22(1) of the Act as he is a Class 1 constructive trustee. The same may
                    not be said of Mdm Lim. Given the foregoing, it seems quite clear that
                    dishonest assistants and knowing recipients, as strangers to the trust, are
                    Class 2 constructive trustees who are not “trustees” within
                    s 22(1) of the Act. As was observed in Charles Mitchell, “Dishonest
                    assistance, knowing receipt, and the law of limitation” (2008) 3 Conv 226
                        (“<em>Charles Mitchell</em>”) at
                    pp 230–231:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Claimants have [argued]...that [s 22(1) of the Act] applies to actions for
                        dishonest assistance and knowing receipt. The [argument] turns on the fact
                        that dishonest assistants and knowing recipients are “personally
                        liable to account as constructive trustees”...One might have thought
                        that knowing recipients would find it harder to defeat this argument than
                        dishonest assistants because the former always receive property which can be
                        impressed with a trust and the latter do not. Paradoxically, however,
                            <em>knowing recipients have been held to fall outside the
                            subsection...for a long time, whereas dishonest assistants have only
                            been found to fall outside the subsection very

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Even though knowing recipients and dishonest
                    assistants are not “trustees” within the meaning of s 22(1)

                    trustees from pleading limitation? This issue shall be analysed with reference
                    to dishonest assistants and knowing recipients separately to determine whether
                    they should be treated in the same vein or differently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dishonest assistants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     When courts hold that a dishonest assistant to
                    a breach of trust is “liable to account as a constructive
                    trustee”, they do not actually mean that he must account for property in
                    his hands, which he holds on trust. Liability based on dishonest assistance is a
                        <em>personal</em> liability, and the defendant can be
                    liable whether or not he had received and/or retained trust property; there is

                    Act should apply to dishonest assistants because liability of the dishonest
                    accessory should be of the same measure as the wrongdoing principal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> This argument touches on a dilemma
                    which has been discussed in the English cases in relation to whether claims
                    based on dishonest assistance may be brought under s 22(1)(a) of the Act by
                    construing dishonest assistants as having been “a party or privy”
                    to the fraudulent breach of trust. The dilemma, as stated in <em>Charles Mitchell</em> at p 235, is that between two anomalies:
                    either dishonest assistants are never subject to the same rule as fraudulent
                    trustees, even when the trustee and the accessory are fraudulent
                    co-conspirators, or dishonest assistants are sometimes entitled to invoke the
                    limitation defence where the breach of trust was committed innocently, but not
                    where the breach was committed fraudulently, even though in both cases, they may
                    have behaved equally badly. In holding that dishonest assistants were Class 2
                    constructive trustees who may rely on the six-year limitation defence, Deputy
                    High Court Judge Richard Sheldon QC held in <em>Cattley and anor
                        v Pollard and anor</em> [2007] 3 WLR 317 (“<em>Cattley</em>”) at p 334 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Godsmark also relied on the following passage in the
                        judgment of Millett LJ in the Paragon case [1999]
                        1 All ER 400, 414:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“(10) A principled system of limitation would also treat a
                            claim against an accessory as barred when the claim against the
                            principal was barred and not before. There is, therefore, a case for
                            treating a claim against a person who has assisted a trustee in
                            committing a breach of trust as subject to the same limitation regime as
                            the claim against the trustee: see J <em>W Brunyate,
                                Limitation of Actions in Equity</em> (1932). But the
                            borrowers, who obtained the money by deceit and were the principal
                            wrongdoers, were neither trustees nor fiduciaries. If guilty of fraud,
                            they can plead the statute. It would be extraordinary if the defendants
                            were liable in equity as accessories or co-conspirators without limit of
                            time when the claim against the principal wrongdoers was
                            barred.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst this passage does provide some support for Mr Godsmark's
                        argument, it is to be noted that Millett LJ is only postulating an argument
                        (“There is … a case”) which he then proceeds to answer
                        on the facts before him. <em>I do not read this passage as
                            indicating that Millett LJ is accepting that the same period of
                            limitation should necessarily be applicable to a claim against the
                            trustee and a claim against the accessory.</em> <em>It seems to me that there is an illogicality in making a
                            dishonest assistance claim subject to the same period of limitation as a
                            claim against the trustee</em>. In the light of <em>Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn </em><em>Bhd v
                            Tan</em> [1995] 2 AC 378 (which was decided after
                        the Paragon case), a person dishonestly assisting in a breach of trust is
                        liable whether or not the trustee has been fraudulent. Where the trustee's
                        breach is not fraudulent a claim against him would be subject to a six-year
                        limitation period and, if fraudulent, there would be no applicable period of
                        limitation. <em>It would appear illogical for a dishonest
                            assistance claim against the accessory to be subject to a six-year
                            limitation period if the trustee's breach of trust is not fraudulent but
                            subject to no period of limitation if the trustee's breach were
                            fraudulent: the accessory, to be made liable, has to have been guilty of
                            dishonesty in both cases and there is no readily apparent rationale as
                            to why a different period of limitation should apply</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     To avoid the anomalous distinction between
                    actions for dishonest assistance and knowing receipt, where the breach of trust

                    accessory has behaved equally badly in both cases, the better view is that
                    accessorial liability, in both instances, falls outside s 22(1)(a) of the

                    by its directors. The plaintiff company (Statek) was purchased by another
                    company (TCI II) in 1984. One Johnston and one Spillane became directors of
                    Statek. TCI II was the holding company, and all its revenue came from the highly
                    profitable trading activities of Statek. From February 1984 to January 1996,
                    Johnston and Spillane systematically looted Statek and TCI II, misappropriating
                    more than $19.8 million from Statek and more than $10.5 million from TCI II.
                    Between April 1988 and December 1995, a series of payments were made into the
                    personal bank account of one Alford (the defendant), a businessman and longtime
                    business associate of Johnston and Spillane. Statek alleged that, in dishonest
                    breach of his duties to Statek, Alford facilitated the misapplication of
                    Statek’s monies so received by him for which Statek claims, <em>inter alia</em>, that he is bound to account as constructive
                    trustee. Evans-Lombe J found that Alford was a <em>de
                        facto</em> director and hence breached his fiduciary duties to Statek
                        <em>ie</em>, Class 1 constructive trustee (<em>Statek</em> at [107]). In <em>obiter
                        dicta</em>, he added (at [120]–[124]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In arriving at his conclusion Mr Sheldon [in <em>Cattley</em>] placed principal reliance on the judgment
                        of Lord Millett as he had then become in <em>Dubai
                            Aluminium Company Limited v Salaam</em> [2003]
                        2 AC 366...[T]he House of Lords concluded that Mr Amhurst was
                        constituted a category 2 trustee having assisted in a fraud. At paragraph
                        141 in the speech of Lord Millett he is recorded as saying
                        this:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Unlike HB in <em>Mara v Browne</em>
                            [1896]1Ch199, Mr Amhurst did not assume the position of a trustee
                            on behalf of others. He never had title to the trust funds or claimed
                            the right to deal with them on behalf of those properly entitled to
                            them. He acted throughout on his own or his confederate’s behalf.
                            The claim against him is simply that he participated in a fraud. Equity
                            gives relief against fraud by making any person sufficiently implicated
                            in the fraud accountable in equity. In such a case he is traditionally
                            (and I have suggested unfortunately) described as a “constructive
                            trustee” and is said to be “liable to account as a
                            constructive trustee”. But he is not in fact a trustee at all,
                            even though he may be liable to account as if he were...and he could
                            plead the Limitation Acts as a defence in the claim.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...Mr Sheldon describes Lord Millett in this passage as
                        “dealing with a claim for dishonest assistance in a fraudulent breach
                        of trust”…and found that the Limitation Act could be pleaded
                        as a defence to the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect to Mr Sheldon, nowhere in his judgment does
                        Lord Millett describe the assistance given by Mr Amhurst to the
                        fraud as being assistance to a fraudulent breach of trust. He does not do so
                        in the passage cited<em>...</em>[T]he case does not
                        seem to proceed on the basis that he or any of the other defendants were
                        trustees or fiduciaries of the assets of the claimant whose fraud, in
                        dealing with those assets, had been assisted by the actions of
                        Mr Amhurst.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Evans-Lombe J thus observed in <em>obiter dicta</em> that s 21(1)(a) of the 1980 UK Act
                        (<em>in pari </em><em>materia</em>
                    with s 22(1)(a) of our Act) applied to accessories to fraudulent breaches
                    of trust (<em>Statek</em> at [114]–[125]). This
                    observation in effect subjects a dishonest assistant in an innocent breach of
                    trust to a different limitation regime from that which applies where the breach
                    of trust is fraudulent, <em>ie</em>, the very anomaly
                    identified in <em>Charles Mitchell</em>. Evans-Lombe
                    J’s criticism of <em>Cattley</em> was however
                    difficult to follow since the claim in <em>Dubai
                        Aluminium</em> clearly related to dishonest assistance to a fraudulent
                    misappropriation of company funds, which was subject to the limitation defence
                    (see <em>Dubai Aluminium</em> at [85], [87], [141] and [143]), <em>ie</em>,
                    falling outside the ambit of s 21(1)(a) of the 1980 UK Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     
          <em>Statek</em> must now
                    be viewed in light of <em>Peconic</em>, where the Hong Kong
                    Court of Final Appeal firmly held that dishonest assistants are allowed to plead
                    the limitation defence. See <em>Peconic</em> at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>. The bank in <em>Peconic</em> was fraudulently induced by one Chio to invest in a land
                    speculation deal through a joint venture company (Peconic), of which Chio became
                    a director and 25 percent shareholder in 1991. The land was purchased at
                    HK$515 million, although the immediate vendor, which Chio beneficially owned,
                    only bought it for HK$151 million. Chio made a fortune of HK$350 million in the
                    meantime. In 2002, the bank sued a solicitor (Lau) who had allegedly assisted
                    Chio in the fraudulent breach of his fiduciary duties to Peconic. The Hong Kong
                    Court of Final Appeal had to deal with the issue of whether dishonest assistants
                    fell within s 20 of the Hong Kong Limitation Ordinance, which is <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with
                    s 22 of our Act, such that Lau was precluded from raising the limitation
                    defence. Referring to Class 1 constructive trustees as
                    “fiduciaries”, to whom the limitation defence is denied, and Class
                    2 constructive trustees as “non-fiduciaries”, including dishonest
                    assistants who may plead the limitation defence, Lord Hoffmann, sitting in
                    the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, held that (<em>Peconic</em> at [23]–[24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[N]on-fiduciaries do not come within the definition of trustees in [s 22
                        of the Act]. It is necessary however to deal with a different submission,
                        which is that...one category of non-fiduciaries, namely, persons who
                        dishonestly assist a trustee in a fraudulent breach of trust, should be
                        treated in the same way as the trustee and not allowed a limitation
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This argument has the high authority of some dicta...in <em>Soar v Ashwell</em> [1893] 2 QB 390. These remarks have
                        been subjected to minute analysis in the cases and academic writings but I
                        am willing to accept that they support the proposition that dishonest
                        assisters cannot rely on a limitation defence. Nevertheless, I think that
                        they are wrong in principle and unsupported by authority. <em>The principle is not that the limitation defence is denied to people
                            who were dishonest...The principle is that the limitation period is
                            denied to fiduciaries. </em><em>But dishonest
                            assisters are not fiduciaries. </em><em>It might be
                            surprising, as Millett LJ said in the Paragon Finance case (at p.414),
                            if a person primarily liable was entitled to plead the Limitation Act
                            when someone who assisted him could not. </em><em>But there seems no reason in fairness or logic why the reverse should
                            not be true. </em><em>And in any case, Royal Brunei
                            Airlines Sdn </em><em>Bhd v Tan [1995]
                            2 AC 378 shows that the liability of a dishonest assister is
                            independent of the dishonesty of the trustee or other
                            fiduciary.</em> [Counsel for the bank] placed some reliance upon
                        Millett LJ’s observation that “a principled system of
                        limitation would also treat a claim against an accessory as barred when the
                        claim against the principal was barred and not before”...That showed,
                        he said, that if the fraudulent trustee is never entitled to plead
                        limitation, the dishonest assister should not be entitled to do so.
                            <em>But I do not think Millett LJ could have meant
                            this, which would be contrary to most of his reasoning and to his
                            subsequent clear statement in Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2003]
                            2 AC 366, 404 that a dishonest assister is not a fiduciary and
                            can plead the Limitation Act.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Knowing Recipient</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The fact that a “constructive
                    trust” imposed on the knowing recipient arises by virtue of the relevant
                    wrong also situates such claims within Class 2. Notwithstanding the weight of
                    authority to the contrary, Mr Foo argued that Mdm Lim’s
                    liability falls squarely within s 22(1)(b) of the Act because she currently
                    holds the misappropriated monies in her possession.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> This argument may however be said to
                    have been foreclosed following <em>Taylor</em> (at
                    p 653), which clearly determined that “trust property” in the
                    Ontario equivalent to s 22(1)(b) of our Act refers “not to a case
                    where a person having taken possession of property on his own behalf, is liable
                    to be declared a trustee by the Court; but rather to a case where he originally
                    took possession upon trust for or on behalf of others”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     While it is clear that knowing receipt claims
                    do not fall within s 22(1)(b) of the Act, can it nevertheless be brought

                    tentatively, that s 19(1)(a) of the 1939 UK Act (<em>in pari
                        </em><em>materia</em> with s 22(1)(a) of our

                    fraudulent breach of trust, such that there was no time bar. <em>Baker</em> involved a claim by a company (Baker) to recover money
                    entrusted to its auditor (Titley) who fraudulently paid some of it to a company
                    of which he was a director (Medway). When judgment against Titley remained
                    unsatisfied, Baker claimed from Medway repayment of the said sum.

                            the trustee was a party or privy.” It seems to me that the words
                            “in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust”
                            may be capable of referring to a case where the action of the plaintiffs
                            is based upon the fact that their moneys were fraudulently paid away and
                            have reached the hands of an innocent party. That is a possible
                            construction, but whether or not it is the right one is not at all
                            clear</em>...I am bound to say that I think that the words
                        “in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust” are
                        wide enough to cover the present case...It is because they received that
                        payment by virtue of Titley's fraudulent breach of trust that the plaintiff
                        company is able to bring this action against them. Consequently, so far as
                        those words are concerned, the provision seems to me wide enough.</p>

                        But I think that in the context of s.20 of the Ordinance it simply means
                        that the beneficiary must be claiming against the trustee on the ground that
                        he has committed a fraudulent breach of trust. <em>If it had

                        Peter Gibson J. said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"It is clear that a stranger to a trust may make himself accountable
                            to the beneficiaries under the trust in certain circumstances. The two
                            main categories of circumstances have been given the convenient
                            labels...'knowing receipt or dealing' and 'knowing assistance'. The
                            first category of 'knowing receipt or dealing' is described in
                            Snell...as follows: 'A person receiving property which is subject to a
                            trust...becomes a constructive trustee if he falls within either of two
                            heads, namely: (i) that he received trust property with actual or
                            constructive notice that it was trust property and that the transfer to
                            him was a breach of trust; or (ii) that although he received it
                            without notice of the trust, he was not a bona fide purchaser for value
                            without notice of the trust, and yet, after he had subsequently acquired
                            notice of the trust, he dealt with the property in a manner inconsistent
                            with the trust.' <em>I admit to doubt as to whether the
                                bounds of this category might not be drawn too narrowly
                                in Snell. For example, why should a person who, having received
                                trust property knowing it to be such but without notice of a breach
                                of trust because there was none, subsequently deals with the
                                property in a manner inconsistent with the trust not be a
                                constructive trustee within the 'knowing receipt or dealing'
                                category?"</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I respectfully agree...<em>Without attempting an exhaustive
                            classification, it is necessary to distinguish between two main classes
                            of case under this heading</em>. <em>The first is
                            concerned with the person who receives for his own benefit trust
                            property transferred to him in breach of trust.</em> He is liable
                        as a constructive trustee if he received it with notice, actual or
                        constructive, that it was trust property and that the transfer to him was a
                        breach of trust; or if he received it without such notice but subsequently
                        discovered the facts. In either case he is liable to account for the
                        property, in the first case as from the time he received the property, and
                        in the second as from the time he acquired notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The second and, in my judgment, distinct class of case
                            is that of the person, usually an agent of the trustees, who receives
                            the trust property lawfully and not for his own benefit but who then
                            either misappropriates it or otherwise deals with it in a manner which
                            is inconsistent with the trust.</em> He is liable to account as a
                        constructive trustee if he received the property knowing it to be such,
                        though he will not necessarily be required in all circumstances to have
                        known the exact terms of the trust...The essential feature of the first
                        class is that the recipient must have received the property for his own use
                        and benefit. This is why neither the paying nor the collecting bank can
                        normally be brought within it. In paying or collecting money for a customer
                        the bank acts only as his agent. It is otherwise, however, if the collecting
                        bank uses the money to reduce or discharge the customer's overdraft. In
                        doing so it receives the money for its own benefit...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Although Gibson J, in the passage
                    endorsed by Millett J, does seem to suggest that there could be several
                    classes of knowing receipt, depending on the quality of knowledge/notice on the
                    part of the recipient, the distinction Millett J drew “between two
                    classes of case under this heading” seems to mirror the distinction
                    between the two <em>general</em> classes of constructive
                    trusts, which he later set out more clearly in <em>Paragon
                        Finance.</em> In any case, this passage from <em>Agip</em>, which Mr Foo relied on, did not concern the defence
                    of limitation, and it is unclear on its face, how the sub-categories of knowing
                    recipients should differ in respect of the availability of the limitation
                    defence. No other authority was cited to me to this effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Given the persuasive authority in favour of
                    the position that knowing recipients, like dishonest assistants, are Class 2
                    constructive trustees, I am of the view that Panweld’s claim against
                    Mdm Lim falls outside s 22(1) of the Act, and is consequently
                    partially time barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 22(2) of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It remains to be considered whether the
                    limitation defence in relation to dishonest assistance and knowing receipt
                    claims is rooted in s 22(2) of the Act. Although Sheldon QC in <em>Cattley</em> (at [92]) seemed to accept that claims against dishonest assistants were
                    governed by s 21(3) of the 1980 UK Act, which is similar to s 22(2) of
                    our Act, his reliance on <em>Gwembe Valley</em> on this
                    point might not be entirely accurate as the relevant discussion in <em>Gwembe Valley</em> concerned claims against <em>fiduciaries</em> (<em>Gwembe Valley</em>
                    at [111]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fiduciary duties and limitation – summary</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">111.  In the light of those cases, in our view,
                                <em>it is possible to simplify the court’s task
                                when considering the application of the 1980 Act to claims against
                                fiduciaries.</em> The starting assumption should be that a six
                            year limitation period will apply – under one or other provision
                            of the Act, applied directly or by analogy – unless it is
                            specifically excluded by the Act or established case-law. Personal
                            claims against fiduciaries will normally be subject to limits by analogy
                            with claims in tort or contract (1980 Act s 2, 5; see Seguros).
                                <em>By contrast, claims for breach of fiduciary duty,
                                in the special sense explained in Mothew, will normally be covered
                                by section 21. The six-year time-limit under section 21(3), will
                                apply, directly or by analogy, unless excluded by subsection
                                21(1)(a) (fraud) or (b) (Class 1 trust)</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For consistency, “trust” under
                    s 22(1) must mean the same thing under s 22(2). Consequently, while
                    s 22(2) of the Act applies to trustees who parted with trust property
                    negligently or innocently (see Oughton, Lowry &amp; Merkin, <em>Limitation of Actions</em> (LLP, 1998) at p 375 and Choong Yeow
                    Choy, <em>Law of Limitation</em> (Butterworths Asia, 1995)
                    at [2.13.3]) it does <em>not</em> apply to strangers to the
                    trust such as Class 2 constructive trustees. Support for this may be drawn
                    from JJ. <em>Harrison</em> at pp 754 – 755,
                    where it was observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer to the question whether s. 21(3) of the 1980 Act

                        historical analysis in <em>Paragon Finance plc v Thakerar

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘...It was evidently considered unduly harsh that trustees
                            should remain liable indefinitely for innocent breaches of trust when
                            even common law actions for fraud were barred after six years and s. 8
                            of the 1888 Act introduced a period of limitation (effectively six
                            years) for such claims. Its purpose was to provide protection for
                            trustees who would otherwise be liable without limitation of time
                            (laches and acquiescence apart) where the breach of trust was committed

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The position, therefore is that, <em>since the coming into

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As the claim against Mr Yong falls within
                    s 22(1) of the Act, no limitation period applies. Mr Yong is therefore
                    a constructive trustee of the full measure of the monies misapplied. As
                    Mdm Lim is entitled to raise the six-year limitation defence under
                    s 6(7) of the Act, the amount recoverable against her would be capped at
                    $338,410 instead of $873,959.20. The result may appear anomalous in that the
                    principal wrongdoer, Mr Yong, is not able to plead limitation while his
                    accessory, Mdm Lim, is able to do so. However, it has also been said that
                    it would be anomalous for an accessory (who is not a trustee) not to be entitled
                    to plead limitation when a non-trustee who has committed a fraud is entitled to
                    do so. Ultimately, the outcome is merely a function of the court’s
                    interpretation of whether Class 2 constructive trustees, either as knowing
                    recipients or dishonest assistants, fall within the definition of
                    “trustees” in s 22(1) of the Act. Sound judicial reasoning
                    from established case law dictates that they do not because they are, in truth,
                    not really trustees. There is no reason why knowing recipients and dishonest
                    assistants should be treated differently. In the words of Lord Millet in
                        <em>Paragon Finance</em> at p 409, they are
                        “<em>unfortunately described”</em> as
                    constructive trustees. In truth, they are “<em>constructively treated, by a legal fiction</em>” as though
                    they are trustees by their participation in the breach of trust by the principal
                    wrongdoer. See <em>Charles Mitchell</em> at
                    p 229.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Mr Yong is therefore liable to Panweld
                    for the full salary claim of $873,959.20, while Mdm Lim is only jointly
                    liable to the extent of $338,410 together with interest at 5.33 percent
                    per annum on the respective judgment sums from 12 February 2010 till
                    the date of judgment. As agreed, costs of the four settled claims
                    shall follow the event of the salary claim. However as Mdm Lim has
                    succeeded on the limitation defence, I shall order one set of costs at 80
                    percent of the entire action to be paid by Mr Yong to Panweld to be taxed
                    if not agreed and that Mdm Lim is jointly liable to the extent of 30
                    percent for such costs. As I have noted at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> that the third party action is without merit, it is
                    dismissed with costs to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
