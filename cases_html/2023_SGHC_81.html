The plaintiff transferred his 10% share (the “One-Tenth Share”) to the defendant in 2000 by executing three documents: (a) a sale and purchase agreement dated 10 May 2000 (the “SPA”); (b) a statutory declaration dated 11 May 2000 (the “Statutory Declaration”); and (c) a transfer document dated 6 July 2000 (the “Transfer Document”) (collectively, the “Written Documents”). The plaintiff now claims that the reason he executed the Written Documents in 2000 was because prior to the execution of those documents, the defendant had given the plaintiff an oral undertaking that if the plaintiff transfers the One-Tenth Share, the defendant will pay the plaintiff the monetary value of the One-Tenth Share once the Property is sold (the “Oral Undertaking”).

</div> The parties give different explanations for the plaintiff’s One-Tenth Share in the Property. According to the plaintiff, TTL decided of his own volition to give the plaintiff the One-Tenth Share because TTL was a “very traditional man” who felt that the Guillemard Property was not a fair allocation for his eldest son, since it was of lower value than the Property.

</div> According to the defendant, the plaintiff demanded an exchange with the defendant immediately after the ballot. The defendant was, at the time, agreeable to the exchange, but Mdm Ting objected, stating that he was too young to make that decision and that the sons should abide by the ballot results. TTL supported Mdm Ting, and the exchange was not made, but the defendant subsequently found out that TTL had transferred nine-tenth share of the Property to the defendant and the One-Tenth Share to the plaintiff.

</div> According to the plaintiff, sometime in late 1999 or early 2000, the defendant called the plaintiff, said that he was in deep financial trouble and requested that the plaintiff transfer the One-Tenth Share, to enable the defendant to refinance his bank loan and/or obtain a bigger bank loan. The plaintiff sought TTL’s blessing, following which TTL spoke to the brothers. The defendant gave the alleged Oral Undertaking to TTL and the plaintiff. It was only upon the defendant’s said undertaking that the plaintiff agreed to transfer his One-Tenth Share.

During the discussion, the plaintiff raised the issue of the monetary value of his One-Tenth Share. The defendant said the plaintiff had no such entitlement. The defendant then left and informed the plaintiff that he would meet the latter the following day at People’s Park Centre, but subsequently did not show up.

</div> The defendant disputes this. According to the defendant, on 12 January 2021, he met the plaintiff at People’s Park Centre to hand over mail that he had retrieved from the mailbox of one of the units at People’s Park Centre that TTL owned. The plaintiff said to the defendant, in Hokkien, “[w]e are checking on [TTL’s] CPF … I am going to sue you”. The defendant reminded the plaintiff that the One-Tenth Share had already been sold to the defendant and that TTL had paid S$320,000. According to the defendant, he asked the plaintiff to confirm that he had received payment from TTL but the plaintiff neither responded to nor denied what the defendant had said.

</div> I note that the plaintiff does not challenge the validity of the transfer of his One-Tenth Share. Neither does he ask for the transaction to be set aside. Indeed, the plaintiff’s claim appears to depend on the validity of the transfer of his One-Tenth Share in 2000, which forms the basis for the alleged Oral Undertaking that he now seeks to enforce. All the plaintiff seeks before this court is to be paid pursuant to the alleged Oral Undertaking, despite the documentary evidence showing that he was already paid for the transfer. The plaintiff’s assertions regarding the absence of an intention to create legal relations, and of the lack of payment or consideration for his transfer of his One-Tenth Share in 2000, must therefore be considered in this context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The defendant’s defence is that the consideration for the plaintiff’s transfer of his One-Tenth Share to the defendant was already pre-paid by TTL on the defendant’s behalf,

</div>
</div> In the plaintiff’s written submissions, it is not clear what the plaintiff asserts as the part performance. It can only be presumed that the plaintiff seeks to argue that his signing of the Written Documents and transfer of the One-Tenth Share constitute the part performance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20  There are two different standards which may be applied to determine whether a promisee’s acts constitute sufficient part performance, and, as noted by the courts in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex Pte Ltd v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Seng (trading as Tong Seng Vegetable Trading </span>[2013] 4 SLR 176 (“<span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span>”) at [25] and <span class="font-italic">Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Moh Yin Patricia and another v Sim Kwai Meng</span> [2021] SGHC 11 (“<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang</span>”) at [96], the Court of Appeal has not made a definitive pronouncement as to which of the two standards should apply in Singapore. Under the two standards, as examined by the court in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex </span>at [21]–[24], the plaintiff must show either: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the acts relied upon as part performance “unequivocally” point towards the existence of a contract fitting the description of the oral contract alleged to exist (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the standard in <span class="font-italic">Elizabeth Maddison v John Alderson</span> (1883) 8 App Cas 467 (<span class="font-italic">“Maddison”</span>)); or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that on an analysis of all the circumstances (but leaving aside evidence of the purported oral contract), it is “more probably than not” that the acts relied upon as part performance were done in reliance on the oral contract alleged to exist (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the standard in<span class="font-italic"> Steadman v Steadman</span> [1976] AC 536 (“<span class="font-italic">Steadman</span>”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span>, after an analysis of legal developments in England and in Singapore, concluded at [33] that the approach in <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> is to be preferred to that in <span class="font-italic">Steadman</span>. In a more recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang</span>, the General Division of the High Court set out the historical background leading to the recognition of the doctrine of part performance as an exception to the requirements under s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA in Singapore and considered the application of the doctrine of part performance by both Singapore courts and foreign courts. The court similarly concluded that the <span class="font-italic">Maddison </span>standard should be applied<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [114]–[115]). In this regard, I note that the appeal from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang</span> was allowed in part by the Appellate Division of the High Court <span class="font-italic">in Sim Kwai Meng v Pang </span><span class="font-italic">Moh Yin Patricia and another</span> [2022] SGHC(A) 1. The Appellate Division, however, did not comment on the learned Judge’s conclusions on the doctrine of part performance, but disposed of the appeal based on an unrelated point. The courts in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span> and <span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang</span> made the following observations: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is a need to strike a balance between ensuring that the legislative purpose of s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA is not defeated and that the doctrine of part performance achieves its objective of thwarting unconscionable conduct in exploiting the statute. The <span class="font-italic">Maddison </span>standard better strikes this balance between the two competing considerations (<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [103], citing <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex </span>at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The doctrine of part performance, under Lord Selborne’s rationalisation in <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> (at 475–476), only seeks to enforce the equities generated by a party who has partially performed the alleged oral contract, and does not seek to undermine the formality requirements imposed by statute by enforcing the oral contract itself. The requirement of “unequivocal referability” in <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> specifies the appropriate threshold that a party’s equities must cross in order to justify the enforcement of the same despite the non-compliance of the contract with the requisite statutory formalities. This reason for preferring the <span class="font-italic">Maddison </span>standard is aligned with the persuasive reasoning of the seven-judge <span class="font-italic">coram</span> of the Australian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Pipikos</span><span class="font-italic"> v Trayans</span> [2019] 1 LRC 236 (“<span class="font-italic">Pipikos</span>”) at [47]–[49], [51]–[52], [54] and [65], which unanimously held that the <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> standard was preferred (<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [104]–[107]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The doctrine of part performance ought not to be regarded as a free-wheeling creation of equity which can be moulded to deliver “palm-tree justice” in an unprincipled manner. The requirement of “unequivocal referability” in <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> provides a principled limitation on the scope of the doctrine (<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [107], citing <span class="font-italic">Pipikos</span> at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">Steadman </span>is not entirely persuasive as an authority for overturning the <span class="font-italic">Maddison </span>standard because the reasoning of the members of the <span class="font-italic">coram</span> in <span class="font-italic">Steadman</span> was disparate, and none of their Lordships in <span class="font-italic">Steadman </span>suggested that the decision involved a departure from the approach of Lord Selborne in <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [111], citing <span class="font-italic">Pipikos</span> at [67]–[70]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The doctrine of part performance was legislatively abolished under English law due to the perceived uncertainty in the law created by the more relaxed standard in <span class="font-italic">Steadman</span>. Under the <span class="font-italic">Steadman </span>standard, it was difficult to discover, with acceptable certainty, prior to proceedings, whether a contract will be found to be enforceable (<span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [100]–[103], citing<span class="font-italic"> Hu Lee Impex </span>at [29]–[33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The paragraph above at [21] is but a brief summary of the observations and detailed analyses undertaken by the learned Judges in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span> and <span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang</span>. I am in agreement with the reasons given in those cases for preferring the <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> standard, and I gratefully adopt the same. For completeness, it should be mentioned that the court in <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Goh Seng Heng and another </span>[2019] SGHC 40 (“<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky</span>”), which was referred to in <span class="font-italic">Patricia Pang </span>at [97], also applied the <span class="font-italic">Maddison </span>standard (<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky </span>at [65]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The plaintiff relies on <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span> “[i]n addressing the requirements for the doctrine of part performance to apply in Singapore”.

Specifically, the court noted that the learned contributors did not take cognisance of the fact that <span class="font-italic">Steadman</span> no longer represents the position in English law and that <span class="font-italic">Steadman</span> was the impetus for the abolition of the doctrine of part performance under English law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As was held in <span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex </span>at [34(b)], “the doctrine of part performance requires evidence of <span class="font-italic">acts</span> which manifestly speak for themselves [and] [c]ontested evidence of what allegedly transpired at a meeting is manifestly inadequate to cross the hurdle of unequivocality” [emphasis in original]. In this regard, the court is required to disregard the alleged oral agreement (<span class="font-italic">Hu Lee Impex</span> at [34(c)]). Applying the <span class="font-italic">Maddison</span> standard to the facts of this case, I find that there is nothing in the plaintiff’s signing of the Written Documents and transfer of the One-Tenth Share that unequivocally, and in their own nature, point towards the existence of the alleged Oral Undertaking. On the contrary, the Written Documents themselves, on their face, provide an explanation for the plaintiff’s transfer of his One-Tenth Share of the Property to the defendant: the Written Documents state that the transfer of the One-Tenth Share was done in exchange for consideration of S$320,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiff also relies on <span class="font-italic">Joseph Mathew and another v Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev and another </span>[2010] 1 SLR 338<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA)</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev and another v Joseph Mathew and others</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC)</span>”) in support of his invocation of the doctrine of part performance.

</div> In both <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC)</span>, it was held that the requirements in s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA were satisfied on the facts (<span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>at [41]–[46] and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC) </span>at [38]). The High Court had also found, assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA was not complied with, that there was part performance of a contract for the sale of a condominium unit by the defendants to the plaintiffs for the sale price of S$506,000. As noted by the court at [39]–[40], the part performance was the payment of 1% of the sale price and acceptance of the same, evidenced by a cheque for S$5,060 (on the back of which the full address of the condominium unit was spelt out) issued by the first plaintiff and receipt of that sum by the first defendant. There, the draft option stated that it was to be granted in consideration of the sum of $5,060 paid by the purchaser as the option money. In the circumstances of <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC)</span>, the acts of payment and receipt of the S$5,060 were found to be acts “referable to the [oral] contract to sell the [p]roperty and there was thus part performance” (<span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC) </span>at [39]−[40], as reproduced and endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>at [63]–[64]). It can further be seen that the evidence before the courts in <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC)</span> was also unequivocal that the acts were done in reliance on the oral contract for the sale of the condominium unit. For the reasons stated above at [24], the present facts are very different from those in <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Chiranjeev (HC)</span>, and the fact that the plaintiff signed the Written Documents and transferred his One-Tenth Share to the defendant does not tend to unequivocally show that the plaintiff had done so because he relied on the alleged Oral Undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For completeness, I note that even if the <span class="font-italic">Steadman </span>standard was applied, the plaintiff would have failed to show that it is met. As may be seen below, in the context of analysing the evidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> whether there was an Oral Undertaking and whether the Written Documents are a sham, the allegations of the plaintiff concerning the circumstances surrounding the signing of the Written Documents are vigorously contested, and the plaintiff’s evidence is manifestly inadequate to show that the Written Documents were executed in reliance on any oral agreement. Thus, on an analysis of all the circumstances (but leaving aside evidence of the Oral Undertaking), it is not more probable than not that the Written Documents were executed in reliance on any oral agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The plaintiff therefore cannot rely on the doctrine of part performance to overcome the unenforceability of the alleged Oral Undertaking under s 6(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CLA. The claim of the plaintiff must fail since the alleged Oral Undertaking, even if proven, will be unenforceable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In any event, I find, on the evidence, that the plaintiff has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant gave him the Oral Undertaking as alleged. It is to this that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there was an Oral Undertaking as alleged by the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 According to the plaintiff, there was (a) a phone call between himself and the defendant, during which the defendant sought his help and asked for the transfer of his One-Tenth Share; (b) a conversation with TTL to seek TTL’s blessing for the transfer; (c) communications between himself, the defendant, and TTL, pursuant to which the alleged Oral Undertaking was given.

</div> In support of this narrative, the plaintiff attempts to show that the defendant was facing financial difficulties in or around 2000 and that there were two instances when the plaintiff had demanded payment from the defendant (see [11] above).

During cross-examination, the plaintiff’s transcriber explained the reason for including “if” in the plaintiff’s Transcript. Due to the slurring in TTL’s speech in the recording, the words used by TTL were not entirely clear. The plaintiff’s transcriber thus had reference to the context and inferred that TTL was making a conditional statement.

The plaintiff’s transcriber has also shown a propensity to regard as “inaudible” the portions of the conversation that are not in his client’s favour, until he was confronted during cross-examination. In any event, the plaintiff’s transcriber ultimately agreed that a literal translation of the 29 second mark of the recording was “but I have already return [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] him”.

</div>
</div> (at the 31 second mark of the defendant’s Transcription). If “he” at the 29 second to the 31 second mark is taken to refer to the plaintiff, then TTL had spoken in a manner that suggests that the plaintiff might not pursue the option in the event that the defendant fails to make the payment that the defendant purportedly said he wanted to make, particularly when TTL alluded to how the plaintiff might “still” want to make the said deduction if that were to happen. Even if “he” at the 29 second to the 31 second mark is understood to refer to the defendant, that interpretation would still not assist the plaintiff’s case as that reading gives the defendant the choice to deduct or not. If, indeed, the defendant is obligated to pay the plaintiff, the deduction would logically not be optional. I therefore find the Audio Recording to be inconsistent with the plaintiff’s case that there was a binding oral agreement<span class="font-italic"> obligating</span> the defendant to pay the plaintiff. Had the defendant been bound by an obligation to pay the plaintiff, the payment referred to in the conversation would not be dependent on the plaintiff’s inclination to receive payment or the defendant’s inclination to make payment. This is because it would follow as a natural consequence to a binding oral agreement for the plaintiff to receive payment and for the defendant to have to pay the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, I take the view that there is nothing in either set of transcriptions that suggests that the payment that the defendant purportedly “want[ed]” to make to the plaintiff (which payment I shall henceforth refer to as the “optional payment”) is for moneys that are owing by the defendant to the plaintiff under a binding oral agreement. Indeed, the tone and tenor of the conversation is consistent with what the defendant has argued. In my judgment, the mention of the optional payment could allude to a potential payment of S$930,000 to the plaintiff, after the sale of the Property, but this would be a further payment in addition to what TTL had already paid the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TTL said that the defendant “want[ed]” to pay the plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Even if TTL’s words go towards showing that the defendant might have indicated that he wanted to pay the plaintiff, this does not in and of itself prove the existence of the alleged Oral Undertaking. The contents of the transcriptions do not provide sufficient information to explain the defendant’s purported indication that he “wants” to pay the plaintiff. It cannot be extrapolated to mean that there was a binding oral agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant based on the evidence before the court. The defendant may “want” to pay for any number of reasons, and the existence of the Oral Undertaking is <span class="font-italic">only one of </span><span class="font-italic">the possible extrapolations</span> that may be made from the statements in the transcript. Simply put, there is insufficient evidence for the court to come to the conclusion that the defendant must have “want[ed]” to pay the plaintiff because there was a binding oral agreement to pay the plaintiff 10% of the sale proceeds of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Further observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I further observe that in the Audio Recording, there was no complaint by TTL about the defendant, contrary to what Ms Tan Bee Lee asserts. At no point in time during the course of the conversation was TTL critical of the defendant for not paying the plaintiff the monetary value of the latter’s One-Tenth Share in the Property after the sale of the Property. This contradicts the evidence of Ms Tan Sook Har that TTL “regularly … complain[ed] that [the defendant] had not yet paid [the plaintiff] for his 10% share in the Property”.

</div> Further, insofar as the conversation in the Audio Recording went, it is not consistent with the impression given in the evidence of Ms Tan Sook Har and Ms Tan Seok Phin, which is that TTL was dissatisfied with the defendant for not paying what he owed to the plaintiff and that TTL had regularly complained about that.

</div>
</div> In my view, the possible deduction in favour of the plaintiff in the event that the defendant does not make the optional payment appears to be an expression of the patriarch’s wishes for his estate to make that optional payment if it is not made by the defendant or if it is not paid from the defendant’s share of TTL’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is apt at this juncture to reiterate that the plaintiff’s case is that he has never been paid by anyone for the transfer of his One-Tenth Share; it is not his case that he has been paid, but there is an agreement for the optional payment to be made. The mention of the optional payment does not, therefore, serve to advance the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Additionally, as the defendant argues,

</div> the Audio Recording appears to be made under suspicious circumstances, which calls into question the reliability of the recording as evidence supporting the existence of the alleged Oral Undertaking. First, I observe that, as accepted by Ms Tan Bee Lee, her voice was louder than that of TTL and this was because Ms Tan Bee Lee’s phone was placed closer to her than to TTL.

</div> Second, it is evident from the transcripts that Ms Tan Bee Lee initiated the discussion about the Property. At the very start of the recording, the pair were speaking about the defendant’s wife, and the first mention of the Property was by Ms Tan Bee Lee. She appears to be leading TTL to say that the defendant had an obligation to pay the plaintiff when she said, “… so you had spoken to [the defendant] that he has to pay him when the time comes …”.

</div>
</div> She was also the one to bring up the 10% payment. In my assessment, it is evident that Ms Tan Bee Lee was guiding the conversation towards the topic of the payment for the plaintiff’s One-Tenth Share. She tried, but was not successful, in leading the conversation towards the conclusion that the defendant is obligated under an undertaking to pay the plaintiff. Indeed, TTL’s response to her was “but” he had already paid the plaintiff (see [37] above). Although Ms Tan Bee Lee explained that this Audio Recording was made because she had just purchased a new mobile phone and was fiddling with the phone to show TTL how to use it to record,
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-244d2cff-bcfc-4cdb-ba0f-828fe1239bd6" data-toggle="modal" type="button">84</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> I find this explanation to be unconvincing and I do not believe her explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Further, I consider that on the available evidence, TTL’s conduct at the time of the Audio Recording and thereafter is inconsistent with the plaintiff’s case that TTL took the view that the defendant had an outstanding obligation to pay the plaintiff for the One-Tenth Share. First, as observed above at [49], TTL did not make any negative remarks about the defendant in the Audio Recording, as Ms Tan Bee Lee accepted.

</div>
</div> Second, I note that the brothers and TTL made a trip to TTL’s lawyer’s office on the day of the Chinatown Point Meeting on 4 July 2019 to settle his will. There is no evidence that TTL made any arrangement to see to it that any alleged outstanding payment from the defendant would be made to the plaintiff. If what the sisters and the plaintiff said on the stand were true – and in particular, the plaintiff testified that TTL was the one who encouraged him many times to ask for payment from the defendant

</div> It is reasonable to infer that at this point, which was after 17 April 2019 when the Audio Recording was made, the plaintiff would have been alive to the option of making a recording of TTL saying something about the payment that the plaintiff now claims is due from the defendant. The plaintiff, despite having made a recording of himself walking with TTL that day, does not have any recording of TTL saying that the defendant should pay the plaintiff under the alleged Oral Undertaking. The plaintiff also did not make any attempts to gather any other evidence that could have been obtained when TTL was alive, nor did he raise the issue of the payment that he said was due to him at the lawyer’s office when the father and sons attended for the purpose of settling the will of TTL,

It is clear that the sisters knew that TTL had given 10% of the Property to the plaintiff, but they were unfamiliar with, or even unaware of, the sale and transfer of the One-Tenth Share <span class="font-italic">via </span>the Written Documents to the defendant in 2000.

</div> In any event, none of these matters detract from her lucid and firm testimony that TTL told her that he had paid the plaintiff, nor her credibility as someone who interacted regularly and worked closely with TTL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In light of all the available evidence, I have come to the view that the plaintiff was in fact already paid by TTL for his One-Tenth Share in the Property, even before the execution of the Written Documents in 2000. Therefore, the plaintiff did not transfer his One-Tenth Share in reliance on any alleged Oral Undertaking from the defendant, as the consideration for the transfer had in fact been earlier furnished by TTL. Although in the Audio Recording there is a reference to the optional payment that the defendant had purportedly agreed to make, it does not assist the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff’s case is that he was never paid by anyone for the transfer, not that he has been paid and is owed a further payment, as mentioned above at [50]. It is also unclear, on the available evidence, whether the defendant had in fact agreed to make the optional payment and if there was such an agreement, what the terms, such as the consideration, for that payment may be. As there is no claim for the optional payment, I say no more about it. I conclude that the plaintiff has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the defendant gave him the Oral Undertaking as alleged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Written Documents are a sham </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff’s position is that the Written Documents are a sham. A sham is “a provision or agreement which the parties do not really intend to be effective, but have merely entered into for the purpose of leading the court or a third party to believe that it is to be effective”; in other words, the crux of a sham lies in a common intention to mislead, such intention pertaining to the subjective intentions of the parties involved (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng and another (executrixes and trustees of the estate of Fock Poh Kum, deceased) v Chng Eng Chye </span>[2013] 2 SLR 715 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng</span>”) at [50] and [52]). There is a “very strong presumption” that the parties intend to be bound by the terms of an agreement that they enter into (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng </span>at [51]). As the party alleging the sham, the plaintiff bears the legal burden of proving that the Written Documents are a sham (<span class="font-italic">Toh </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina and another appeal </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1176 (“<span class="font-italic">Toh </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Tiah</span>”) at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 To ascertain whether the documents represent the true relationship between the parties, the court looks to (a) whether the documents were intended to create legal relationships; and (b) whether the parties did actually act according to the apparent purpose and tenor of the documents (<span class="font-italic">Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte Ltd and another </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 375 at [64], citing <span class="font-italic">TKM (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Export Credit Insurance Corp of Singapore Ltd </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 858 at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff did not plead any specific facts nor lead any evidence to show that the plaintiff and the defendant did not really intend the Written Documents to be effective, but have merely executed the said documents for the purpose of leading the court or a third party to believe that the documents were to be effective. The plaintiff also did not identify anyone whom he and/or the defendant sought to mislead when the Written Documents were executed. In fact, the plaintiff did not even admit to having formed an intention with the defendant to mislead or deceive anyone when he signed the Written Documents. Instead, the plaintiff merely alleges that because the defendant requested the transfer of the plaintiff’s One-Tenth Share to enable the defendant to refinance the defendant’s bank loan and/or obtain a bigger bank loan in 2000, the plaintiff accordingly transferred the One-Tenth Share in reliance on the alleged Oral Undertaking, without receipt of any consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 To support his allegation of a sham, the plaintiff relies on the following arguments:

</div> The plaintiff’s evidence is therefore inconsistent between that in his AEIC and at trial. This inconsistency relates to an important aspect of his case as to whether the alleged Oral Undertaking was given by the defendant, and casts some doubt on the credibility of the plaintiff’s evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I also note that given the state of the parties’ relationship, it is difficult to conceive that the pair had any common intention to collude and deceive or mislead a third party. Indeed, the plaintiff has not shown any such plan between the two. In view of the state of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, I also find it hard to believe that the plaintiff would agree to transfer his One-Tenth Share based solely on an agreement that was never documented. Further, the transfer and the alleged Oral Undertaking appears not even to have been mentioned by the plaintiff to anyone other than TTL. Even the sisters who were called by the plaintiff to give evidence were never informed by the plaintiff. To conclude this point, I find that it is inappropriate to apply the presumption that the parties did not intend to create legal relations. I also find that the plaintiff has not shown that there was no intention to create legal relations when the parties executed the Written Documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Second, I address the plaintiff’s arguments that the key terms of the SPA were not followed and instead, the alleged Oral Undertaking is the real agreement between the parties. The plaintiff points to clauses 2, 4 and 10 of the SPA, which state that the defendant is to pay S$32,000 as a deposit to the plaintiff and that upon completion of the sale, the defendant is to pay the balance of the purchase price of S$320,000 to the plaintiff.

</div> In essence, the plaintiff raises the alleged non-compliance with all these clauses to bolster his claim that he has not been paid for the transfer of his One-Tenth Share because there was an oral undertaking by the defendant to pay him the monetary value of the One-Tenth Share once the Property is sold. I reiterate that the plaintiff did not challenge the validity of the transfer of his One-Tenth Share pursuant to the Written Documents. This is inconsistent with his argument that the Written Documents are a sham, since a sham provision or agreement is one which the parties do not really intend to be effective, per <span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Bee Kheng </span>as set out above at [64]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In my judgment, there is nothing in the evidence to show that in executing the Written Documents, the parties had a common intention to mislead. Even if it were shown that the defendant did not comply strictly with the terms in the SPA, that in and of itself may not be sufficient to prove the sham alleged. Non-payment alone might well just indicate a breach of a payment obligation and not necessarily indicate a sham (<span class="font-italic">Akfel</span><span class="font-italic"> Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam </span>[2019] 2 SLR 412 at [55]).

</div> the burden does not lie on the defendant to prove the payment. Rather, it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove the sham as he alleges. In any event, I have already found at [63] that TTL had paid the plaintiff for the transfer. As for what the plaintiff alleges to be the true agreement intended in place of the Written Documents, I have already found at [63] that there was no Oral Undertaking as alleged by the plaintiff. Therefore, having regard to whether the parties did act according to the apparent purpose and tenor of the documents, being one of the considerations for ascertaining whether the documents represent the true relationship between the parties, I find that the plaintiff has failed to show the Written Documents to be a sham. The intention of the parties was to effect the transfer of the One-Tenth Share from the plaintiff to the defendant, and the parties had conducted themselves in line with the transaction embodied in the Written Documents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Finally, the plaintiff claims that the defendant sought the transfer because he was in deep financial trouble and wanted to refinance his bank loans and/or obtain a bigger bank loan.

In the same vein, the defendant has adduced drafts of the SPA dated 1996 and 1998, which he states were prepared in accordance with TTL’s instructions, but which were not executed due to the plaintiff’s lack of cooperation.
