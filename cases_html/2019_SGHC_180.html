</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The relationship between the applicant and Mr Nair also appeared to have broken down completely, with each accusing the other of wrongdoing in relation to the first respondent’s affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 To my mind, the dysfunctional state of the first respondent’s board, with the applicant and Mr Nair at loggerheads and Mr Kunjayyappan adopting a disinterested stance, rendered it unable to properly investigate any potential claims against the second respondent. It was my view that it would not have made any difference regardless of whether notice was validly served or not. It was unlikely to have led to a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> effort to investigate any of the applicant’s claims. This satisfied the requirement of impracticability and justified dispensing with the notice requirement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The good faith requirement in the context of a statutory derivative action under s 216A of the Companies Act was recently summarised by Judicial Commissioner Ang Cheng Hock in <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investment Holdings Pte Ltd &amp; 2 Ors v Healthstats International Pte Ltd &amp; 2 Ors </span>[2019] SGHC 38 (at [42] and [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 There are two main facets to the “good faith” requirement: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29]–[30]; <span class="font-italic">Maher v Honeysett and Maher Electrical Contractors </span>[2005] NSWSC 859 at [28]. The first relates to the merits of the proposed derivative action.  The applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that a good cause of action exists for the company to prosecute.  It follows as a corollary that an applicant may be found to lack good faith if it is shown that no reasonable person in his position, and knowing what he knows, could believe that the company had a good cause of action to prosecute: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29].  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, an applicant may be found to be lacking in good faith if it can be demonstrated that he is bringing the derivative action for a collateral purpose: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [30].  The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is “genuinely aggrieved”, and that any collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of “doing justice to a company” so that he or she is not abusing the statutory remedy and, by extension, also the company, as a vehicle for the applicant’s own aims and interests: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [31], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The mere fact that an applicant acts out of self-interest does not mean that he is acting in bad faith. The motivations of an applicant will only amount to bad faith in so far as they go to show that his judgment has been clouded by purely personal considerations: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The second respondent argued that the applicant acted in bad faith as the statutory derivative action was brought for a collateral purpose, namely, to enable Tuff to recover sums allegedly owed to it by the first respondent. This would benefit the applicant personally as Tuff’s beneficial owner.
