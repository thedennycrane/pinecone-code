<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Originating Summons No 1175 of 2013
                    (“OS 1175/2013”) is an <em>ex parte</em>
                    application by the Attorney-General (“the AGC”) under O 57
                    r 16(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) for leave to apply for an order of committal against Au
                    Wai Pang (“Alex Au”) for contempt of court in respect of an
                    article published on his blog. Originating Summons No 59 of 2014
                    (“OS 59/2014”) is an application by Alex Au to appear in and
                    contest OS 1175/2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In an earlier application to the High Court
                    (Originating Summons No 1098 of 2013, hereinafter
                    “OS 1098/2013”), the AGC sought leave to apply for an order
                    of committal against Alex Au for contempt of court in respect of two articles
                    published on his blog:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     “377 wheels come off Supreme
                        Court’s best-laid plans”, published on 5 October 2013
                        (“the first article”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     “Church sacks employee and sues government —
                        on one ground right, on another wrong”, published on 12 October
                        2013 (“the second article”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 25 November 2013 at around 10.30pm, Alex
                    Au received word through the media that the AGC intended to apply to the High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) on the morning of 26 November 2013
                    for leave to initiate committal proceedings against him. The following morning,
                    counsel for Alex Au sought leave to convert OS 1098/2013 into an <em>inter partes</em> hearing. OS 1098/2013 was adjourned to
                    27 November 2013 for further submissions on whether this should be done.
                    The request to convert OS 1098/2013 into an <em>inter
                        partes</em> hearing was denied by the Judge during the
                    27 November hearing. She nevertheless allowed Alex Au’s counsel to
                    hold a watching brief for him in chambers. The Judge also granted leave to the
                    AGC to apply for an order of committal against Alex Au in respect of the first
                    article, but not the second.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       O 57 r 16(3) of the ROC stipulates
                    that, in the event of a refusal of an <em>ex parte</em>
                    application by the High Court, an application for a similar purpose may be made
                    to the Court of Appeal within seven days after the date of refusal. The AGC
                    attempted to electronically file the application on 6 December 2013 (the
                    seventh day after the date of refusal), but this filing was rejected by the
                    Supreme Court registry on 9 December 2013 because of an error in the title
                    of a document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After correcting this error, the AGC re-filed
                    the application on 9 December 2013 under a different case number, namely,
                    OS 1175/2013. On 12 December 2013, the AGC appeared before the Duty
                    Registrar to fix two summonses before the Duty Judge. The first summons was for
                    the hearing of OS 1175/2013 to be expedited; the second summons was for the
                    AGC to be granted an extension of time until 9 December 2013 to file
                    OS 1175/2013. We note from the minutes of the proceedings that counsel for
                    the AGC informed the Duty Registrar that s 36(1) of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) empowered
                    a single judge to hear an application for extension of time to file an
                    originating summons before the Court of Appeal. The AGC also invoked O 57
                    r 16(3) of the ROC and relied on observations made in the Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 354 (“<em>Michael
                        Dorsey</em>”) for the proposition that the application in
                    OS 1175/2013 was not an appeal, and was in fact a “renewal
                    application”. The Duty Registrar fixed the two summonses before the Duty
                    Judge, and in doing so observed that the Duty Judge could decide whether he had
                    jurisdiction and whether it was proper to hear the application for an extension
                    of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Counsel for the AGC appeared before the Duty
                    Judge on 13 December 2013, whereupon he granted orders in terms for both
                    the application to expedite and the application for extension of time.
                    Unfortunately, the available minutes make no reference to the submissions made
                    to him or his reasons for allowing the applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       OS 59/2014 was filed by Alex Au on
                    17 January 2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       This court heard OS 1175/2013 and
                    OS 59/2014 on 28 February 2014. We were however concerned with two
                    issues, which we drew to counsel’s attention in the course of the
                    hearing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Duty Judge had the power
                        to sit as the Court of Appeal and grant an extension of time;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the
                        Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to grant leave to commence committal
                        proceedings for contempt of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the Duty Judge have the power to grant an extension of
                time?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Section 36(1) of the SCJA
                    (“s 36(1)”) is the governing provision on this particular
                    issue. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <b>any </b><b><em>proceeding
                            pending</em></b> before the Court of Appeal, any direction incidental
                        thereto not involving the decision of the <b>appeal</b>, <em>any interim order to prevent
                            prejudice to the claims of parties pending the appeal</em>, and
                        any order for security for costs and for the dismissal <em>of
                            </em><b><em>an appeal</em></b> for default in
                        furnishing security so ordered, may at any time be made by a Judge.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The definition of the word
                    “pending” has been considered by numerous Singaporean and
                    Malaysian cases, all of which speak with one voice. In the Federation of Malaya
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>K Sockalinga Mudaliar v S
                        Eliathamby &amp; Anor</em> [1952] MLJ 77, Thomson J
                    commented (at 78) that “pending” is derived from the Latin word
                        <em>pendere</em>, which literally translates as
                    “to hang”, and quoted <em>Stroud’s Judicial
                        Dictionary</em> (2nd ed) at p 1445:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>A legal proceeding is “pending” as soon
                            as commenced</em>... and until it is concluded, i.e. so long as
                        the Court having original cognizance of it can make an order on the matters
                        in issue, or to be dealt with, therein. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Singapore High Court decision of <em>Goh Teng Hoon and others v Choi Hon Ching</em> [1985-1986]
                    SLR(R) 869 (at [7]) and the Singapore Court of Appeal decision of <em>Bank of India v Rai Bahadur Singh and another</em> [1993]
                    2 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Bank of India</em>”)
                    (at [14]) cited the same passage with approval. The definition in <em>Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary</em> appears to have
                    stemmed from the seminal English Court of Appeal decision of <em>In re Clagett’s Estate; Fordham v Clagett</em> (1882)
                    20 Ch D 637, where Jessel MR held that a cause is said to be pending
                    in a court when any proceeding can be taken in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     More specifically, no orders can be made if
                    proceedings have not been already validly commenced. This proposition emerges
                    from the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Sugden and
                        others v Lord St Leonards and others</em> (1876) 1 PD 154,
                    wherein Mellish LJ observed, in the course of argument, as follows (at
                    209):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have held in several cases that, till an appeal is brought, there is
                        nothing pending in the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>
<em>The Annual Practice 1923</em> is also
                        instructive in this regard (at p 2081):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Until an appeal is brought there is nothing
                            “pending” before the C. A. A single judge has no
                            jurisdiction hereunder until an appeal has been presented.</em>
                        The proper course seems to be in the first place to serve a notice of
                        appeal, which will be for a day in vacation, or so soon thereafter, &amp;c.
                        and then to write to a member of the C. A. asking if and when it will be
                        convenient to him to hear an application under the section. [case references
                        omitted and emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     We agree with the settled approach adopted in
                    the authorities enumerated above. The test for whether proceedings are
                    “pending” is whether the court concerned has the power to make an
                    order on the matters in issue therein. An application for an extension of time
                        <em>to file</em> OS 1175/2013 must be predicated,
                    however, on the implicit assumption that the originating summons was <em>not filed</em> within the stipulated timeline. As
                    OS 1175/2013 was not validly commenced in the first place, there is nothing
                    before this court; consequently, this court does not have the power to make an
                    order on the matters in issue. OS 1175/2013 therefore cannot be said to be
                    “pending” before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Plainly, until and unless proceedings have
                    been validly commenced, proceedings cannot be said to be “pending”
                    before this court. An application for an extension of time to file
                    OS 1175/2013 must be predicated on the admission that OS 1175/2013 has
                        <em>not</em> been <em>regularly
                        filed</em> in the first place. It follows that the Duty Judge, as a
                    single Judge, did not have the same power as the Court of Appeal to grant an
                    extension of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Further, the word “proceeding”
                    in s 36(1) is also qualified by the clauses following it. The word
                    “appeal” is mentioned another three times in s 36(1) itself;
                    a single judge has the power to make orders <em>only</em>
                    in the following three types of situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     an incidental direction not
                        involving the decision of the appeal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     an interim order to prevent injustice to the claims of
                        parties pending the appeal; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     an order for security of costs and for the dismissal of
                        an appeal for default in furnishing security so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is therefore axiomatic that s 36(1) does not envisage a
                        single judge having the power to sit as the Court of Appeal if an <em>appeal</em> has not been validly commenced. We shall
                        elaborate on this point later (at [18]–[25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In this regard, the instant facts are
                    eminently distinguishable from those in the <em>Bank of
                        India</em> case, where Judith Prakash JC (as she then was),
                    sitting as a single judge of the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 36(1),
                    permitted an application to effect service of the appellant’s record of
                    appeal out of time. Proceedings in that particular matter had been validly
                    commenced: the notice of appeal and record of appeal had been regularly filed.
                    The applicant was merely seeking to regularise the <em>service</em> of the record of appeal. This is quite unlike the case
                    before this court, where OS 1175/2013 had not even gotten off the ground in
                    the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the course of argument the AGC, without
                    reference to any authority, urged this court to adopt a purposive approach as
                    mandated by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed).
                    Unfortunately, in our view, this does not assist the AGC. Let us
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 36(1) has a long lineage. Its
                    oldest predecessor is s 52 of the UK Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873
                    (c 66) (UK) (“the 1873 UK Act”), which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any cause or matter pending before the Court of Appeal, any direction
                        incidental thereto, not involving the decision of the appeal, may be given
                        by a single judge of the Court of Appeal; and a single Judge of the Court of
                        Appeal <b><em>may at any time during vacation</em></b> make
                        any interim order to prevent prejudice to the claims of any parties pending
                        an appeal as he may think fit; but every such order made by a single judge
                        may be discharged or varied by the Court of Appeal or a Divisional Court
                        thereof. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>

                    (“s 26(1)”) was the first piece of <em>Singaporean</em> legislation which allowed a single Judge to sit as

                        was originally promulgated out of the necessity to enable urgent
                        applications to be made to a single judge outside of a Court of Appeal
                        sitting.</p>

                        in furnishing security so ordered, may be made by a Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As can be seen, the prerequisite of the Court of Appeal not

                    Federation of Malaya, as well as with British North Borneo (now Sabah) and
                    Sarawak to form Malaysia in 1963. The Federal Court assumed the role of the
                    former Court of Appeal. Section 44(1) of the (Malaysian) Courts of
                    Judicature Act 1964 (Act No 7 of 1964) (“the Malaysian Courts of
                    Judicature Act”) provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any proceeding pending before the Federal Court any direction
                        incidental thereto not involving the decision of the proceeding, any interim

                        the proceeding, any order for security for costs, and for the dismissal of a
                        proceeding for default in furnishing security so ordered <b><em>may at any time</em></b> be made by a Judge of the Federal Court.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 15, 1970 Rev Ed) was promulgated by Act 24 of 1969 after
                    Singapore became an independent nation state in 1965, and restored the <em>status quo ante</em> by re-establishing the Court of Appeal
                    and Court of Criminal Appeal. Section 36(1) of the same has remained
                    unchanged to this day (see above at [9]). Section 36(1) followed the lead
                    of s 44(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act and explicitly added
                    the phrase “may at any time”. This made it clear beyond any doubt
                    whatsoever the removal of the prerequisite that the Court of Appeal must not be
                    sitting for a single judge to make the directions and/or orders listed in
                    s 36(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Interestingly, England only removed the
                    prerequisite of the (English) Court of Appeal not sitting in 1982 with
                    amendments to the then Rules of the Supreme Court. In the Practice Note
                    accompanying the amendments (reported at [1982] 1 WLR 1312), Sir John
                    Donaldson MR had this to say about the move (at 1316B–C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<em>The single judge of the Court of
                            Appeal</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the past a court consisting of at least two judges has had to consider
                        incidental applications, such as those for leave to appeal, for the
                        imposition or removal of orders staying execution or for the grant,
                        variation or discharge of injunctions pending appeal. <b><em>This represented an extravagant use of judicial time</em></b> and
                        rule 10 (9) will now enable all these matters to be considered and
                        disposed of by a single judge sitting in chambers. All such applications
                        will be made by motion: rule 14 (1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clearly, s 36(1) was intended to avoid burdening a
                        three-judge court with applications which could be more expeditiously
                        disposed of by a single judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The common thread throughout all the statutes
                    cited above is the fact that a single judge may make <em>interim</em> orders aimed at preventing prejudice or preserving the
                        <em>status quo</em>. Administrative efficiency is
                    ultimately justified by the fact that the interim orders made are <em>not dispositive of the substantive appeal</em>. This is
                    plainly evident from s 36(3) of the SCJA, which states that “[e]very
                    order so made may be discharged or varied by the Court of Appeal.” There
                    is nothing to discharge or vary if the single judge refuses to grant an
                    extension of time. If an extension of time is not granted, this would be
                    dispositive of the appeal and conclusively settle the respective legal
                    entitlements of the parties, who would be bound by the judgment below. An
                    application for an extension of time to file an originating summons is therefore
                    manifestly not the type of case which was intended to be heard by a single
                    judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The purposive interpretation of s 36(1)
                    suggested by the AGC (ironically) fortifies our earlier conclusion that the
                    AGC’s application for an extension of time did not fall within the meaning
                    of a “proceeding pending”. In any case, this court has severe
                    doubts over whether a purposive interpretation can be used to construe a statute
                    in a way that cannot be supported by the language within.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In response to our observations on the
                    historical basis of s 36(1), the AGC made an oral application for an
                    extension of time to file OS 1175/2013. For reasons that follow, we did not
                    rule on the oral application because it was moot.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Does the Court of Appeal have the jurisdiction to grant leave to
                commence committal proceedings for contempt of court?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Before embarking on an analysis of this issue,
                    it would be helpful to first set out the statutory framework pertaining to the
                    jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. In <em>Re Nalpon Zero
                        Geraldo Mario</em> [2013] 3 SLR 258 (“<em>Zero Nalpon</em>”) at [14], this court emphatically reiterated
                    that the Court of Appeal, being a creature of statute, can only be seized of
                    jurisdiction that is conferred by statute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Section 3 of the SCJA reads as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is evident that <em>none</em> of the provisions in the SCJA confers <em>original</em> jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal. In this regard,
                    the omission of “original” in s 3(<em>b</em>) of the SCJA is telling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     To recapitulate, the AGC relied on O 57
                    r 16(3) of the ROC to apply for leave to commence committal proceedings.
                    O 57 r 16(3) stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an ex parte application has been refused by the Court below, an
                        application for a similar purpose may be made to the Court of Appeal ex
                        parte within 7 days after the date of the refusal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     When we raised the issue of this court’s
                    jurisdiction with counsel for the AGC, the AGC responded with two submissions.
                    First, the plain words of O 57 r 16(3) are wide enough to allow an
                    application to be made in this manner; and, secondly, an application under
                    O 57 r 16(3) was in fact an appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plain reading argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The first submission is, with respect, plainly
                    untenable. As a matter of hierarchy, the Rules of Court is <em>subsidiary</em> legislation that is, by its very nature, subordinate
                    to its parent act, the SCJA, and must thus be read in harmony with the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This is made clear by s 80(1) of the
                    SCJA, which states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Rules Committee constituted under subsection (3) may make Rules
                        of Court <em>regulating and prescribing the procedure
                            (including the method of pleading) and the practice</em> to be
                        followed in the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively in all
                        causes and matters whatsoever <em>in or with respect to which
                            those courts respectively </em><b><em>have for the
                            time being jurisdiction</em></b> (including the procedure and practice
                        to be followed in the Registry of the Supreme Court) and any matters
                        incidental to or relating to any such procedure or practice. [emphasis added
                        in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 80(1) of the SCJA makes it clear that the Rules
                        of Court regulate procedure and practice. The Rules of Court do not, and
                        cannot, confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal by a side wind. O 57
                        r 16(3) presupposes that the court has already been validly seized of
                        jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We would like to add that the proviso to
                    s 29A(1) of the SCJA (“s 29A(1)”) , which reads
                    “subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written
                    law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be
                    brought”, does not assist the AGC. “Subject” is an
                    adjective that expresses the notion that a clause is qualified by the clause
                    that follows it. <em>The Oxford English Dictionary, Volume
                        XVII</em> (2nd ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1989) defines
                    “subject” as (at p 31):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dependent upon a certain correcting or modifying condition; conditional
                        upon; resting upon the assumption of. Freq. <em>advb.</em>, conditionally upon, with the assumption of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>A correcting or modifying condition, as a practical linguistic
                        fact, implies a change that does not completely alter the thing in question.
                        A simple illustration will suffice. Whilst it is theoretically possible to
                        utter the statement that “I have an apple, subject to the fact that
                        it may be an orange”, such a statement would be nonsensical and would
                        not convey any meaning to the recipient of the statement. Applying the same
                        reasoning to s 29A(1), the proviso cannot be read as saying that the
                        other provisions of the SCJA or any other written law may confer
                        non-appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal. Such a reading would
                        constitute a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Section 7(1) of the SCJA also does not
                    assist the AGC as it is a power-conferring and not a jurisdiction-conferring
                    provision (for an explanation of the power-jurisdiction dichotomy, see <em>Zero Nalpon</em> at [30]–[32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Pertinently, the Court of Appeal (and its

                    s 29A did not confer any original jurisdiction to the earlier incarnations

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The only exception was s 45 of the Malaysian
                        Courts of Judicature Act, which conferred original jurisdiction on the
                        Federal Court for certain limited purposes (as listed in Art 128 of the
                        Federal Constitution of Malaysia). This exception pertained to federal
                        matters and therefore need not detain us here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Further, in the context of contempt
                    proceedings, O 52 r 2(2) of the ROC explicitly states that an
                    application for leave to commence committal proceedings is to be made to a
                    Judge. O 52 r 1(3) provides that where contempt of court is committed
                    otherwise than in connection with any proceedings, an order of committal may be
                    made <em>only</em> by the High Court. We would like to
                    point out that, assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the Court
                    of Appeal has the <em>original</em> jurisdiction to grant
                    leave and does grant leave, it would be highly anomalous for the Court of Appeal
                    to then remit the committal application to the High Court as sought by the AGC
                    in the subject application. Ordinarily, the court granting leave would proceed
                    to hear the substantive application. However, our attention was not drawn to any
                    instance in any common law jurisdiction where an appellant court heard contempt
                    proceedings <em>de novo</em>. It would be extremely odd for
                    an appellate court to hear a <em>de novo</em> application,
                    and in this respect we cite the following comment by Sir John
                    Donaldson MR with approval (in the English decision of <em>R
                        v Bolton Justices, ex parte Graeme</em> (1986) 150 JP 190
                        (“<em>Ex parte Graeme</em>”)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it would be very peculiar indeed if this court was to exercise an
                        original jurisdiction to give leave to proceed by judicial review in
                        circumstances in which any consequent decision was unappealable to this
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Drawing the threads together, the inexorable
                    conclusion is that the Court of Appeal does <em>not</em>
                    have the original jurisdiction to grant leave to commence committal
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We would also like to take this opportunity to
                    clarify certain remarks made in <em>Michael Dorsey</em> (at
                    [95] and [96]) which the AGC had referred to when queried by the Duty Registrar
                    on the jurisdictional basis of the application (see above at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">95    However, there appears to be one apparently
                            anomalous exception to the propositions we have set out at [93] and [94]
                            above, namely where an <em>ex parte</em>
                            application is refused at first instance. In that case, under O 57
                            r 16(3) of the Rules of Court, the applicant can renew the
                            application before the Court of Appeal within seven days after the date
                            of hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96    Strictly speaking, an application to the Court of
                            Appeal in these circumstances is not an appeal. In substance, however,
                            it means that a party making an <em>ex parte</em>
                            application is entitled to two tiers of hearings including one before
                            the Court of Appeal as of right. If, on the other hand, an interlocutory
                            order is made on an interlocutory application that is heard <em>inter partes</em>, the default position under the
                            Fourth and Fifth Schedule to the SCJA is that leave of the High Court
                            judge is required before an appeal can be brought to the Court of
                            Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The remarks are of general application and do
                    not apply to particular situations akin to the present where the very
                    jurisdiction of the court is in doubt. [95] and [96] of <em>Michael Dorsey</em> must be read in context. In this regard, [97] of
                        <em>Michael Dorsey</em> states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As <em>ex parte</em> applications are virtually
                        always interlocutory in nature, it is anomalous that a party making an
                        application <em>ex parte</em> is able to renew the
                        application before the Court of Appeal while a party making an application
                            <em>inter partes</em> is not. Should leave be
                        refused by the High Court judge, that would be the end of the matter as the
                        aggrieved party would then have no avenue to obtain leave from the Court of
                        Appeal. <em>In our judgment, legislative intervention would
                            be desirable in this regard</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The point of referring to O 57 r 16(3) was to call
                        attention to the potential anomaly between <em>ex
                            parte</em> and <em>inter partes</em>
                        applications, and how applicants in <em>ex parte</em>
                        applications would potentially enjoy an advantage because leave may not be
                        required for a renewed application before the Court of Appeal. The remarks
                        did not need to consider, and did not in fact consider, the issue of how
                        O 57 r 16(3) interfaced with the concept of
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellate jurisdiction argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second prong relied upon by the AGC was
                    the argument that O 57 r 16(3) was an invocation of the Court of
                    Appeal’s appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The AGC relied on two cases in this regard. In
                        <em>Kemper Reinsurance Co v Minister of Finance and
                        others</em> [2000] 1 AC 1 (“<em>Kemper
                        Reinsurance</em>”), the appellant appealed against a decision
                    of the Court of Appeal of Bermuda whereupon it held that it did not have the
                    jurisdiction to hear appeals from the grant or refusal of leave to apply for
                        <em>certiorari</em>. The Judicial Committee of the
                    Privy Council allowed the appeal and held that the Court of Appeal of Bermuda
                    did have the requisite jurisdiction to hear such appeals. Lord Hoffmann
                    nevertheless went on to observe that (at 18C–D):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships therefore consider that a renewed application to the Court
                        of Appeal under R.S.C., Ord. 59, r. 14(3) is a true appeal with a
                        procedure adapted to its ex parte nature. If the rule had been intended to
                        create an anomalous exception to the principle in <em>Lane v.
                            Esdaile</em> [1891] A.C. 210, it would hardly have been restricted
                        to the refusal of applications ex parte. It should logically have been
                        extended to appeals from the discharge of leave after an inter partes
                        hearing and from a refusal to discharge such leave. But appeals against all
                        such orders are regularly entertained and their existence is inconsistent
                        with the application of the principle in <em>Lane v.
                            Esdaile</em> to appeals from the refusal of leave to apply for
                        judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This brings their Lordships to the decision of the House of Lords in
                            <em>In re Poh</em> [1983] 1 W.L.R. 2.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Ord 59 r 14(3) of the Rules of Supreme Court (UK)
                        (“RSC”) is identical to O 57 r 16(3) of our Rules of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     
          <em>Regina (Burkett) v

                    1 WLR 1593 (“<em>Hammersmith</em>”)
                    concerned a late application for judicial review; the preliminary issue before
                    the House of Lords was whether it had the jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a
                    decision of the Court of Appeal refusing permission to seek judicial review.
                    Lord Steyn observed that (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    … In <em>Kemper Reinsurance
                                Co v Minister of Finance</em> [2000] 1 AC 1 the Privy
                            Council cast doubt on the reasoning in <em>In re
                                Poh</em>. Lord Hoffmann observed, at p 18b, that a
                            renewed application to the Court of Appeal under RSC Ord 59,
                            r 14(3) is a true appeal with a procedure adapted to its ex parte
                            nature. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It is evident that the comments about RSC
                    Ord 59 r 14(3) in both <em>Kemper
                        Reinsurance</em> and <em>Hammersmith</em> were
                    made in the context of exploring the true width of the rule in <em>Lane and another v Esdaile and another</em> [1891] AC 210
                        (“<em>Lane v Esdaile</em>”), and whether
                        <em>In re Poh</em> [1983] 1 WLR 2 had validly
                    extended it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     
          <em>Lane v Esdaile</em>
                    concerned the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords. The appellant sought
                    to appeal against a refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal to
                    the House of Lords. The House of Lords held that it did not have the
                    jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a refusal to grant leave to appeal by the
                    Court of Appeal. Lord Diplock, in the House of Lords decision of <em>In Re Poh</em>, extended the rule in <em>Lane
                        v Esdaile</em> to a refusal to grant leave to commence judicial review
                    proceedings. Both <em>Kemper Reinsurance</em> and <em>Hammersmith</em> disapproved of Lord Diplock’s
                    extension of the <em>Lane v Esdaile</em> rule to judicial
                    review proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Before summarising Lord Hoffmann’s
                    line of logic in <em>Kemper Reinsurance</em>, it is
                    apposite to point out that Bermuda did not have the equivalent of RSC
                    Ord 59 r 14(3) in their procedural rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Kemper
                        Reinsurance</em> Lord Hoffmann was, in fact, attempting to
                    disapprove of <em>In Re Poh</em> on principled grounds.
                    First, he observed that, in England, there was a routine practice of allowing
                    appeals from the discharge of leave after an <em>inter
                        partes</em> hearing and from a refusal to discharge such leave in
                    judicial review proceedings (at 18D). <em>Secondly, he
                        held</em> (at 17D):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At any rate, [RSC Ord 59 r 14(3)] appears to their Lordships to
                        be entirely procedural.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>
<em>He also stated that a renewed application
                            under RSC Ord 59 r 14(3) was “a true
                            appeal”</em> (at 18C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships therefore consider that a renewed application to the Court
                        of Appeal under R.S.C. Ord 59 r 14(3) is a true appeal with a
                        procedure adapted to its ex parte nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Thirdly, he held that the rule in <em>Lane v Esdaile</em> would potentially apply to such appeals
                    since RSC O 59 r 14(3) is merely procedural in nature. Lastly, he
                    pointed out that the routine practice of allowing such appeals meant that
                    judicial review proceedings were in practice not caught by the rule in <em>Lane v Esdaile</em>. It was therefore irrelevant that Bermuda
                    did not have the equivalent of RSC O 59 r 14(3), because English
                    practice showed that the rule in <em>Lane v Esdaile</em>
                    did not extend to judicial review proceedings. Lord Hoffmann, in the
                    alternative, also justified a restrictive reading of the rule in <em>Lane v Esdaile</em> on the basis of the differences between
                    judicial review and an appeal (see 14H–15C), but this is not relevant for
                    our purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The key step in Lord Hoffmann’s
                    reasoning – that RSC Ord 59 r 14(3) is merely procedural and a
                    renewal application under the same is a true appeal – is italicised above.
                    If this key step were to fail, his conclusion that <em>Lane v
                        Esdaile</em> did not apply to judicial review would not follow. This
                    step was problematic on two counts: first, Lord Hoffmann did not consider
                    the possibility that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction and second, the
                    characterisation of a RSC O 59 r 14(3) application as an appeal was
                    unsupported by the weight of authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Lord Hoffmann opined that RSC O 59
                    r 14(3) was procedural (in other words, non-jurisdiction conferring) in
                    nature, and then asserted that an application under the same was a true appeal.
                    With respect, the latter does not necessarily follow from the former. From a
                    logical standpoint, it could very well be the case that the Court of Appeal is
                    exercising an original jurisdiction which may or may not exist, and may or may
                    not stem from a source outside of the Rules of Court (but see below at [58]). It
                    seems, with respect, that Lord Hoffmann observed that the Court of Appeal
                    was exercising an appellate jurisdiction out of expediency in order to justify
                    previous practice (at 18C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But appeals against all such orders are regularly entertained
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Furthermore, Lord Hoffmann referred to
                    only two authorities in support of this step: <em>Underhill’s Manual of Procedure of the Chancery Division</em>
                    (1881) and <em>J O Griffits’s Guide to Crown
                        Office Practice</em> (1947), respectively, both of which suggested
                    that Ord LVIII r 10 of the 1883 Rules of the Supreme Court (the
                    predecessor to Ord 59 r 14(3) of the 1965 Rules of Supreme Court)
                    entailed an appeal, and not a fresh application, to the Court of
                Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     These two books did not, however, cite any
                    cases to support the proposition that an application under Ord LVIII
                    r 10 or Ord 59 r 14(3) was in actuality an appeal. This must be
                    counterbalanced against the wealth of authority wherein appellate courts have
                    persistently held that they were exercising an original jurisdiction in RSC
                    Ord 59 r 14(3) applications (see, for example, <em>Ex
                        parte Graeme</em> at [38]; and the cases cited below at [54] and
                    [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Sir John Donaldson MR made the same
                    point in two cases. In the English Court of Criminal Appeal decision of
                        <em>Dhillon v Secretary of State for the Home
                        Department</em> (1988) 86 CrAppR 14 (at 17) (“<em>Dhillon</em>”), he opined as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, <em>this Court has a special
                            jurisdiction in judicial review matters—the origin of which is
                            lost in the mists of recent antiquity</em> and plainly it is not
                        open to us to challenge it at this stage—whereby we can consider a
                        renewed application for leave to grant judicial review. … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Reg v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex parte
                            Turkoglu</em> [1988] QB 398 (“<em>Turkoglu</em>”), he said (at 400):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… As I pointed out in the judgment, if on the adjourned hearing of
                        the application for leave to apply before the High Court the judge had
                        dismissed the application, there could be no appeal to this court. <em>There would be a power to renew that application to this court,
                            but no appeal</em>: <em>Lane v. Esdaile</em>
                        [1891] A.C. 210. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The English Court of Appeal has even held that
                    it possessed the original jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial
                    review after granting leave to an applicant to do so. <em>Reg v
                        Industrial Injuries Commissioner, ex parte Amalgamated Engineering
                        Union</em> [1966] 2 QB 21 (“<em>Amalagamated Engineering Union</em>”) concerned a trade union
                    which applied <em>ex parte</em> to the Queen’s Bench
                    Division Court for leave to apply for an order of certiorari to quash a decision
                    of the Industrial Injuries Commissioner. The Divisional Court, without stating
                    reasons, refused leave. The trade union renewed their application; the Court of
                    Appeal, consisting of Lord Denning MR, Salmon LJ, and
                    Davies LJ, granted leave. The Ministry opposing the judicial review
                    application argued that the actual application should go back to the Divisional
                    Court, because of RSC Ord 59 r 5, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When leave has been granted to apply for an order of mandamus, prohibition
                        or certiorari, the application shall be made by notice of motion to a
                        Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Lord Denning MR held that RSC
                    Ord 59 r 5 applied only to cases where the Divisional Court itself has
                    granted leave, and not where the Court of Appeal has granted leave. The weight
                    of court practice was against the Ministry. After the introduction of the
                    requirement of leave for judicial review matters (via s 10 of the UK
                    Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1938 (c 63)), the
                    practice had always been for the Court of Appeal itself to hear the judicial
                    review application after the grant of leave. Lord Denning MR further
                    added (at 28–29):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am greatly influenced by the practice of the courts over the years. In a
                        matter such as this, the opinion and practice of the profession certainly
                        makes law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would add this. If the Divisional Court had gone through the full
                        procedure of giving leave to apply for an order of certiorari, and then had
                        heard the other side, and ultimately refused to grant the order, there would
                        clearly have been an appeal to this court on the whole matter. In the
                        present instance they have taken a short cut. They thought that there was no
                        need to hear the other side at all. So they refused leave at once. It would
                        be absurd for us to send it back to them to hear a case which they thought
                        so plain. It is much better for us to hear it straight away. I think the
                        preliminary objection is not well founded, and the court should go on and
                        hear the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The position is surely <em>a
                            fortiori</em> for an application under RSC Ord 59
                        r 14(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     With respect, <em>Kemper
                        Reinsurance</em> and <em>Hammersmith</em> obscure
                    the settled position. Whilst we agree that the Rules of the Supreme Court are
                    merely procedural in nature, it seems to us implausible to deem an application
                    under RSC Ord 59 r 14(3) (and therefore O 57 r 16(3) of the
                    ROC) to be an invocation of the court’s appellate jurisdiction. To
                    reiterate, RSC Ord 59 r 14(3) merely states that “an
                    application for a similar purpose may be made to the Court of
                    Appeal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Further, there are also significant
                    differences between the jurisdictional bases of the English Court of Appeal and
                    the Singapore Court of Appeal. When <em>Dhillon</em> and
                        <em>Turkoglu</em> were decided, the relevant
                    jurisdiction-conferring provision was s 15(2) of the UK Supreme Court Act
                    1981 (c 54) (“the 1981 UK Act”), which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be
                        exercisable by the Court of Appeal —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    all such
                                jurisdiction (whether civil or criminal) as is conferred on it by
                                this or any other Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    
                <em>all such other jurisdiction (whether civil or criminal)
                                    as was exercisable by it immediately before the commencement of
                                    this Act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The language of s 15(2)(<em>b</em>) clearly contemplates that the English Court of Appeal
                    could exercise “all such other” jurisdiction that it used to
                    historically exercise. This is in sharp contrast to Singapore’s statutory
                    provisions, which clearly state that the Court of Appeal only exercises an
                    appellate jurisdiction, with s 3 of the SCJA, in particular, omitting the
                    word “original” when the Court of Appeal is mentioned in
                        s 3(<em>b</em>) (as opposed to when the High Court
                    is mentioned in s 3(<em>a</em>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>WEA Records Ltd v Visions Channel 4 Ltd and
                        others</em> [1983] 1 WLR 721, Sir John Donaldson MR
                    commented on the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as follows (at 727):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The Court of Appeal hears appeals from orders and judgments. It
                        does not hear original applications save to the extent that these are
                        ancillary to an appeal, and <em>save in respect of an
                            entirely anomalous form of proceeding in relation to the grant of leave
                            to apply to the Divisional Court for judicial review.</em>

                        583 (“<em>Ocean Software</em>”),
                        Scott LJ considered the 1981 UK Act and cited the above passage with
                        approval (at 589).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The same result obtains when one engages in a
                    semantic enquiry into what constitutes an “appeal”.
                    “Appeal” is defined by <em>Jowitt’s
                        Dictionary of English Law</em> (D Greenberg, gen ed)
                    (3rd ed, 2010) at p 137, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The judicial examination by a higher court of the decision of an inferior
                        court. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In essence, an appeal necessarily entails the
                    examination of a decision made by an inferior court. There is nothing to examine
                    if an application under O 57 r 16(3) “for a similar
                    purpose” is made to the Court of Appeal. In such an application, the
                    Court of Appeal is looking at the matter completely afresh and without having
                    the benefit of the reasoned grounds upon which the application has been refused
                    by the High Court. This is also supported by the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Subesh v Secretary of State for the Home
                        Department and other appeals</em> [2004] All ER (D) 326 (Mar),
                    where it was stated that (at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer is, we think, ultimately to be found in the reason why (as we
                        have put it) the appeal process is not merely a re-run second time around of
                        the first instance trial. It is because of the law's acknowledgement of an
                        important public interest, namely that of finality in litigation. <em>The would-be appellant does not approach the appeal court as if
                            there had been no first decision, as if, so to speak, he and his
                            opponent were to meet on virgin territory. …</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     A structural examination of the ROC supports
                    the semantic proposition that an O 57 r 16(3) application is not an appeal.
                    O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An appeal to the Court of Appeal <em>shall</em> be by
                        way of rehearing and <b><em>must </em></b><em>be brought by notice of appeal in Form 112.</em> [emphasis
                        added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The use of “must” means that, under the Rules of
                        Court, O 57 r 3(1) is the <em>only</em> means
                        of commencing an appeal. The characterisation of an O 57 r 16(3)
                        application as an appeal is therefore manifestly repugnant to the clear
                        words of O 57 r 3(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     O 57 r 5(1) of the ROC also
                    stipulates that, when a notice of appeal has been filed, the Judge who gave the
                    judgment or made the order must certify in writing the grounds of the judgment
                    or order, unless the judgment has already been written. This procedure is
                    emblematic of an appeal, and ensures that the Court of Appeal is able to examine
                    the decision of the court below. Other consequences also flow from the filing of
                    the notice of appeal; for instance, under O 57 r 9, the appellant must
                    file, amongst other things, the appellant’s case and a core bundle within
                    two months of the record of proceedings being available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     None of the above features is present where an
                    O 57 r 16(3) application for a similar purpose is made to the Court of
                    Appeal. The ineluctable conclusion is that such an application is <em>not</em> an appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is not to the point that O 57
                    r 16(3) entails a “procedure adapted to its <em>ex
                        parte</em> nature” (as <em>Kemper
                        Reinsurance</em> and <em>Hammersmith</em> have
                    asserted (see above at [43] and [44])). The usual provisions in the ROC are more
                    than capable of handling an appeal from the refusal of an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application. For instance, there would be no need to serve
                    the notice of appeal on the respondent (O 57 r 9(1)) because there is
                    no respondent. There is also no need for the respondent’s case to be filed
                    (O 57 r 9A(2)). If the appeal is urgent, an application may be made to
                    expedite the hearing of the appeal (O 57 r 20).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     We thus only partially agree with the
                    following comment made in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure
                        2013</em> (G P Selvam ed-in-chief)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2013) (“<em>White
                        Book</em>”) at para 57/16/3:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But if the application to the court below is refused, the application to
                        the Court of Appeal is not an appeal. The jurisdiction is concurrent
                            (<em>Cropper v Smith</em> (1883) 24 Ch.D 305;
                            <em>Brown v Brook</em> (1902) 86 L.T. 372,
                        CA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We agree that an O 57 r 16(3)
                    application is not an appeal. We do not agree with the blanket statement that
                    jurisdiction is “concurrent”, as we shall elaborate on in the
                    section below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A coda on the incidental appellate jurisdiction of the Court of
                Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     O 57 r 16(3) is nonetheless not
                        <em>ultra vires</em> vis-à-vis the SCJA. An application
                    under O 57 r 16(3) can be made if there are statutory grounds for the
                    assumption of jurisdiction by the Court of Appeal. For instance, prior to the
                    enactment of our Supreme Court of Judicature Amendment Act 2010 (No 30 of
                    2010), s 34(2) of the SCJA expressly provided for the “Court of
                    Appeal or a Judge” granting leave to appeal in certain enumerated
                    circumstances. The current s 34(2) however no longer confers jurisdiction
                    on the Court of Appeal to grant leave to appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In the current statutory framework,
                    s 29A(3) of the SCJA is one such jurisdiction-conferring provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of and <b><em>incidental</em></b> to —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    
                <b><em>the hearing and determination of any appeal</em></b>
                                to the Court of Appeal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    the amendment,
                                execution and enforcement of any judgment or order made on such an
                                appeal,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court of Appeal shall have all the authority and jurisdiction of the
                        court or tribunal from which the appeal was brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 29A(3) of the SCJA confers on the Court of Appeal
                        the jurisdiction and powers of the court below if this is <em>incidental</em> to the hearing and determination of an appeal.
                        For ease of reference, this shall be hereinafter referred to as the
                        incidental appellate jurisdiction of the Court of
                Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Ocean Software</em> is highly relevant in this
                    regard. It is apposite to first set out s 15(3) of the 1981 UK Act, which
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For all purposes of or incidental to —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the hearing and
                                determination of any appeal to the civil division of the Court of
                                Appeal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    the amendment,
                                execution and enforcement of any judgment or order made on such an
                                appeal,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court of Appeal shall have all the authority <em>and
                            jurisdiction</em> of the court or tribunal from which the appeal
                        was brought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The language utilised in s 15(3) of the 1981 UK Act is
                        identical to that used in s 29A of our SCJA, save for the phrase
                        “[f]or all purposes of or incidental to” being used in the
                        former and “[f]or the purposes of and incidental to” being
                        used in the latter. This is not, in our view, a material
                    difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The facts of <em>Ocean
                        Software</em> are as follows. The English High Court refused to grant
                    the plaintiff’s <em>ex parte</em> application for a
                        <em>Mareva</em> injunction. The plaintiff appealed to
                    the Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal and granted the <em>Mareva</em> injunction. One of the orders gave either party liberty
                    to apply to discharge or vary the injunction. The defendant applied to the Court
                    of Appeal to discharge the <em>ex parte Mareva</em>
                    injunction, whereupon the plaintiff applied for additional interlocutory relief
                    with respect to a prospective income stream. Scott LJ held that the Court
                    of Appeal did not have the jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s
                    application for additional interlocutory relief because s 15(3) of the 1981
                    UK Act was inapplicable (at 588C–E):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the line is to be drawn between applications which are ancillary to
                        the exercise by the Court of Appeal of its appellate jurisdiction and
                        applications which are free-standing first instance applications may be
                        difficult to draw. It may be a matter of degree. In the present case, the
                        proposed application by the plaintiff to apply for additional relief in
                        order to protect its share of future payments of royalties that may be
                        received by the third defendant from Nintendo is clearly, in my opinion, on
                        the wrong side of the jurisdictional line. It is not ancillary to any
                        appeal. An application to discharge an ex parte injunction on the ground
                        that the plaintiff's cause of action is insufficiently substantial to
                        justify the grant of the injunction also, in my opinion, falls on the wrong
                        side of the line. It is not ancillary to an order allowing an appeal against
                        a first instance refusal of the injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     We agree with Scott LJ’s comments.
                    If an appeal has been validly commenced in this court, an application may be
                    made to this court if the application is incidental to the hearing and
                    determination of the appeal. We accept that the line between a free-standing and
                    incidental application is potentially difficult to draw. The precise contours of
                    the line to be drawn can only be determined on a case by case
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The question of whether the incidental
                    appellate jurisdiction of this court was invoked did not arise on the facts of
                    this case. Counsel for the AGC contended that their O 57 r 16(3)
                    application was in actuality an appeal. As we have already explained, an
                    O 57 r 16(3) application is not an appeal. There was no appeal before
                    this court; there cannot therefore be anything incidental to a non-existent
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     An O 57 r 16(3) application may be
                    validly made if and only if the application is pursuant to the incidental
                    appellate jurisdiction of the court. We turn now to the two cases raised by the
                        <em>White Book</em> (see above at [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Cropper v Smith</em> (1883) 24 ChD 305
                    concerned an application to stay an assessment of damages hearing pending an
                    appeal. The application was initially refused by the court below. The applicant
                    renewed his application before the Court of Appeal. Brett MR held that (at
                    308-309):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By that rule it is assumed that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction, and
                        to my mind, according to the true reading of that rule, not a jurisdiction
                        by way of appeal merely, but an independent jurisdiction, …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Then in order that the Court of Appeal and the Court below may not incur
                        the risk of deciding in different ways as to staying proceedings without
                        either of them knowing of the application to the other the rule imposes this
                        limitation, that although the jurisdiction is co-ordinate, and although it
                        is alternative, yet the Court of Appeal will not exercise its jurisdiction
                        until it knows whether the co-ordinate jurisdiction of the Divisional Court
                        has been exercised and how. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     These comments must be read in light of the
                    statutory provisions then in force. The relevant part of s 19 of the 1873
                    UK Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For all the purposes of and incidental to the hearing and determination of
                        any appeal within its jurisdiction, and the amendment, execution and
                        enforcement of any judgment or order made on any such appeal, and for the
                        purpose of every other authority expressly given to the Court of Appeal by
                        this Act, <em>the Court of Appeal shall have the power,
                            authority and</em><b><em> jurisdiction
                            </em></b><em>by this Act vested in the High Court of
                            Justice.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is clear that Brett MR’s reference to the
                        “independent jurisdiction” of the English Court of Appeal is a
                        reference to, in our terminology, the <em>incidental</em> appellate jurisdiction of the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Brown v Brook</em> (1902) 86 LT 373 is
                    similar. The plaintiff appealed against a decision by Ridley J, and applied
                    to the Court of Appeal for a stay of execution. The plaintiff did not first
                    apply to the court below because Ridley J was “away on
                    circuit”. The Court of Appeal held that it had the jurisdiction to hear
                    the plaintiff’s application, but did not indicate the source of the
                    jurisdiction. In our view the source of the court’s jurisdiction was
                    s 19 of the 1873 UK Act, and is properly characterised as <em>incidental</em> appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     OS 1175/2013 was therefore dismissed with
                    no order as to costs. Counsel for Alex Au, Mr Peter Low
                    (“Mr Low”), asked for costs at the conclusion of proceedings.
                    We declined to do so because we did not hear OS 59/2014; Mr Low did
                    not participate in proceedings before us and did not raise any of the legal
                    issues considered above.</p>
