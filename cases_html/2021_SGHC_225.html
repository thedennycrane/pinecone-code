One party asserts that a binding and complete agreement was concluded, while the other party insists that the parties were only in the stage of negotiations, with no firm agreement having been reached.  In such cases, much often turns on the alleged terms of the pleaded agreement, and whether the court can objectively ascertain from all the evidence, particularly the written communications exchanged, that the pleaded agreement had indeed come into existence.  What is somewhat different about this case is the almost complete absence of any contemporaneous documentation in relation to the alleged agreement.  The court is thus left to grapple with the credibility of the protagonists’ oral evidence, and to test the inherent probabilities of their various allegations against the objective facts and the conduct of the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff (“Dr Wong”) is the managing director of Advanced Holdings Ltd (“AHL”), a company which he started many years ago.

</div>  I accept that the latter argument of repudiation is the real thrust of Mr Lim’s case in the counterclaim.  This is because even on Mr Lim’s version of events, there was quite clearly no total failure of consideration in respect of the oral agreement, given that Dr Wong did sell 17 million AHL shares to BD Corp in 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In any case, the reliefs that Mr Lim is seeking have remained constant.  He seeks an order that Dr Wong repay the premium of $2,975,000 paid for the 5.6% stake in AHL in 2013.  Alternatively, he asserts that he should be entitled to “reverse” the transaction for the purchase of the 5.6% stake in AHL from Dr Wong in 2013, such that Dr Wong be ordered to repay Mr Lim the sum of $7.14m, and the 17 million AHL shares will be returned to Dr Wong.

If so, I also have to decide what the terms of this oral agreement were.  Did it include a term that Dr Wong had to procure the acquisition of BDCE by AHL?  Also, was BD Corp’s purchase of a 5.6% stake in AHL from Dr Wong part of this alleged oral agreement?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further to this, if the oral agreement as pleaded is found to exist, the other issues that will arise for determination are whether Mr Lim is entitled to the remedies that he seeks, including the primary relief sought of an order that the premium of $2,975,000, paid by BD Corp for the purchase of the 5.6% stake in AHL, be repaid by Dr Wong.  Alternatively, should the court order that the transaction involving the purchase of the 5.6% stake be “reversed”?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The oral agreement in 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Let me start by pointing out my concern that there has been no contemporaneous documentary evidence of any sort produced by the parties that would shed light on whether the oral agreement was indeed reached in 2013.  There is no evidence before me of any letters or emails exchanged, or any other form of electronic communications such as text or WhatsApp messages, that would support a finding as to the existence, or otherwise, of the oral agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I do not think that it is at all unrealistic to expect that, if a deal had indeed been discussed at length and concluded orally in 2013, there would exist some written record of the parties’ discussions, the terms negotiated or the consensus reached.  After all, this would have been a deal in the magnitude of $36m, which, according to Mr Lim, was the agreed consideration for Dr Wong’s stake in AHL.  As the burden of proof is ultimately on Mr Lim to establish the existence of the oral agreement on a balance of probabilities, the complete absence of any written evidence is a factor that weighs against his case on the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The accounts by Mr Lim and Dr Wong as to what transpired from June to August 2013 are, not unexpectedly, quite different.  Mr Lim’s version is that Dr Wong told him about his desire to retire and his willingness to hand AHL over to a successor.

</div>  The convoluted structure of the deal was because Mr Lim did not have sufficient funds to buy the whole of the 29%  stake in AHL in one transaction, and did not know when he would be able to raise the necessary funds.  Notwithstanding this, Mr Lim testified that Dr Wong’s response was that he would wait for Mr Lim to raise the funds.  However, Dr Wong wanted a “deposit” to be paid.  As such, Mr Lim agreed to buy the 5.6% stake first, and it was agreed that there was no fixed time frame for Mr Lim to complete his purchase of the remaining 23.4% stake.

</div>  What is far more likely is that the parties had some discussions about a potential sale of Dr Wong’s stake in AHL, but then agreed simply to enter into more detailed discussions on the potential sale at some later date, when Mr Lim had sorted out his funding issues.  In my judgment, Mr Lim would have fully appreciated the commercial realities of the situation, and he could not have honestly believed that Dr Wong had already made a legal commitment to sell his remaining stake in AHL.  While I also accept that it is likely that the impression given by Dr Wong to Mr Lim in their discussions must have been that he was prepared to relinquish control of his shares in AHL, this does not change the analysis as to whether the two men had concluded a binding agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Mr Lim seeks to buttress his account with the evidence of his then business partner, Mr Ng Kok Teck (“Mr Ng”).

</div>  Second, even in Mr Ng’s account, the language used is tentative.  In the passage quoted above, Mr Ng speaks of discussions and plans, but not of agreements.

This evidence spans four aspects of the parties’ subsequent conduct: (a) the September 2013 purchase by BD Corp of the 5.6% stake in AHL from Dr Wong; (b) AHL’s proposed acquisition of BDCE in 2014; (c) Mr Lim’s attempt to purchase Dr Wong’s remaining 23.4% stake in AHL in 2017; and (d) the loan from Dr Wong to Mr Lim in 2015 and Mr Lim’s responses to Dr Wong’s subsequent attempts to obtain repayment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd v Jiacipto Jiaravanon </span>[2019] 1 SLR 696 at [78], “where the court is ascertaining whether a contract has been formed, evidence of subsequent conduct has traditionally been regarded as admissible and relevant” [emphasis in original omitted].  While the Court of Appeal noted that there is some instability in this rule, it was satisfied that the subsequent communications and conduct raised in that case was, at least in part, an aid in objectively ascertaining the existence of an agreement, as “[t]here [was] no reason to doubt that they were candidly expressed and undertaken” (at [78]–[79]).  In similar fashion, I find it useful to consider whether the subsequent conduct canvassed by the parties in this matter was consistent with the supposed existence of the oral agreement.  In doing so, I note that this conduct took place before the emergence of the dispute between the parties, and was therefore unlikely to have been undertaken with an eye to buttressing either party’s position in this Suit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The September 2013 purchase of the 5.6% AHL stake</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The first aspect of the parties’ subsequent conduct, the September 2013 purchase by BD Corp of the 5.6% AHL stake from Dr Wong, is the subject of Mr Lim’s main contention in his submissions.

</div>  I find that Mr Lim’s procurement of BD Corp’s purchase of this 5.6% stake was, in his mind, the first step in his plan of trying to acquire a controlling stake in AHL.  It is likely that in proceeding with this purchase at a premium, Mr Lim wanted to demonstrate to Dr Wong his sincerity and commitment, and to show that he was serious about wanting to acquire, eventually, a controlling stake in AHL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, the above only speaks to Mr Lim’s intentions at the time.  Dr Wong’s evidence is that he regarded his AHL shares as being more valuable than what the traded price indicated, and that he was thus insistent on a premium over that traded price before he was prepared to part with his AHL shares.

</div>  I find this to be a credible and perfectly sensible explanation for what the premium meant to Dr Wong, and therefore why he agreed to the sale of a 5.6% stake in AHL in September 2013 only when such a premium was on the table.  There is no objective evidence that Dr Wong expressed agreement with Mr Lim’s intentions even <span class="font-italic">generally</span>, with regard to the latter’s desire to ultimately acquire a controlling stake in AHL.  There is also certainly <span class="font-italic">not</span> enough evidence which would allow the court to find <span class="font-italic">specifically</span>, on a balance of probabilities, that Dr Wong had agreed sometime in June to August 2013 to eventually sell a 29% stake in AHL to Mr Lim at the price of $36m, and that BD Corp’s purchase of the 5.6% stake was a first step in this overarching agreement.  The only conclusion that can be drawn about the basis of this transaction is from its objective terms – the transfer of a 5.6% stake from Dr Wong to BD Corp in exchange for $7.14m – and Mr Lim’s intentions cannot, in the absence of supporting evidence, change that complexion. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">AHL’s proposed acquisition of BDCE in 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 An examination of the subsequent conduct of the two men in 2014 also militates against any finding of an oral agreement on the terms alleged by Mr Lim.

</div>  Based on the pleaded case, this was <span class="font-italic">not</span> simply an obligation on Dr Wong to endeavour, or use his best efforts, to procure AHL to purchase BDCE.

I also find Mr Lim’s evidence in relation to this term to be somewhat inconsistent.  As he was at pains to explain in his oral evidence, he did not have the funds in 2013 to immediately proceed with the purchase of the full 29% stake in AHL from Dr Wong.  He could only raise around $7m in cash, which BD Corp then used to purchase the 5.6% stake in AHL.  He gave evidence that his bankers were willing to lend him about $20m, but he was still short of funds to the tune of about $9m, which he needed to pay the full consideration of $36m for the 29% stake in AHL from Dr Wong.  As such, to Mr Lim, AHL’s acquisition of BDCE was a critical part of his deal with Dr Wong.  It would provide him the needed cash to proceed with the purchase of the remaining 23.4% stake in AHL.

</div>  This is difficult to believe; after all, if the oral agreement had been concluded, it would not have been a mere “detail” but rather the entire basis for the acquisition of BDCE in the first place.  It is quite implausible that the oral agreement would not have crossed his mind then.  This indicates to me that the truth is that Dr Wong had never promised him that AHL would definitely acquire BDCE.  Therefore, it is clear that the true position is as set out in the MOU.  In fact, in another part of his evidence under cross-examination, Mr Lim admitted that Dr Wong had told him, when the proposed acquisition of BDCE was discussed, that it was up to AHL’s board to decide whether to proceed with the deal.

</div>  This again contradicts his pleaded case that the oral agreement required Dr Wong to procure AHL to acquire BDCE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Mr Lim’s evidence, which suggests an uncomplaining acceptance of AHL’s decision not to proceed with the BDCE acquisition, also does not cohere with the commercial reality that, without the acquisition proceeding, he would not receive the funds that would enable him to go ahead and perform his part of the oral agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the purchase of the remaining 23.4% stake in AHL from Dr Wong.  That would effectively mean that Dr Wong had repudiated the oral agreement, which would have put an end to Mr Lim’s plans to take a controlling stake in AHL.  Also, it would mean that, from Mr Lim’s perspective, BD Corp had paid a premium of $2,975,000 for Dr Wong’s 5.6% stake in AHL for no real purpose.  Despite all this, the evidence showed no protest at all by Mr Lim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 When cross-examined about this state of affairs being inconsistent with the oral agreement, Mr Lim’s explanation was that Dr Wong had, upon the falling-through of the acquisition of BDCE, told him that he would wait for Mr Lim to raise the funds to proceed with the purchase of the 23.4% stake in AHL.  There was no time frame agreed for these funds to be raised.  According to Mr Lim, Dr Wong promised that, if he had not sold this 23.4% stake in AHL by the time funds were raised, whenever that might be, he would sell those shares to Mr Lim.

</div>  If this were all true, that would mean that the oral agreement had been varied by the parties, <span class="font-italic">after</span> AHL decided not to proceed with the acquisition of BDCE.  Yet, this alleged variation of the oral agreement was not pleaded by Mr Lim, or even raised in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In summary, I find Mr Lim’s evidence in relation to the failed BDCE acquisition to be incongruent with his pleaded case on the alleged oral agreement with Dr Wong, and also quite strained as a matter of logic.  His evidence on this issue appears to have deviated from his case that Dr Wong was obliged to cause AHL to acquire BDCE.  I must also emphasise once more the difficulty of accepting, as a matter of commercial reality, that these two experienced businessmen would have reached a legally binding agreement that would effectively be open-ended as to when the purchase of the 23.4% stake in AHL held by Dr Wong would take place.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The discussions in 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Another aspect of the parties’ subsequent conduct brought up by Mr Lim was his 2017 attempt to proceed with the acquisition of Dr Wong’s shares in AHL.  Mr Lim’s evidence is that, in 2017, he was in a position to raise funds to do so.

</div>  The reasons for the loan are not relevant to Mr Lim’s counterclaim.  What is relevant though is that, in the entire period of time from the end of the parties’ discussions in 2017 until the commencement of these legal proceedings by Dr Wong in October 2020, Mr Lim never once asserted that he did not have to repay the outstanding loan amount to Dr Wong because the latter had “reneged” on the oral agreement, and was liable to repay Mr Lim the premium of $2,975,000 BD Corp paid for the 5.6% stake in AHL.

This is particularly when Mr Lim’s claim for the return of the premium of $2,975,000 far exceeds the amount that remained due under the loan agreement, which was $900,000.  Quite to the contrary, Mr Lim gave evidence that, when Dr Wong chased him for the repayment of the loan during the period from 2017 to 2020, he told Dr Wong that he needed time to raise funds.

</div>  There was no attempt to explain why he did not simply raise his claim for the refund of $2,975,000, as a set-off against Dr Wong’s claim for the outstanding loan.  Given these circumstances, while it is certainly not determinative of the issue, I find that Mr Lim’s conduct adversely affects the credibility of his evidence that there was an oral agreement between him and Dr Wong. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In sum, I find that Mr Lim’s counterclaim faced difficulties from the very outset, being unsupported by contemporaneous documents of any sort.  His account of the alleged oral agreement was beset by implausibility and a lack of clarity.  None of the instances he raised of the parties’ subsequent conduct successfully advanced his counterclaim; on the contrary, some of these instances undermined it, and suggested that there had been no oral agreement between him and Dr Wong as alleged.  Consequently, I find that Mr Lim has not proven his counterclaim on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The legal basis of the reliefs sought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Given my analysis and findings above, it is strictly not necessary for me to deal with the legal reliefs sought by Mr Lim.  However, I think it behoves me to make the following observations about whether the prayed-for reliefs may be sustained as a matter of law, to perhaps serve as some guidance for other litigants and counsel, who may find themselves dealing with similar issues in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As I have already mentioned, the primary relief sought by Mr Lim for the breach of the alleged oral agreement is that the court order Dr Wong to refund him the premium of $2,975,000 for the transaction involving the purchase of the 5.6% stake in AHL.  What appears to have been glossed over is the fact that it was <span class="font-italic">not</span> Mr Lim who acquired the 5.6% stake in AHL from Dr Wong.

</div>
</div>  While not specifically explained in his closing submissions, I take it that Mr Lim is seeking to rescind the transaction, in the sense that he is asking the court to unravel the transaction by ordering Dr Wong to refund the consideration he received of $7.14m, and for BD Corp to transfer the 17 million shares back to Dr Wong.  In my judgment, this prayed-for relief of rescission suffers from several insurmountable problems.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, as in the case of the primary relief, it is not one that is available to Mr Lim, since he was not the person who acquired the shares from Dr Wong.  For rescission to be even theoretically available, BD Corp should have been made a party to this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, as a general rule, rescission <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> is not available as a remedy for a claim in breach of contract.  For such claims, the usual remedy is instead an award of damages, which seeks to place the innocent party, so far as money can do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed.  This was clearly elucidated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hong Fok Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There was a patent confusion of thought when reference was made to <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span> in the sense of restoring the parties to their respective positions as if the contract had not been made, or the <span class="font-italic">status quo ante</span> as it was put. It is quite inappropriate in a case like the present where the rescission is not on the footing that the contract was void <span class="font-italic">ab initio</span> because of some vitiating factor like fraud or mistake, but on the footing that the other party had been guilty of repudiatory breach and that repudiatory breach had been accepted by the innocent party. In this type of situation, the innocent party is entitled to treat the contract as having come to an end and to sue for damages. The object of the award of damages in this type of situation is not to restore the parties to their respective positions as if the contract had not been made, but rather, in recognition of the existence of the contract and the subsequent breach, to compensate the innocent party, as far as money can do so, for the loss, damage and injury which he has suffered as a result of the breach. It is to place the innocent party, so far as money can do so, in the same position as if the contract had been performed. It is clear that any argument about placing both parties in their respective positions as if the contract had not been made is entirely out of place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Mr Lim’s case is that Dr Wong has committed a repudiatory breach of the oral agreement.  It would therefore be “inappropriate”, as the Court of Appeal put it, for rescission <span class="font-italic">ab initio </span>to be ordered.  Even if Mr Lim had established liability on the part of Dr Wong, he would have been restricted to damages as his relief, and to quantify such damages, he would also have had to prove the loss that he suffered from that repudiatory breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Third, it emerged during Mr Lim’s evidence on cross-examination that the interest in some of the AHL shares acquired by BD Corp had been transferred to other parties, or otherwise encumbered.  Mr Lim’s evidence was that, in the course of the period from 2013 to 2017, some portion of the acquired AHL shares were pledged to a bank and later to a securities brokerage firm.

</div>  This issue was not taken up by counsel for Mr Lim when Dr Wong was being cross-examined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Neither party addressed me on the impact of these transactions on the availability of rescission.  I would therefore simply observe that rescission may be barred where third party rights have intervened and title has passed to an innocent third party purchaser for value (see <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Goh Seng Heng and another </span>[2020] 3 SLR 335 at [100], which was upheld on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd and other appeals and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 606), and that it is not clear whether the 17 million shares in AHL purchased by BD Corp can be restored to Dr Wong.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For the reasons set out above, I find that Mr Lim has failed to establish his counterclaim.  He has not been able to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he and Dr Wong had entered into an oral agreement in 2013 for the acquisition of a 29% stake in AHL from Dr Wong, and that Dr Wong then failed to perform his obligations under the agreement.  Even if he had been able to prove as much, the reliefs that he is seeking cannot be granted.  As such, Mr Lim’s counterclaim is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I will deal separately with the issue of costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Kan Kiang Roy (Sterling Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Cheng Kiong (CK Tan Law Corporation) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
