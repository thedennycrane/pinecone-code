The Wife, who was born in 1967, and the Husband, who was born in 1952, were married in February 2011. Prior to their marriage, the parties cohabited for a period of about 12 years beginning in 1999. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings in July 2016 and obtained interim judgment on 16 August 2016. Thus, the formal length of the marriage was about five and a half years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Husband is presently 66 years old and is employed as a lawyer. The Wife is 52 years old and is a real estate salesperson who has attained a senior position within a major real estate agency. There are no children of the marriage. However, during the relationship, the parties lived with the Wife’s two children from a previous marriage: a son, [P], who was born in 1991; and a daughter, [Q], who was born in 1994. [P] and [Q] were eight and five years old respectively at the time the parties began cohabiting, and 20 and 17 years old respectively at the time of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The issues in dispute between the parties broadly relate to the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. With regard to the latter, in this case, it is the Husband who seeks maintenance on the basis that he is an “incapacitated husband” within the meaning of s 113(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The parties have taken sharply diverging positions over (a) the identity of the assets within the matrimonial pool, (b) the value of those assets and (c) the appropriate ratio for division. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Before I turn to these issues, I address the preliminary matter of which of two possible approaches I shall apply in dividing the matrimonial assets – the global assessment methodology or the classification methodology. The former methodology, which is more commonly used (see <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1172 (“<span class="font-italic">TNC v</span><span class="font-italic"> TND</span>”) at [39]), consists of four phases: First, the court identifies and pools all the matrimonial assets; secondly, the court assesses the net value of the pool of assets; thirdly, the court determines a just and equitable division of the assets; and fourthly, the court decides on the most convenient way to achieve these proportions of division (see <span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span>”) at [31]). As for the latter classification methodology, the court divides the matrimonial assets into various classes and then separately considers the parties’ contributions in relation to each class of assets (<span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">NK v NL</span> at [33] and [35], both approaches are consistent with the legislative framework under s 112 of the Women’s Charter, and in most cases, both approaches will lead to the same result. However, the classification approach is generally appropriate where there are multiple classes of assets which “lend themselves to classification” (see <span class="font-italic">AYQ v AYR </span>[2013] 1 SLR 476 at [19]) and where parties have made different contributions in relation to each class (<span class="font-italic">NK v NL </span>at [35]). The classification methodology may also be appropriate where certain assets are “not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represents” (see <span class="font-italic">TNC v TND </span>at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the present case, I consider that it is appropriate to adopt the global assessment methodology rather than the classification methodology for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the assets do not lend themselves readily to the classification approach as there is no clearly distinguishable asset or group of assets in which the proportion of the parties’ respective contributions is different from the other assets. It will be seen that across the various matrimonial assets, the Wife has generally made greater direct contributions.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the parties have made their submissions on the basis that the global assessment methodology would be employed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, while it might be said that some of the assets which were purchased prior to the marriage are “not wholly the gains of the co-operative partnership of efforts that the marriage represents” (see [15]–[20] below), this will be addressed by excluding from the pool of assets a <span class="font-italic">pro rata</span> value corresponding to the amount which was paid for prior to the marriage (see [70]–[80] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I shall discuss the identity and value of the matrimonial assets, and the appropriate ratio for division in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Identifying the matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Wife owns a total of 17 residential and non-residential properties, some of which are held through companies of which the Wife is a sole shareholder. As a preliminary matter, it should be noted that for the purpose of these proceedings, the parties have agreed that there is no need to value the holding companies and the value to be ascribed to these companies shall be taken as the value of the properties owned by each respective company, if any.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Of the 17 real properties owned by the Wife, it is common ground between the parties that the following seven properties which were purchased during the marriage should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) A property at Telok Kurau Road (“the Telok Kurau Property”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) A condominium unit on Fraser Street (“the Fraser Street Property”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Two units at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 (“Bukit Batok Property A” and “Bukit Batok Property B” respectively);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Two units at Alexandra Road (“Alexandra Property A and Alexandra Property B” respectively); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) A condominium unit at Changi Road (“the Changi Road Property”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In addition, the parties also agree that a property at Sunrise Close (“the Sunrise Close Property”) should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets because, while it was purchased by the Wife before the marriage, it was used by the parties as their matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assets purchased before the marriage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The main point in dispute relates to whether the following nine properties, which were purchased by the Wife before the marriage (“the Pre-Marriage Properties”), should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) A unit at Bedok North Street 3 (“the Bedok North Property”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Two units at Telok Blangah Drive (“Telok Blangah Property A” and “Telok Blangah Property B” respectively);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) A unit at Compassvale Bow (“the Compassvale Property”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) A unit at Marina Boulevard in which the Wife has a one-third share (“the Marina Boulevard Property”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Two units at Robertson Quay (“Robertson Quay Property A” and “Robertson Quay Property B” respectively); </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) A property at Woodleigh Close (“the Woodleigh Property”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) A property at Leedon Heights (“the Leedon Property”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By way of interjection, I note that the Husband has suggested that Robertson Quay Property B, the Leedon Property and the Woodleigh Property were purchased or acquired after the marriage because the transfer of title for these properties was only registered after the marriage.

</div> She submits that these were assets acquired before the marriage and, pursuant to s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), such assets only constitute matrimonial assets if they were ordinarily used or enjoyed by the parties while residing together within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), or if they were substantially improved during the marriage by the Husband or by both parties within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Women’s Charter.

The Wife further stresses that the Husband did not contribute financially towards the acquisition of these Pre-Marriage Properties, and that she had assumed sole responsibility for the debt which she incurred to finance the purchase of these properties. She also submits that the Husband has “all along distanced himself from [her] property investments”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Husband argues that although these Pre-Marriage Properties were <span class="font-italic">purchased</span> before the marriage, they were <span class="font-italic">acquired </span>during the marriage within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter. This is because the Wife had continued to pay mortgage instalments for these properties during the marriage. In this regard, the Husband cites <span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO </span>[2013] SGHC 91 (“<span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">THL v THM </span>[2015] SGHCF 11 (“<span class="font-italic">THL v THM</span>”) as authorities for the proposition that a property purchased prior to the marriage may constitute an asset “acquired during the marriage” where instalments continue to be paid during the marriage. In addition, the Husband argues that Robertson Quay Properties A and B, as well as the Compassvale Property, are matrimonial assets because they were substantially improved by the Husband during the marriage within the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I agree with the Husband that the Pre-Marriage Properties cannot be excluded entirely from the matrimonial pool. Apart from <span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO </span>and <span class="font-italic">THL v THM</span>, the decisions of <span class="font-italic">BGT v BGU </span>[2013] SGHC 50 and <span class="font-italic">UJF v UJG </span>[2018] SGHCF 1 (“<span class="font-italic">UJF v UJG</span>”) also support the proposition that, in the context of s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter, the “acquisition” of an asset refers not only to its purchase, but to the continuing process of payment for that asset in mortgage instalments. Thus, to the extent that the Wife continued to pay for the Pre-Marriage Properties during the parties’ marriage, these assets should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Wife sought to argue that these Pre-Marriage Properties should be excluded from the pool because the Husband had distanced himself from her property investments. I was not persuaded by this. It is true that in exceptional circumstances, the court may exclude even an asset which was acquired during the marriage from the pool of matrimonial assets. An example of this is the case of <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel</span>”). There, the parties had agreed to purchase an apartment in their joint names in February 2002, but shortly thereafter, their relationship broke down. The wife subsequently refused to sign the mortgage documents unless the husband would enter into a deed to record their understanding that he would be solely responsible for all the liabilities arising out of the purchase of the apartment. When the husband refused to sign the deed, the wife pulled out of the purchase, incurring abortive costs. The husband proceeded to purchase the apartment in his sole name in May 2003. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Court of Appeal held that the apartment should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets because this was the only determination that was consistent with the wife’s consistent position that she would have no part in the purchase of the apartment and all liabilities associated therewith (at [15]). The wife had made her intentions to have no part in the purchase “exceptionally clear” by seeking to enter into a legally binding agreement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deed) which would confirm that she would share no responsibility for the liabilities arising from the purchase (at [21]). She had also actively sought to distance herself from liability for any of the abortive costs (at [18]). The court further noted that the apartment had been purchased after the parties’ relationship had already deteriorated (at [20]). It was in this context that the Court of Appeal held that, notwithstanding the fact that the apartment was acquired during the marriage and technically came within the definition of a matrimonial asset in s 112(10), the court should not exercise its powers of division in relation to the apartment (at [25]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In my judgment, the facts of the present case are distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel</span>. To begin with, unlike <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel</span>, the Pre-Marriage Properties were not purchased at a time when the relationship between the parties had deteriorated. Rather, they were purchased at a time when the parties presumably enjoyed a close relationship (given that they were cohabiting), and were then incrementally paid for in the following years, during which time the parties formalised their relationship in marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Further, the <span class="font-italic">presumptive </span>position under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is that any asset acquired during the marriage is a matrimonial asset which is liable to division. Seen in this context, the mere fact that one party has solely paid for an asset cannot, without more, suffice to exclude that asset from the matrimonial pool, for to adopt such an approach would strip s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of much of its meaning. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Boon Huat Samuel</span>, the court did not exclude the apartment in question from division merely because its purchase had been financed entirely by the husband. Rather, the court’s determination was influenced by the fact that the wife had deliberately sought to dissociate herself from the purchase of the apartment and its attendant liabilities in a way that was “exceptionally clear”. In contrast, in the present case, the only facts which the Wife relies on are that, in the course of these proceedings, the Husband has expressed disapproval of her property acquisitions and has described her as a “greedy woman who wanted to buy more and more properties just to satisfy her insatiable appetite for real assets and wealth”.

Some of this money went towards purchasing equipment like ovens, chillers, heaters and other utensils for the café business. Although the café business failed, the Husband alleges that as a result of the parties’ investment, the new tenant was able to enjoy the benefit of the newly renovated premises, alongside the new equipment and utensils which the parties purchased. The Husband also claims that he was involved in Strata Titles Boards proceedings brought by the Wife against the MCST of the condominium development to secure approval for an upgrade of the electrical supply for Robertson Quay Property B (“the STB Proceedings”).

</div> Further, the Wife submits that the Husband was not involved in the STB Proceedings, and that she solely paid for both the legal costs arising from these STB Proceedings, as well as the works to upgrade the electrical supply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my judgment, the Husband has failed to establish that he “substantially improved” Robertson Quay Property B. As for the parties’ joint investment in renovating and outfitting the property for their café business, I find that there is no direct causal connection between this joint contribution and any improvement in the value of this asset. The Husband does not dispute the Wife’s account that the unit was left vacant for two years after their café business ceased, and that the new tenant renovated the premises entirely and did not make use of whatever fixtures or equipment were left behind by the parties from their defunct café business. As for the efforts that were made to upgrade the electrical supply, the Husband has not furnished any details of his alleged involvement in the STB Proceedings, save that he introduced the Wife to the lawyer who represented her in the action against the MCST. Given that the Wife was the party who funded the proceedings as well as all upgrading works, I find that the Husband’s contribution was <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>and could not constitute a “substantial improvement”. For the avoidance of doubt, any “substantial improvement” which the Wife may have made individually in upgrading the electrical supply would not suffice to bring Robertson Quay Property B within the definition of a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), since that provision only applies where the substantial improvements are made “by <span class="font-italic">the other party </span>(in this case, the Husband) or both parties to the marriage”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Compassvale Property</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Compassvale Property is a commercial shop unit located within a condominium. The current tenant operates a childcare centre on the premises. The Husband’s account of how he “substantially improved” the unit is as follows: Sometime in January 2010, the parties relocated the main door of this unit to the side facing the main road. The result of this was to make the unit accessible from the main road, instead of only through the condominium, such that parents would not have to enter the condominium to fetch their children from the childcare centre. In the Husband’s submission, this has improved the value of the property. After the repositioning of the main door was complete, a dispute arose with the condominium’s MCST over whether the parties required approval for their modifications to the property. The parties tried to secure a 90% resolution approving their modifications to the Compassvale Property at an annual general meeting of the subsidiary proprietors, but this proved unsuccessful. The Husband then researched the law and formed the view that it was unnecessary to obtain a 90% resolution. He wanted to take the MCST to court over this issue. However, the chairman of the MCST persuaded the parties “to keep the matter in abeyance”. Eventually, the Husband “realized that the glass door opening [had] remained in existence for more than 6 years already without any enforcement action being taken by the MCST”, and that the MCST was therefore prevented from taking any action against the parties by virtue of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed).

While the Wife argues that the matrimonial assets should be valued as at the IJ Date “for consistency” because the date for <span class="font-italic">identifying </span>the matrimonial assets is also the IJ Date, I do not accept this argument. If the Wife’s position were correct, the default position in <span class="font-italic">every </span>case would be that the date of interim judgment should be used to value the matrimonial assets, since the default position is that the matrimonial assets are identified as at the date of interim judgment (see <span class="font-italic">ARY v ARX </span>[2016] 2 SLR 686 at [28]).

Some of these assets include bank accounts and CPF accounts, but they also include several non-money assets such as a motor vehicle, and shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In my view, it is appropriate to value the bank accounts and CPF accounts as at the date of the interim judgment. These are unique assets in that their value is tied to the quantum of funds therein. Accordingly, the value of such assets in the pool of matrimonial assets at the ancillary matters date should be substantially similar to that as at the interim judgment date. As for the non-money assets, however, these should rightly have been valued as at the ancillary matters date, but the Wife did not provide disclosure of the updated values of these assets as at the AM Date. Given the limitations in the evidence, and since the parties had both stated the value of these assets with reference to the IJ Date in their JSRI, I shall adopt the IJ Date as the operative date in valuing these assets. In this regard, although the Husband has in fact disclosed an updated valuation of his shares as of the AM Date (such value having increased by about $3,000 since the IJ Date),

</div> The Wife’s license plate number is, itself, not listed for sale in this document. A closer look at the exhibit shows that of the fifty unique two-digit license plate numbers listed for sale therein, about a quarter of the sellers have listed asking prices of less than $5,000, about half have listed asking prices of between $5,000 and $20,000, and about a quarter have listed asking prices in excess of $20,000. Only two sellers have listed asking prices in excess of $100,000. It is clear that the Husband’s estimate that the Wife’s license plate number is worth $100,000 is excessive and unsupported by the evidence. The evidence does suggest, however, that the asking prices for license plate numbers with a format similar to the Wife’s tend to be higher, and were generally in excess of $30,000.

On 11 April 2018, however, in her fourth affidavit of assets and means, the Wife sought to provide an updated valuation of her properties as at the AM Date by Premas. The Husband complains that this “updated valuation” simply took the form of a “Whatsapp” message from Premas, purportedly stating the updated values of the properties without any supporting information as to how these figures were derived.

As between the Husband’s valuations which were obtained from Allied and the Wife’s “valuations” as at the AM Date from Premas, I find that the Husband’s valuations are to be preferred. I agree with the Husband that the evidence relied on by the Wife – a screen capture of a Whatsapp message from Premas which does not even identify the properties by address but refers to the properties as “Ppty 1” through “Ppty 17” – is unsatisfactory. In contrast, Allied’s valuation reports state that the basis of each valuation is a comparison with recent transactions of comparable properties within the vicinity,

For these reasons, I shall adopt the values proffered by Allied for the properties in respect of which the Husband has obtained valuation reports.

While I have reservations about the manner in which the Wife has adduced the updated valuations from Premas, the Husband has not offered a credible alternative estimate of the true market value of these properties. Allied’s valuations, however, suggest that Premas’ valuation of the properties as at the AM Date may have been somewhat conservative. In the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to gauge the market value of these properties by applying a slight 10% uplift to Premas’s figures.

The husband claimed he had used part of the sale proceeds to buy a car for the parties’ son, to repay a car loan, to help the parties’ son to purchase a HDB flat, to loan money to a friend and to buy shares in a friend’s name. The Court of Appeal held that the entire sale proceeds should be returned to the asset pool. The wife had not only a putative interest but an actual interest in the proceeds from the sale of the apartment (since she was a joint owner of the apartment) and as she had not consented to the husband’s expenditure, the husband should bear these expenditures personally and in full (at [23]–[25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Secondly, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span> suggests that it may be acceptable for a party to incur fresh liabilities on matrimonial assets after the commencement of divorce proceedings <span class="font-italic">if </span>such liabilities are incurred for the benefit of both spouses (at [68] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA). In <span class="font-italic">Wan Lai Cheng</span>, the court found that the liabilities incurred on certain matrimonial properties had increased significantly since the wife had filed for divorce. Since the husband had never suggested that these liabilities were incurred for the benefit of both parties, the court was entitled to infer that they had been incurred for the sole benefit of the husband, and that those liabilities should therefore be disregarded for the purposes of determining the net value of these properties. (at [68]). This suggests that if the court <span class="font-italic">had </span>been satisfied that the liabilities were incurred for the parties’ joint benefit, it might have been prepared to take these fresh liabilities into account in ascertaining the value of the matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Drawing the principles from these two authorities together, upon the commencement of divorce proceedings, if a party comes into funds in which the other party has a putative interest, that party ought to seek the other party’s consent before any expenditure of a substantial sum, failing which that party may be required to bear that payment personally by returning the sum to the asset pool. There is nothing to suggest that the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>at [24] are inapplicable when the intended expenditure is the payment of some existing liability which would ultimately be to the benefit of both parties (such as, for instance, if the Wife used the proceeds of the Bedok North Property to pay the mortgage on another of the matrimonial properties). Even in such a situation, it is necessary for the party intending to expend the sum to obtain the other party’s consent. Nevertheless, if the party who has <span class="font-italic">not </span>obtained prior consent is able to prove that the sum in question was applied for the parties’ <span class="font-italic">joint benefit</span> in the sense that it was used to pay off an existing liability which would otherwise have been deductible against the matrimonial assets, then the party which expended the sum in question may not be required to bear this cost personally, and will not be required to return the sum so expended to the asset pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Applying this reasoning to the present facts, I was of the view that the Wife ought to have kept the Husband apprised of any sale of her assets; and having received the proceeds from such sale, she ought to have sought the Husband’s consent before expending any substantial sum. Nevertheless, if there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the Wife applied the proceeds towards mortgage payments on her properties (which form part of the matrimonial assets), it would not be fair to require the Wife to restore these sums to the pool of assets. This is especially so given that the net values of the various matrimonial properties are obtained by deducting the <span class="font-italic">outstanding mortgage liability as at</span><span class="font-italic"> the AM Date </span>from the gross value. If, however, there is <span class="font-italic">insufficient</span> evidence that any sum was applied towards such liabilities, then the Wife ought to be required to restore these sums to the asset pool.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Of the Bedok North Property proceeds, I was satisfied, and the Husband appears to accept, that the Wife had applied $8,858.70 towards the payment of mortgage instalments for the Telok Kurau Property and Robertson Quay Properties A and B, while a further $20,220 was used to make a payment to Hong Leong Finance for capital repayment of the mortgage on the Telok Kurau Property.

</div>
</div> As will be seen, the pool of matrimonial assets is being valued by deducting the Wife’s liabilities (frozen as at the time of the commencement of divorce proceedings) from the total value of the assets (see [83] below). Those liabilities would essentially be double-counted if the court were then to <span class="font-italic">also </span>exclude whatever value of the Bedok North Property sales proceeds that have been applied to <span class="font-italic">discharge </span>those liabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As for the Husband’s claim that because a cheque of $51,146 was drawn in favour of the Wife’s real estate agency, this must mean that this sum was eventually given to the Wife as the real estate salesperson, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to support such an inference. Thus, I find that the net value of the Bedok North Property is $1,867,587.46 less the sums which were applied towards mortgage payments ($8,858.70 and $20,220), which yields a figure of $1,838,508.76.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 With regard to the Woodleigh Property, $864,060.05 out of the total proceeds of $1,188,888 were applied towards the repayment of a $960,000 loan from Ethoz Capital taken out against the Woodleigh Property on 31 October 2016. The question is whether this loan was incurred for the Wife’s “sole benefit”, in which case the Wife ought to be required to restore the sum of $864,060.05 to the pool of matrimonial assets. If, on the other hand, I accept the Wife’s argument that she used the loan to pay for the mortgages on her properties, then this loan would have been for the parties “joint benefit” in that it has improved the overall net value of the assets in the matrimonial pool. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Husband contends that the Wife has not adduced any evidence to show that the loan of $960,000 from Ethoz Capital was applied towards mortgage payments, as the Wife claims. In my view, however, there is sufficient evidence to indicate, on a balance of probabilities, that the loan was applied in this manner. First, on a comparison of the Wife’s outstanding liabilities against her various properties between the IJ Date and the AM Date, the Wife reduced her total mortgage liabilities from $15,092,986.03 to $13,774,557.87.

However, the plaintiff had only furnished the court with evidence of her <span class="font-italic">total </span>amount of CPF contributions which were used for the purchase of the apartment from the time of purchase. The court had no information as to the original purchase price of the apartment, and how much was in the plaintiff’s CPF account prior to the marriage (which would have allowed the court to determine the exact amount of CPF contribution during the marriage). Given these limitations, Ang J found that the plaintiff’s total CPF contributions towards the purchase of the property could be used as the <span class="font-italic">minimum </span>figure to be attributed notionally to the pool of matrimonial assets.

It is nevertheless necessary for the court to come to some estimate of the value to be included in the matrimonial pool, using the available evidence. Based on a comparison between the outstanding liabilities as at the date of the marriage and the IJ Date, I conclude that mortgage payments of $402,312.23 were made during the marriage.

The analysis is further complicated by the fact that the Wife took out a fresh loan of $960,000 from Ethoz Capital (see [54] above) in October 2016, which was after<span class="font-italic"> </span>the IJ Date. Given these difficulties, I shall adopt the approach which was taken by Ang J in <span class="font-italic">BHN v BHO </span>at [41] (see [71] above), which was essentially to take the absolute amount which was paid towards the acquisition of the property, and use this as the figure which should be attributed notionally to the pool of matrimonial assets. This is on the basis that if the Wife had not paid these amounts towards the acquisition of the Woodleigh Property, they would have remained in her bank accounts and would have been subject to division. I gather that in September 2016, the Wife was making monthly mortgage payments of about $2,931 on this property.

</div> It is clear that from July 2015 to the present, the Wife has been making monthly loan repayments of at least $13,416.67 to repay this fresh loan. However, there is no evidence as to how much the Wife expended to repay the loan which she <span class="font-italic">initially </span>took out to purchase the Compassvale Property between February 2011 and July 2015. Nevertheless, I gather that in the approximately 16-month period between the time the Wife signed the option to purchase in respect of this property on 19 September 2009 and the date of the marriage in February 2011, the Wife paid some $113,028.75 for the property (this being the purchase price of $488,000 less $374,971.25 in outstanding liabilities as at the date of the marriage).

</div> While I agree with this as a matter of principle, as a matter of fact, it is incorrect to say that the Wife’s credit card loans and insurance policies were all incurred “once divorce proceedings [were] afoot”. On the contrary, the Husband’s <span class="font-italic">own</span><span class="font-italic"> position</span> is that only $140,400 of the Wife’s personal loans were newly incurred between April 2016 (when the Wife evicted the Husband from the matrimonial home and initiated the divorce proceedings) and September 2016.

</div> Of this $140,400 worth of newly incurred liabilities, I agree with the Husband that it has not been demonstrated that these were incurred otherwise than for the Wife’s sole benefit. I thus do not take these liabilities into account. As for the remaining $1,442,026 ($1,582,426 - $140,400) worth of liabilities, I see no reason why they should not be taken into consideration in determining the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Turning then to the loan of $20,000 which the Husband claims to have taken from his brother, there was a lack of evidence to support the Husband’s position. At the final ancillary matters hearing on 21 August 2018, the Husband sought to adduce new evidence in the form of a letter from his brother confirming this loan. I considered that the Husband had numerous opportunities to obtain an affidavit from his brother and had not done so. Given the late stage of the proceedings, and the manner in which this evidence was sought to be introduced, I did not think it was appropriate to admit this letter into evidence. There being no other evidence to support the Husband’s claim that he had taken this loan from his brother, I do not take this alleged liability into account in determining the pool of matrimonial

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The question of whether pre-marital contributions may be taken into consideration in the court’s division of matrimonial assets was considered by Valerie Thean JC (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">JAF v JAE </span>[2016] 3 SLR 717 at [20]–[21]. In that case, prior to the parties’ marriage, the wife had purchased a property in Poland which was held in her sole name. The husband had contributed a sum of about £15,000 towards the purchase. Thean JC found that the property was not a matrimonial asset because it was not “ordinarily used or enjoyed” by the parties within the meaning of s 112(10)(a)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Women’s Charter. The husband also had not sought to argue that the property had been substantially improved within the meaning of s 112(10)(a)(<span class="font-italic">ii</span>). Nevertheless, in analysing the extent of each party’s contribution to the marriage, Thean JC was of the view that the husband’s contribution of £15,000 towards the purchase of the property in Poland could be taken into account notwithstanding the fact that such contribution was made before the marriage. This was on the basis that s 112 of the Women’s Charter required the court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case” and specifically, s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) required the court to have regard to “the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party” without any restriction as to time period (at [20]). Thean JC was satisfied that the husband’s contribution to the purchase of the Poland property had been made at a time when the parties were already in a “domestic relationship”, and that this property had functioned as a platform from which the parties built their lives together (at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Thean JC also noted that pre-marital contributions had been taken into account in the decision of <span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker v Foo Moo Chye </span>[2009] SGDC 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (DC)</span>”), and this, in turn, was upheld by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker v Foo Moo Chye Julie </span>[2009] SGHC 247 (“<span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (HC)</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (DC)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (HC)</span>, the parties had cohabited for a period of sixteen years before they married. A few years before the marriage, the wife had helped the husband to secure a lucrative consultancy project which appears to have placed the husband in good stead in subsequent employment. District Judge Tan Peck Cheng found that this was the wife’s most significant contribution to the marriage, notwithstanding the fact that it had been made prior to the marriage. On appeal, Steven Chong JC (as he then was) cited this as his reason for adjusting the wife’s share of the matrimonial assets upwards (<span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (HC) </span>at [13] and [17(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 <span class="font-italic"> </span>The question of whether pre-marital contributions are relevant in the division of matrimonial assets was also considered by George Wei JC in <span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1320 (“<span class="font-italic">ACY v ACZ</span>”), although Wei JC did not express a definitive view on the matter. Finally, I note that in <span class="font-italic">UIG v UIH </span>[2017] SGFC 149 (“<span class="font-italic">UIG v UIH</span>”), District Judge Masayu Norashikin felt that it was “apt for contributions even prior to the marriage to be factored in” because the parties in that case “were living together even before marriage” and had made indirect contributions to the family during this period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 As against the above line of authorities, in <span class="font-italic">UJF v UJG, </span>Aedit Abdullah J found that pre-marital circumstances should not be taken into consideration in the court’s exercise of its discretion under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The facts of that case were similar to the present case: the parties had cohabited for over a decade before they married, then divorced after a four-year marriage. Abdullah J held that “the fact that the parties were in a relationship that lasted for many years could not be a relevant factor given the scope of the legislative provision which is concerned only with factors relating to the period of marriage” (at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Having regard to the language of s 112 of the Women’s Charter, I am in agreement with the views taken in authorities such as <span class="font-italic">JAF v JAE</span>, <span class="font-italic">Smith Brian Walker (DC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">(HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">UIG v UIH </span>that pre-marital contributions may be a relevant factor in determining the just and equitable division of matrimonial assets. On one hand, the assets which are the <span class="font-italic">subject of </span>the court’s powers of division (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, matrimonial assets) are defined with reference to clear time boundaries under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>), which refer to assets in terms of whether they were acquired before or during the marriage. On the other hand, the <span class="font-italic">factors</span> to be taken into account in determining the appropriate apportionment of the assets are not limited to the period of marriage. Thus, for instance, s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) refers to the “extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family” while s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) refers to “the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party”, also without restriction as to time period (as noted in <span class="font-italic">JAF v JAE </span>at [20]). In this case, the parties have cohabited and shared their lives together for a significant period of time before the marriage. In the circumstances, I did not think it would be appropriate to entirely disregard the contributions which they have made to their shared lives in this period.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Direct contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The parties are in broad agreement that direct contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of matrimonial properties were mostly attributable to the Wife.

The Wife characterises this transfer instead as payment for the Husband’s “rent and living expenses from 2003 to 2007”.

It is not in dispute that the parties had cohabited since 1999 and given the nature of their relationship, it seemed unlikely that the Wife was charging the Husband rent at the material time. Since the Wife did not dispute having received these sums, I found that these sums should be counted as the Husband’s direct contributions. As for the Husband’s claim that he spent $45,000 on the design and construction of the koi pond at the matrimonial property, I agreed with the Wife that this was unsubstantiated by documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Even taking the sums of $58,000 and $91,536 into account, however, and adding these sums to the value of the assets in the Husband’s name, the Husband’s total contributions amount to just under $300,000 ($148,658.02 + $58,000 + $91,536). As against this, it is not in dispute that the Wife solely financed her property acquisitions. The following table sets out an estimate of the amounts which the Wife contributed towards the properties in the matrimonial pool (omitting Robertson Quay Property B, the Marina Boulevard Property, the Woodleigh Property and the Compassvale Property):</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Asset </span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contribution</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Formula used</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sunrise Close Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$462,983.69</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Purchase price ($1,108,000)

The table above omits Robertson Quay Property B, the Compassvale Property, the Marina Boulevard Property and the Woodleigh Property because for the reasons described at [77]–[80] above, there is insufficient information concerning the original purchase price and therefore insufficient information concerning how much the Wife contributed towards the acquisitions of these assets. Given these limitations, for the purposes of quantifying the Wife’s direct contributions, I shall simply adopt the values of these assets which are being included in the pool of matrimonial assets and treat these values as representing the Wife’s direct contributions. Thus, the Wife’s contribution towards these properties are as stated in the following table:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Asset </span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Contribution</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">1.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Compassvale Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$257,268.65</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">2.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Robertson Quay Property B</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$53,439.16</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">3.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Marina Boulevard Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$134,102.30</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">4.</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Woodleigh Property</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$196,377.00</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="txt-body text-right"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Total Contributions</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">$641,187.11</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Wife’s total direct contributions towards her real properties alone were thus in excess of $6.80m ($6,193,417.70 + $641,187.11).

While [P] and [Q] claim that they had written these greeting cards at the Wife’s behest and simply adopted her suggested phrasing, the language used in these cards and the detail in which the children thank the Husband and describe his acts of care towards them cast doubt on the position which they take in their affidavits.

The factors which the courts may consider include the length of the marriage, and the size of the pool of matrimonial assets and its constituents. Indirect contributions tend to feature less prominently in shorter marriages (at [27(a)]).

I also agreed with the Wife that this was, at least formally, a short and childless marriage, although this factor was weakened somewhat given the fact that the parties had cohabited for a long period of time and shared caregiving responsibilities over the Wife’s children from a previous marriage. Taking the circumstances in the round, I consider that the weightage to be given to direct financial contributions is 70%, and the weightage to be given to indirect contributions is 30%. On this basis, the ratio for division of assets would be as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(242,242,242)"><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Direct contributions (70% weightage)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">66.5%</div><div class="txt-body text-left">(0.7 × 95%)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">3.5%</div><div class="txt-body text-left">(0.7 × 5%)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Indirect contributions (30% weightage)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">22.5%</div><div class="txt-body text-left">(0.3 × 75%)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">7.5%</div><div class="txt-body text-left">(0.3 × 25%)</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Average Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">89%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">11%</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adverse inferences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Before I apply the ratios derived in the table above to the pool of matrimonial assets, this is a convenient juncture at which to discuss the parties’ submissions regarding adverse inferences.

As for the Husband, I find that he has provided information (for example, in relation to his bank accounts) in a rather piecemeal way, often in response to objective information provided by the Wife. He has also changed his position several times in seeking to explain withdrawals and transfers of monies. As for the Wife, it was less than satisfactory that she had failed to disclose the sales of the Bedok North and Woodleigh Properties, and that she had sought to rely on Premas’s valuation of these properties in an affidavit dated 22 November 2017, without revealing the fact that she had sold these properties for a higher price.

Having regard to the evidence, I find that there is insufficient basis to support the conclusion that the Husband has become incapacitated from earning a livelihood. I generally agree with the Wife that the medical reports relied upon by the Husband do not suggest that the Husband is completely unable to work. Rather, they suggest that he may be unable to work <span class="font-italic">upon the onset</span> <span class="font-italic">of an attack </span>of vertigo.

</div> and I find that they carry limited weight as an objective indicator of the frequency of his attacks. I also note that despite the Husband’s claim that he has been suffering from frequent debilitating attacks of vertigo, there is nothing in evidence to suggest that he has more recently sought medical treatment, which would be expected if the attacks were as frequent and disruptive as he claims. I also take into consideration the private investigator reports which do suggest that the Husband is able to go about his daily activities.

</div> I was not persuaded that the Husband had become unable to earn a means of securing the necessities of life. While the Husband’s monthly income for 2016 was a rather meagre sum of $598, I did not think that this was an accurate indicator of the Husband’s earning capacity, given that just a year before this, his monthly income was in excess of $2,000. Moreover, while one can imagine how litigation and court work may be affected by the Husband’s condition, which apparently causes hearing deterioration, I was not persuaded that Meniere’s Disease would render him unable to perform other kinds of legal work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 For these reasons, I find that the Husband does not meet the definition of an incapacitated husband.
