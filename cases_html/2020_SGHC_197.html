The Defendant has owned the Defendant’s Property since 2 August 2010. The Plaintiff’s purchase of the Plaintiff’s Property came with an existing tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In or around December 2015, the Plaintiff obtained permission from the Building and Construction Authority to convert the second to fifth storeys of the Plaintiff’s Property into an approved temporary backpackers’ hostel, change the use of the first storey from a temporary backpackers’ hostel to a shop, and add a new fifth storey extension at the rear for office use (collectively “the Redevelopment Works”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 13 September 2016, the Plaintiff commenced proceedings against the Defendant in Suit No 974 of 2016 (“the 2016 Suit”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiff’s claim in the 2016 Suit related to the Defendant’s unreasonable refusal (according to the Plaintiff) to allow the Plaintiff to demolish its own boundary wall at the rear of the fifth storey. It was the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant’s refusal caused the Plaintiff to have to adopt a more costly alternative construction method, thereby incurring increased construction costs and consultants’ fees as well as loss of potential rental from tenancy agreements that the Plaintiff had entered into with two entities, namely Peramakan Pte Ltd (“Peramakan”) and The Keepers Inn Pte Ltd (“Keepers Inn”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiff’s statement of claim (“SOC”) in the 2016 Suit alleged that the Defendant and/or its tenant had encroached onto the Plaintiff’s boundary wall by mounting and/or installing kitchen cabinets and furnishings directly onto the Plaintiff’s boundary wall. Further, the metal roof on the fifth storey of the Defendant’s Property and its support protruded beyond the boundary line of the Defendant’s Property and encroached or trespassed upon the Plaintiff’s Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As part of the Redevelopment Works, the Plaintiff intended to demolish the existing boundary wall and to re-erect a new boundary wall seated exactly on the boundary line of the Plaintiff’s Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mr Chew Chin Hui (“Chew”), the Plaintiff’s project manager, sent emails to the Defendant on 25 April and on 6 May 2016 to give notice that the Defendant should demolish the kitchen fittings on the boundary wall and re-locate the metal roof and support prior to the Plaintiff’s demolition works. By another email dated 16 May 2016, Chew gave notice that the Defendant’s refusal to remove their fittings from the boundary wall meant that the Redevelopment Works would be delayed and the Plaintiff would thereby suffer loss and damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 29 June 2016, the Defendant via Wong replied by letter to the Plaintiff refusing to consent to the Plaintiff’s demolition of the boundary and claiming, without substantiation, that the boundary wall should logically belong to the Defendant’s Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Further, in response to the Plaintiff’s SOC, the Defendant filed a defence and counterclaim not only denying that it encroached onto the Plaintiff’s Property but also counterclaiming for the alleged encroachment by the Plaintiff onto the Defendant’s Property by the erection of standing platforms at the encroachment area.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the interim, the Plaintiff had entered into a tenancy agreement with Peramakan dated 1 June 2016

At about the same time, Stanley was introduced to Mr Lim Wei Siong (“Lim”), a director of Nuve Holdings Ltd (“Nuve”), which is a hotel operator. Stanley was keen to get Nuve to operate a hotel at the Plaintiff’s Property and broached the subject to Lim. However, Lim declined saying he could not commit Nuve to operating another boutique hotel as Nuve had just taken on a third boutique hotel project. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In 2018, while the 2016 Suit was ongoing, the Plaintiff changed lawyers to their present solicitors who, upon taking over conduct of the proceedings, decided to amend the SOC. The draft amended SOC was forwarded to the Defendant’s solicitors by the Plaintiff’s solicitors on 20 June 2018. In the draft amended SOC, the Plaintiff claimed in excess of $3m for the increased construction costs due to using an alternative construction method and the resultant prolonged construction period as well as loss of rental under the tenancies with Peramakan and Keepers Inn due to the delay in completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 With a view to an amicable settlement of the dispute, both parties agreed, and proceeded, to mediation. The session was held on 26 June 2018 and chaired by a retired judge (“the Mediator”) of the Supreme Court. Apart from its solicitors, the attendees from the Plaintiff’s side were Stanley, Michael, Richard, and Chew (whose wife Mdm Chan Ren Tze is a shareholder of the Plaintiff). Richard left the mediation session sometime in the afternoon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Representing the Defendant at the mediation session were Wong, Mr Ng Dick Young (a professional engineer) and the Defendant’s solicitors. At one stage (about 7.25pm), Mrs Wong joined the mediation session at the suggestion of the Mediator since he understood from Wong that the latter needed to consult his wife and obtain her consent to any agreement with the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The mediation session continued into the early hours (2.30am) of 27 June 2018 and culminated in the Settlement Agreement.

In September 2018, Red Doorz gave the Plaintiff a letter of intent setting out their intention to operate the Plaintiff’s boutique hotel at a hybrid rent/profit arrangement, which comprised a fixed component of $46,000 rent per month plus a variable 12.5% profit sharing component (for amounts above $10,000 net profit).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 When Stanley conveyed Red Doorz’s offer to Lim, he offered the Plaintiff the same hybrid payment arrangement with a higher fixed rent of $49,000 per month plus 10% of gross revenue less a notional fixed sum to account for operating expenses (which was later agreed at $80,000). The Plaintiff and Nuve subsequently signed a hotel management agreement for the Plaintiff’s Property on 3 February 2019 (“the Hotel Management Agreement”).

However, the Defendant alleged that from about 19 October 2018 onwards the Plaintiff refused to discuss or negotiate the terms for the tenancy agreement and/or the parties have been unable to reach an agreement over the terms of the tenancy agreement and/or execute a tenancy agreement. The Defendant added that the parties have also not been able to agree for the change of use of the Defendant’s Property for any use other than as a hotel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Defendant added that it was an implied term that the parties would negotiate the terms of the tenancy agreement in good faith and alleged that the Plaintiff refused to do so or even consider the proposals made by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff was in breach of the Settlement Agreement in refusing to consider the Defendant’s numerous proposals for the tenancy agreement and in refusing to have their dispute mediated by the Singapore Mediation Centre. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Consequently, the Defendant <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> counterclaimed against the Plaintiff for the loss and damage it suffered which included:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) rent due from 1 November 2018 at $8,000 per month;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) damage arising from the failure to rectify water leakage caused to the Defendant’s Property by construction works carried out at the Plaintiff’s Property; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) a declaration that the tenancy portion of clause 8 of the Settlement Agreement is void for uncertainty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reply and Defence to Counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In its Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim, the Plaintiff joined issue with the Defendant on its Defence.

</div> that the Plaintiff had represented to Wong that the Plaintiff could renovate the Defendant’s Property as a hotel or otherwise make convenient use of the Defendant’s Property as additional rooms for the hotel on the Plaintiff’s Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Plaintiff averred that because the parties intended to set out fixed deadlines for the handover of the Defendant’s Property to the Plaintiff, clauses 6.2 and 6.3 of the Settlement Agreement had handover dates inserted by the Defendant. Further, handover was not contingent on the occurrence of any event. The Plaintiff had no knowledge of the terms of, and was not provided with copies of, the Defendant’s tenancy agreements with its tenants at the material time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Plaintiff averred that the Defendant had given an undertaking in clause 4 of the Settlement Agreement that it would allow renovation works to the Defendant’s Property to be carried out in accordance with the Plaintiff’s desired requirements or specifications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Plaintiff averred that it was an implied term of the Settlement Agreement that the tenancy agreement would not introduce or contain terms that contradicted the commercial intent or express terms of the Settlement Agreement. The Plaintiff could introduce additional or boilerplate clauses in the formal tenancy agreement to be entered into, provided that such terms did not contradict the commercial intent or express terms of the Settlement Agreement. It was not the parties’ intention that the parties would be allowed to introduce terms into the tenancy agreement that derogated from or wholly undermined the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Plaintiff alleged that the parties’ failure to enter into any tenancy agreement was due to the Defendant’s unreasonable refusal to abide by the Settlement Agreement and/or wilful refusal to execute a tenancy agreement in accordance with the commercial intent and/or material terms set out in the Settlement Agreement. The Defendant’s unreasonable conduct was said to include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) refusing to execute the Plaintiff’s draft TA sent to the Defendant on or about 20 July 2018; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) repeatedly putting forth its own various versions of the tenancy agreement each of which introduced or maintained clauses that contravened or were inconsistent with the terms and commercial considerations underpinning the Settlement Agreement. Such terms or attempts to introduce such terms included:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) a prohibition on assignment despite the Defendant having actual or constructive knowledge that the Plaintiff in the course of its business intended to have or has a separate operator or subtenant to run the boarding house or hotel business, or food and beverage business;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) an entire agreement clause which would supersede the Settlement Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) an <span class="font-italic">en-bloc</span> sale clause stating that any such sale would not be subject to the tenancy agreement (contrary to clause 13 of the Settlement Agreement);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) handover dates for the various storeys of the Defendant’s Property that were not in accordance with the dates set out in clause 6 of the Settlement Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) asking for increased rental contravening clauses 6 and 7 of the Settlement Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) an option to renew clause for one instead of five years;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) a new and onerous term for deeds of indemnity to be provided by the individual shareholders or directors of the Plaintiff; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) ignoring the Plaintiff’s various requests to amend the offending clauses in each version of the Defendant’s draft TAs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Plaintiff maintained it was at all times ready, willing and able to abide by and comply with the Settlement Agreement. It amended the Defendant’s fourth draft TA for the Defendant’s review and had even proposed on 1 February 2019 a face-to-face meeting to discuss and execute the Tenancy Agreement at the end of the meeting. But the Defendant unreasonably refused its offer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for the Defendant’s counterclaim, the Plaintiff asserted that from the 2016 Suit, the Defendant was well aware that the Plaintiff was redeveloping the Plaintiff’s Property for use as a boarding house or hostel or hotel. Needless to say, the Plaintiff disputed the Defendant’s Counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In support of its case, the Plaintiff called five witnesses to testify. Besides Stanley and Michael, the Plaintiff’s other witnesses were Lim (from Nuve, see [13] above); Mr Chew Hun Keat (“CHK”), a quantity surveyor; and Mr Wilson Lim Yen Kai (“Wilson Lim”), a licensed appraiser. As stated at [17] above, the Attendance Note was produced in court. Indeed, the Defendant consented to the admission of that document as well as Mabel’s AEIC without the need to have Mabel testify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On the Defendant’s part, Wong turned out to be its only witness although an order of court dated 17 January 2020 also listed Mrs Wong as a witness.

That meant the parties held a lengthy private discussion in the late morning and for the entire afternoon. The court notes this because of the Defendant’s allegations (see [49(c)] above) that the Plaintiff (who denied it) made various representations. The Attendance Note did not record any representations being made by any of the Plaintiff’s representatives. The court will return to the Attendance Note in the course of reviewing the evidence of the various witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Most of the talking during the open sessions was done by the Plaintiff’s representatives, particularly Michael, and the Mediator. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Stanley’s narrative of events was largely consistent with what has been set out at [3]–[44] above. The court therefore turns to review Stanley’s testimony during cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Stanley was questioned on the Attendance Note. He agreed that when Mrs Wong joined the mediation session in the evening, her primary unhappiness was with the figure of $350,000 that the Plaintiff wanted from the Defendant as the contribution for renovations to be carried out by the Plaintiff. That figure was eventually reduced by $100,000 to $250,000, a sum with which Mrs Wong agreed. Mrs Wong was also unhappy about the rents being fixed at $8,000 and then $12,000 but she accepted those figures which were unchanged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Stanley revealed that at the mediation session, he had initially wanted a rent-free period of ten years for renting the Defendant’s Property. Wong did not agree, so eventually the Plaintiff agreed to a “five plus five” rental period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Stanley agreed that at the mediation, the Plaintiff’s main focus (if an agreement was reached with the Defendant) was to convert the Defendant’s Property into a hotel. Failing obtaining approval for a hotel, the Plaintiff would consider turning the Defendant’s Property into a co-working space. This would not require a change of use as the Defendant’s Property was already zoned as commercial. This fact was confirmed by Wong during cross-examination.

Mr Murali relied on the Attendance Note pointing out that only twice

</div> and in passing too was there mention of “co-working space” as an alternative use for the Defendant’s Property. Stanley disagreed there was no discussion of co-working space or that Wong never agreed to this as an alternative use for the Defendant’s Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As the private sessions between the parties were not minuted, there is no evidence before the court as to whether discussions on co-working space took place between Wong and the Plaintiff’s representatives when the Mediator was not present. The court notes however that if indeed no mention of co-working space took place in the private sessions between the parties, when the subject was raised twice in the open sessions, one would imagine that it would have been the natural reaction of Wong to have objected and said something to the effect of “I have never agreed to my (the Defendant’s) property being used for co-working space”. No such objection was noted to have been raised by either Wong or the Defendant’s counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In cross-examination of Stanley and Michael (PW2), Mr Murali placed great emphasis on the fact that the 2016 Suit never went to trial so there was no finding at law on the merits of the Plaintiff’s claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Michael’s testimony was similar to Stanley’s. To both witnesses, Mr Murali stressed in the course of cross-examination that in the Settlement Agreement, the Defendant <span class="font-italic">never</span> agreed to compensation for the Plaintiff’s alleged losses, only that the Defendant would make <span class="font-italic">a</span> <span class="font-italic">contribution</span><span class="font-italic"> sum </span>towards renovation costs which amount was finally settled at $250,000, a reduction from the Plaintiff’s initial demand for $350,000.

It should be noted that Michael (and Stanley) denied giving any assurance or guarantee to Wong or the Defendant that the Defendant’s Property, like the Plaintiff’s Property, would be converted to hotel accommodation. They further denied they did not inform Wong that co-working space would be the alternative if change of use to a hotel was not approved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The court pointed out to Mr Murali (when he said Wong did not agree to the change of use from hotel to co-working space) that since the subject was raised during the open session when both sides and their counsel was present, that Wong could have and should have objected but he did not.

Chew requested to market the Defendant’s property on an “as is” basis for $10m. Wong proposed an asking price of $13m as he believed $10m was below the market price. However, no sale materialised. I should add that during mediation the subject of selling the Defendant’s Property was discussed but not pursued because the Defendant’s asking price of $17m was well above the market price (according to Michael).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In relation to the draft tenancy agreement, Wong deposed he felt (which sentiment he claimed Michael shared) that lawyers could be dispensed with to save costs. Hence, he formally discharged his (former) lawyers in November 2018 and did not involve them in the draft tenancy agreements he sent to the Plaintiff. In this regard, it is noted that the Plaintiff’s draft TA (see [27] above) was drafted by its solicitors who act for them in these proceedings. The Plaintiff therefore had already incurred legal costs before the Defendant made its request to dispense with lawyers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In his AEIC, Wong blamed the Plaintiff for the failure to conclude a tenancy agreement. He deposed as to his various efforts to get the Plaintiff to sign a tenancy agreement. He said he was surprised to receive the Plaintiff’s first draft TA as it was his understanding that the draft should come from the owner not the tenant. Wong was also uncomfortable with the Plaintiff’s draft as the parties had appeared to agree to dispense with their respective lawyers’ involvement at that time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Wong therefore contacted Michael via email on 20 July 2018 and requested that the Defendant’s draft tenancy be used as it had thus far been accepted by the Defendant’s tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 When he met Michael and Stanley on 23 July 2018 to discuss the tenancy further, Wong said that Michael showed him a marked-up copy of the Defendant’s first draft TA. Both sides had discussed the issue of the option to renew clause contained in the Defendant’s existing tenancy agreements. Wong believed that the parties had reached agreement in principle on the tenancy agreement as the Plaintiff had marked up the Defendant’s first draft TA save for some specific clauses which Michael and Stanley indicated they needed to discuss or check with their lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Wong deposed that he was disappointed to receive Chew’s email of 4 August 2018 to the effect that the Plaintiff was not agreeable to the following clauses in the Defendant’s first draft TA:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the inclusion of clause 3 providing for a refundable security deposit of $24,000 for the first lease and a roll-over of the said sum to the second lease;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the inclusion of clause 4 providing for the tenant to pay interest for late payment of rent;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the inclusion of clause 38 providing for the Plaintiff to pay stamp duty on the first and second leases; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the inclusion of clause 39 which allowed the Defendant to terminate the tenancy with three months’ notice in the event of an <span class="font-italic">en-bloc</span> redevelopment, reconstruction and/or alteration to the existing building.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Chew further indicated he wanted to refer to the Settlement Agreement in the tenancy agreement and insisted on using the Plaintiff’s first draft TA as the legal costs for this had already been incurred. Wong also disagreed with Chew’s comment that the Plaintiff was a “creditor” of the Defendant because of the outstanding second tranche of $150,000 of the <span class="font-italic">agreed contribution sum</span> towards renovation costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In cross-examination, Wong disclosed he owned four other companies besides the Defendant company and he was therefore familiar with tenancy agreements.

It was said that the Letter of Intent dated 15 July 2018 (see [21] above) was non-binding and Lim’s projections, as a factual witness, of revenue to be earned from the Defendant’s Property do not mean the Plaintiff would have actually earned $1,650 plus 10% room revenue per month.

It was said that Wilson Lim’s calculations of occupancy rates to project revenues and profits based on the usage of the Defendant’s Property as a hotel, as a capsule hotel, and as a hotel-cum co-working space had no supporting documents or materials.

This included the fact (contrary to Wong’s assertion) that the Plaintiff (through Michael or Stanley) never guaranteed or assured Wong that the Defendant’s Property would be converted to a hotel. Indeed, the Defendant’s own lawyer at the mediation session was recorded as saying that the prospect of getting a hotel licence was “speculative”.

While the court is not obliged to accept expert evidence by reason only that it is unchallenged (<span class="font-italic">Sek Kim Wah v PP </span>[1987] SLR 107), if the court finds that the evidence is based on sound grounds and supported by the basic facts, it can do little else than to accept the evidence. [original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In the same vein, this court in <span class="font-italic">Asia Hotel Investments Ltd v Starwood Asia Pacific</span><span class="font-italic"> Management Pte Ltd and another</span> [2007] SGHC 50 noting that the plaintiff did not call any expert witnesses, and said (at [364] and [366]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">364 In doing so, the plaintiff took the risk that if the court disagreed with its submission that the WACC should not be applied in favour of awarding based on 2006 values, then the court’s evaluation of the expert evidence provided by [the defendant’s expert witness] would stand or fall, based on counsel’s objections alone, without the plaintiff providing a viable alternative for the court’s consideration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">366 The challenge against [the defendant’s expert witness’s] evidence came only in the form of the plaintiff’s closing submissions and not by way of another expert. While I accept that the plaintiff was not obliged to call another expert to refute [the defendant’s expert witness’s] expert opinion, it should also be borne in mind that by choosing <span class="font-italic">not</span> to call another expert, the court was left with choosing between (a) counsel’s objections through submissions and (b) in the event that the court disagreed with all of counsel’s objections, [the defendant’s expert witness’s] evidence in its entirety. The court was not presented with another choice. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Bearing all relevant considerations in mind, the court is of the view that there are no factors that preclude the court’s acceptance of the testimony of Wilson Lim and CHK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The court considered the URA Circular dated 27 June 2018 found in Appendix A of Wilson Lim’s report. As Nuve is operating a hotel at the Plaintiff’s Property, it seems more likely than not that the URA would have approved the change of use of the Defendant’s Property to a hotel as an add-on to Nuve’s hotel operations next door.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 On the issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the Defendant in breach of the Settlement Agreement by providing numerous and changing draft TAs to the Plaintiff? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the tenancy agreement to be signed between the parties premised on the Defendant’s Property being used solely as a hotel?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court’s finding is “yes” to (a) and “no” to (b). The Defendant or Wong apparently overlooked the fact that the Plaintiff provided good consideration for the Settlement Agreement by discontinuing the 2016 Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 It follows therefrom that the Plaintiff succeeds in its claim. It further follows that the Defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed with costs to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The reliefs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 With regard to the reliefs claimed by the Plaintiff, the court notes from the Plaintiff’s submissions that the Plaintiff thinks specific performance may not be the most just and equitable remedy in the light of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis as well as the recent tenancy agreement between the defendant and Ink &amp; Pixel, the termination of which would adversely the innocent tenant and cause hardship.

</div>
</div> (total revenue $11,719,008 less total costs and expenses of $6,808,728) less rent payable to the Defendant over 10 years of $1,452,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Based on CHK’s report the Plaintiff’s claims for the opportunity loss due to the Defendant’s failure to co-operate to effect a collective sale of the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s Properties are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $18,731,884.06 (based on boutique hotel option);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $21,123,188.41 (based on capsule hotel cum boutique hotel option); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $15,543,478.26 (based on co-working space cum boutique hotel option).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 It is the court’s view that the possibility of a collective sale of the parties’ properties is too speculative. If the parties could not agree on the terms of a tenancy agreement, it is highly unlikely that the Plaintiff will ever be able to agree on the terms of a collective sale with the Defendant or Wong. The Attendance Note recorded Wong asking for an above-market price for the Defendant’s Property at the mediation session, which was clearly not achievable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Consequently, the court finds that the Plaintiff’s claim will be confined to its claim for damages. Of the three options set out in [171], the court views options (a) and (b) as the most viable. Those claims of $4,676,634 and $6,896,740 respectively average out to $5,786,687 (being ($4,676,634 + $6,896,740) ÷ 2). The court is mindful of the current sad state of the tourism industry worldwide, including Singapore. While a daily rate of $140 per room per night for a boutique hotel and $35 per capsule per night are achievable in a buoyant market, those targets are well-nigh impossible to attain in the current Covid-19 pandemic situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Accordingly, the court takes a pragmatic view of Hotel NuVe Elements’ operations at the Plaintiff’s Property (see [86] above). The Plaintiff should be adequately compensated for its loss, but it should not obtain a windfall at the expense of the Defendant – however reprehensible Wong’s past conduct may have been. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The court discounts the figure of $5,786,687 by 50% to arrive at $2,893,343.50. It should be borne in mind that the boutique hotel figure of $4,676,634 was based on 80% occupancy whilst the capsule hotel figure of $6,896,740 was based on 75% occupancy. Consequently, the rates were effectively reduced to 40% and 37.5% respectively. Those rates may seem generous in the current market but had the tenancy agreement been signed between the parties, the Plaintiff’s ten-year lease with the Defendant would only have expired in July 2028. It cannot be the case that the tourism market and the hotel industry would remain in the doldrums for another eight years. There would be recovery somewhere along the way, which would improve room rates beyond 50% of $140 and $35 respectively for a boutique and capsule hotel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The court disallows the Plaintiff’s claim for $170,000 (see [170]) for the interim period of August 2018 to December 2019. The court does not think that the Plaintiff could have made use of the Defendant’s Property by August 2018, barely two months after the signing of the Settlement Agreement, for the reason (according to Wilson Lim’s report
