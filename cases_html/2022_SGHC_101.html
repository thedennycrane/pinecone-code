in a joint trial where mirror charges are framed pursuant to s 258(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”), prior to its amendment by the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018 (Act 19 of 2018) (the “CJRA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The appellants in these three related appeals were convicted after a joint trial in the court below for their respective roles in an arrangement to provide gratification in the form of bribe moneys to the then Indonesian Embassy Labour Attaché, one Agus Ramdhany Machjumi (“Agus”). The District Judge’s (the “DJ’s”) grounds of decision can be found in <span class="font-italic">PP v Chow Tuck Keong Benjamin and others </span>[2021] SGDC 232 (the “GD”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In the present appeals, the first appellant, Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Hanib (“Aziz”) and the third appellant, Chow Tuck Keong Benjamin (“Benjamin”) challenge both their conviction and sentence.

The PB was meant to operate as a guarantee for the performance of every clause in the Embassy’s standard employment contract for the FDWs. Essentially, employers hiring Indonesian FDWs would have to make a one-off $70 purchase of a performance guarantee (the “Guarantee”) from insurance providers accredited by the Embassy. If an employer is found by the Embassy to be in breach of the terms of the employment contract issued by them, the respective insurers would have to make payment to the Embassy of a sum of up to $6,000. The amount paid to the Embassy by the insurers is fully claimable by the insurers from the employer in breach.

Aziz, who was assisting Agus with various work at the Embassy, was tasked by Agus to find insurance agents or companies which were agreeable to give bribes in return for receiving the accreditation to sell the Guarantees.

I find this to be instructive and I accordingly reproduce it in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 In summary, where there is a dispute as to the admissibility of a statement, the following questions should be considered: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(a) First, was the statement given voluntarily based on the requirements set out in s 258(3) of the CPC?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  (i) If the statement was involuntary due to an inducement, threat or promise within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC, then it shall be excluded and that is the end of the admissibility inquiry. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">  (ii) If the statement was voluntary, the enquiry proceeds to the second step.  </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(b)   Second, even if the statement was voluntary, would the prejudicial effect of the statement outweigh its probative value? This is a discretionary exercise and the court’s foremost concern is in evaluating the reliability of the statement in the light of the specific circumstances in which it was recorded. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Thus, where the admissibility of a statement is contested, the court is concerned at the first step of the inquiry with whether the statement was made voluntarily. The starting point is that any statement given by an accused person in the course of investigations is admissible in evidence at his trial in accordance with s 258(1) of the CPC. However, this is subject to the requirement of voluntariness enshrined in s 258(3) of the CPC, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 It is settled law that the test for voluntariness under s 258(3) of the CPC is partly objective and partly subjective. In <span class="font-italic">Chai </span><span class="font-italic">Chien Wei Kelvin v PP </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [53], the Court of Appeal held that the first stage of the inquiry corresponding to the objective limb considers whether there was any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused. The second stage of the inquiry corresponding to the subjective limb examines whether the said inducement, threat or promise was such that it would be reasonable for the accused to think that he would gain some advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, adverse consequences) in relation to the proceedings against him by making the statement. This was also recently affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Furthermore, Explanation 1 to s 258(3) of the CPC also establishes that where a statement is procured from an accused person in oppressive circumstances, it is similarly inadmissible. The explanation reads as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation 1 — </span>If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this connection, Woo Bih Li J (“Woo J”) in <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang v PP </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1189 (“<span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang</span>”) at [90], held that the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Seow</span><span class="font-italic"> Choon Meng v PP </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 338 (“<span class="font-italic">Seow</span><span class="font-italic"> Choon Meng</span>”) at [33] continue to apply to s 258(3) of the CPC. It is useful to reproduce these observations at length:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Oppression in this context relates to the methods and manner of interrogation preparatory to and during the making of statements. <span class="font-italic">It has been said that oppressive questioning may be described as questioning which by its nature, duration or other attendant circumstances</span>, including the fact of custody, excites hopes, such as the hope of release, or fears, or so affects the mind of the person being interrogated that <span class="font-italic">his will crumbles and he speaks when otherwise he would have remained silent – </span><span class="font-italic">questioning in circumstances which tended to sap and did sap, the free will of the person interrogated</span>: <span class="font-italic">per</span> Edmund Davis LJ in <span class="font-italic">R v Prager</span> [1972] 1 All ER 1114. At the same time, it has been said that <span class="font-italic">the court’s approach should not be such </span><span class="font-italic">so as to form a clog on the proper exercise by the police of their investigating function, and, indeed, on the administration of justice itself</span>: <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hailsham in <span class="font-italic">DPP v Ping Lin</span> [1975] 3 All ER 175 at 183. <span class="font-italic">Robust interrogation is, in our opinion, an essential and integral aspect of police investigation</span>. However, as was observed by L P Thean J in <span class="font-italic">Sim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Cheoh</span> ([31] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), if the questioning is too vigorous or prolonged, it becomes oppressive, with the result that a doubt arises as to whether the statement or the answers have been caused by any fear or threat so as to render the statements or answers to the questions inadmissible. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang </span>at [113], Woo J thus held that the litmus test for oppression is whether the investigation was, by its nature, duration, or other attendant circumstances, such as to affect the accused’s mind and will such that he speaks when he would otherwise have remained silent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It also bears repeating that where an accused person challenges the voluntariness of his statement, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement had in fact been made voluntarily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Subsequently, if the court is satisfied that the statement has been made voluntarily, it must then embark on the second step of the inquiry to determine whether to exercise its residual discretion at common law to nonetheless exclude the statement where its prejudicial value outweighs its probative value. At its core, the exclusionary discretion is concerned with the reliability of the statements as evidence to be admitted (see <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45], citing <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar v PP </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”) at [55]). In <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span> at [47], the Court of Appeal explained that the probative value of any evidence relates to its ability to prove a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Its prejudicial effect refers to how its admission might be unfair to the accused person as a matter of process. Some examples for evaluating prejudicial effect would include whether the accused person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, his physical condition at the material time and his ability to understand the language used. Importantly, the court cautioned that where a voluntary statement is found to be highly probative, evidence of <span class="font-italic">significant</span> prejudice to the accused person would be required to justify the exclusion of the statement (see <span class="font-italic">Sulaiman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Having set out the fundamental principles concerning admissibility, I now proceed to consider whether Aziz’s and James’s contested statements were rightly admitted into evidence by the DJ. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Aziz’s contested statements are admissible </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Aziz challenges the admissibility of his first four statements. His arguments largely reiterate his position during his ancillary hearing in the court below, and I summarise them as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to his 1st and 2nd statements which were recorded from him whilst he was in custody between 29 June 2018 to 30 June 2018, he relies on two main grounds, namely, the presence of oppressive circumstances and an alleged threat directed at him by CSI Chris. As a result, he was stressed and weak, with no will left, leading him to sign on the statements even though he did not agree with the contents.

Aziz disputes the DJ’s finding that he was served a McChicken burger for dinner at about 8.00pm on 29 June 2018. However, this was recorded in CSI Chris’s investigation diary, which was consistent with what was recorded in Aziz’s 1st statement (that he signed).

</div>
</div> I find that there is no reason to doubt the reliability of these records. In any event, even if I accept that Aziz was not served the aforementioned burger, it is undisputed that when he later made a request for food, he was served cup noodles and biscuits at 1.00am on 30 June 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> While Aziz testified that he only consumed the biscuits and not the cup noodles, I am satisfied that this was wholly an exercise of his personal autonomy and it did not now lie in his mouth to make baseless allegations that the CPIB officers had deprived him of food. This is made clear by Aziz’s candid admission that he made the conscious <span class="font-italic">choice</span> not to consume the cup noodles as he was “not used to eating that”.

</div> Aziz’s ability to make such a choice demonstrates two things: first, that he was not so hungry to the point where his will was sapped, and second, that there was no oppressive behaviour on the part of the CPIB officers as they had acceded to his request for food. Aziz also did not dispute that he was served a breakfast of Chinese-style noodles after the recording of his 1st statement and Malay chicken rice for lunch prior to the recording of his 2nd statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is also notable that during his time in custody, Aziz had made multiple requests for toilet breaks, smoke breaks and prayer breaks. These too were accommodated by the CPIB officers.

</div> The willingness of the CPIB officers to acquiesce to Aziz’s various requests runs entirely contrary to the narrative of oppression that he seeks to present. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Although I accept that Aziz was short on sleep at the time his first two statements were recorded, I am nonetheless satisfied that this did not have any meaningful impact on his ability to provide his statements. In other words, his lack of sleep did not affect him to the extent where his will was sapped. It was unchallenged by him that he was given intermittent rest breaks while in custody. I also note that Aziz had the presence of mind to make not insignificant amendments to his 2nd statement. I return to elaborate more on this point later (at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, Aziz contends that he was kept in a windowless room with no clock, with his personal mobile phone and watch taken away from him, which resulted in him being unable to tell day from night.

</div>
</div> This point can be disposed of shortly. The situation that Aziz found himself in was certainly not exceptional. It is trite that some discomfort is to be expected during investigations (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo See How v PP </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 277 at [40]). In fact, the DJ accepted that it was “natural that Aziz would have been anxious and stressed, not knowing who might be coming in next and when and with what further questions or information.”

</div> However, it must be observed that these stressors were <span class="font-italic">not</span> unique to Aziz. <span class="font-italic">Every</span> accused person under investigation is faced with a similar set of circumstances. It cannot be the case that the high threshold to satisfy an allegation of oppression is so easily met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Third, Aziz submits that the CPIB refused to record anything he said unless it was something that they wanted to hear, and this wore him down to the point where he purportedly confessed. It is, however, important to bear in mind that robust interrogation is an essential and integral part of police investigation (see <span class="font-italic">Seow</span><span class="font-italic"> Choon Meng </span>cited above at [38]). That being said, I accept that in some situations where the questioning by investigators is so vigorous or prolonged, the threshold of oppression may very well be crossed (see <span class="font-italic">Sim Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Cheoh and others v PP </span>[1991] 1 SLR(R) 961 at [41]). Therefore, in every case, it is a fact-sensitive inquiry as to whether the manner and the duration of the questioning would amount to oppression. Aziz urges the court to find that the threshold for a finding of oppression has been crossed in his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 However, based on an examination of the evidence before me, I am unable to agree with Aziz’s submission. A concise chronology of events which documented Aziz’s activities while in custody, including his break timings and interview/statement recording timings, was helpfully set out by the DJ (GD at [47]).

For example, prior to the recording of his 1st statement, three interviews were conducted by CSI Chris which lasted approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours and 20 minutes respectively. In between each of these interviews, Aziz was afforded rest/meal breaks of 30 minutes, 1 hour and 1 hour and 25 minutes. Crucially, although CSI Chris had intended to commence a fourth interview after this last break, Aziz was given an additional meal break of 1 hour and 20 minutes because he had requested for food. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further, in my view, it was certainly not necessary for Aziz’s statement recorders, namely CSI Chris and CSI Johnston, to accept Aziz’s initial account at face value. Plainly, it is the job of investigators to conduct investigations, and it is not their job to blindly transcribe verbatim the words uttered by accused persons unquestioningly. It was thus entirely their prerogative to challenge Aziz’s account on the basis of evidence obtained during investigations which pointed to the contrary. This was in fact CSI Chris’s explanation for his refusal to record Aziz’s initial account, which he assessed to be incompatible with the CPIB’s preliminary evidence.

</div> To this end, CSI Chris testified that during the interview with Aziz, he informed Aziz that “what he told [CSI Chris] isn’t the truth because [the CPIB] have [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] evidence to suggest otherwise.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, I must caution that this does not give carte blanche to investigators to engage in all manner of questioning and/or for unreasonable durations.

To illustrate this point, I highlight two of these amendments (with deleted words struck through, and inserted words underlined): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first amendment reads as follows: “The reason I asked for this advance was I was having tight cash flow <span class="font-underline">to assist </span><span class="font-underline">Agus for some operational work in relation to Agus work to protect maids and counselling</span>.”

The content of these amendments also shed light on Aziz’s state of mind at the time. They sought to minimise his culpability and portray him in the best light possible. In particular, the second amendment is exculpatory in nature, as he sought to shift the blame onto Agus and distance himself from the entire corrupt scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Pertinently, Aziz was subsequently given the opportunity to review his 2nd statement prior to the recording of his 3rd statement on 3 July 2018. At this time, he had already been released on bail. During this review of his 2nd statement, Aziz made a number of clarifications and amendments. I am satisfied that by this time, the effect of any alleged oppression based on the circumstances prevailing at the time his 1st and 2nd statements were recorded would have been removed, and there was thus no reason for him not to make substantial amendments to his earlier statements should they be inaccurate. However, he did not do so. Moreover, for the reasons I will elaborate below at [64], I find that there was no threat hanging over his head at the time of the recording of his 3rd statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Therefore, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that no oppressive circumstances were prevailing at the time when Aziz’s first two statements were recorded such that his mind and will were so affected that he spoke when he would otherwise have remained silent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) No threat was made by CSI Chris to Aziz</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Apart from his allegation of oppression, Aziz also claims that CSI Chris had threatened him prior to the recording of his first two statements.

This is especially so when sensitive issues are involved, such as in the present case. It is, in my view, a gross mischaracterisation of the MOM’s e-mail to allege that they were “<span class="font-italic">accusing</span> the Indonesians” [emphasis added] of something. On a plain reading of the e-mail, it is evident that it was merely meant to serve as a general reminder to the Indonesian Embassy to exercise care when considering what terms to implement in the PB. This in <span class="font-italic">no way</span> could be interpreted as an accusation by the MOM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In any event, I am unable to see how CSI Chris’s statement could possibly amount to a threat having reference to any of the charges against Aziz. The alleged threat was exceedingly vague and did not specify any consequences should Aziz decline to provide a confession to the CPIB. Importantly, it simply defies logic for CSI Chris to threaten Aziz by telling him not to “create problem[s] for our government with [the] Indonesian Government” and then hope to extract a confession from him which would implicate Agus. This surely would contradict CSI Chris’s apparent intention on the face of the alleged threat for Aziz not to create problems with the Indonesian government. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Aziz’s swollen eye was no impediment to the admissibility of his 4th statement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Finally, Aziz argues that at the time his 4th statement was recorded, he once again found himself labouring under oppressive circumstances.

However, he categorically denied making any form of promise or inducement to him during their exchange. Instead, he testified that he had made a spontaneous decision to enter James’s interview room as he was walking past, to have a word with him about certain discrepancies in the commission sharing percentages between James’s and Aziz’s accounts.

</div>
</div> I agree with this observation. What James meant by replacing the “essence” of the statement was amending whole paragraphs or chunks of paragraphs. If such a replacement had occurred, it would necessarily suggest an allegation that the statement recorders had fabricated large portions of James’s statements. This is a serious allegation that was not put to the recorders. Moreover, in my view, there is nothing to suggest that the statement recorders had engaged in any such fabrication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is thus clear to me that James’s allegation that CSI Chris had offered him an inducement or made him a promise was nothing more than an afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether James’s statements should be excluded pursuant to the court’s residual discretion at common law to exclude prejudicial evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In a similar vein as Aziz’s submission, James submits that there were procedural irregularities during the statement recording process which warranted the exercise of the court’s common law discretion to exclude the contested statements on the basis that their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value. James’s main argument in this regard is that his statement recorders, PSI Lam and SSI Mak, had testified at trial to having paraphrased what James had communicated to them.

</div>
</div>
</div> To this end, James argues that their paraphrasing took on two main forms: (a) the paraphrasing of his choice of words; and (b) the substitution of references he made to “CSR/implementation costs” to “Agus”. I have addressed and rejected James’s allegation of the latter form of paraphrasing. I therefore deal now only with his argument concerning the paraphrasing of his choice of words. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 James relies on M Karthigesu JA’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Taw Cheng Kong v PP </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 78 (“<span class="font-italic">Taw Cheng Kong</span>”), to support his argument that his statements should be excluded on account of paraphrasing done by PSI Lam and SSI Mak: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">108 … The process by which these “confessions” were made left much to be desired: being recorded not verbatim but in note form, in handwriting, then transcribed into typewritten form by paraphrasing the handwritten notes, with the insertion of facts from memory which were not referred to in the handwritten notes, and the omission altogether of references to other “key words” contained in the handwritten notes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">109 … [The typewritten transcripts] can, by no stretch of the imagination, be considered exclusively the appellant’s statements since their contents may have been supplemented by Betty Khoo from her own personal knowledge, or suffered from a defect in her powers of recollection … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The above passage from <span class="font-italic">Taw Cheng Kong</span> must be understood in its proper context. In <span class="font-italic">Taw Cheng Kong</span>, the appellant’s statements, which were recorded by a Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (“GIC”) investigation officer (the “GIC statements”), were admitted at a <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span>. However, subsequent to this <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span>, new evidence surfaced indicating that the GIC investigation officer had made handwritten notes of the interviews and prepared a typewritten “transcript” of the interviews based on these. The appellant did not sign any of the handwritten or typewritten notes. It was the typewritten notes that constituted the GIC statements which were tendered in evidence as confessions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The factual background to M Karthigesu JA’s observations is thus starkly different from what has transpired here. It is undisputed that James’s statements were recorded contemporaneously and that he was given the opportunity thereafter to read and amend these statements at will. He had also signed on every page of the statements. The significant procedural irregularities before the court in <span class="font-italic">Taw Cheng Kong</span> are thus not present in the instant case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Hence, while it may not have been ideal that PSI Lam and SSI Mak had paraphrased the choice of words used by James during his statement recording, I am of the view that this was not a significant procedural irregularity such as to warrant the exercise of the court’s common law discretion to exclude these contested statements, given that James had the opportunity to make corrections to his statements, as noted above. Having found also that there was no inducement or promise made by CSI Chris to James, there was consequently no reason for him not to make substantial amendments to his statements if they had been wrongly worded before appending his signature on every page. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In my view, the effect of any paraphrasing would go towards the determination of the weight to be placed on the statements. It is to this which I turn next. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Weight to be placed on James’s statements </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I accept that caution ought to be exercised in assessing the weight to be placed on James’s statements because of the paraphrasing involved. Nonetheless, upon considering the contents of the statements as well as the circumstances in which they were recorded, I did not find that any paraphrasing done had much impact on their reliability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 First, as I have observed earlier, James was given the opportunity to read through his statements and make amendments if he so desired. If PSI Lam and SSI Mak had paraphrased his words in a manner which materially altered the account he had provided to them during his statement recording, he could have easily made amendments to correct any discrepancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Second, I am mindful that the act of paraphrasing James’s choice of words falls far short of re-writing or fabricating entire portions of James’s statements. I am satisfied that the contents of James’s statements could only have come from him and any paraphrasing could only have been cosmetic in nature. For example, in his 2nd statement, James was referred to photographs of Laos Airlines airplane sickness bags, which he explained belonged to him and were used by him to hand over Aziz’s and Agus’s share of his commission earned from the sale of the Guarantees by AIG and Liberty.

Therefore, the court must be able to refer to the statement by James for the purpose of finding that just as James had given, Aziz had received.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I respectfully disagree with the DJ’s interpretation of the pre-amendment s 258(5). I appreciate that there is an intuitive attraction to the reasoning behind the DJ’s interpretation of the phrase “the same offence” in the pre-amendment s 258(5), and to read it as extending to the present offences which are for all intents and purposes mirror images of each other. However, to interpret the phrase in this manner is, in my view, to do violence to its plain meaning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Based on a literal reading of the provision, the mirror charges faced by Aziz and James <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be regarded as constituting the “same offence”. I find support for this view in the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v PP and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1003 at [60]–[62], where the court endorsed the trial judge’s conclusion that the provision would only apply if the “<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">co-accused persons in question faced </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">precisely the same charges for identical crimes</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, or if one of the co-accused persons was charged with abetting the other in the commission of the offence with which the other was charged, or if one of the co-accused persons was charged with attempting to commit the exact same offence as the other”</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [emphasis added]. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">These are the exhaustive circumstances in which the provision can be relied upon. In my view, the phrase “precisely the same charges for identical crimes” requires the coincidence of both </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">form</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">substance</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. It is insufficient for the offences to simply concern the same </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">set of facts for the provision to be invoked. As the form of the charges faced by Aziz and James are patently different, with the former facing charges under s 5(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)(</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">i) and the latter facing charges under s 5(</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">b</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">)(</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">i) of the PCA, the pre-amendment s 258(5) thus cannot apply. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 My view is fortified by the subsequent amendments made by Parliament in the CJRA to s 258(5) read together with the accompanying illustrations. The post-amendment s 258(5) introduces two additional circumstances (reflected in ss 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)) in which a confession made by an accused person can be taken into consideration by the court as against his other co-accused persons where they have been jointly tried. The amendment however retained the original circumstance covered by s 258(5) in the form of s 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 For the present purpose, the most relevant amendment is the additional circumstance provided in s 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the amended CPC which is reproduced above at [96]. An example of this particular circumstance arising in practice can be found in illustration (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) which is directly relevant here. This illustration explicitly provides that where a giver and receiver are jointly tried for offences under ss 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PCA, if a confession made by the giver affecting both him and the receiver is proved and the same facts are alleged in the charges against both of them, the court may take into consideration the giver’s confession as against the receiver, <span class="font-italic">even though the giver and receiver are charged with offences that have different elements</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 It is thus evident from the language of illustration (<span class="font-italic">c</span>), that offences under ss 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PCA are regarded by Parliament as separate offences which require proof of <span class="font-italic">different elements</span>. The expansion of the scope of s 258(5) in the amended CPC with the introduction of s 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and illustration (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) appears to be Parliament’s response to a previous lacuna in the pre-amendment CPC, whereby only the confessions of co-accused persons jointly tried with the <span class="font-italic">same </span>offence could be taken into consideration by the court as against each of them. Therefore, I agree with both Aziz’s and James’s submissions

In my view, they apply <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandis</span> to offences under s 5 of the PCA given that there is a substantial degree of overlap between the two provisions and s 6 is essentially a subset of s 5 with a narrower ambit (see <span class="font-italic">PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals </span>[2019] 5 SLR 926 (“<span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span>”) at [54]–[55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 It is also uncontroverted that the first element, the giving or receiving of the gratification, is concerned with the physical criminal act, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span>. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of the offence is complete even if the recipient has not yet had any opportunity to show favour to the giver in relation to the recipient’s affairs (see <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang </span>at [13]). It is the second to the fourth elements which are concerned with whether the giver or the recipient possessed a criminal intent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span>. Thus, Woo J in <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang</span> explains the relationship between these elements as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The second element relates to the causal, or consequential, link between the gratification and the act the gratification was intended to procure (or reward).

The question is whether the recipient received the gratification believing that it was given to him as a <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> for conferring a dishonest gain or advantage on the giver in relation to his … affairs. The court has treated these two elements together in its assessment of whether an offence is made out … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 … The objective corrupt element implies the feature of dishonesty. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 The fourth and final element relates to knowledge … The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Wing Seng</span> elaborated on the fourth element as follows (at [23]–[24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 I should clarify that ‘corrupt intent’ actually refers to whether the accused knew or realised what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. This is a subjective test and a more accurate formulation of what this court meant when it stated in [<span class="font-italic">PP v Khoo Yong </span><span class="font-italic">Hak </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 769] that ‘the giving must be accompanied by a corrupt intent’.

</div>
</div>
</div> They argue that this materially goes to proving the corrupt element particularised in their respective charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 To my mind, the starting point of the analysis must be the four legal elements underpinning s 5 of the PCA, these being the <span class="font-italic">only</span> requirements that the Prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to secure a conviction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The question that must be asked is this: Is it a requirement under any of the elements to prove that the key recipient (Agus) had the power to influence the accreditation process, or that he did materially influence the said process? Having considered the relevant authorities, I am of the view that the answer to this is no. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 First, it is well-established that the Prosecution need not prove this purported requirement in order to satisfy the first element of s 5 of the PCA pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of the offence. This was made abundantly clear in <span class="font-italic">Tey</span><span class="font-italic"> Tsun Hang</span> at [13], cited above at [109].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Second, it is also apparent that none of the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> elements import such a requirement. Where a charge is framed against the giver, it is the giver’s intention that is crucial. Conversely, where a charge is framed against the recipient, it is the recipient’s intention that is paramount. Likewise, where a middleman recipient is interposed between the key recipient and the giver, it is the middleman’s intention as a recipient in his own right that is critical. In the present case, we are thus primarily concerned with the intention of the giver, James, and the middleman recipient, Aziz. Ultimately, the inquiry into whether the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>elements are satisfied hinges on whether the accused in question gave or received gratification as an inducement or reward knowing or believing it to be for a corrupt purpose (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, with dishonesty). In order to evaluate this, the court may have regard to all the surrounding circumstances – for instance, evidence from the recipient – when determining the guilt of the giver, and <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. However, this in no way mandates a requirement that in every case evidence from the giver/recipient <span class="font-italic">must</span> be obtained, in order to infer the intention of the recipient/giver. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Parliament could not have intended to mandate such an onerous evidentiary requirement for the Prosecution to establish the <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> elements. This would be contrary to Singapore’s tough stance against corruption, and it would stymie the prosecution of givers/recipients of gratification, regardless of the reason why the recipient/giver was indisposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I am well aware that the circumstances of the present case are unique. While investigations were ongoing, Agus was covered by diplomatic immunity. CSI Chris testified that the CPIB had sought a waiver from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this immunity. However, they were unsuccessful. This tied the hands of both the CPIB investigators as well as the Prosecution. The DJ was thus certainly correct not to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for not producing Agus in court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 While it would have been helpful to hear evidence from Agus, the absence of his evidence is not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. For the reasons I consider below, I am satisfied that the evidence from the appellants’ individual statements support the intention of both Aziz and James for the payments to be made as a reward to Agus for showing favour in the accreditation process and for Aziz to influence Agus in that regard. Agus’s evidence was thus not necessary to establish their charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Moreover, as the DJ observed, there was ample reason for the appellants to think that Agus had shown favour such as to warrant the reward being given. Not only was Agus the Labour Attaché of the Embassy, but AIG and Liberty were also duly accredited in accordance with their agreement, and as it turned out, were the only ones ever accredited.

As mentioned earlier, this defence was not advanced by any of the appellants in the course of the main trial, including James. It was also not pursued at length in the appeal before me. Nonetheless, I propose to deal with it for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Quite apart from the fact that this alleged defence was not raised in the course of the main trial, I find that there is simply no credible evidence to commend it. It was thus entirely proper of the DJ to reject this defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 First, given the very nature of CSR contributions, they are usually made through formal channels with proper documentation. However, no documentary evidence was adduced by James to show that the payments made to Agus were for the purpose of making CSR contributions. It is simply unbelievable that either AIG, Liberty or the Embassy would deal with CSR contributions in cash stashed away in airplane sickness bags, with no official record documenting this. Moreover, as pointed out by the DJ, the letters from the Embassy tendered by James in his Case for the Defence did nothing to support his CSR defence. Instead, the letters demonstrated that CSR contributions would be formally requested by the Embassy pertaining to specific events. Additionally, Low Hwee Huan Derek (“Derek”), the Executive Vice-President (Personal Lines) of Liberty at the time, testified that Liberty had only made one lump sum contribution of $2,000 towards CSR which was paid by way of a cheque made out to the Embassy and did not come from the sale of the Guarantees.

His later message stating “i want sending proposal for csr bro…” and the follow-up question “to who?” was also consistent with the testimonies by the representatives from AIG and Liberty, that they were approached by the Embassy to make contributions to their CSR funded events. Thus, at this point on 14 March 2018, Agus was simply asking James for future reference whom he should refer the Embassy’s legitimate requests for CSR to. This is in line with the idea that CSR requests should be made formally to the appropriate persons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Based on a reading of these messages, it is evident that Agus had two distinct questions for James. The first related to what <span class="font-italic">personal benefit</span> he was to derive from the PBs and the second related to whom (from AIG and Liberty) he should send the Embassy’s official proposals for CSR to. If Agus’s first question had anything to do with CSR, he would not have asked what rewards there were for <span class="font-italic">him</span> specifically. Reading these messages together with Aziz’s 4th statement further reinforces the point that the payments by James to Agus could not have been for the purpose of CSR. In Aziz’s 4th statement, he stated that Agus frequently chased him to get payment from James in respect of the Guarantees sold, and once even threatened to “switch off the system if James … refused or delayed” in making payment.

</div> If these payments were indeed CSR payments, it is certainly odd that Agus would ask Aziz to chase James personally for these payments (instead of the representatives from AIG and Liberty), and that any refused or delayed payments would be cause for the termination of AIG/Liberty’s accreditation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Considering the evidence in its totality, James’s CSR defence quite simply has no legs to stand on. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Element 4: The gratification was given by James, and received by Aziz, with guilty knowledge </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Finally, the evidence in Aziz’s and James’s statements unequivocally demonstrate that they possessed the requisite guilty knowledge. I cite only a few examples to illustrate this. In Aziz’s 1st statement, when he was asked why he thought James was uncomfortable giving money directly to Agus, he replied: “He [James] did not want to be seen bribing Agus. I was also not feeling comfortable to help him give as I did not want to get involved.”

Further, at a subsequent internal meeting at Tokio Marine’s office on 5 March 2018, where David, Choo, Cher Ah Kow (the Chief Executive of Tokio Marine), and some other staff were present, David and Choo testified that they knew Aziz was asking for a bribe and a decision was made not to accede to this request.

She found that this did not sit well with the evidence from David and Choo that Aziz had followed up on his request after the meeting, even going so far as to message David while he was away on holiday to ask for updates.

I would add that Aziz’s explanation is also incongruent with Choo’s evidence on his subsequent meeting with Agus sometime in May 2018, where Agus had specifically communicated his requirement that any commission moneys to him were to be paid in cash, with no paper trail. Although Choo had explained then that official receipts had to be issued for audit purposes, Agus had insisted on cash payments. Agus even suggested that AVA Insurance find other ways to make payments to him, for example, by registering a new company.

Aziz did solicit a 40% commission from the representatives of Tokio Marine as an inducement for Agus to grant accreditation to Tokio Marine. As established in respect of the 18 mirror charges above, the solicitation of payments of such a nature is invariably corrupt.

It cannot be controverted that Benjamin’s introduction of James to Aziz clearly facilitated the commission of the offences which related to the payment of bribes from James to Aziz and Agus. This introduction was in fact the very catalyst that set the entire corrupt transaction into motion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Further, Benjamin’s belated denial of any knowledge regarding the circumstances of the offence directly contradicts his clear and unequivocal admissions in his investigative statements. At the time he introduced James to Aziz, he had full knowledge that whichever insurance agent or company that sought to be accredited would need to pay bribes to people in the Embassy. This is evident from Benjamin’s 2nd statement:

Based on the admissions in his statements, his conviction is unimpeachable. His choice to remain silent when confronted with his statements leads to the irrefutable conclusion that he simply had no defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Second, although Aziz had given evidence during his ancillary hearing that the statement recorders refused to record the initial version of events which he had provided to them, he chose not to take the stand to provide an account of what was, in his view, the correct account of what had transpired. I thus accept the DJ’s inference that Aziz did not have any more innocuous explanation for the events that unfolded.

Their appeals are limited only to contesting the custodial sentences imposed. Aziz is not challenging the penalty sum imposed on him under s 13 of the PCA. Benjamin is also not challenging the fine amount imposed. Accordingly, I deal only with their appeals against the custodial terms meted out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I preface my decision with some general observations on sentencing in corruption offences. In two recent High Court decisions, <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span> and <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Wong Chee Meng</span> [2020] 5 SLR 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span>”), this court had to consider the issue of whether to adopt a sentencing framework for PCA offences. In <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span>, the question was whether it would be appropriate to promulgate a general sentencing framework for corruption offences under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA. Hoo Sheau Peng J (“Hoo J”) declined to do so. She observed that the wide variety of acts caught by ss 5 and 6 of the PCA would make the crafting of a single sentencing framework applicable to all such offences an extremely challenging task (see <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span> at [104]). In <span class="font-italic">Wong Chee Meng</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ (“Menon CJ”) declined to lay down a sentencing framework applicable generally to all offences under ss 5 and 6 of the PCA. One main reason for this was because the gravamen of the offences differed. In particular, he observed that the offence under s 6 of the PCA is rooted in the notion of <span class="font-italic">agents</span> who have allowed their loyalty to their <span class="font-italic">principal</span> to become suborned through the corrupt receipt of gratification. This differs in complexion from s 5 of the PCA, which targets corrupt transactions more generally. Given this, <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">there is the distinct possibility of different sentencing considerations being relevant for offences under s 5 of the PCA (see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Wong Chee Meng</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [59]). </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">However, Menon CJ nevertheless set out a </span>sentencing framework applicable in the narrower context of offences under s 6 read with s 7 of the PCA. As the question of the appropriateness of promulgating a sentencing framework for offences under s 5 of the PCA is not before me in these appeals, I leave this open for consideration on a future occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 For now, I can do no better than to summarise the relevant factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [99]), which serve as a useful reference point in the calibration of the appropriate sentence for corruption offences:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The value of the gratification;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The consequences of the corruption. This includes consideration of the type of policy considerations implicated, which vary depending on whether the corruption involved relates to: (i) public sector corruption; (ii) private sector corruption; or (iii) corruption involving a foreign public official;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Motivation of the offender;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The web of corruption or broader syndicate operations;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The extent of premeditation and sophistication;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Duration of offending;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Role of the offender;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Transnational nature of the offence; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether the corrupt conduct was endemic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In the present case, the DJ correctly identified that the starting point for the offences was a custodial term as they involved the giving of gratification to a foreign public official (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Agus, the Labour Attaché from the Embassy).

</div> This offence-specific aggravating factor, in my view, applies across all of the appellants’ charges, and no distinction should be made even for the charges which did not specifically name Agus as an involved party. The reason for this is apparent once one considers that the entire corrupt transaction was premised on the single purpose of providing rewards to Agus in respect of his help in accrediting AIG and Liberty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Having established that the relevant starting point for the sentences to be imposed should necessarily be a custodial term, I now turn to consider whether the lengths of the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Aziz’s appeal against sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The 18 mirror charges</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 At the outset, I note that Aziz takes no issue with the DJ’s reasoning and broad sentencing approach. His only quarrel is with the DJ’s numerical calibration of the individual sentences based on the precedents she relied upon. Aziz thus submits that the following individual sentences are more appropriate (the sentences in s/n 4, 8, 12 and 18 were ordered by the DJ to run consecutively):

</div> Aziz disagreed with this. I am inclined to agree with Aziz’s objection. There is no evidence that AIG and Liberty were complicit in the corrupt transaction. Based on the Prosecution’s case, James acted unilaterally and paid out bribes from his own commission without the knowledge of his principals. Moreover, while there may have been some adverse impact, to my mind, this was not significant enough to constitute a standalone aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I also accept that Aziz may not have been the main force behind the corrupt arrangement, although I am nonetheless cognisant that he played a significant role in the co-ordination and facilitation of the entire scheme. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 I now turn to the precedents relied on by the DJ and the parties in the court below. The DJ found guidance from two cases cited by the parties, <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chew Hoe Soon </span>(DAC-916888-2017 and others) (“<span class="font-italic">Chew Hoe Soon</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 It bears repeating the caution against the reliance on unreported decisions (see <span class="font-italic">Luong </span><span class="font-italic">Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP </span>[2010] 1 SLR 707 at [21]). These decisions often lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire factual landscape required to appreciate the precise sentences imposed. The lack of reasoned grounds also greatly diminishes the precedential value of these decisions. I therefore hesitate to place much weight on the case of <span class="font-italic">Chew</span><span class="font-italic"> Hoe Soon</span>. In any event, having considered the facts of the case as set out by the DJ (GD at [230]), it appears to me that the sentence imposed there was lenient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The second precedent considered by the DJ was <span class="font-italic">Michael Tan</span>. In that case, the offender in the first appeal, Tan Kok Ming Michael, had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 5(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the PCA, for giving a sum of $10,000 to one Owyong Thian Lai (“Owyong”) for the purpose of bribing officers from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (“APMM”) to detain a vessel belonging to his competitor. Two further charges under the same provision involving amounts of $10,000 each were taken into consideration for sentencing (“TIC charges”). As this case involved the giving of gratification to Owyong for the benefit of APMM officers, Hoo J held that this triggered the relevant policy considerations surrounding corruption involving foreign public officials. Therefore, the custodial threshold had been crossed. The other relevant sentencing factors considered included: (a) the total sum of the gratification (including the gratification forming the subject-matter of the TIC charges) which amounted to $30,000; (b) the offender’s motivation borne out of self-interest (namely to create a non-level playing field for himself); and (c) the two other TIC charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 Having regard to the relevant offence-specific factors outlined above as well as the precedents cited, I am of the view that the DJ’s calibration of the individual sentences cannot be considered to be manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Tokio Marine charge </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In relation to the Tokio Marine charge, the DJ relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">PP</span><span class="font-italic"> v Su Fengxian </span>[2018] SGDC 40, where the offender had tried to bribe an official from the Singapore Table Tennis Association and received a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment after trial. The DJ then applied an uplift to two months’ imprisonment to take into account the fact that Aziz had solicited bribes for a foreign public official. Aziz submits instead that a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment is appropriate. He did not provide any grounds to support this submission, and I am unable see any cogent reason to depart from the sentence imposed by the DJ. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The global sentence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 For completeness, I note that Aziz rightly did not challenge the DJ’s decision to run five sentences consecutively, namely the 4th, 8th, 12th, 18th and 19th charges. This was clearly commensurate with his culpability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 I therefore dismiss Aziz’s appeal against sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s appeal against sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Benjamin did not provide any written submissions for his appeal against sentence. In his oral submissions, he merely reiterated that his role in the entire corrupt transaction was limited and pleaded for a lighter sentence. This limited role was in fact recognised by the DJ in her calibration of the appropriate sentence to impose.
