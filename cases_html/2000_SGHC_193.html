<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Decision</strong></font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THE CHARGES</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1 The Accused is now 38 years old. He

pleaded guilty to two Charges under Section 354 of the Penal Code involving outrage of

modesty committed against his niece in September 1997 and November 1999 when she was then

10 and 12 years old respectively. His niece (hereinafter referred to as "the

victim") is an orphan living with her sisters in their grandmother’s flat. The

Accused also pleaded guilty to three Charges under Section 377 of the Penal Code for

having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with the victim by causing her to

perform fellatio on him in November 1997, December 1997 and October 1999. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 In addition, the Accused admitted 21

other Charges of outrage of modesty under Section 354 of the Penal Code committed against

the victim between May 1997 and October 1999. These 21 Section 354 of the Penal Code

Charges alleged that the Accused caressed the victim’s body, fondled her nipples and

rubbed his erect penis against her vagina. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 The first Section 354 of the Penal Code

Charge to which he pleaded guilty alleged kissing of the mouth, sucking of the nipples and

rubbing his erect penis against her vagina. The second alleged that he caressed her body,

fondled her nipples and kissed her mouth.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The Statement of Facts added a prelude

to the first outrage of modesty Charge which took place in the Accused’s

brother-in-law’s flat which was the one next to the victim’s grandmother’s.

The Accused first kissed the victim’s face and mouth and then put some facial cream

on her hand and taught her to masturbate him. When he ejaculated, she was shocked and ran

into the toilet. The Accused then called her to the bedroom again and asked her to lie

down on the floor. After that, he pushed up her t-shirt and sucked her nipples. He also

kissed her mouth and inserted his tongue therein. He then removed her pants and panties

and told her to spread her legs. He next went on top of her and rubbed his penis against

her vagina until he ejaculated onto a piece of tissue. They then washed themselves and

went next door to the victim’s grandmother’s flat. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 The second outrage of modesty Charge to

which the Accused pleaded guilty was the last in the series of offences committed against

the victim. That took place at the Accused’s home on 6 November 1999. The victim had

gone there with some relatives. The Accused and his wife were home. At first, everyone in

the flat was doing karaoke singing in the living room. The Accused then went to one of the

bedrooms to rest. When the victim entered that bedroom to get a compact disc, he asked her

to lock the door but she merely closed it. He asked her to sit on the bed and, after

pushing her gently to lie down, proceeded to fondle and suck her nipples and to kiss her.

He then placed her body on top of his with her back towards him. Before anything else

happened, the Accused’s wife entered the bedroom whereupon the Accused released the

victim and both of them jumped off the bed. A heated argument between the Accused and his

wife ensued while the victim ran out of the bedroom in tears. She was subsequently brought

home. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 On 13 November 1999, the victim’s

step-sister brought her to Tanglin Police Division Headquarters to lodge a report that the

victim had been raped by the Accused. Subsequent investigations revealed that she was not

raped but that the offences in question had been committed against her.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 In respect of the three Section 377 of

the Penal Code Charges, the victim was asked each time to lick the Accused’s penis

until it became erect and then to suck it. He would then withdraw his penis and ejaculate

onto a piece of tissue. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON

SENTENCE</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The Prosecution noted that Section 377

of the Penal Code provides for imprisonment for life or for up to 10 years with a

discretionary fine and that Section 354 of the Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up

to two years or a fine or caning or any two of such punishments. Citing <i>Chia Kim Heng

Frederick v PP</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 361</nobr>, the Prosecution submitted that the Court should take

into account the victim’s young age, the Accused’s position of responsibility

and trust vis--vis the victim and any perversions or gross indignities forced on the

victim. Although that case involved the offence of rape, the Prosecution argued that those

factors in sentencing were equally apposite here as the present offences were also sexual

in nature. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 Stressing that the victim was only 10

years when the first abuse took place and the fact that she is an orphan depending heavily

on her extended family for care and emotional support, the Prosecution pressed for a

deterrent sentence to be imposed on the Accused. In addition, the Prosecution pointed out

that the Accused had told the police that he would often tell the victim that he would buy

her sweets and other things if she allowed him to touch her. He had also shown her obscene

video tapes of people engaging in sexual intercourse on three occasions when he molested

her. It was also emphasized that the offences were a series committed over some two years.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 Relying on <i>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v

PP</i> <nobr>[1991] 1 MLJ 321</nobr>, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s plea of guilt

should not be the dominant consideration in deciding the appropriate sentence here because

he was practically caught red-handed by his wife, had confessed at a "family

meeting" that he had "disturbed" the victim and had admitted the offences

to the police. He was therefore pleading guilty when he had "no means of escape"

(words borrowed from the case cited).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE MITIGATION PLEA</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 Defence Counsel informed me that the

Accused was working as a postman for 20 years. He was also a first offender. He is married

with two young children. His wife is a full-time homemaker.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 The victim was said to be very fond of

and very attached to the Accused. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 After the confrontation in the

Accused’s flat on 6 November 1999, the Accused’s wife informed her mother (the

victim’s grandmother) who questioned the victim and disciplined her by beating her.

That angered the victim’s elder step-sister who decided to lodge a police report

after discussing the matter with other family members.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 The Accused was remorseful and had

admitted everything to the police. He had not used force or threats against the victim at

any time. He was exempted from performing reserve service after his full-time national

service on medical grounds. Defence Counsel also urged me to backdate the imprisonment

sentence to the date of his arrest on 3 May 2000. While not implying that the victim had

consented to the acts, Defence Counsel submitted that if the Accused had thought about the

matter, he would have obtained her consent as she was already 12 years old in 1999. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><u> </u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 This is another sad and sordid case of

an erstwhile innocent young girl sexually abused by an adult relative. The victim was only

10 years old when the first of the series of offences took place. She is now 13 years old

and has just begun secondary education. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 The Accused, now 38 years old, instead

of displaying avuncular love, chose to bury the sweet innocence of his young niece in an

avalanche of lust. The series of sexual assaults stretched over a period of more than two

years. An uncle should be buying games and toys for his growing niece, not treating her as

fair game and playing with her as if she were his toy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 Children of such tender age and in such

an emotionally dependent situation as the present must be protected against adult

predators who entice them with gifts or attempt in any way to deprive their young minds of

innocence and to deprave their young bodies. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 Sexual offences committed by relatives

cause waves of emotional distress and recrimination long after the events because the

offender and the offender’s family are likely to come into contact with the victim

and her family again. Relationships among family members can become extremely strained if

not altogether destroyed. It is therefore appropriate that accused persons in such

situations should be kept out of society for a sufficiently long period of time in order

to assuage the hurt and to allow the painful memories to fade away.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 The Accused has no previous conviction

but that fact must be viewed in the context that his offences were not uncovered for more

than two years. That again underlines the insidiousness of offences committed by adult

relatives – they have every reason to be near their vulnerable victims who may feel

great discomfort in making any complaints against their uncle. The Accused has however

admitted his offences, first, in front of his relatives, and later, when questioned by the

police. He has also pleaded guilty and admitted all the offences, obviating the need for

his niece to come to Court to face him and to recount all the embarrassing and hurtful

events of the past few years. For this, appropriate credit will be given in the sentences.

</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 Mr Abdul Hamed Bin Yahya, I now

pronounce the sentences of this Court on you. For the 1<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>

Charges under Section 354 of the Penal Code – I sentence you to one year imprisonment

and eight strokes of the cane per Charge. For the 24<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup>

Charges concerning Section 377 of the Penal Code – I sentence you to seven years

imprisonment per Charge. The imprisonment terms for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 24<sup>th</sup>

and 25<sup>th</sup> Charges will run consecutively while the rest will run concurrently

with the other sentences, making a total of 15 years imprisonment and 16 strokes of the

cane. The imprisonment terms are backdated to commence on 3 May 2000.</font></p>
