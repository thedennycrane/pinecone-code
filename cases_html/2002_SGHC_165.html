Wahdin Basharahil ("the Testator") died on 15 July 1953 in Madura, Indonesia

leaving properties in Singapore. He had made a Will in Singapore on 3 September 1938, the

terms of which are as follows:</font>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">I, SHAIK AHMAD BIN ABDULLAH WAHDAIN BASHARAHIL, at

    present residing at No. 26 Lorong 30, Geylang Road, Singapore, Trader, hereby revoke all

    former wills codicils and testamentary instruments heretofore made by me of and concerning

    my estate and effects moveable and immoveable in the colony of the Straits Settlements.</font></p>
<p align="justify">1. I appoint:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">my lawful sons at present residing in Java to be the executors and

      trustees of this my will and the guardians of my infant children.</p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">2. I devise and bequeath all my lands and houses in

    Singapore and elsewhere in the Colony of the Straits Settlements unto my trustees upon

    trust that my trustees shall until the expiration of twenty-one years from the date of my

    death stand possessed of the annual income thereof in trust for <u>the persons or person

    who would at my death have been entitled according to Mohamedan Law to my estate and

    effects if I had died intestate</u> and upon further trust that after the expiration of

    twenty-one years from the date of my death my trustees shall sell call in and convert into

    money all such parts thereof as shall not consist of money with power "to postpone

    the sale calling in and conversion of any part of my real and personal estate for such

    period as they in their absolute discretion may deem fit and shall stand possessed of the

    proceeds of such sale and conversion upon trust for the person or persons who would at my

    death have been entitled according to Mohamedan Law to my estate and effects if I had died

    intestate.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The words underlined above

are indicative of the issue before me, i.e. a determination of the persons who, at the

death of the Testator, were entitled to his estate according to Mohamedan Law if he had

died intestate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2 The Testator died leaving a

large number of immovable properties. Probate to the Will of the Testator was originally

granted to Shaik Sayeed bin Ahmad Waidin Basharahil, one of the Executors and Trustees

named in the Will. Subsequently the Public Trustee was appointed trustee of the Will by an

Order of Court dated 11 October 1976 in Originating Summons No. 80 of 1976 as the Court

was satisfied that the original trustee was permanently residing out of the jurisdiction

and was unfit to act as such trustee. By this order, 61 immovable properties belonging to

the estate of the Testator became vested in the Public Trustee. Since then 32 of those

properties had been compulsorily acquired by the State leaving only 29 immovable

properties vested in the Public Trustee which are the subject matter of these proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3 As the Testator died on 15 July

1953 the estate of the Testator was to be wound up 21 years from the date of death of the

Testator i.e. immediately after 15 July 1974 ("date of distribution"). The date

of distribution had long passed by some 26 years as of the date of filing of the first

summons, OS 1030/2000.</font></p>

1030/2000 is the Public Trustee. The second Applicant ("Quraisj") is the

attorney of six persons who claim to be some of the beneficiaries under the Will. The

    treaty at such prices and on such terms and conditions as the 1<sup>st</sup> Applicant may

    in his absolute discretion determine (but having regard to the valuation prices as set out

    in the Valuation Reports attached to the 1st Affidavit of the 1<sup>st</sup> Applicant in

    support of this application) freed from all encumbrances including:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5 This application for

sale was objected to by the fifth Respondent ("Musa") and sixth Respondent

("Salim") objected. They claim to represent another group of beneficiaries. More

than this, they claim that the persons that Quraisj represents are not beneficiaries under

the Will. Musa and Salim claim that the people they represent constitute all the

beneficiaries under the Will.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Inquiry as to

beneficiaries</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8 The inquiry pursuant to Order 2

above was conducted on 3 July 2002. The Public Trustee was not a party to that inquiry as

he is merely a trustee and is not concerned with the outcome. Quraisj admits the claim by

Musa and Salim that the people they represent are beneficiaries under the Will, but not to

their claim that they constitute all the beneficiaries. So the only issue is whether the

persons that Quraisj represents, and any others, are also beneficiaries under the Will.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9 The agreed facts are as

follows: The Testator had, in accordance with Indonesian law, married one Saimih who bore

him six sons, and also a daughter who predeceased him. Saimih died in or about 1928. Those

six sons married and had children. All six died between 1973 and 1987. Musa and Salim are

the sons of two of them and claim to represent the branch of beneficiaries arising from

Saimih's children. Apart from Saimih, the Testator also had children by four other women

and what is under contest is whether they were legally married to him under Muslim law.

The second wife (this term being used without prejudice) is Maimunah, who bore the

Testator a son and a daughter. The third wife is Aisyah who bore him two sons. The fourth

wife is Samani who bore him a daughter. The fifth wife is Maria who bore him two sons. The

Testator had at various stages, divorced his second, third and fourth wives. At the time

of his death, he was survived by:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) six sons by Saimih, the first

  wife;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) a son and a daughter by

  Maimunah, the second wife;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) two sons by Aisyah, the third

  wife;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) one daughter by Samani, the

  fourth wife;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(e) Maria, his fifth wife; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(f) two sons by Maria.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10 The sole issue is therefore

whether the Testator had been married under Muslim law to the second to fifth wives. If he

had not, then the beneficiaries are just the six sons by Saimih and consequently their

descendants would be entitled to the entire estate under the Will. If he did, then the

number of beneficiaries would be 14, with the six sons by Saimih being collectively

entitled to only 84/192 or 43.75% of the estate.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11 Musa and Salim have filed two

affidavits in both summons. The first affidavit is their joint affidavit filed 1 November

2000, in which they relate the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the persons represented by

    Quraisj are not beneficiaries and therefore not entitled to claim any share or interest in

    the estate of the Testator;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) there was "in fact no

    statement of marriage between the Testator and the said Madam Maria", bearing in mind

    that in Indonesia all marriages (including Muslim marriages) are valid and recognisable by

    the State only if they are registered and not otherwise;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) the Inheritance Certificate

    from the Surabaya Inheritance Property Administration Office dated 7th February 1992

    certified that the following six children are the heirs of the Testator:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12 However in an earlier

Affidavit affirmed by Salim and filed on 14 July 1995 in an earlier action, OS 473/1995,

he had stated that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) that the Testator had

    "four other wives one of whom is one Maria ….";</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) that OS 473 of 1995 was a

    fraudulent attempt by the Plaintiff in that summons (Abdul Rachman bin Abdullah Wahdin,

    one of Saimih’s grandsons) to cheat the rest of the beneficiaries of the estate of

    the Testator including Quraisj.</font><font size="4"></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13 Salim deposed in an

affidavit filed on 27 August 2001 to explain the contradiction. He said as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    the contents of the

  Affidavit in OS 473/1995 was "<i>not interpreted</i>" to him and the "<i>legal

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>(c) </em>   there was "<i>no

</blockquote>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">14 However if there had

been such glaring errors in his earlier affidavit, Salim should have taken steps to

rectify them as its contents could have misled the Court in arriving at the decision that

it did in those proceedings. Neither Salim nor the solicitors who acted for him in OS

473/1995 had filed affidavits explaining whether:</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) Salim was in fact illiterate

in the English language;</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) Salim gave his instructions

for the Affidavit in the Indonesian or some other language;</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) the contents of the Affidavit

filed by him in OS 473/1995 were in fact the instructions given by him to his former

solicitors;</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) the contents of the Affidavit

filed in OS 473/1995 were explained to him and whether he fully understood and

acknowledged the contents thereof.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the absence of such Affidavit

by Salim’s former solicitors I cannot place much reliance on that aspect of the joint

affidavit of Musa and Salim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15 In OS 473/1995, Quraisj had

filed an affidavit on 13 July 1995 in which he stated that there were fourteen principal

beneficiaries of the Testator under Muslim law. Salim had, in his affidavit filed on 14

July 1995 in that summons, made the following statement in  4:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">My Father Hasan bin Achmad bin

    Abdullah Wachdin Basharahil …. is entitled to a 14/192 share of the estate of the

    Testator. Annexed and marked SH2 is a translated copy of a Certificate of Inheritance from

    the office of the Public Trustee of Surabaya</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The share of 14/192 that he

asserts is consistent with Quraisj’s position and inconsistent with his and

Musa’s. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16 I should add further that the

joint affidavit of Musa and Salim is devoid of any assertion that Maria was not married to

the Testator in accordance with Muslim law. All that the deponents have said is as

follows, at  17(1):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The words in bold only assert

that the State does not recognise the marriage if it was not registered in accordance with

Indonesian law. It does not assert that the marriage was not conducted in accordance with

Muslim law. If anything, from the words "<i>including muslim marriages</i>",

there is an implication that the marriage was conducted in accordance with Muslim law.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17 As for the matter of the

Inheritance Certificate from the Surabaya Inheritance Property Administration Office, it

recites in the Certificate that the Office only took into consideration the children by

the first wife, Saimih. It is significant that the Certificate states that Saimih was the

"<i>first wife</i>", implying that she is not the only wife. In Salim’s

affidavit filed in OS 600626/2001 on 27 April 2001, he relied on two additional documents

as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i)    an Order of the Religious

  Court of Pamekasan, Madura, Indonesia dated 16 October 2000 that there are only six lawful

  beneficiaries of the Testator namely the six children by the Testator’s first wife

  Saimih. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii)    the Inheritance

  Certificates issued by the Shariah Court in Singapore on the basis of the facts disclosed

  in the Order of the Religious Court. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18 Quraisj points out in his

second affidavit that the Order of the Religious Court, on its face, reveals that the only

persons who appeared and furnished information before the Religious Court were Musa and

Salim. The Order was made on the erroneous basis that the Testator had only one wife,

namely Saimih, and six children. Musa and Salim did not reply to this affidavit although

they had the opportunity to do so.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19 As for the Inheritance

Certificates issued by Shariah Court, Singapore, they are based on the Order of the

Religious Court which is itself spurious. In any event it is for this Court to make the

relevant findings of fact. Section 115 of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap. 3)

states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1) If, in the course of any

    proceedings relating to the administration or distribution of the estate of a deceased

    person whose estate is to be distributed according to the Muslim law, any Court or

    authority shall be under the duty of determining the persons entitled to share in such

    estate or the shares to which such persons are respectively entitled, the Syariah Court

    may, on a request by the Court or authority or on the application of any person claiming

    to be a beneficiary and on payment of the prescribed fee, certify upon any set of facts

    found by such Court or authority or on any hypothetical set of facts its opinion as to the

    persons who are, assuming such facts, whether as found or hypothetical, entitled to share

    in such estate and as to the shares to which they are respectively entitled.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2) The Syariah Court may, before

    certifying its opinion, require to hear the parties on any question of law, but shall not

    hear evidence or make findings on any question of fact.</font><font size="3"></font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(3) In any case of special difficulty, the Syariah Court may refer the

    question to the Legal Committee of the Majlis for its opinion and shall, if such opinion

    be given, certify in accordance therewith. </p>
<font size="4">
</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This section provides that

the Shariah Court may, at the request of the Court, <i>"certify upon any set of facts

found by such Court …. or on any hypothetical set of facts its opinion"</i> as

to who are entitled to share in the estate of a deceased person. The role of the Shariah

Court is to provide a ruling as to Shariah law on facts determined by the Court. The

Inheritance Certificates in question were therefore not made on the correct set of facts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20 Quraisj had filed two

Affidavits in which he had set out the case on behalf of the beneficiaries he represented,

who were the offsprings of the third to fifth wives of the Testator. In his first

affidavit filed on 17 August 2000, he stated that, under Power of Attorney No. 10162 of

1999 executed in Singapore, he was appointed attorney of the following persons:</font></p>

this.</font></p>
