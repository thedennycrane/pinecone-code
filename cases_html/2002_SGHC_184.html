</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">Introduction </p>
<p></p></i></b>1.        The infant, who was the subject of

the appeal before me, was born in the mid-1990s. He is a male Malay.

<p xmlns="">2.        On 21 March 1997, an adoption order was

made (‘the Adoption Order’) in respect of the infant in favour of the Appellants

whose names I am also not mentioning because of the sensitive nature of the matter before

me. The Appellants are also Malays.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.        At the time the Adoption Order was made,

the full name of the infant conferred by the Adoption Order included his original name

which in turn referred to the name of his natural father e.g the adopted name was XYZ Bin

M, ‘M’ being the name of his natural father.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.        As a result, the birth certificate of the

infant issued on 30 May 1997 reflects the adopted name but save as aforesaid, there is no

suggestion therein that the infant is adopted by the Appellants whose names are recorded

in the birth certificate as his father and mother.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.        In 2002, the Appellants applied to amend

the Adoption Order to delete any reference in the adopted name to the infant’s

original name and for an order that the Registrar-General of Births and Deaths be directed

to re-register the birth and issue a new birth certificate in accordance with the amended

Adoption Order.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.        In their supporting affidavit, the

Appellants said they had not deleted the original name of the infant from the adopted name

at the time when they applied to adopt him because they believed that neither the natural

father, his wife or his family would disclose to the infant his true identity after the

Adoption Order was made. I should add that the natural father is a brother of the adopting

mother.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.        As events turned out, the infant was in

contact with his natural siblings.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.        Apparently for the last three months

before the application was made, these children, as well as other cousins of the infant,

have been telling him that he is not the natural son of the Appellants but of his natural

father. This caused him to be very sad and inquisitive. By then, he was about seven years

of age.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.        For better or worse, the Appellants did

not respond to his inquisitiveness by telling him the truth. Instead, they told him that

he is their son, meaning their natural son. The infant then insisted on seeing his birth

certificate thus causing the Appellants to be afraid that he would be ‘terribly

emotionally affected’ when he learns the truth.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.        Hence, the application was made to amend

the Adoption Order. The application was heard by District Judge Regina Ow. The

Attorney-General who was the guardian ad litem for the infant pending the making of the

Adoption Order appeared and objected to the application on the basis that the court had no

jurisdiction to amend the Adoption Order as the court was functus officio after the

Adoption Order was made.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.        The District Judge dismissed the

application on the ground that she had no jurisdiction to amend the Adoption Order. The

Appellants then appealed and I heard their appeal. After hearing submissions, I dismissed

the appeal. I now give my written reasons.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">My reasons</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">12.        Ms Dyan Zuzarte, from the

Attorney-General’s Chambers, drew my attention to an unreported decision of Michael

Hwang JC (as he then was) in Adoption Petition No 143 of 1990 where he held that he had no

power to allow amendment of an infant’s name to include his Hanyu Pinyin name after

the adoption order was made and perfected. However, no written reasons were given.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.        Counsel for the Appellants, Ms Halimah

Bte Abdul Jalil argued that that decision was wrong.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.        She submitted that the court had

jurisdiction to amend the Adoption Order notwithstanding that it had been made and

perfected. She relied on s 16 and 17 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) but

it was quite clear to me that those provisions did not address the question whether the

court had jurisdiction to amend an order after it was made and perfected. Moreover, the

initial application of the Appellants for amendment was made to the District Court and not

to the High Court (which is part of the Supreme Court).</p>
<p xmlns="">15.        Counsel for the Appellants then submitted

that para 14 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Amendment) Act

1993 provides that the court has ‘powers to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and

in equity’ but again, for the same reasons I have mentioned, this provision did not

help.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.        Counsel for the Appellants also relied on

O 92 r 4 of the Rules of Court which states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘4 For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in

  these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make

  any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process

  of the Court.’</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">She then cited <i>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62013&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 25</a>.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.        However the facts in the case she cited

were different and did not involve the question of amending an order that had been made

and perfected.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.        Furthermore, as far as I was aware, O 92

r 4 has never been used by a court or any party to amend an order already made and

perfected. Rather it is used to persuade a court to make an order before the court makes

its order.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.        I was of the view that the District Judge

was correct in concluding that the court had no jurisdiction to amend the Adoption Order

after it had been made and perfected, unless the amendment was being sought under what is

known as the slip-rule. This was not the case before me.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.        I also considered whether a court could

vary the Adoption Order, as opposed to amending it, on the basis of a change of

circumstances akin to a variation of maintenance for a woman and/or a child under the

Women’s Charter Act (Cap 353). However, that variation is allowed under specific

provisions of the Women’s Charter and, even then, such a variation does not relate

back to the date of the original maintenance order.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.        Having considered the scheme under the

Act and in particular s 12 thereof, I was of the view that the change of name for an

adopted infant arises only when an adoption order is made.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.        The material parts of s 12 state: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘12.(1) Where an adoption order has been made, the Registrar of

  the court by which the adoption order was made shall forthwith send to the

  Registrar-General of Births and Deaths a notice in the form set out in the Schedule,

  setting out the following particulars so far as they are known to the court:</p>
<p align="justify">(a)    the full name of the child before the making of

  the adoption order;</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    the full name of the child conferred by the

  adoption order;</p>
<p align="justify">[the other sub-provisions are not material.]</p>
<p align="justify">(2) ….</p>
<p align="justify">(3) <u>Upon</u> receipt of the form referred to in subsection (1), the

  Registrar-General shall if the birth of the adopted child has been registered in Singapore

  cause the entry in the relevant registrar of births to be marked with the word

  "Adopted". Particulars as to the birth of the child shall <u>then</u> be

  registered separately <u>substituting the name conferred by the adoption for the name of

  the child prior to adoption</u>, and recording the name, address and description of each

  adopting parent in substitution for the particulars as to the natural or last adopting

  parents.</p>
<p align="justify">(4) ….</p>
<p align="justify">(5) Where a copy of the entry as to the birth of any child to which

  this section relates is required for any purpose, the Registrar-General, subject to any

  regulations as to payment of fees as are prescribed, shall supply a copy of the last entry

  made pursuant to subsection (3) omitting in the copy of the word "Adopted" that

  appears in the original or former entry.’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.] </p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">23.        If an adopted infant or his adopting

parents are not happy with the name chosen at the time the adoption order is made, then

the change of name has to be effected by a deed poll but this will not alter the name in

the birth certificate.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.        My attention was also drawn to a decision

by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in <i>Re ABZ (An infant) </i>[1992] 2 SLR 445. In

that case, the infant was a Chinese and his natural parents were Chinese. However the

natural father had died and the mother married a man, Mr Z, of Japanese origin. They

adopted the infant with Mr Z’s surname. Subsequently, Mr and Mrs Z were divorced and

the mother had custody of the infant and had no intention of settling in Japan. The infant

went to school in Singapore and, according to the mother, was humiliated by other students

because of the Japanese surname. The mother then applied to set aside the adoption order

and Mr Z had no objection to the application.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.        Justice Chan decided this could not be

done. He went on to say that the infant’s surname could be changed by a deed poll,

but added, at p 445 A/B: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘… However, I note that the Act makes no provision for a

  birth certificate issued pursuant to s 12 to be changed to reflect a change of name.’</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I agreed.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.        I should add that Justice Chan was also

of the view that the mother in the case before him was not without recourse as she could

invoke s 9 of the Act to re-adopt the infant under the intended new name.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.        Section 9 states: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘9. An adoption order or an interim order may be made in respect

  of an infant who has already been the subject of an adoption order, and, upon any

  application for such further adoption order, <u>the adopter or adopters under the adoption

  order last previously made shall</u>, if living, <u>be deemed to be the parent or parents

  of the infant</u> for all the purposes of this Act.’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">28.        I was of the view that on the facts

before me, it was not possible for both the Appellants to apply to re-adopt the infant

under s 9 because s 9 envisages re-adoption by different adopting parents. It is not

necessary for me to express a view whether one of the Appellants can apply to re-adopt the

infant since such an application will create other problems for the infant as the name of

one of the Appellants will then drop out from the birth certificate to be issued.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.        There is also one more point which I

would wish to make. Although the Appellants might have good intentions, they were in

effect asking the court to assist them to continue to bluff the infant. I had serious

reservations as to whether the court should be an accomplice in this endeavour even if it

had the jurisdiction and power to do so.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.        Ultimately, the Appellants have no legal

recourse. However, it is precisely because there may be no recourse that adopting parents

must take great care in the choice of the adopted name.</p>
