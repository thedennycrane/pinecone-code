Since her business was successful, she told her parents, Goh Ah Moi (“Mother”) and Tay Sia Yong (“Father”), to use the proceeds from Serene Leather and purchase an apartment for their family to live in. An apartment at 18 Tong Watt Road (the “Valley Apartment”) was subsequently purchased by her parents and successfully sold in an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>exercise.

In his Defence, he vaguely states that Father purchased Valley Apartment “with his own money” and repaid the housing loan of $150,000 “with his own money”.

</div> Yak Ping must have realised that as a young boy of about   23 years old at the time of the purchase of the Valley Apartment, he could not have amassed such a large sum of money to pay for the down payment of Valley Apartment and the housing loan. At trial, he could not demonstrate that he had any occupation that would have enabled him to earn amounts of money sufficient for him to save enough money to pay for the down payment and housing loan for the Valley Apartment. Hence, he had to resort to saying that it was Father’s money from Father’s bamboo business that was used to purchase Valley Apartment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Even then, I note that his evidence is inconsistent and appears calculated to advance his case. Yak Ping says that Father’s business was doing well because there were few competitors. Father and Mother put all their money in the bank. He first says that when they were living at the Mohamed Sultan Property, he would help his parents deposit “a few thousand dollars” to their bank accounts about four to ten times a month. However, upon being asked whether there would be at least $20,000 deposited per month, Yak Ping recants and says it would be more like $5,000.

</div> His own self-contradiction shows that his recollection of bringing “a few thousands” several times a month to the bank was clearly inaccurate. This also demonstrates his propensity to exaggerate facts favourable to him. Further, Yak Ping’s claim that Father and Mother put all their money in the bank is also inconsistent with Lah Moi’s and Serene’s recollection. Serene testifies that Father and Mother kept their money at home because they did not trust the bank.

</div> In the 1970s, before Yak Hoe, Jee Soon, Lah Moi and Mui Kiah had gotten married and moved out, the sleeping arrangements for the nine of them was very telling as to the kind of lifestyle the family had. There was only one room on the first level of the Mohamed Sultan Property. In this room, Father and Mother slept on the bed. Two sisters would sleep under the bed frame (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, underneath Father and Mother’s bed) while another two sisters would sleep on the sides of the bed. Father constructed a small elevated space which allowed two brothers to climb a ladder to that space to sleep while the third brother slept in a hammock downstairs.

</div> Considering the totality of the evidence, I believe that Father was, if not poor, at least struggling to support the expenses of such a large family before Serene Leather was started. In my view, it is again inexplicable why the family would have had to endure such living conditions if Father, as per Yak Ping’s case, was rich and had substantial savings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 This is supported by an incident that Nguang Keow recalls sometime around 1975. She suggested to Mother to buy a HDB flat since the children had grown older and the sleeping arrangements at the Mohamed Sultan Property became “not so convenient”. However, Mother said that they did not have money to buy such a property.

</div> In my view, it is much more probable that Father and Mother were struggling to make ends meet during those years. That was the reason they could not afford to buy a property but instead had to rent the first storey of the Mohamed Sultan Property despite the space being insufficient for their large family of nine persons. It bordered on the unbelievable that if Father had been earning $5,000 per month from the Bamboo business and had access to large sums of savings that he would not purchase a property so that his family could live in more comfortable living conditions. When this was put to Yak Ping, he maintains that Father was not poor but merely stingy.

</div> He even went so far as to say that “back in those days, it would cost about the same if you lease the premises from others, and you take a loan from the bank. So [in] that era, very few people would buy properties”. I do not find this explanation believable. Even if the cost of rental may be the same as the instalments for the housing loan, there remains a critical difference that the purchase of a property culminates in an asset which can later be sold. I do not believe that Father, as a businessman, was not aware of that. I find it far more probable that Father simply did not have the money to purchase a property at the material time. Father’s bamboo business did not generate sufficient profits to allow Father to have sums of $120,000 to pay in cash for Valley Apartment and $80,000 for a Mercedes while still being able to pay $2,800 to $2,900 each month for the monthly instalments of the housing loan. That would not be commensurate with the objective circumstances detailed above relating to the family’s livelihood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I also consider that Father had substantial financial commitments at the material time. Aside from living expenses including his warehouse in Kranji, a lorry and the Mitsubishi, he also spent money on drinking, cigarettes and gambling.

However, she gave discount for certain items which is not indicated on the memo but is based on her memory. She also wrote the sale price of the item on the memo. Based on this information, she is able to calculate her net profit for the various items sold.

</div> From a review of the sales memos adduced, I am satisfied that her calculations based on the contemporaneous sales memos do provide a good and reliable estimate of the kind of monthly profits that could be generated by Serene Leather. The selling prices recorded on the daily sale memos, less the cost to Serene Leather of the items sold and the summation over the whole month of the daily profits to obtain the monthly profit do corroborate her estimates of Serene Leather’s monthly profits. This is important to ascertain whether or not Serene Leather is indeed capable of generating substantial profits to justify Serene’s claim that Valley Apartment was purchased using the proceeds from Serene Leather’s business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Lah Moi testifies that she started to see more bundles of cash coming in at Valley Apartment and the family’s financial situation started to improve.

</div> In comparison to Father’s bamboo business which he claims earns about $5,000 a month, it is clear that the earnings of Serene Leather was the true reason why Father and Mother could purchase Valley Apartment.

</div> In the light of all the evidence before me, I find for Serene that Father and Mother, pursuant to their agreement with Serene, used the proceeds of Serene Leather from the safes to pay for the housing loan instalments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I do not agree with Yak Ping that the Bank’s granting of a $150,000 loan to Father, Mother and Yak Ping necessarily supports his case. While the Bank did grant a $150,000 loan to Father, it must be noted that due to the large upfront payment of $120,000, the loan amount was only 55.6% of the purchase price of $270,000. It is possible for the Bank to have exercised its discretion given that the loan amount was not a high percentage of the total purchase price and decided that Father was nevertheless credit-worthy by considering that he had a bamboo business and had enough cash to pay $120,000 of the purchase price in cash. Further, the $150,000 loan was granted based on a mortgage over the entire Valley Apartment. Thus, the fact that the Bank granted the loan to Father, Mother and Yak Ping did not necessarily mean that he must have had a high enough income from his bamboo business to have saved $120,000 in cash to pay for Valley Apartment at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Finally, Yak Ping also argues that since Father registered the legal title of Valley Apartment in the names of Father, Mother and Yak Ping, and Mother made a will to distribute her share of Valley Apartment, this supports his case that the parents regarded Valley Apartment as theirs and not Serene’s. I reject his argument. I believe Serene’s version of events, as supported by Lah Moi and Nguang Keow, that Father and Mother acknowledged that Valley Apartment was purchased by Serene. The reason that the legal title of Valley Apartment was not put in Serene’s name was to ensure that she would not be cheated by her Boyfriend. Father constantly suspected that her Boyfriend would cheat her.

However, Father said that all his relatives knew that he was living in a private apartment and that he would have “lost his face” to downgrade to a HDB flat. He knew that Valley Apartment was paid for by Serene. However, Father insisted that he wanted to buy another private property and that property will still go to Serene in future.

</div> I find that Father did acknowledge that Serene paid for Valley Apartment at the meeting and assured her that whatever property he purchased with the proceeds from Valley Apartment, it was still hers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Yak Ping also relies on the case of <span class="font-italic">Quek Hung </span><span class="font-italic">Heong </span>to argue that the proper inference to be drawn from a testamentary disposition is that the person making the will is the outright beneficial owner of the property rather than a resulting trustee. There, the dispute concerned a two-storey bungalow held by five members of one family in equal shares. The property was paid for by the family company, of which all five of the family members were shareholders. The plaintiff argued that there was a family arrangement such that the loan for the property would be funded substantially by the family company, registered in the names of the five family members for convenience, and when the plaintiff had repaid the loan in full, each family member was to transfer his or her share in the property to the plaintiff. Thus, the plaintiff claimed for the entire beneficial interest in a property on the basis of a resulting trust and sought to compel the other four members of his family (or their estates) to transfer to him their shares of the property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim. It held (at [117]) that there was no such alleged family arrangement at that point of time and the plaintiff’s resulting trust must necessarily fail. It also stated in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> (at [119]) that the intent of the family members not to separate the beneficial interest of the property from its legal title can be evinced by the wills of the parents and one brother in which they sought to devise their own one-fifth share of the Property separately on the basis that they owned it outright. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In my view, the High Court was not setting out any presumption or rule that the proper inference to draw from a testamentary disposition is necessarily that the person making the will is the outright beneficial owner of the property rather than a resulting trustee. I accept that a testamentary disposition may in some cases indicate that the person making the will regarded the property as their own. However, this does not preclude the operation of a resulting trust. The person making the will could well be a mere trustee who is mistaken as regards the beneficial ownership of the property or in exceptional cases, even mischievous. Ultimately, whether a resulting trust is formed and whether it may be rebutted is a fact sensitive inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this case, I note that Mother made a will and distributed her share of Valley Apartment to Jee Soon, Lah Moi and Yak Ping in equal shares. However, there is evidence that Mother regarded Valley Apartment as having been purchased by Serene. Lah Moi testifies that Mother knew that the Valley Apartment was not purchased by her.

She found a potential lease opportunity at Westin Plaza Hotel and went for several interviews with the financial controller of the hotel to convince him to give her a chance despite her young age. She came to an arrangement with the wholesalers of the leather goods to allow her to take goods on consignment. She also arranged for her Boyfriend, who was a manager of a Japanese travel agency, to direct his tourists to her shop.

The name chosen, Serene Leather, is itself telling. It is undisputed that she operated Serene Leather on a daily basis and made all the major decisions pertaining to the business herself. At the hearing, she is even able to calculate the gross profit of Serene Leather and identify her own codes written on the sales memos though many years have passed.

</div> Considering the family’s financial circumstances at the time Serene Leather started, I do not believe Yak Ping’s assertions that the sum of $50,000 was loaned by Father directly and he even gave an additional sum of $20,000 to Serene as capital for Serene Leather. I note that Father was against Serene starting Serene Leather because of the large capital involved and the risk in the first place.

</div> This makes it difficult to believe that Father would contribute capital to the business. I find that Father only acted as an intermediary to help Serene loan the $50,000 from Hiap Heng. He did not make any capital contribution to Serene Leather. This explains why Serene maintained that the liability to repay the loan fell upon her instead of Father because it was her who borrowed the money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 To my mind, the addition of Jee Soon, Yak Ping and Father as partners of Serene Leather did not give them ownership of Serene Leather. Serene maintains that she never had any intention to give Serene Leather to Father, Jee Soon and Yak Ping.

</div> It is important to note also that these additions occurred only after the registration of Serene Leather. I do not believe Yak Ping’s assertion that they were all added at the same time before Serene went to register the business since this is clearly contradicted by the ACRA records (see above at [5]). I accept Serene’s explanation of why she was persuaded by Father to include Father, Jee Soon and Yak Ping’s names as partners in Serene Leather. She was just 25 years old at that time. She was unfamiliar with accounting and taxation. Since she was told by Father that this was for tax and administrative purposes, she trusted him.

</div> Further, the additions appear to be another manifestation of Father’s fears and suspicions regarding Serene’s Boyfriend. Father was worried that he may usurp her business and persuaded her to include Jee Soon’s name as a partner and co-signatory to Serene Leather’s cheques.

They did not make any capital contribution. There is no evidence that they were involved in any of the decision making in running Serene Leather. Neither is there any evidence that they were asked to bear liability for anything. Yak Ping concedes that Father, Jee Soon and himself do not know anything about selling leather goods.

There is no indication in the evidence that the proceeds of Serene Leather which were kept in the safes were split between Father, Serene, Jee Soon and Yak Ping in any proportion. To the contrary, the sale proceeds were treated as being safekept for Serene to ensure that she was not cheated by her Boyfriend. According to Lah Moi’s recollection, there was one incident when Serene became angry because of the difficulty involved when she wanted to take the money out of the safe at Valley Apartment. Father and Mother would worry that she was taking the money out for her Boyfriend. She told Mother and Father that she would no longer bring the cash proceeds of Serene Leather home but would deposit them into a bank instead. However, Mother and Father threatened to commit suicide to force her to bring the moneys back home in cash. Mother also told Serene to come back home and showed her that the moneys in the safe were being safekept for her. Mother assured her that she did not spend any of the money.

</div> After perusing the evidence, none of these reflect any support for Yak Ping’s contention that Serene Leather was Father’s family business. I am persuaded that the family never understood Serene Leather to be anything other than Serene’s own business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Therefore, I find that Serene Leather was owned solely by Serene on a balance of probabilities. Father, Jee Soon and Yak Ping were only nominee partners of Serene Leather and had no ownership over Serene Leather. As such, all the proceeds of Serene Leather belong to Serene. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the Sum is held on trust for Serene</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The presumption of resulting trust arises where an individual makes a voluntary payment for the purchase of a property that is then vested in the other person or in both of them jointly. The law in this regard is uncontroversial; the <span class="font-italic">locus classicus </span>has been regarded as <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated (at 708A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is held on trust for A (if he is the sole provider of the money) or in the case of a joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contributions…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observations have been accepted locally on numerous occasions: see <span class="font-italic">Lim Beng </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat v Mohammad Sarman bin Saidi </span>[2020] SGHC 253 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) née Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin</span> [2019] 5 SLR 593 (“<span class="font-italic">Yang Chia-Yin</span>”) at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The considerations undergirding the rule in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are important. The court in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) stated that the presumption of resulting trust is equity’s response to the lack of intention by the transferor to benefit the transferee: at [38] and [44]. As a consequence, equity regards each party as holding a beneficial interest in the property equivalent to their respective financial contributions to the same <span class="font-italic">at the time the property was acquired</span>: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [53]. This stands to reason as a matter of principle: a <span class="font-italic">bona fide purchaser for value</span> is regarded as equity’s darling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The presumption of resulting trust, and the beneficial interest that accompanies it, can be displaced in several ways, namely, (a) by evidence of the transferor’s intention to make a gift to the transferee (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(d)]); (b) due to the operation of the presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(e)]); or (c) by evidence of a common intention of the parties, either at or subsequent to the acquisition, to hold the beneficial interest in a proportion other than that which corresponds with the parties’ respective financial contributions (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(b)] and [160(f)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the light of my findings above (at [48] and [58]), I find that Valley Apartment was held by the Defendants on resulting trust for Serene because proceeds of Serene Leather, which was solely owned by Serene, were used to pay the purchase price of Valley Apartment. After Valley Apartment was sold in the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>exercise, the proceeds of the sale were held by the Defendants on resulting trust for Serene. There has never been any intention by Serene to gift her parents Valley Apartment or its sale proceeds. This is not the Defendants’ case, and neither is this argument tenable on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Subsequently, these sale proceeds were used by the Defendants to purchase the Pacific Mansion Property at a purchase price of $670,000.

</div> There is a lack of clear evidence showing that the sum of $44,000 in Yak Ping’s CPF account were from the proceeds of Serene Leather although I do not discount that possibility completely. In the circumstances, I find that Serene has not proven that the sum of $44,000 from Yak Ping’s CPF account was from Serene Leather proceeds. Consequently, Yak Ping did contribute to the purchase of the Pacific Mansion Property to the extent of $26,300.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 After subtracting $26,300 from the purchase price of the Pacific Mansion Property (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $670,000), the remaining $643,700 of the purchase price was paid from the sale proceeds of Valley Apartment which was held on trust by the Defendants for Serene. This constitutes 96.07% of the purchase price. I find that the Defendants hold 96.07% of the Sum on resulting trust for Serene. Yak Ping is entitled to 3.93% of the Sum as a result of his contribution of $26,300 towards the purchase price of the Pacific Mansion Property. I note that Yak Ping had to refund a total of $60,289.40 to the CPF Board upon the sale of the Pacific Mansion Property.

While I do not include Yak Ping’s contribution of $17,700 for the payment of the stamp duty as a contribution towards the purchase price of the Pacific Mansion Property, I think it right to order that Serene reimburse Yak Ping the sum of $24,252.78 × 0.9607 = $23,299.65, comprising her 96.07% share of the $17,700 initially paid for stamp duty and the accrued interest of $6552.78 on that amount, to Yak Ping.

</div>
</div> I reject this argument. I am of the view that Serene is not precluded from relying on s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act. It is trite that the defence of limitation must be specifically pleaded (see O 18 r 18 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed)). After the defendant has pleaded the defence of limitation, where it is necessary for the plaintiff to set up an affirmative case of his own in answer to the facts alleged by the defendant, it is good practice for the plaintiff to serve a reply and specifically plead in his reply the facts relevant to defeat the defence of limitation. It has been observed that the better approach, if possible, would be to plead those facts in the statement of claim in the first place (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2019 </span>vol 1<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019) at para 18/3/2). For instance, if the plaintiff wishes to rely on the fraud exception in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act, the facts relating to the said fraud should be clearly set out in the reply if it has not already been set out in the statement of claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 However, in the present case, the essence of Serene’s claim is that there is a resulting trust. This is also the very reason she contends that s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Limitation Act applies. The facts needed to establish this has already been clearly pleaded in her Statement of Claim. At paragraph 20 of Serene’s Reply, she denies the application of the time bar in the Limitation Act albeit without specifying s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). I am guided by the Court of Appeal’s approach to pleadings as stated in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 at [39]–[40]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 It is a trite principle that allegations of fraud must be pleaded with sufficient particularity. This principle finds statutory expression in O 18 r 12(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). It is a principle of natural justice that the court painstakingly upholds so as to ensure that the defendant knows the case it has to meet: see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> vol I (Foo Chee Hock JC, gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) at para 18/12/2. Accordingly, where a plaintiff succeeds on findings of fact that were not pleaded, the Court of Appeal will not allow the judgment to stand: see <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 524 (“Sheagar”) at [95].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40  But <span class="font-italic">one must also be careful not to descend blindly into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings</span>, and to always bear in mind that their ultimate purpose is to define the scope of the issues arising for the court’s determination and <span class="font-italic">to ensure that the parties are not taken by surprise and deprived of the opportunity to adduce the relevant evidence</span>: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span> at [94] and <span class="font-italic">Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Mok Wing Chong</span> [2018] 4 SLR 645 at [61].

First, where a person makes a voluntary payment to another for the purchase of property, which is vested in the other alone or in both of them, there is a presumption that the payment was not intended as a gift, so that the payee holds the property (or an appropriate share of it) for the payer. Secondly, where a settlor transfers property to another as trustee on express trusts which do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest, a trust of the residue results to the settlor. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50-090  In the former case, it is not altogether obvious how the trust should be classified for the purpose of limitation, not least because such a trust may arise even when property is put into the transferee’s name without his knowledge, but <span class="font-italic">since the trust is based on the payer’s presumed intention, we consider that it is to be treated along with constructive trusts of the first kind, so that section 2(1) will preclude a defence of limitation to claims within its wording</span>.

The time lapse is substantial. As a result, there is prejudice to the defence since Father is mentally incapacitated and unable to give rebuttal evidence, Mother has passed away, relevant documents are lost and there will be a windfall to Serene from her own delay.

It is properly invoked where essentially there has been a <span class="font-italic">substantial lapse of time coupled with circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy</span> either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or, where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted (<span class="font-italic">Sukhpreet</span><span class="font-italic"> Kaur Bajaj d/o Manjit Singh v Paramjit Singh Bajaj</span> [2008] SGHC 207 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Re Estate of Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kow Quee</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 417 at [32]). This is a broad-based inquiry and it would be <span class="font-italic">relevant to consider the length of delay before the claim was brought, the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant, as well as any element of unconscionability</span> in allowing the claim to be enforced (<span class="font-italic">Re Estate of Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kow Quee </span>at [38]). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The basis for equitable intervention by way of the doctrine of laches is ultimately found in unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Re Estate of Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kow Quee </span>at [33]). The inquiry should be approached in a broad manner, as opposed to trying to fit the circumstances of each case within the confines of a preconceived formula derived from earlier cases. As such, I do not find it useful to canvass the facts of the precedent cases cited by the parties. The inquiry depends mainly on the particular facts of each case, and to that end, the citation of earlier case authorities with points of similarity will, in most circumstances, be of limited assistance. Finally, it is acknowledged that the defendant bears the burden of proving that the doctrine of laches applies (<span class="font-italic">Chng</span><span class="font-italic"> Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng </span>[2016] 2 SLR 464 at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I deal first with the timing in which Serene brought her claim. In my view, it would not be logical to expect Serene to have brought her claim any earlier than March 2018 when the Pacific Mansion Apartment was sold in an <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>exercise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 While the Defendants contend that she could have sued in 1988 or 1991 because she knew that her name was not in the legal title of Valley Apartment, this argument misses the mark. Serene consented to have the legal title of Valley Apartment put in the names of Father and Mother. She did not insist that her name was to be in the property at all. Her own case is that Father and Mother were afraid that her Boyfriend would be able to get some share of Valley Apartment if they were married and subsequently divorced and therefore did not include Serene’s name in the legal title. She only told her parents that if “anyone’s name was to be added, it would be hers; and if anyone else’s name was to be added, they would have to get her permission”.

</div> However, no such permission was sought from her and she did not know that Yak Ping’s name was included in the legal title. As such, no action could have been taken by her then. There is also no reason to expect that Serene should turn around and sue her parents for not including her name when she <span class="font-italic">consented </span>to the exclusion of her name from the legal title of Valley Apartment in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In 2006, after Valley Apartment went <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>and the proceeds were divided amongst Father, Yak Ping, Jee Soon and Lah Moi, it could be said that Serene had basis to sue then since she found out that her parents had added the names of her other siblings instead of hers.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Since I found for Serene above that Father did assure her that Valley Apartment was still hers (above at [43]), I accept that it was reasonable for Serene not to have brought her claim from 2006 to 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It is critical to appreciate that Father did not dispute Serene’s claim to the property but represented to her that it belonged to her. This was said in the presence of Lai Moi and Nguang Keow and they testify that it was common knowledge that Serene had paid for Valley Apartment. To Serene’s mind, there was no cause to suspect that she would be denied her rightful claim by anyone. While the prudent thing to do might have been to document Father’s agreement, the absence of any documentation must be seen in the light of the parties’ familial relationship. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Quek Hung </span><span class="font-italic">Heong </span>(at [90]-–[91]) made the following astute observations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90  It is true that the only evidence which the plaintiff has of the family arrangement described at [20] above is his own oral evidence. He has no documentary evidence of the arrangement. Indeed, he cannot point to a single document in the evidence before me which, in itself, allows me even to draw an <span class="font-italic">inference </span>that this arrangement existed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91  Having said that, I <span class="font-italic">do not attach much weight to the lack of documentary evidence</span> in itself in assessing the veracity of his evidence. It is <span class="font-italic">not unusual for arrangements between family members</span><span class="font-italic"> not to be documented</span>. That is true – <span class="font-italic">it may even be especially true – when those arrangements</span><span class="font-italic"> concern money or property rights, always a sensitive subject-matter</span>. Arrangements of this nature are arrived at in an informal context between individuals of different generations, united by their close and unique relationship as family members and subject to the inevitable deference which younger members accord to older members. It is typical that family members will not feel the same desire or need to document their rights and interests that strangers would. Even if they were to feel the same desire or need to do so, it is also typical that they would feel inhibited in acting upon it. That would have been even more true of the more patriarchal families of 1966 than it is of today’s more egalitarian families.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These observations apply squarely to the facts of this case. It is understandable that Serene, and her siblings, trusted Father in these circumstances and there was never any consideration for the need to document such arrangements. Since Serene was content to let Father stay in her property (be it Valley Apartment or the Pacific Mansion Property) after Father’s assurance that it remains hers, there is no reason to expect Serene to have brought her claim between 2006 and 2018. No potential future breach of trust by Father, who appeared to be an authoritative figure in the family, could have been anticipated by Serene then.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In 2018, when Pacific Mansion Property was to be sold in the <span class="font-italic">en</span><span class="font-italic"> bloc </span>exercise, Serene, with the rest of her siblings, were asked by Yak Ping to attend at a law firm to consent to Yak Ping being named as Father’s sole deputy. Father had dementia since 2017 and was certified to have lost mental capacity on 7 February 2019.

</div>
</div> In consideration that Yak Ping wanted to appropriate all of the proceeds from the sale of the Pacific Mansion Property for himself, she brought the claim. Considering the circumstances, I find that her decision to bring the claim in 2019 does not constitute undue delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I turn now to the alleged prejudice contended for by the Defendants. Since Mother passed away in 1996, she would not have been available to testify even if Serene had brought the claim in 2006. While I accept that the fact that Father has lost mental capacity and the lack of relevant documentation since the material events occurred over a span of 30 years renders it harder for the Defendants to defend the claim, it similarly presents difficulties to Serene in satisfying her burden of proof. Ultimately, since I do not find that Serene had delayed making her claim, such prejudice can only be said to be unfortunate. It is not caused by any undue delay or fault on the part of Serene. In my judgment, I do not think it is unconscionable to allow Serene relief. To the contrary, given the credible evidence presented by Lah Moi and Nguang Keow who are factual witnesses with no interest in claiming any part of this Sum and who are able to testify to the events that occurred at the material time, it would be unconscionable to deny Serene relief on the ground of laches.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the foregoing reasons, I find that Serene’s claim is not barred by the Limitation Act and/or the doctrine of laches. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the circumstances, I grant Serene judgment for 96.07% of the Sum with the usual interest from the date of the judgment to the date of payment. I also declare that Yak Ping is entitled to 3.93% of the Sum as a result of his CPF contribution of $23,600 towards the purchase price of the Pacific Mansion Property. Serene should also return the sum of $23,299.65, comprising her 96.07% share of the $17,700 initially paid for the stamp duty and the accrued interest of $6,552.78 on that amount, to Yak Ping.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I will hear the parties on costs if these cannot be agreed.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Justin James Zehnder and Kertar Singh s/o Guljar Singh (Kertar &amp; Sandhu LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeoh Oon Weng Vincent (Malkin &amp; Maxwell LLP) for the defendants.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
