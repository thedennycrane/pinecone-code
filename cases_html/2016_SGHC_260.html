</div> It should be noted that the 2nd Plaintiff is neither an executor nor a beneficiary of the Late Mother’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Late Brother passed away intestate on 19 July 2007. His estate also consists solely of his 1/7th share of the Late Father’s estate. By FC/P 678 of 2015, a letter of administration was granted to the Late Brother’s widow, Chen Yu, in February 2016, which appointed her as the sole administrator of the Late Brother’s estate. Over the course of the present proceedings, the parties have come to accept that the claims in relation to the Late Brother’s estate are not part of the present suit. This was because neither of the Plaintiffs is an administrator of the Late Brother’s estate, and therefore would not have had the standing to bring any claim in relation to his estate. A claim relating to the Late Brother’s estate was eventually brought by Chen Yu (as I will elaborate at [59] below). For the purposes of this judgment, I focus only on the disputes in relation to the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The relationship between the five surviving Foo siblings quickly deteriorated largely because of disagreements on how to deal with the Property after the Late Mother’s death. In brief, the 1st Plaintiff, the 2nd Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant wanted the Property to be sold, but the 1st Defendant did not. These disagreements led to a slew of legal tussles between them. It is necessary to briefly set out some of the legal proceedings and relevant events at this juncture, as these will provide an essential backdrop to the disputes in the present suit. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Originating Summons No 909 of 2010</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 2 September 2010, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant filed Originating Summons No 909 of 2010 (“OS 909”) in the High Court, naming the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin as defendants. OS 909, amongst other things, was an application to compel a sale of the Property and thereafter the distribution of the proceeds of the sale according to the Late Father’s will.  It also sought to compel the 1st Defendant to furnish an account of the proceeds of the rent that he had allegedly received from the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The 2nd Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant were initially represented by Mr David de Souza (“Mr de Souza”) from M/s De Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP. Mr de Souza issued the originating summons on behalf of all the plaintiffs in OS 909, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant. It subsequently came to light that the 1st Plaintiff was separately represented by Mr V Ramakrishnan (“Mr Rama”) from V Ramakrishnan &amp; Co. The 1st Plaintiff had apparently sought leave to intervene in OS 909 to apprise the court of issues relating to the Late Mother’s estate. The 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, the defendants in OS 909, were represented by M/s Tan See Swan &amp; Co (“TSS”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At the first hearing of OS 909 on 21 March 2011, Prakash J felt that it was not appropriate for the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant to be represented by two different sets of solicitors. It was thereafter agreed that Mr de Souza was to submit on behalf of all of them. Mr Rama then left the chambers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 OS 909 was ultimately dismissed by Prakash J on 18 May 2011 with costs to be paid by the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant to the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin, as taxed or agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA 70 of 2011</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 9 June 2011, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant appealed the decision of Prakash J, which led to CA 70 of 2011 (“CA 70”). By this point, the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant had changed their solicitors to Ms Molly Lim SC, Ms Hwa Hoong Luan  (“Ms Hwa”) and Mr Ang Hou Fu from M/s Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC (“WTL”), while the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin continued to be represented by TSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Further, the 1st Plaintiff engaged M/s Wong Thomas &amp; Leong to file Summons No 5533 of 2011 (“SUM 5533”), again seeking leave<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the 1st Plaintiff, in his capacity as co-executor of the Late Mother’s estate, to participate in CA 70 to apprise the court of the position taken by each of the beneficiaries in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 CA 70 and SUM 5533 were heard together on 29 February 2012. SUM 5533 was dismissed with no order as to costs. The judgment for CA 70 was reserved. On 7 August 2012, the Court of Appeal delivered judgment for CA 70 and made the following orders (collectively “the CA Orders”):

By an email dated 4 January 2013, the 1st Defendant stated that the reserve price for the Property was to be $6.5 million, and that he would work it out with the 3rd Defendant and Foo Chin Chin before instructing DTZ on the proposed sale of the Property. On 10 January 2013, he wrote to DTZ stating that the reserve price was $6.5 million, and that he had not agreed for DTZ to do the valuation.

This action was ultimately settled. A Deed of Settlement was entered into on 12 November 2012 between the 1st Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the 3rd Defendant. The Deed of Settlement states:

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Deed of Settlement and consent judgment provide the backdrop to the disputes in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in connection with the present suit. This will be explained further later in the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The present suit  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The protracted disagreements between the siblings were not resolved. On 26 August 2013, the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs, through their then solicitors, M/s Malkin &amp; Maxwell LLP, commenced the present suit against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, bringing the claims which I shall set out at [60]–[65] below. On 4 August 2014, the Plaintiffs changed their solicitors to M/s Belinda Ang Tang &amp; Partners (“BATP”).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As originally pleaded, the present suit was brought against the Defendants only in respect of the Late Father’s estate. There was no claim made in respect of the Late Mother’s or the Late Brother’s estates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Numerous interlocutory applications were filed in the present suit, the most essential of which are summarised below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Amendments of Statement of Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On 23 October 2013, before the pleadings were deemed closed, the Plaintiffs amended their Statement of Claim pursuant to O 20 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). This led to the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC-1”). The amendments were minor, seeking, for example, an additional relief for interest to be paid on the sums found due. There were still no claims brought against the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On 18 September 2014, the Plaintiffs filed Summons No 4655 of 2014 (“SUM 4655”) for leave to amend SOC-1, as indicated in an attached draft. These proposed amendments were fairly significant. In brief, the amendments expanded or added details in respect of the Plaintiffs’ claim against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. The amendments also sought to add new claims against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in respect of the Late Mother’s estate and the Late Brother’s estate. At the hearing before AR Lee, the Defendants did not object to a number of proposed amendments. As for the contested amendments, AR Lee allowed some, but disallowed a significant number as well. Both the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant were dissatisfied with AR Lee’s decision. The Plaintiffs filed Registrar’s Appeal No 396 of 2014 seeking to reverse the AR’s decision disallowing certain paragraphs of the draft. The 2nd Defendant filed Registrar’s Appeal No 397 of 2014 seeking to exclude certain paragraphs in the draft that had been allowed. The appeals then came before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 After hearing the parties on 9 February 2015, I allowed the 2nd Defendant’s appeal in full, and only partially allowed the Plaintiffs’ appeal. These are summarised at [22] of my decision in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo and another </span><span class="font-italic">v Foo Jhee Tuang and another (Foo Jee Seng, intervener)</span> [2015] SGHC 176 (“the Amendment Judgment”). In essence, I allowed various paragraphs relating to the 2nd Defendant’s handling of the Late Father’s estate. I also allowed facts relating to the parties’ claims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 However, there was considerable confusion over the status in which the parties were suing or being sued in the present suit. In the course of SUM 4655, the parties eventually confirmed that they were suing and being sued in their <span class="font-italic">personal capacities</span>: see the Amendment Judgment at [26] and [33]–[36]. That being the case, I disallowed the amendments pleading breach of duty against the 2nd Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. In the case of the claims against the 1st Defendant in respect of the Late Mother’s estate, there were <span class="font-italic">no objection</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> raised by the 1st Defendant to the amendments, and these were allowed on that basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Plaintiffs were dissatisfied with my decision in the Amendment Judgment. On 16 February 2015, they wrote in to court to request for further arguments on the Registrar’s Appeals. On 17 February 2015, they filed Summonses No 786 and 787 of 2015, seeking leave to appeal my decision in the Registrar’s Appeals. On 9 July 2015, I dismissed the applications for leave to appeal and did not change my order in the Registrar’s Appeals after hearing their further arguments. I will elaborate on some parts of the Amendment Judgment in due course, when I analyse and set out my decision on the Plaintiffs’ case against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On 21 July 2015, the Plaintiffs duly amended SOC-1 as directed, which led to the present Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“SOC-2”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summonses for leave to intervene</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On 25 November 2014, the 3rd Defendant filed Summons No 5860 of 2014, an application to make himself a party to the present suit and to be allowed to participate in it, on the basis that he was a beneficiary of both the Late Father’s and Late Mother’s estates. On 4 February 2015, AR Zhuang Wenxiong granted the application. The 3rd Defendant was subsequently added as a defendant to the present suit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I should add that on 23 September 2015, Foo Chin Chin also applied for leave to intervene in the present suit. However, she subsequently withdrew her application at a hearing before me on 7 March 2016, indicating that she no longer wished to contest the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Payment into court and payments out of the minimum undisputed sum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On 24 March 2014, I ordered the 2nd Defendant to pay the sum of $3,897,359.97, being the balance of the sale proceeds of the Property still held in its conveyancing account, into court pending the determination of the present suit. This was duly done on 29 December 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On 1 September 2015, the Plaintiffs brought Summons No 4346 of 2015 (“SUM 4346”) seeking to have the minimum undisputed portions of their shares in the Late Father’s estate, quantified at $758,495.68 each (“the Minimum Sum”), to be paid out of the sum paid into court on 29 December 2014. The detailed computation of this figure is set out at [63] below. I granted this application on 7 March 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 On 15 March 2016, the 3rd Defendant filed Summons No 1291 of 2016 (“SUM 1291”) also seeking a payment out of his Minimum Sum. On 22 March 2016, Foo Chin Chin, not being a party to the present suit, filed OS 291 of 2016 (“OS 291”) for payment out of her Minimum Sum pursuant to O 90 r 8 of the Rules of Court. I granted orders-in-terms of both applications on 20 April 2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary of positions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In summary, as a result of the abovementioned events and legal proceedings, the positions of the beneficiaries of the Late Father’s estate just before the trial of the present suit were as follows: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Name</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Capacity</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Share</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Status</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Yap Wee Kien (deceased)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Late Mother</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Executor and trustee</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">See [53] below</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Foo Jee Fong (deceased)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Late Brother</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">$782,542.86</span> paid by the 2nd Defendant to the 1st Defendant to hold for the Late Brother (see [30] above). </div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Foo Li Li</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2nd Plaintiff </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Minimum Sum of <span class="font-weight-bold">$758,495.68</span> paid out pursuant to Order of Court dated 7 March 2016 in SUM 4346 (see [50] above).</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Foo Jee Seng</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3rd Defendant </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Minimum Sum of <span class="font-weight-bold">$758,495.68</span> paid out pursuant to Order of Court dated 20 April 2016 in SUM 1291 (see [51] above).</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Foo Jhee Tuang</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1st Defendant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Sole surviving executor and trustee</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">$835,181.57</span> paid by the 2nd Defendant to the 1st Defendant (see [30] above).</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Foo Chin Chin</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Sister, who is not a party to the present suit</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Minimum Sum of <span class="font-weight-bold">$758,495.68</span> paid out pursuant to Order of Court dated 20 April 2016 in OS 291 (see [51] above).</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Foo Jee Boo</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1st Plaintiff </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1/7</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Minimum Sum of <span class="font-weight-bold">$758,495.68</span> paid out pursuant to Order of Court dated 7 March 2016 in SUM 4346 (see [50] above)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The positions of the beneficiaries of the Late Mother’s estate just before the trial of the present suit were as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Name</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Capacity</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Share</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Status</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Foo Jee Seng</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3rd Defendant </div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">1/4</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Not paid.

S 284 is most likely a consequence of the Amendment Judgment, in which I had held that the Plaintiffs had no standing to bring claims against the 2nd Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estates when suing in their <span class="font-italic">personal</span> <span class="font-italic">capacities</span> (see [71] of the Amendment Judgment). S 284 was brought primarily against the 2nd Defendant. The 1st Defendant was joined as defendant because he refused to join the 1st Plaintiff in suing the 2nd Defendant. The claims and reliefs of S 284 arise out of substantially the same facts as those raised in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. In S 284, the 1st Plaintiff wants the 2nd Defendant to account for all monies received by the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, including overpayment quantified at $89,678.86, and for the 2nd Defendant to indemnify and pay the 1st Plaintiff for any shortfall the latter suffers if he fails to receive his entitlement of the Late Mother’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In June 2016, the Plaintiffs, through BATP, orally applied to consolidate S 284 and the present suit, but this was dismissed by AR Lee.

It sought a contribution or indemnity from the 1st Defendant against any sums that the 2nd Defendant is held liable to pay the Plaintiffs, on the ground that the 1st Defendant ought to have known that the 2nd Defendant’s appointment was to act for the 1st Defendant. Therefore, if the Plaintiffs suffered any loss as a result of the distribution, this was caused by the 1st Defendant, since the 2nd Defendant only acted on the instructions, confirmation and authorisation of the 1st Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Late Father’s estate: claims against the 1st Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on the powers and duties of an executor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Before turning to the specific claims brought by the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant, it will be helpful to set out briefly the powers and duties of an executor, such as the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 KS Rajah JC (as he then was) provided a succinct summary of the duties of executors in <span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San and another </span><span class="font-italic">v Tsong Sai Sai Cecilia and another </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 516 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke </span><span class="font-italic">San</span>”) at [35]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An executor “<span class="font-italic">calls in” the estate</span> that collects and converts the assets into cash, and <span class="font-italic">pays all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies</span>. When he has done this, he has discharged his duties as an executor. Then he steps into the shoes of a trustee. He owes a <span class="font-italic">fiduciary duty</span> to the beneficiaries, whether he is an executor or trustee.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I shall now elaborate on the duties owed by an executor as summarised in the preceding paragraph. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Calling in assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First and foremost, an executor is obliged to “call in” the deceased's real and personal estate. In other words, he has to determine the extent of the assets and liabilities of the deceased, and then act diligently and reasonably in realising the assets. In this respect, if the deceased died testate, his will would be a guide, although not necessarily a comprehensive one, as to the assets that he owned: G Raman, <span class="font-italic">Probate and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2012) at pp 157 and 159 (“<span class="font-italic">Probate and Administration</span>”). Where the estate is small, like the present case in which the estate consists of a single asset, the carrying out of this duty does not normally pose an issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paying funeral and testamentary expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Section 57(3) of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 1985 Rev Ed) allows for the estate to be applicable towards the discharge of the funeral, testamentary and administration expenses of the deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Testamentary and administration expenses are “expenses incident to the proper performance of the duty of the executor”: <span class="font-italic">Sharp v Lush </span>[1879] 10 Ch D 468 (“<span class="font-italic">Sharp v Lush</span>”) at 470. They include, but are not limited to:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The costs of obtaining probate or letters of administration; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Legal costs occasioned in commencing a suit to obtain assistance of the court to decide on questions relating to the ascertainment of debts and liabilities due from the deceased’s estate, the payment of such debts and liabilities, and the legal and proper distribution of estate among persons entitled. The suit can be instituted either by the executor himself or by the beneficiaries in a proper case. The costs that are allowed includes the costs by the person who instituted the suit, as well as the costs of other parties to the suit: <span class="font-italic">Sharp v Lush</span> at 470-471; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The costs of taking the advice of a solicitor and counsel outside the administration suit as to the distribution of the estate: <span class="font-italic">Sharp v Lush</span> at 471. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Paying debts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In addition, it is the duty of the executor to pay off the debts of the deceased. This duty is owed to the creditors as well as the beneficiaries. <span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Tankard, Tankard v Midland Bank Executor and Trustee Company, Limited</span> [1942] 1 Ch 69 at 72 summarised this duty in the following terms: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…it is the duty of executors, as a matter of the due administration of the estate, <span class="font-italic">to pay the debts of their testator with due diligence </span>having regard to the assets in their hands which are properly applicable for that purpose, and in determining whether due diligence has been shown regard must be had to all the circumstances of the case…The duty is owed not only to creditors, <span class="font-italic">but also to beneficiaries</span>, for the ultimate object of the administration of an estate is to place the beneficiaries in possession of their interest and that object cannot be fully achieved unless all debts are satisfied.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Prior to the conveyance or distribution of the deceased’s assets, it would be prudent for the executor to protect himself by giving notice in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span> of his intention to make a conveyance or distribution of the assets, and requiring any person interested to send to the executor particulars of his claim in respect of the assets within a stipulated period that is not less than two months: see s 29 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed). If the necessary advertisements are placed, the executor will be at liberty after the expiration of the time specified in the advertisements to distribute the assets, having regard only to the claims of which he has notice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Rendering accounts of the estate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is also the duty of the executor to keep proper accounts of the administration of the estate that they are dealing with. If called upon by the beneficiaries to render accounts, they are obliged to furnish such accounts and allow the beneficiaries to inspect the accounts. The accounts would be required to show the monies and assets received by the executor and how he had dealt with these monies and assets: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Probate, Administration and Succession </span>at para 190.102, citing <span class="font-italic">Thompson v </span><span class="font-italic">Dunn </span>(1870) LR 5 Ch App 573 at 576; see also <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng and others </span><span class="font-italic">v Foo Jhee Tuang and another </span>[2012] 4 SLR 339<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) (the Judgment in CA 70) at [86]–[87]. It is also a requirement before the executor winds up the administration that he submits accounts for the beneficiaries’ perusal and approval prior to distribution: <span class="font-italic">Probate and Administration </span>at p 167.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The request for an account and any suit commenced for an account are not based on any allegations of impropriety on the part of the executor, but simply arise from the<span class="font-italic"> fiduciary relationship</span> between a fiduciary (the executor) and the object of the fiduciary duty (the beneficiaries): <span class="font-italic">A-G v Cocke </span>[1988] Ch 414 (“<span class="font-italic">A-G v </span><span class="font-italic">Cocke</span>”) at 420. Naturally, if there is an allegation of a breach of fiduciary duty, the beneficiaries would all the more be entitled to an account: <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee </span><span class="font-italic">Seng (CA) </span>at [87]. The only exception occurs where it would be oppressive to require the executor to so account, or for some other good reason, the court in its discretion thinks it wrong to make an order: <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-G v Cocke </span>at 420.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">General duty to act in best interest of the beneficiaries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Because an executor is in a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San </span>at [35] and <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">-G v Cocke </span>at 420), it is the executor’s foremost duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries when carrying out his duties or exercising his powers, in the sense that he must do his best to promote the beneficiary’s affairs: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore: Equity and Trusts </span>at para 110.213. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Where an executor is to act for the benefit of a class of persons, such as multiple beneficiaries of a will, he must advance their common interests, holding the scales evenly among the beneficiaries, and act with detachment and impartiality: <span class="font-italic">Probate and Administration</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 165. I should add that this is especially important when the executor is <span class="font-italic">himself</span> a beneficiary, such as the 1st Defendant is in the present case. In such a case, it is all the more crucial that he cannot prefer his own interest over that of other beneficiaries. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Having set out the duties owed by an executor, I now turn to the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. The main issue is whether the 1st Defendant’s acts and omissions breached the CA Orders and his duties as the executor of the Late Father’s estate. The relevant acts and omissions broadly fall into three categories: (i) his failure to provide further accounts of rent received from the Property; (ii) his setting aside of only $200,000 and not $350,000 for legal costs of CA 70 and OS 909; and (iii) his reimbursements of various expense claims by himself and the 3rd Defendant, while not taking into account the claims by the Plaintiffs. I shall deal with each of them in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Account of rent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 To recapitulate, one of the CA Orders is that “the [1st Defendant] shall, within three months of the date of the judgment hereof, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 7th August 2012, furnish an account of the trust to all the beneficiaries” (see [18] above). I pause to observe that even in the absence of the CA Orders, it is incumbent upon the 1st Defendant, as executor of the Late Father’s estate, to render an account of the estate when required to do so, by virtue of his fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries (see [80] – [81] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The parties’ submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Plaintiffs submit that the 1st Defendant failed and/or refused to provide an account of the trust, and in particular, the rent proceeds he received from the Property to date, despite the express CA Orders which were not varied.

It is also unclear when the 2nd Plaintiff, 1st Defendant and 3rd Defendant ceased to reside at the Property. Indeed, even in the case of the 1st Plaintiff, the evidence as to his residence in the Property was confused.  On the whole, it seems that he was working in Malaysia from 2006 to 2007.

The evidence as to when the Property or individual rooms in the Property were rented out, and to whom, was also thin and confused. That said there is some evidence that the 1st Defendant visited the property from time to time and was handed sums of cash for utility bills in 2012.

I agree with the Plaintiffs that the Court of Appeal had clearly been aware of the account set out in the 1st Defendant’s AEIC in OS 909, but had nonetheless ordered an account of the trust. This must mean that the Court of Appeal still considered it necessary to impose a positive duty on the 1st Defendant to account for rental income. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The 1st Defendant argues that because leave was granted in SUM 634 to withdraw the enforcement application, with no further order as to his duty to account, this must have meant that he was no longer under a continuing obligation to account for the rent. I am unable to agree. Instead, the withdrawal of SUM 634 merely signified that the the Plaintiffs and the 3rd Defendant no longer wished to <span class="font-italic">enforce</span> the CA Orders at that time, but did not go towards <span class="font-italic">negating</span> his continuing duty to provide an account in accordance with the CA Orders. The Court of Appeal, in granting leave to withdraw SUM 634, was not making any judgment on the merits of the CA Orders, nor was it varying them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 One of the 1st Defendant’s arguments is that he was not in receipt of any rental income, other than those disclosed in his AEIC in OS 909. This is clearly not the case in light of the Covert Investigation Report (see [86] above), which related to investigations carried out between 23 August and 14 September 2011 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">before</span> the CA Orders were made). The Covert Investigation Reports showed that there were still occupants in the Property. These rental receipts were not recorded in the 1st Defendant’s AEIC in OS 909, which only covered the period from September 2009 to September 2010. The Covert Investigation Report was not seriously challenged by the 1st Defendant at trial. I am more inclined to give greater weight to the Covert Investigation Report than the 1st Defendant’s contrary stance at trial, where he made the bare assertion (with vague details) that the Property was empty and not rented out until sometime <span class="font-italic">after</span> CA 70.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The URA letter is also not of much assistance to the 1st Defendant. While the URA letter prohibited the use of the Property as a <span class="font-italic">workers’ dormitory</span>, it did not prevent any rental of the Property at all. It therefore does not preclude the rental of the Property to any persons other than foreign workers. It cannot be used to prove that the 1st Defendant never rented out the Property after the receipt of the URA letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 A related argument, raised at trial, is that the 1st Defendant did not receive any rental income because any money paid was used to defray utility and gardening bills of the Property. In my view, this is simply irrelevant. The CA Orders only provide that the 1st Defendant has to provide an account of the trust. They do not state that the 1st Defendant must only so account if he has made an <span class="font-italic">overall profit</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>if the rent he received exceeded the expenses incurred in the upkeep of the Property. All that the 1st Defendant is obliged to do is to provide an account of the rent he received and expenses incurred during the relevant periods, even if, like in July, August and September 2010, he incurred a net loss. This, in my opinion, should not be an unduly onerous task.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 However, I should add that based on the material before the court, it is unlikely that the account will disclose “very substantial” income received by the 1st Defendant, if at all. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in CA 70 had observed (at [8]) that the net rental income from the Property was not high, ranging from $1,130 in September 2009 to $200 in September 2010.

</div> It appears from the letter that the 1st Plaintiff was dissatisfied with the 1st Defendant’s administration of the Late Father’s estate, and had instructed the tenants to pay rent to the Late Father’s estate, presumably instead of to the 1st Defendant. The 1st Plaintiff did not, at any point in the letter, state that he was the one who had rented out the Property to the tenants. In fact, under cross-examination, the 1st Plaintiff clarified that these tenants were staying in the Property “rent-free” in exchange for their taking care of the Property while the 1st Plaintiff was overseas.

</div> Given that this was the case, the 1st Plaintiff’s attempt to explain that $350,000 was to be set aside for costs already incurred as well as anticipated costs comes very late in the day, and does not square with evidence of actual legal costs incurred. In my view, this was nothing more than an afterthought and a poor attempt to justify the $350,000 he insisted was agreed upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As it turned out, the sum of $200,000 set aside for the legal costs of CA 70 and OS 909 was more than sufficient. Upon bills of costs coming for taxation in BC 127 and 160 before AR Lee on 15 August 2014 and a subsequent review by Prakash J on 31 October 2014, the costs were determined to only be about $150,000.

On the same note, while I understand that the 3rd Defendant disputes the appropriateness of including the legal fees paid to Mr Rama, I do not find it necessary to delve into the precise figures. These disputes had already been raised by the 3rd Defendant at the taxation hearing and review, and must have been taken into account by AR Lee and Prakash J.

</div>
</div> I was not, however, pointed to any case authority on point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In my judgment, this issue can be analysed under the existing framework of the executor’s duties as set out earlier. Under this framework, the 1st Defendant was indeed under a duty to forward the accounts to the Plaintiffs (as well as other beneficiaries), detailing the claims made and the amounts to be paid out, before instructing the 2nd Defendant to distribute the sales proceeds. This is part of his duty to provide accounts of the assets when the beneficiaries so require (see [80] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The imposition of this duty simultaneously helps to fulfil another of the 1st Defendant’s duties as executor, which is to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries. By forwarding the accounts to the Plaintiffs and other beneficiaries, he ensures that they are kept fully informed of all material facts that may affect their rights and entitlements under the will, and have the opportunity to inspect the accounts and voice any concerns about them. This is especially so because the 1st Defendant must have been aware from the email correspondence that the Plaintiffs had objections to some of the claims, such as the expenses involved in the removal of the family altar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The forwarding of the accounts to the beneficiaries is made all the more important in this case, because the 3rd Defendant was in fact given a copy of the Statements of Accounts of both the Late Father and Late Mother’s estates on 21 May 2013 (see [29] above). The 1st Defendant therefore should also have forwarded the Statements of Accounts to the other beneficiaries, to discharge his duty of acting fairly and impartially among the members of a class of beneficiaries and to hold the scales evenly between them (see [82] and [83] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In the ideal scenario, the beneficiaries will agree to and approve the accounts before distribution (see [80] above). However, I am cognisant that in this particular case, the precise reason that the 1st Defendant did not want the accounts to be forwarded to the beneficiaries was because he did not want to incur further legal costs in the event of additional disputes between the beneficiaries. While the danger of gridlock among the beneficiaries is a legitimate concern, the 1st Defendant must still act impartially and not prefer his own claims or the claims of some beneficiaries over that of the others. Instead, the 1st Defendant should have forwarded the accounts to the beneficiaries and parties should have tried to come to an agreement on the claims. If this was not possible, the 1st Defendant should have sought the assistance of the court. The 1st Defendant should not have attempted to circumvent the problem <span class="font-italic">by simply keeping the beneficiaries in the dark</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> I, therefore, find that the 1st Defendant had breached his duty in failing to forward the accounts to the beneficiaries of the Late Father’s estate. Nonetheless, given that the present suit has been brought by the Plaintiffs, the court is now essentially called on to adjudicate on the disputed claims. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Claims taken into account </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I now move on to the claims that the 1st Defendant had taken into account prior to distribution. The Plaintiffs’ position is that the 1st Defendant breached his fiduciary duties by accepting these claims, which were unreasonably claimed and unreasonable in amount.

At trial, Ms Chee also indicated that she had considered the claim, reviewed photographs produced by the 1st Defendant and noted that the timber rafters of the roof had been replaced.

This is especially so when seen in light of the following circumstances. The BCA letter on 10 November 2010 clearly referred to an “extensively damaged termite infested roof” at the Property. This must have meant that there was a genuine need to carry out extensive repair works on the roof. About one and a half years later, on 1 February 2012, a civil engineer inspected the Property and prepared a report dated 2 February 2012. He concluded that the building was in “good structural condition[]”. In particular, he observed that the “roofing is in good working condition[] except for some minor rafter defects” which was due to some of the timber rafters being “[worn] out” (rather than because of any termite infestation). A photo of the roof attached to the report was accompanied by the caption “[t]imber roof [is] safe and sound”.

</div> Further, the 1st Defendant argues that the claims were brought in bad faith. There were no supporting documents for the claim for property tax. The utilities and telecommunication bills were attributable to the occupants of the Property at that time, and not to the Late Father’s estate. The cheques issued to “Air IQ Engineering and Marketing” for the alleged renovation works did not explain what these services were for and how they related to the Late Father’s estate. In any event, the cheques allegedly in support of the Plaintiffs’ claim only add up to about $7,000. As for the other incidental expenses, such as for nails, paintwork and materials, the 1st Plaintiff had enjoyed rent-free occupation of the Property to the exclusion of the other beneficiaries for many years. Any expenses incurred in the upkeep of the Property would have been the result of his own use and should be borne by the 1st Plaintiff and not by the Late Father’s estate.

It will be recalled that one of the duties of the 1st Defendant, as executor for a class of beneficiaries, is to act with impartiality and to hold the scales evenly among the beneficiaries: see [83] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 After carefully reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the contemporaneous documents, I am of the view that he did not breach his duties in this respect. This is for three main reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 First, from as early as February 2013, the Plaintiffs were intimately involved in heated discussions about certain claims that were to be made against the various estates. For example, the Plaintiffs sent various emails to the other beneficiaries between 2 February 2013 and 14 March 2013, expressing their views on the costs of moving the family altar and the expenses for removing rubbish from the Property.

</div> In my judgment, these are all evidence that the Plaintiffs were acutely aware that claims were being made against the various estates by the other beneficiaries, and they also seemed to be in the midst of preparing their own claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Second, I agree with the 1st Defendant that the Plaintiffs had, in any event, ample time to submit their claims. From the time that they were aware that claims were being made (February 2013) to the time that the 1st Defendant collected his share of the sale proceeds (29 May 2013), there was an intervening period of more than three months in which claims could have been made. Indeed, the miscellaneous expenses were incurred in or before 2008, and the Plaintiffs would have been aware of them in 2013, could have brought them up, but did not do so. Indeed, the Plaintiffs and Ms Hwa accepted that there was nothing to stop them putting in claims and that they knew claims were in fact being made.

This is especially so given the following series of correspondence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 19 March 2013, Ms Hwa sent an email to Ms Chee (“the 19 March 2013 WTL email”), stating “[w]e will collate the payments to be deducted from the sale proceeds before distribution and forward these to you in due course, together with the contracts”. This was in response to Ms Chee’s earlier email asking about the terms of engagement and agreed fees payable to DTZ. The “payments” presumably referred to the fees due to DTZ. Ms Hwa also stated, “our clients want certain set-offs from each other’s share and once they have confirmed this, we will revert”.

</div> The Plaintiffs’ claims were not included because of their own fault, and not as a consequence of any unfair preference or breach of fiduciary duty on the 1st Defendant’s part. This is especially so when I have already found earlier that the claims that the 1st Defendant did take into account were reasonable both in nature and quantum: see [141] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Plaintiffs’ claims should not in any case be allowed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Even if I had found that the 1st Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties, and should have taken the Plaintiffs’ claims into account, I would still have been of the view that the Plaintiffs’ claims should not be allowed. Even at trial, the expenses claimed against the Late Father’s Estate were vague and poorly supported. The three cheques made to “Air IQ Engineering &amp; Marketing” relied on by the Plaintiffs only totalled $7,000 and did not specify what the payments were for. Indeed, it was not even clear whether the cheques were cleared by the bank, as there was no invoice from the recipient. As for the renovation expenses for which receipts were produced, these were incurred in early 2008 when the 1st Plaintiff was still residing in the Property (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before he left Singapore to work overseas), and also before the Property was contracted for sale. Given that this is the case, the renovation expenses would be for his own benefit as an occupier of the Property, rather than for the benefit of the Late Father’s estate. The expenses for property tax, utilities bills, telecommunications bills, termite, bee, and snake removals were not at all supported by receipts. As I see it, the claim for miscellaneous expenses is merely an afterthought by the Plaintiffs and not legitimate expenses that were attributable to the Late Father’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As for the enforcement costs, this was neither pleaded nor included in the Plaintiffs’ AEICs. I agree that the 1st Defendant was aware that the enforcement costs were fixed by the Court of Appeal at $2,000, as he was present at the hearing of SUM 634 itself, and had thereafter informed the 2nd Defendant precisely of this fact.

</div> However, the $200,000 set aside for legal costs is more than sufficient to meet the costs of SUM 634, since the taxed costs was only about $150,000. In fact, Ms Chee’s correspondence to the 1st Defendant on 20 May 2013 and 29 May 2013 expressly stated that the $200,000 set aside was for legal costs in connection with “the suits between [the 1st Defendant] and [his] siblings” (see [28] and [31] above), which would include the enforcement costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 I pause to summarise my findings on the claims by the Plaintiffs against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Father’s estate. I find that the 1st Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties in failing to provide an account of rent received from the Property, and in failing to forward the Statements of Accounts to the Plaintiffs before distribution. However, the 1st Defendant did not breach his fiduciary duties in accepting the claims that he did take into account, as they were reasonable both in nature and quantum. He also did not breach his fiduciary duties in not taking into account the Plaintiffs’ claims, as that was a result of the Plaintiffs’ own fault in not submitting the claims on time. For these reasons, the 1st Defendant did not unfairly prefer the claims of the other beneficiaries over those of the Plaintiffs. In any event, even if the Plaintiffs had submitted the claims in time, I note that the claims would in all likelihood have been rejected for reasons as set out in [156] and [157]. For these reasons, the 1st Defendant’s failure to forward the Statements of Accounts to the Plaintiffs did not cause them to suffer any loss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Late Father’s estate: claims against the 2nd Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Having dealt with the Plaintiffs’ claims in relation to the Late Father’s estate against the 1st Defendant, I now turn to consider their claims against the 2nd Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiffs’ submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 According to the Plaintiffs, because the 2nd Defendant was jointly appointed, it was under an express retainer to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant.

Thus, by the time the 2nd Defendant released the 1st Defendant’s share of the Late Father’s estate to him on 29 May 2013, there would not have been any subsisting fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant.

This is eminently reasonable because the 1st Defendant was neither removed as an executor of the Late Father’s estate, nor were any of his powers as executor removed (except that the Court of Appeal set a six-month time limit on the sale of the Property). The CA Order for the jointly appointed solicitor to “effect” the sale is, in my view, simply be a direction for this solicitor to provide legal services to facilitate the conveyancing of the Property. It does not impose an independent duty on the 2nd Defendant to sell the Property <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, much less distribute the sale proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 I do not agree with the Plaintiffs’ submission that the 2nd Defendant must have been appointed for the distribution of sale proceeds as well, because the purpose of the CA Order for joint appointment was for that solicitor to police the sale proceeds to prevent them from falling into the hands of the 1st Defendant. I similarly disagree with Ms Hwa’s statement at trial that “obviously [the] Court of Appeal didn’t trust [the 1st Defendant], [therefore necessitating] a joint appointment” and her characterisation of the joint appointment as “a check of balance… [to] help [Ms Hwa] check on [the 1st Defendant]”. Indeed, given that the Court of Appeal has never made any finding on the unsuitability of the 1st Defendant to act as the executor of the Late Father’s estate, there is no reason this would have been the purpose of the CA Order. Instead, as WTL itself stated in a letter dated 12 November 2012 to the Plaintiffs, the purpose of the CA Order which asked the <span class="font-italic">solicitors</span> for both sides, WTL and TSS, to appoint the solicitors “for the sale” of the Property is to “ensure that there is <span class="font-italic">no delay to the sale</span> which may result if appointment is <span class="font-italic">by the parti</span><span class="font-italic">es</span>, who are unable to agree” [emphasis added].

Indeed, I find that this is the natural and reasonable interpretation of words used in the correspondence set out above. The 2nd Defendant did not recognise that it had any independent duty to distribute the sale proceeds. This was consistent with Ms Chee’s evidence on the stand, in which she explained that the sale proceeds belonged to the registered owner of the Property, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>the 1st Defendant. However, as the sale proceeds were deposited into the 2nd Defendant’s conveyancing account, it had to be distributed, but only on the instructions of the owner of the proceeds, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the 1st Defendant.

This alleged duty simply did not follow from the joint appointment. First, the Plaintiffs were represented by their own solicitors, WTL, at the material time. Second, such an argument would not be in accordance with the purpose of the CA Order for joint appointment (see [176] above). The purpose of the CA Order is to ensure an expedient <span class="font-italic">appointment</span> of a solicitor to facilitate the conveyance of the Property, and to prevent the possibility of gridlock and delay if that solicitor was to be chosen by the warring parties. It did not follow that the solicitor, <span class="font-italic">after</span> appointment, would still have to actively take instructions from both parties.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The next issue is whether there was nonetheless an implied retainer between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant. The circumstances under which a retainer may be implied is set out in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Ahmad </span><span class="font-italic">Khalis</span>”) at [66]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A retainer may be implied where, on an objective consideration of all the circumstances, <span class="font-italic">an intention to enter into such a contractual relationship ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all the parties.</span> The implication would have to be <span class="font-italic">so clear that the solicitor ought to have appreciated it.</span> Circumstances to be taken into account might include, where appropriate, <span class="font-italic">who is paying the [solicitor’s] fees, who is providing instructions and whether a contractual relationship has existed between the parties in the past.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The court in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Patrick Adrian v Ng Chong &amp; Hue LLC</span> [2014] 3 SLR 761 (“<span class="font-italic">Anwar</span>”) stated that the crux of the matter is whether a contractual relationship “ought fairly and properly” be imputed to all parties (at [53]). The giving of advice to a third party is a strong inference that the solicitor and the third party had regarded themselves as being in some kind of contractual relationship. However, the absence of any advice given, while in many cases helpful in enabling the court to infer that no implied retainer had arisen, is not decisive on whether there is an implied retainer if other objective evidence point towards the existence of an implied retainer (at [51]-[52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In this case, there are no factors that point towards the need for a retainer to be implied. Applying the factors outlined in <span class="font-italic">Ahmad Khalis</span>, it is clear that a retainer should not be implied in these circumstances. The 2nd Defendant’s bill was addressed to the 1st Defendant, as executor of the Late Father’s estate. It was the 1st Defendant who gave the 2nd Defendant instructions. There was no previous contractual relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant. No advice was given by the 2nd Defendant to the Plaintiffs; in fact, the Plaintiffs were separately advised by lawyers from WTL, which included a senior counsel. Any emails from the 2nd Defendant to WTL was merely to keep them updated of matters pertaining to the sale of the Property.

</div> It would not be fair and proper to imply a retainer in such circumstances. Indeed, the implication of a retainer was not “so clear that the solicitor [the 2nd Defendant] ought to have appreciated it”. On the contrary, the 2nd Defendant must sensibly have come to the opposite conclusion that there was no subsisting solicitor-client relationship between itself and the Plaintiffs. Indeed, it is clear from the emails (where the Plaintiffs state that they were not comfortable with Ms Chee) that they did not want any communications from her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 As for Ms Chee’s emails to the 1st Defendant which stated that she would send various expenses incurred by the 1st Defendant and Foo Chin Chin to WTL “for their approval”, and her statement that the letter of authorisation required the signatures of all the beneficiaries, Ms Chee had explained in her AEIC and on the stand that this was because she had mistakenly thought she needed the consent of all beneficiaries but realised she only needed the consent of the executor of the Late Father’s estate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1st Defendant.

</div> Further, under cross-examination by the 1st Plaintiff, Ms Chee made clear that the reference to the Plaintiffs’ approval was not because she owed any obligations under a retainer to the Plaintiffs, but because she knew that there was a history of unhappiness and distrust between the parties and hoped that all would agree to prevent future disputes. I accept these explanations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Duty of care in tort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 Having dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim that the 2nd Defendant owed them a duty of care under an express or implied retainer, I move on to the claim that the 2nd Defendant owed them a duty of care in tort. The immediate difficulty for the Plaintiffs is that this cause of action was not even pleaded. While the Plaintiffs chose to discharge counsel just before the trial, they did have legal representation at the time the pleadings were drafted (and indeed amended). No evidence was led on this claim at the trial. The claim only surfaced in the closing submissions. Given that no replies were allowed to be filed, the 2nd Defendant never had a chance to address the claim. For these reasons, the claim in tort for breach of a duty of care fails. I add in passing that, on the facts before me, even if the claim had been properly pleaded, the claim in tort is highly questionable, to say the least.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Since there is no subsisting solicitor-client relationship between the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendant, the question whether the 2nd Defendant owes fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs is one which demands careful examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The only question is whether the present case is one in which the circumstances justify an imposition of fiduciary duties. A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to <span class="font-italic">a relationship </span><span class="font-italic">of trust and confidence</span>: <span class="font-italic">Bristol &amp; West Building Society v Mothew </span>[1998] Ch 1 at 18, recently cited in <span class="font-italic">FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar </span><span class="font-italic">Capital Partners LLC </span>[2014] UKSC 45 at [5]. In this case, it cannot be said that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiffs, for largely the same reasons as I have detailed at [188]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Furthermore, there is no voluntary assumption of responsibility by the 2nd Defendant. No advice was rendered by Ms Chee to the Plaintiffs. Indeed, it bears repeating that the Plaintiffs made it clear to Ms Chee in the email correspondence that her input and reply was not required. They made no attempts to hide their disdain and distrust of her. The 1st Plaintiff, for example, wrote to Ms Hwa stating that he “do[es] not communicate with [Ms Chee] nor give her any instruction[s]…Anyway I do not have [a] working relationship with her and I will not regard her”.

</div> It would fly in the face of logic for the Plaintiffs to now suggest that Ms Chee had assumed responsibility towards them or had entered into a relationship of trust and confidence in respect of the distribution, when they themselves had <span class="font-italic">prevented</span> her from taking any responsibility.

</div> The 2nd Defendant was simply acting on the instructions of the 1st Defendant, who was the executor of the Late Father’s estate. It was the 1st Defendant who had the power to order the distribution of the sale proceeds.

As I have already found that the 1st Defendant did not breach his fiduciary duties (except in relation to the provision of accounts), the 2nd Defendant naturally cannot be held liable for dishonest assistance.

The 1st Defendant should not have been given his share (as a beneficiary) of the Late Mother’s estate. Further, the share that he received was incorrect as certain expenses against the Late Mother’s estate had not been properly accounted for. The problem, however, for the Plaintiffs is that these issues or claims in respect of the Late Mother’s estate are not or are no longer before this court. I explain by first revisiting the preliminary issue of whether the Plaintiffs even have the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to bring claims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In my Amendment Judgment (which I referred to briefly at the start of this judgment), I had stated that the Plaintiffs’ unequivocal position in the course of the present suit was that the parties were all suing and being sued in their <span class="font-italic">personal capacities </span>only (at [35] of the Amendment Judgment). I had held (at [71]) that the Plaintiffs, suing in their personal capacities, had no standing to bring certain claims relating to the Late Mother’s estate <span class="font-italic">against the 2nd Defendant</span>. I therefore did not allow the inclusion of certain paragraphs in the Statement of Claim outlining the said claims against the 2nd Defendant.  I pause to note that the Plaintiffs had legal representation at this juncture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 I had also observed (at [73] of the Amendment Judgment) that my decision on standing as outlined in the previous paragraph had an impact on the Plaintiffs’ standing to bring claims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate <span class="font-italic">against </span><span class="font-italic">the 1st Defendant</span> as well. However, I noted that because the 1st Defendant had never objected to the paragraphs pertaining to these claims, the issue was not before me and it was for the parties to take the necessary courses of action they deemed fit following my decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Following my Amendment Judgment, the 1st Plaintiff commenced S 284 in his <span class="font-italic">representative</span> <span class="font-italic">capacity</span> as executor of the Late Mother’s estate (see [57] above), bringing claims against <span class="font-italic">the 2nd Defendant</span> in relation to the Late Mother’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 The 1st Defendant, in his opening statement, submitted that S 284 was the proper forum for matters concerning the Late Mother’s estate to be properly ventilated.

</div> I am of the view that he clearly accepted that all issues against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in relation to the Late Mother’s estate are to be dealt with in S 284. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In any event, although the 1st Defendant did not expressly address the point of capacity in his submissions, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs simply do not have the standing to bring an action against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate in the present suit. In this respect, I refer to my analysis and reasoning at [58]–[67] of the Amendment Judgment, in which I analysed the case of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span><span class="font-italic">v Soo Ah Choy</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>”). Based on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs did not have the standing to bring the claims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate, given that they were suing in their <span class="font-italic">personal capacities</span>, as beneficiary and creditor of the Late Mother’s estate respectively. This is because the Plaintiffs have not been able to prove that it is “impossible or at least seriously inconvenient for the representatives to take proceedings” (<span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> at [28]). Indeed, the 1st Plaintiff, as co-executor of the Late Mother’s estate, could have brought the claims in a representative capacity <span class="font-italic">against the 1st Defendant</span>. He has done precisely that when he commenced S 284 in relation to claims <span class="font-italic">against</span> <span class="font-italic">the 2nd Defendant</span>. The Plaintiffs only have themselves to blame for this omission and the current state of affairs. I had in my Amendment Judgment (at [73]) already made clear that my decision on standing in relation to the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 2nd Defendant would affect their standing against <span class="font-italic">the 1st Defendant</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as well. I had given them a chance to take up any proceedings they deemed necessary (see [211] above). It would have been prudent for the 1st Plaintiff to do so, but he has not up to this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Some observations on the Plaintiffs’ claims against the 1st Defendant in relation to the Late Mother’s estate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Notwithstanding the fact that the Plaintiffs agreed and accepted that the claims in respect of the Late Mother’s estate were to be dealt with in S 284, they gave considerable evidence in respect of their complaints in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. That said, the 1st and 3rd Defendant also touched on matters relating to the Late Mother’s Estate. The evidence mainly concerned: (i) the 1st Plaintiff’s claim for the Gleneagles Bills, the Deed of Settlement and the consent judgment in DC 2814; (ii) the 2nd Plaintiff’s claim for the Late Mother’s medical expenses; (iii) the 1st and 3rd Defendant’s claim for the Late Mother’s medical expenses; (iv) the 1st Defendant’s claim for the Late Mother’s funeral expenses; (v) the failure to take account of “<span class="font-italic">pek kim</span>” collected during the Late Mother’s wake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Given that the parties have agreed that claims in respect of the Late Mother’s estate will be decided in S 284, I make no further comment on the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Having dealt with all the claims by the Plaintiffs, I now turn to the final issue of the costs of this trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 The 1st Defendant asks for costs on an indemnity basis against the Plaintiffs. This was for a few reasons. First, despite the Amendment Judgment, in which I disallowed claims concerning the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates, the Plaintiffs did not discontinue the claims relating to Late Mother’s estate until the first day of trial when the 1st Plaintiff conceded that it would be improper to make double claims.

</div>
</div> After the commencement of the present suit, the Plaintiffs separately commenced S 284, which related to the Late Mother’s estate. This made the various heads of claim under the present suit unnecessary and duplicative. Further, the Plaintiffs insisted on taking unreasonable positions, for example by insisting that there was an agreement of $350,000 on legal costs. This is a larger sum than what the Plaintiffs had actually incurred, and more than the quantum determined in taxation proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The 2nd Defendant also claims for costs on an indemnity basis from the Plaintiffs. According to the 2nd Defendant, the contemporaneous documents and the evidence evinces a lack of basis to the Plaintiffs’ case against the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiffs also never had any intention to settle, and sought to disingenuously paint themselves as involuntary plaintiffs, alleging that the 2nd Defendant was inviting them to sue, when there was no such evidence. Further, the Plaintiffs discharged their former solicitors BATP at the very last moment, at the doorstep of trial. This prejudiced the Defendants, causing numerous delays and resulting in the 2nd Defendant incurring extra costs in preparing documents such as the agreed bundles, which would ordinarily have been the responsibility of the Plaintiffs. Finally, the 2nd Defendant points to the Plaintiffs’ behaviour at the trial, stating that they formulated convoluted questions, which resulted in protracted cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In their further submissions on indemnity costs filed on 30 September 2016, the Plaintiffs argue that indemnity costs should not be awarded, as their conduct was not unreasonable. As against the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiffs’ position is that there is merit to their claims, as the 1st Defendant has clearly shown a flagrant disregard for the CA Orders and for his duties to the beneficiaries.

</div> Further, the Plaintiffs had tried to make proposals to the 1st Defendant for mediation and settlement, but these were all rejected. Further, as S 284 was brought only in relation the Late Mother’s estate, there is no duplication. Instead, it was the 1st Defendant who ought to pay the Plaintiffs’ costs on an indemnity basis if he fails in the present suit, and should not be entitled to any costs if he succeeds.

At the beginning of the action, the 2nd Defendant’s counsel had made an offer to settle but this was subject to the Plaintiffs’ agreement to pay the 2nd Defendant indemnity costs, which the Plaintiffs had found unacceptable. Further, the Plaintiffs assert that they are genuinely aggrieved by the 2nd Defendant’s actions and have no ulterior motive or personal grievance. They only wish to seek redress from the courts for the loss that the Plaintiffs have suffered as a result of the 2nd Defendant’s acts and omissions. Further, the reason they were unable to continue with legal representation for the trial was because they have limited funds. They deny that they have been abusing the process of the court.

By contrast, where an order is made for costs on a standard basis, the receiving party is allowed a reasonable amount in respect of all costs reasonably incurred, and any doubts are resolved in favour of the paying party: O 59 r 27(2). Costs on an indemnity basis are awarded as an exception rather than the norm: see <span class="font-italic">CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20 at [32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The determination of whether indemnity costs are appropriate begins with a consideration of the factors under O 59 r 5 of the Rules of Court, which states </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Special matters to be taken into account in exercising discretion (O. 59, r. 5)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any payment of money into Court and the amount of such payment;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the conduct of all the parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)  the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) in particular, the extent to which the parties have followed any relevant pre-action protocol or practice direction for the time being issued by the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Two of the factors are particularly relevant to this case. The first is the conduct of the parties, including conduct <span class="font-italic">before </span>and <span class="font-italic">during </span>the proceedings (O 59 r 5(b)). The second is the parties’ conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause of matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution (O 59 r 5(c)). I shall return to these factors later in my judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Airtrust Hong Kong Ltd v PH Hydraulics &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”), cited by all the parties, comprehensively examined the case law on indemnity costs. In that case, Chan J opined that it may be useful for a court to ask itself the question of whether the party’s conduct was “so unreasonable as to justify an award of indemnity costs”. Such conduct must “reflect a high degree of unreasonableness, and cannot merely be wrong or misguided in hindsight”. However, the unreasonable conduct “need not rise to the level of dishonesty or moral iniquity”: <span class="font-italic">Airtrust </span>at [50].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 To assess the unreasonableness of the party’s conduct, the court may consider whether the party’s conduct caused prejudice to the other party as well as the context and nature of the dispute. One example cited in <span class="font-italic">Ai</span><span class="font-italic">rtrust </span>was the case of <span class="font-italic">Goh Eileen née Chia and another v Goh Mei Ling Yvonne and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1356 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Eileen</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Goh Eileen</span>, the plaintiff’s application to remove the defendants as joint tenants to a flat was dismissed. The defendants sought, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>to recover costs on an indemnity basis. Quentin Loh J found that the case was not sufficiently exceptional to warrant an order of indemnity costs. Loh J considered (at [50]) that at the heart of the case was a family dispute where siblings were fighting over their parents’ flat and “[l]ike most family disputes, emotions ran deep and tempers flared; various allegations, valid or otherwise, were made both in and out of court”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Chan J further suggested (at [23] and [49] of <span class="font-italic">Ai</span><span class="font-italic">rtrust</span>) that it may be appropriate for a court to make an order of indemnity costs where the action or a party’s conduct falls into any of the following non-exhaustive categories:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the action is brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the action is speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings is dishonest, abusive or improper; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where the action amounts to wasteful or duplicative litigation or is otherwise an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 For the purposes of my decision, I adopt the propositions set out above, which I find to be a helpful summary of the law on indemnity costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On what basis should costs be assessed?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 After a careful review of the circumstances surrounding the present suit, I award costs on an indemnity basis to be paid by the Plaintiffs to the 2nd Defendant <span class="font-italic">only</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 In respect of the 1st Defendant, I am of the view that the context and nature of the present suit is similar to <span class="font-italic">Goh Eileen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [217] above)<span class="font-italic">.</span> This is, after all, a family dispute between siblings, for which there was, and still is, deep-seated grievances and hurt. Emotions flared during the course of the trial and various allegations were made, some of which were uncalled for. However, this fact alone did not mean that indemnity costs would invariably be allowed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 In particular, I note that the 1st Defendant had raised the argument that despite the Amendment Judgment, in which I had apparently disallowed claims concerning the Late Mother’s and Late Brother’s estates, the Plaintiffs did not discontinue the claims relating to Late Mother’s estate until the first day of trial. That is not entirely accurate. As I had earlier explained, I had only held in the Amendment Judgment that the Plaintiffs were not allowed to add certain paragraphs to the Statement of Claim with respect to claims <span class="font-italic">against the</span> <span class="font-italic">2nd Defendant</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in relation to the Late Mother’s estate. While I observed that this decision may have an impact on whether the Plaintiffs were allowed to pursue the claims in relation to the Late Mother’s estate <span class="font-italic">against the 1st Defendant</span>, I did not express any firm views on this for the simple reason that the 1st Defendant never raised any objections to these and the issue was not properly before me. It is also not the case that the Plaintiffs had pursued <span class="font-italic">duplicitous</span> claims in the present suit, because S 284 (as presently formulated) did not even encompass claims against the 1st Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 For these reasons, I am of the view that there was nothing exceptional in the matters alleged by the 1st Defendant to warrant a departure from the usual basis of costs on the standard basis. While the 1st Defendant has been ordered to provide an account of the rental income (which may well prove not to be substantial), I note that in all other aspects he has succeeded and is entitled to full costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The situation is different with respect to the 2nd Defendant, where the Plaintiffs’ conduct is far more unreasonable. The claims that were brought by the Plaintiffs were untenable in law, without factual basis, and sometimes directly contradicted by contemporaneous documents. I also observe that it was the Plaintiffs’ own conduct that had distanced Ms Chee, and it was disingenuous for them to allege that the 2nd Defendant had breached various duties towards them. Further, the Plaintiffs had not even pleaded substantive causes of action in the tort of negligence and in dishonest assistance against the 2nd Defendant. This was wholly unacceptable given that they were represented by counsel (BATP) at the pleadings stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 Further, the Plaintiffs’ conduct prior to the proceedings is objectionable. First, the Plaintiffs chose to discharge their solicitors at the eleventh hour, less than two weeks before the trial began. This caused real prejudice to the 2nd Defendant (a factor in [217] above), who was burdened with having to prepare documents, such as the four agreed bundles, which would ordinarily be the onus of the Plaintiffs. During the trial, the Plaintiffs were not able to give good reasons for the discharge of their solicitor at such a late stage, save for a vague and unsubstantiated belief that they would not be able to fully articulate their side of the story if they continued to be represented by solicitors.

</div> but their acrimony and obvious hostility towards the 2nd Defendant both before and during the proceedings militates against any genuine intention to settle. There was only one offer to settle dated 19 June 2013 to the 2nd Defendant. The other “proposal” pointed out by the Plaintiffs simply informed the 2nd Defendant that the Plaintiffs were about to commence legal action against the 1st Defendant and asked if the 2nd Defendant was willing to be bound by the judgment in that action.

</div> In fact, it appears that the Plaintiffs’ position was that they were essentially involuntary plaintiffs because the 2nd Defendant had “invit[ed] [them] to sue”. This allegation is unsupported by evidence and completely at odds with sense or reason. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 I should add that the Plaintiffs could not rely on their status as litigants-in-person to avoid adverse cost orders when their conduct has passed the threshold of unreasonableness. I have already granted the Plaintiffs significant latitude in the presentation of their case, even though they were sometimes evasive in their answers, disruptive during cross-examination, and insisted on spending copious time on irrelevant questions. In this respect, I draw guidance from the observations of Edmund Leow JC in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">Ong Chai Hong (executrix of the estate of Chiang Chia Liang, deceased) </span><span class="font-italic">v Chiang Shirley and others</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1006 at [40]–[41]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is every layperson’s right to represent himself or herself without the aid of counsel. Justice requires that courts do not apply professional standards to litigants in person, who may be involved in a court proceeding for the only time in their lives. <span class="font-italic">However, litigants in person are still subject to the same rules and procedure of court. Whilst the courts are cognisant of the fact that litigants in person are not legally trained, and are thus more indulgent of their mistakes, this does not mean that they can act without regard to these rules and procedures</span><span class="font-italic">...</span> I find that the first defendant had behaved unreasonably, even when allowance is made for her inexperience and lack of objectivity; her actions caused the other parties in the litigation to incur unnecessary costs to respond to her allegations and in managing her disruptions. In my view, the first defendant had taken unfair advantage of the leeway given to her as a litigant in person and pursued her claims in a manner that was prejudicial to the other parties in the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I pause to clarify that I did not draw an adverse inference against the first defendant for not engaging counsel for the trial when she could afford to do so: her right to appear in person is quite absolute. <span class="font-italic">However, her status as a litigant in person alone does not and cannot mean that she can conduct her case in an unreasonable manner that causes the other parties to incur unnecessary costs, and remain immune from adverse cost orders</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">By whom should the costs be paid?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Despite fairly extensive submissions on the <span class="font-italic">basis </span>of the assessment of costs, there were no submissions made by any of the parties on <span class="font-italic">who </span>should bear the costs incurred –whether it should be borne by the parties personally, or by the Late Father’s estate. Nonetheless, it is my view that there is sufficient evidence before this court to make an assessment on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In my view, the costs of the Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant incurred for the present suit are to be paid by the Late Father’s estate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, out of the sale proceeds of the Property. This is because these proceedings are brought to determine the scope of the 1st Defendant’s duty as executor. Such legal proceedings can be brought by the beneficiaries in a proper case, with legal expenses of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the person who instituted the proceedings, as well as other parties in the suit, borne by the estate as legitimate testamentary expenses (see [77(b)] above). However, I note that a sum of only $863,377.25 remains in court after the payments out of the Minimum Sums: see [54] above. At the point of the payments out, provision had been made for the legal expenses that the Plaintiffs allege have been incurred in OS 909 and CA 70 ($350,000): see [50]-[52] and [63] above. However, the court’s attention was not drawn in any of the summonses to the fact that further provision may need to be made for meeting the costs of <span class="font-italic">the present suit</span>. In the circumstances, it is unclear whether the amount that remains in court would be sufficient to meet the cost order currently made. If it is not, the outstanding amount that cannot be met by the remaining sum in court is to be divided among the beneficiaries equally, and each beneficiary is to pay that amount back to court in order to satisfy the cost order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 However, the Plaintiffs are to bear the costs incurred by the 2nd Defendant in this suit <span class="font-italic">personally</span>. It is clear that there was no merit to their case against the 2nd Defendant and it would not be just or reasonable to make the Late Father’s estate bear the costs of such untenable claims, when the Plaintiffs were responsible for this state of affairs. Looking at the evidence as a whole, it is clear that the Plaintiffs’ displeasure with the 2nd Defendant was largely due to their perception that Ms Chee was not listening to their instructions and that she was “favouring” the 1st Defendant. I find that they have no basis for this perception. Ms Chee was acting as best she could in difficult circumstances, taking account of the scope of her appointment and the CA Orders. Indeed, the Plaintiffs were the ones who had attempted to cut off communications with her: see [188] above.<span style="color: rgba(0,176,80,1)"> </span>Ms Chee, through no fault of her own, became embroiled in what was already a highly emotional and bitter dispute between the siblings over the Late Father’s estate that has now stretched to involve three estates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 As for the 3rd Defendant, I am of the view that he should bear his own costs. The 3rd Defendant was added to the present suit mainly to apprise the court of his position in relation to some of the disputed claims, and his evidence was fairly contained. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 In summary, I find that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The 1st Defendant has breached his fiduciary duties only in relation to his failure to provide an account of rent of the Property and to forward the Statements of Accounts to the Plaintiffs before distribution of the sale proceeds. However, the 1st Defendant did not breach his fiduciary duties in accepting the claims that he did take into account. He also did not breach his fiduciary duties in not taking into account the Plaintiffs’ claims, which would not in any case have been allowed. The failure to forward the Statements of Accounts to the Plaintiffs therefore did not cause any loss to the Plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Plaintiffs’ claims against the 2nd Defendant are dismissed in their entirety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 The 1st Defendant is to provide an account of rent received from the Property within two months of the date of this judgment. If the account of rent reveals profits made from the rental, these profits must be returned to the estate and be equally divided among the beneficiaries. I remind the 1st Defendant that he needs to perform this duty <span class="font-italic">assiduously and honestly</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 The 1st Defendant’s costs are to be assessed on a standard basis. The Plaintiffs’ and 1st Defendant’s costs are to be paid out of the Late Father’s estate. If the amount left in court is insufficient to meet this cost order, the outstanding costs are to be divided equally among the beneficiaries, with each beneficiary to pay back that amount into court as necessary to satisfy the cost order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 In addition, the Plaintiffs are to pay the 2nd Defendant’s costs on an indemnity basis. These costs are to be paid by the Plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">personally</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 All the above costs are to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The 3rd Defendant is to bear his own costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 I conclude by making some observations about the present suit. It is clear that there is much bitterness among the Foo siblings and deep-rooted grievances against one another which has spilt into the courts over the years. This is underscored by the sheer number of suits and interlocutory proceedings in relation to the late parents’ estates. Indeed, there are now also proceedings concerning the Late Brother’s Estate. These legal proceedings have resulted in the estate monies being substantially depleted in pursuing and defending the claims, without any real prospect of settlement. In fact, in the present suit, the disputed sums are negligible compared to the Minimum Sums already paid out to the beneficiaries. It bears emphasis that the court should not be used as a forum for the airing of grievances accumulated over a lifetime against other family members. As a court of law, the grievances must be set out in the context of legally enforceable rights and obligations and with due regard to established rules on procedure and evidence. It is my hope that this judgment provides some closure to the parties and enables them to leave behind their animosity and to move on to the next chapter of their lives. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The plaintiffs in person;<br/>Nandwani Manoj Prakash and Christine Ong (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the 1st defendant;<br/>Christopher Anand s/o Daniel, Ganga d/o Avadiar and Foo Li Chuan Arlene (Advocatus Law LLP) for the 2nd defendant; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The 3rd defendant in person.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
