<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The prohibition against an undischarged bankrupt
                    from managing (or being a director of) a company or a business as found in
                    s 148(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Companies Act’) and s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act
                    (Cap 32, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the Business Registration Act”)
                    serves the important role of safeguarding the interests of the business’
                    existing creditors, as well as the interests of potential creditors of the
                    business, who may be unaware of the financial status of persons in charge of
                    such businesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The prohibition also serves to protect the
                    greater public interest to prevent the undischarged bankrupt from misusing the
                    corporate structure for collateral purposes to the detriment of stakeholders
                    such as the company’s shareholders, the business’ trading partners
                    and suppliers, consumers, and the general public who depend on the services
                    and/or products of such businesses or companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       From my review of several written decisions from
                    the Subordinate Courts, it appears to me that the trend is to impose a custodial
                    sentence for offenders who breach the prohibition by acting as a director of a
                    company or being involved in management of a business in spite of their bankrupt
                    status. Of the six decisions which I reviewed, five imposed custodial sentences
                    ranging from two weeks to six weeks. In only one instance was a fine imposed.
                    From my examination of the line of Subordinate Court decisions on the same
                    offence, it seems to me that there is no discernible sentencing principle or a
                    common sentencing policy which can be drawn from them. The present situation
                    presents a disparate and unclear position on what the benchmark sentence should
                    be, and what the proper factors to be considered as relevant aggravating factors
                    are. It is hoped that this decision will provide some rational sentencing
                    guidelines in relation to such offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Further, this appeal has also revealed the need
                    for a review of the working protocol as regards the removal of persons as
                    directors who have been adjudged bankrupt. In this case, the appellant remained
                    on record as a director of a company for almost four years after she was
                    adjudged a bankrupt. How was this possible? The breach was only discovered when
                    the appellant applied to be discharged as a bankrupt. Instead of being <em>discharged</em>, she was <em>charged</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background Facts</p>
<p>
<b><em>The Charges</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The appellant pleaded guilty to three charges.
                    The first charge, DAC 10992 of 2009, relates to the appellant having acted
                    as a director of a company, Novena Communication Pte Ltd (“NCPL”),
                    whilst being a bankrupt without the leave of the High Court or the written
                    permission of the Official Assignee (“the OA”), which is an
                    offence punishable under s 148(1) of the Companies Act. The second charge,
                    DAC 10995 of 2009, relates to the appellant, having taken part in the management
                    of a sole proprietorship named Novena Security System (“NSS”),
                    whilst being an undischarged bankrupt, without the leave of the High Court or
                    the written permission of the OA, which is an offence punishable under
                    s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act. The third charge, DAC 10999 of
                    2009, which is not the subject matter of this appeal, relates to the appellant
                    having remained outside Singapore without the prior permission of the OA, which
                    is an offence punishable under s 131(2) of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“the Bankruptcy Act”). The appellant further
                    consented to six other charges (two charges under s 148(1) of the Companies
                    Act, two charges under s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act, and two
                    charges under s 131(2) of the Bankruptcy Act) being taken into
                    consideration for the purposes of sentencing
                (“TIC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The District Judge (“the DJ”)
                    sentenced the appellant to six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the first
                    two charges, and a fine of $5,000 for the third charge, with the imprisonment
                    terms ordered to run concurrently. The appellant appealed and sought a
                    non-custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events before the appellant’s bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The appellant and her husband were the directors
                    of two companies, namely Novena Lighting Pte Ltd (“NLPL”) and
                    NCPL, which were registered on 4 January 1986 and 18 August 1988 respectively
                    long before her bankruptcy. Fujitec Singapore Corporation Ltd
                    (“Fujitec”) was one of NCPL’s principal clients. At all
                    material times, one Koh Heng Chuan (“Koh”) was employed by NLPL,
                    but subsequently became more involved in NCPL’s business as he was trained
                    in audio video communications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As NCPL experienced dire financial difficulties,
                    the appellant borrowed various sums of $50,000, $25,000 and $30,000 from Koh in
                    1999, March 2000 and November 2000 respectively. These loans totalled
                    $105,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Sometime in February 2001, the appellant
                    suggested that Koh set up a sole-proprietorship to take over NCPL’s
                    distributorship of audio video intercommunications (“AVI”)
                    equipment supplied by Nippon Interphone Ltd (“Nippon”). Koh was
                    concerned with his lack of management experience. The appellant assured Koh that
                    she would teach and guide him. Koh acceded to the appellant’s request and
                    registered a business known as Kaseve International (“Kaseve”)
                    under his name on 8 March 2001. Koh contributed a total of $85,088.40 to
                    finance Kaseve’s purchase of AVI equipment from Nippon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequently, Koh was informed by the
                    appellant that Fujitec did not recognise the name “Kaseve
                    International” for the purposes of making payment. On 19 April 2001,
                    pursuant to the appellant’s instructions, Koh registered another
                    sole-proprietorship, NSS under his name. Between 19 April 2001 and
                    10 July 2001, Fujitec issued purchase orders to NSS in the aggregate sum of
                    $15,677.63. Kaseve in turn purchased the goods to fulfil the orders placed by
                    Fujitec with NSS. Fujitec credited a sum of $10,381.37 into NCPL’s bank
                    account on 25 July 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The appellant was adjudged a bankrupt on 23
                    November 2001. A few weeks later, on 18 December 2001, she was briefed on
                    her duties and responsibilities as an undischarged bankrupt, and she
                    acknowledged receipt of several documents which included the following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bankruptcy order against the appellant dated 23

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bankruptcy information sheet 3 on how the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Bankruptcy information sheet 1 included a
                    paragraph that stipulated the prohibition on taking part either directly or
                    indirectly in the management of any company or business or acting as a director
                    without the written permission of the OA or the leave of the High
                Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the appellant’s bankruptcy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Despite acknowledging receipt of the various
                    documents from the OA which included the prohibition on acting as director or
                    being involved in management, the appellant continued as a director of NCPL for
                    almost four years, between 18 December 2001 and 4 July 2005. The
                    appellant only resigned from her directorship on 4 July 2005, after
                    receiving a letter of warning dated 24 June 2005 from the Insolvency &amp;
                    Public Trustee’s Office (“IPTO”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The appellant had unrestricted access to
                    NCPL’s funds (via an ATM card and cheque book) between 18 December
                    2001 and 31 January 2002. Fujitec credited a sum of $21,349.84 on
                    21 December 2001 into NCPL’s bank account. Thereafter, the appellant
                    issued cheques which totalled the sum of $22,786.50 to pay various creditors.
                    The appellant also withdrew the sum of $6,266.52 from NCPL’s bank account
                    on 26 January 2002, after Fujitec credited the sum of $5,814.35 on
                    25 January 2002. The appellant had, on 26 December 2001, represented
                    herself as a director of NCPL when she signed a tenancy agreement on behalf of
                    NCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In relation to the offence of taking part in
                    the management of NSS, the appellant was substantially involved in the running
                    of NSS’ business. It was the appellant who made all the business decisions
                    while Koh’s role was reduced to providing the financing for the purchase
                    of the AVI equipment. The appellant admitted that because NCPL was unable to
                    fulfil its obligation to supply AVI equipment to Fujitec under its existing
                    contracts, the appellant had asked Koh to set up NSS, and had used Koh’s
                    funds to purchase the AVI equipment through NSS to supply to Fujitec<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Between January and April 2002, Koh
                    received cheque payments totalling $19,000, for the AVI equipment purchased by
                    Fujitec from NSS, as well as cash payments of around $2,000 for servicing
                    charges. In addition, the appellant handed Koh a cheque issued in the name of
                    NSS for the sum of $350 in March 2002. Fujitec further credited $18,454
                    into NSS’ account on 25 April 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In December 2001, Koh discovered that the
                    appellant had been adjudged a bankrupt on 23 November 2001.To safeguard his own
                    interest, Koh terminated the two sole-proprietorships of Kaseve and NSS on
                    28 June 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In arriving at her decision to impose a
                    sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment for each of the two charges, the DJ
                    took into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The appellant’s deliberate
                        disregard of the prohibition on acting as a director of NCPL for a period of
                        more than four years (consequently no concession was given for her guilty
                        plea or her complete absence of antecedents).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The appellant’s lack of honesty in her
                        dealings with Koh in that she manipulated the transactions and utilised
                        payments received from Fujitec after she was adjudged to be a bankrupt for
                        purposes unrelated to Koh, Kaseve and NSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     The appellant’s involvement in the
                        management of NSS and Kaseve was not just “in passing” and she
                        had deliberately influenced Koh into registering the two
                        sole-proprietorships for her to manage.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The absence of exceptional circumstances which
                        warranted a non-custodial sentence.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     An offender who contravenes these provisions
                    faces a wide range of punishment: the offender is liable to be punished by a
                    fine not exceeding $10,000, or an imprisonment term not exceeding two years, or
                    both. As alluded to above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>, my analysis
                    of several earlier decisions in the Subordinate Courts did not reveal any clear
                    or consistent sentencing policy. It is unclear what constitutes relevant or
                    recognised aggravating factors for sentencing purposes. It is to these decisions
                    that my attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Public Prosecutor v. Ong
                        Kwang Eng</em> [2005] SGDC 175 (“<em>Ong Kwang Eng”</em>), the offender was sentenced to one
                    month’s imprisonment under s 148(1) of the Companies Act for taking
                    part in the management of a company. In determining whether a custodial sentence
                    was warranted, the judge observed that the “flagrant
                    contravention” of the law was an aggravating feature in that case (at
                    [11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...a custodial sentence would be appropriate where there are aggravating
                        features such as flagrant contravention of the law, dishonesty, or where the
                        offender has previous convictions of a similar nature...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The judge, however, adopted a curious approach
                    as to what constitutes “blatant disregard” of the law (at
                    [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I...considered the length of sentence that would be appropriate on the
                        facts of this case. The accused blatantly disregarded the disqualification
                        on him. His actions in directly taking part in the management of Gabriel
                        Technology Pte Ltd. showed a deliberate disregard of the law...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As can be seen from the above, the judge
                    regarded the very offence (which was the direct involvement in the management of
                    the company) as an aggravating factor in itself. The judge also imposed a
                    sentence of one month’s imprisonment for breach of the disqualification
                    order under s 154(1) of the Companies Act, and ordered both imprisonment
                    sentences to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     A somewhat inconsistent outcome was reached in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Hua Tong Jasons</em>
                    [2005] SGDC 122 (“<em>Lim Hua
                    Tong</em>”) where a non-custodial sentence was imposed for a
                    conviction under s 148(1) of the Companies Act despite the fact that the
                    offender was directly involved in the management of the company (a private
                    education centre), made management decisions, and was in charge of the academic
                    programmes, training courses and the business development of the company. Like
                    the case in <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em>, no harm resulted from
                    the commission of the offences. The judge in <em>Lim Hua
                        Tong</em> found that a fine of $5,000 (in default six weeks’
                    imprisonment) was appropriate since no harm was caused by the offences, the
                    offences did not persist over several years, and the offender had no relevant
                    antecedents. The judge held that (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The range of fines for such a first [time] offender, who does not cause
                        harm, is generally between $2,000 to $6,000 or so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A different sentencing approach was adopted in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeong Chuan Wor</em>
                    [2004] SGDC 141 (“<em>Yeong Chuan
                    Wor</em>”). Unlike the approach in <em>Ong Kwang
                        Eng</em> where the judge found that direct involvement in the
                    management of the company <em>per se</em> constituted a
                    flagrant contravention of the law and was hence an aggravating factor, the judge
                    in <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em> adopted a slightly more
                    methodical approach in the treatment of “flagrant contravention of the
                    law”. The judge found that there was flagrant contravention of the law
                    due to several factors:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the offender committed the offence despite having
                                b<em>een briefed</em> by the OA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the offender had continued to manage the company
                            despite ceasing to be a director; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the offender incorporated three companies
                                <em>after</em> he was adjudged a
                            bankrupt.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The judge found that a custodial sentence was warranted due to this
                    “flagrant contravention of the law”, even though there was no
                    dishonesty and no loss was caused by the offender (<em>Yeong
                        Chuan Wor</em> at [37]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, in determining whether the custody threshold had been
                        breached, I noted that there had been no dishonesty established and that
                        there had been no evidence of any loss to the clients of the companies.
                        However, even in the absence of dishonesty or loss to third parties, a
                        custodial sentence is correct when there has been a flagrant contravention
                        of the [prohibition]...I found that to be the case here. The accused who was
                        served with the bankruptcy information sheet knew perfectly well that he
                        should not concern himself in the management of a company. Yet he did
                        precisely that. After having ceased to hold the position of director of
                        Scmart Malaysia as requested by the OA, he nevertheless continued to manage
                        the company in disobedience of the statutory provision. ...He carried on
                        disobeying the order by incorporating not one company, but three
                        companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The sentences imposed by the judge in
                        <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em> were nonetheless quite odd, to
                    say the least. A sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was imposed on the
                    accused for managing Scmart Singapore for less than six months, while a sentence
                    of three weeks was imposed for managing another company, Synergy, for slightly
                    more than eleven months. Inexplicably, a sentence of two weeks’
                    imprisonment was imposed for managing Calphix Singapore for a period of about 20
                    months. These sentences are hardly consistent with the sentence of four
                    weeks’ imprisonment imposed on the offender in <em>Ong
                        Kwang Eng</em>, who had managed the relevant company for about seven
                    months, and who, unlike the offender in <em>Yeong Chuan
                        Wor</em>, had serious antecedents of eight convictions for cheating
                    offences. It is also curious that the judge in <em>Yeong Chuan
                        Wor</em> had, without explanation, concluded that there was no
                    dishonesty, given that the Judge herself observed the undisputed fact that the
                    offender had registered his siblings as the companies’ directors, so as to
                    allow the offender to camouflage his participation in the management of the
                    company’s operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Ng
                        Chuan Seng</em> [2006] SDGC 264 (“<em>Ng Chuan
                        Seng</em>”) the judge’s approach was not dissimilar to
                    that of <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em> and <em>Yeong
                        Chuan Wor</em> in determining what constitutes “deliberate
                    disregard of the law” (at [10]–[12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    This was not a case where the accused was ignorant
                            of the fact that she could not manage a business. He had been<b><em> briefed just like any other bankrupts</em></b> that he
                            should not concern himself in the management of a
                        business...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    In the instant case, it is plain that the accused

                                disregard</em> of the law continued for a considerable period
                            of time...</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Ng Chuan
                    Seng</em>, the offender was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment
                    under s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act, even though <em>loss</em> was caused to a creditor as a result of the
                    offence, in addition to the aggravating factor of the so-called
                    “deliberate disregard of the law”. This is in contrast to the more
                    severe imprisonment sentences meted out in <em>Yeong Chuan
                        Wor</em> even though in that case no harm or loss was
                caused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Interestingly, the court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Heng Boon Tong</em> [2007] SGDC 290
                        (“<em>Heng Boon Tong</em>”) decided to
                    impose a custodial sentence of one month’s imprisonment for a conviction
                    under s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act based on wholly different
                    sentencing considerations. The judge was particularly persuaded by the decision
                    of Yong CJ in <em>Public Prosecutor v Choong Kian Haw</em>
                    [2002] 4 SLR(R) 776 (“<em>Choong Kian
                        Haw”)</em>. He observed (<em>Heng Boon
                        Tong</em> at [7] and [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    In <em>Public Prosecutor v. Choong
                                Kian Haw</em> [2002] 4 SLR 776, the High Court commented that
                            fines were in general, not a suitable punishment since bankrupts would
                            typically lack the means to pay for the fines themselves. If they had
                            the funds to pay the fines, these monies should clearly be channelled
                            instead to the unpaid creditors. If they lacked the funds and a third
                            party paid for them, the punitive effect of the punishment is
                            diminished...The court added that the burden was on the offender to show
                            that there were such exceptional circumstances to warrant a deviation
                            from the usual imposition of a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14.    In arriving at the appropriate sentence for the
                            charge under...s. 26(1) of the Business Registration Act...I...accepted
                            the prosecution’s submission that a fine is inappropriate in the
                            present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It appears that the judge in <em>Heng Boon Tong</em> imposed a custodial sentence solely on
                    this sentencing philosophy as there was no explicable aggravating factor present
                    in that case. Such a sentencing philosophy was, however, neither referred to nor
                    applied in <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em>, <em>Lim
                        Hua Tong</em> or <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em>. It
                    was, however, endorsed in <em>Ng Chuan Seng</em> where the
                    judge observed that (at [13]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...Yong CJ stated that a sentence in the form of a fine would generally be
                        ineffective as the bankrupt is unlikely to have sufficient funds to pay the
                        fine, which would result in someone else having to pay the fine on behalf of
                        the bankrupt (for which any punitive effect would clearly be
                        diluted)...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     From the above review, with the exception of
                        <em>Lim Hua Tong</em>, the only common denominator
                    which I have been able to ascertain from the above decisions is that each of the
                    judges treated the breach of the statutory prohibition as a deliberate and
                    flagrant disregard of the law and, on that basis, imposed a range of custodial
                    sentences. More will be said about this below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Underlying purpose of s 148 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Any review of the earlier Subordinate Court
                    decisions would not be complete without examining the <em>mischief</em> which s 148 of the Companies Act is intended to
                    safeguard against. As stated above (at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>–<a href="#p1_2">[2]</a>), the
                    prohibition of an undischarged bankrupt from managing (or being a director of) a
                    company or a business serves not only to protect creditors’ interests; it
                    also serves to safeguard the greater public interest to prevent an undischarged
                    bankrupt from misusing the corporate structure for collateral purposes to the
                    detriment of innocent third parties. In <em>Ng Chuan
                        Seng</em>, the Court observed that s 26(1) of the Business
                    Registration Act is “designed to protect the public”, while a
                    similar observation was made in <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em> that
                    the purpose of the disqualification under s 148(1) of the Companies Act is
                    to “protect corporate and commercial integrity”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In England, an undischarged bankrupt would not
                    be granted leave to be a director, or to manage a company if it is <em>contrary to the public interest</em> to do so, as is evident
                    from the express language of s 11of the UK Company Directors

                    13 Cr App R (S) 601 (“<em>Sundranpillai Theivendran”</em>), observed the protective
                    rationale of s 11(1) of the CDDA (as well as s 360(1)(<em>a</em>) of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, being in <em>pari materia</em> with s 148(1)(<em>a</em>) of our local Bankruptcy Act) (per Farquharson LJ at
                    603):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the underlying purpose of [these statutory provisions]... is to
                        rationalise the law of insolvency and in general to enable those involved in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Australian Courts highlighted that the
                    prohibition serves protective purposes and is <em>not a punitive
                        rule</em>. The Supreme Court of New South Wales in <em>Re Altim Pty Ltd</em> [1968] 2 NSWR 762 made the following
                    observation in the context of s 117(1) of the Australian Companies Act 1961
                    (in <em>pari materia</em> with s 148(1) of our
                    Companies Act) (per Street J in 764):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the section is not in any sense a punishment of the bankrupt. Nor
                        should a refusal to grant leave under that section be regarded as punitive.
                            <em>The prohibition is entirely
                        protective</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Bowen CJ similarly observed in <em>Re Magna Alloys &amp; Research Pty Ltd</em> (1975)
                    1 ACLR 203 at 205 that the rationale of the prohibition was not
                    punitive, but protective:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The section is not punitive. It is designed to protect the public and to
                        prevent the corporate structure from being used to the financial detriment
                        of investors, shareholders, creditors and persons dealing with a company. In
                        its operation[,] it is calculated as a safeguard against the corporate
                        structure being used by individuals in a manner which is contrary to proper
                        commercial standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The protective rationale is consistent with
                    the policy behind the bankruptcy regime to achieve a balanced approach.
                    Professor Ho Peng Kee observed in the Second Reading of the Bankruptcy
                    (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                    19 January 2009, vol 85) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our bankruptcy regime seeks to give creditors their rights whilst, at the
                        same time, give debtors an opportunity to make a fresh start
                        in their financial matters. </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The non-punitive rationale behind the
                    prohibition as observed in the English and Australian positions applies equally
                    to s 148 of our Companies Act. This is apparent from the amendments made in
                    1999 to facilitate the ability of undischarged bankrupts to resume directorship
                    or management of businesses. As observed in the Reading of the Bankruptcy
                    (Amendment) Bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                    18 August 1999, vol 70, col 2184 to 2186, per Professor Ho Peng Kee):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...it is important that a bankrupt remains economically productive even
                        during bankruptcy. This will allow the bankrupt to settle his debts earlier
                        and get out of bankruptcy more speedily. It will also allow the bankrupt to
                        continue contributing economically to society during bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presently, a bankrupt cannot act as a company director or engage in the
                        management of a company or business, except with leave of Court. However,
                        very few bankrupts apply to court for permission to do business, deterred by
                        the costs and trouble of having to apply to Court. The Official Assignee, as
                        administrator of a bankruptcy estate, frequently deals with bankrupts and is
                        more knowledgeable of their affairs. He will therefore be able to consider
                        the merits of each case before he grants permission. Allowing the Official
                        Assignee to grant such permission will also make the process cheaper,
                        simpler and more accessible to the bankrupts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In light of the authorities above, it is clear
                    to me that the prohibition on managing a company or business (or being a
                    director of a company) found in s 148(1) of the Companies Act and
                    s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act is premised on protective
                    considerations. The prohibition in these provisions is not intended to be
                    punitive in nature. Accordingly, to mete out the correct sentence, it is
                    critical to bear this statutory objective in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Guidelines</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Given the protective nature of the relevant
                    provisions, the predominant consideration in sentencing offenders for breach of
                    s 148(1) of the Companies Act and s 26(1) of the Business Registration
                    Act is to evaluate the applicability of the deterrent principle with a view to
                    protecting the interests of creditors and the public from harm caused by the
                    bankrupt’s management of the business. As a starting point, if no harm was
                    caused to anyone arising from the offence and there was no dishonest element in
                    the commission of the offence, a fine would generally be
                sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In my view, a custodial sentence would
                    typically be appropriate where one or more of the following aggravating
                    circumstances are present, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     The unlawful continuance of
                        directorship and/or management of the company or business resulting in loss
                        or harm suffered by innocent third parties who dealt with the company or
                        business under the management of the undischarged bankrupt (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     The offence was committed with dishonest
                        intention to cheat or defraud innocent third parties (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_c"></a>(c)     The offender obtained personal gains or was
                        enriched as a result of committing the offences (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_d"></a>(d)     The flagrant or reckless disregard of the
                        prohibition, such as the direct or indirect involvement in the incorporation
                        of companies <em>after</em> the offender has already
                        been made a bankrupt in order to circumvent the prohibition (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>–<a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_e"></a>(e)     The offence was committed in breach of an existing
                        disqualification order made under ss 149, 149A and154 of the Companies Act
                        (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_f"></a>(f)     The offence was committed over a
                        prolonged period of time during which the offender was in <em>active</em> management.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_g"></a>(g)     The offender has antecedents of the same offence or
                        related bankruptcy offences under the Bankruptcy Act, Companies Act and/or
                        the Business Registration Act (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>
                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The above aggravating factors serve as a guide
                    in the exercise of sentencing discretion. They are not intended to be
                    exhaustive. Each case must necessarily be decided on its own facts. Although the
                    lack of any of these aggravating factors <em>may not
                        necessarily</em> preclude the imposition of a custodial sentence, a
                    sentencing judge ought to give due consideration and justification whenever a
                    custodial sentence is imposed in the <em>absence</em> of
                    recognised aggravating factors. I will elaborate on the aggravating factors. In
                    the meantime, I should add that it is certainly incorrect to approach the
                    question by examining whether there are exceptional circumstances to warrant the
                    imposition of a <em>non-custodial</em> sentence as observed
                    by the DJ at [33] of her grounds of decision (“the GD”). In my
                    view, it should be the other way round. As I have explained in <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above, in the absence of loss or harm to
                    third parties or dishonesty (which are both aggravating factors), a fine is
                    typically the appropriate sentence. Accordingly, the court should instead
                    establish whether there are circumstances to warrant the imposition of a
                    custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Consistent with the protective rationale of
                    the prohibition, the law will take a serious view towards offenders who, as a
                    result of the continued directorship or management of businesses, caused
                    innocent third parties who deal with such businesses to suffer losses. A
                    custodial sentence would be imposed in these situations to satisfy the
                    requirements of specific and general deterrence. In <em>Lim Hua
                        Tong</em>, a fine of $5,000 was imposed for the conviction of one
                    charge under s 148(1) of the Companies Act. The judge placed emphasis on
                    the fact that no harm was caused to anyone (at [22]–[23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...there was nothing here that called for the imposition of a sentence of
                        imprisonment. There was no harm caused to any one apparently, as there was
                        no mention of this in the [Statement of Facts]...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...The range of fines for such a first [time] offender, who does not cause
                        harm is generally between $2,000 to $6,000 or so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     A fine is generally inappropriate where the
                    offender has obtained personal gains or was enriched as a result of committing
                    the offences. In such situations, a fine will generally not be sufficient to
                    serve as a deterrent as it may only disgorge some of the profits (given that the
                    maximum fine is only $10,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It has been accepted that the offender’s
                        <em>reckless</em> or <em>flagrant</em> disregard of the prohibition under s 148(1) of the
                    Companies Act, or s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act is an
                    aggravating factor: see <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em> at [15],
                        <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em> and <em>Sundranpillai Theivendra</em>n. However, the DJ in the court below
                    took a questionable position on what constitutes “reckless” or
                    “flagrant” disregard. She decided that one of the reasons which
                    warranted a custodial sentence was because the appellant had been informed by
                    the OA that she was prohibited from managing a business, and by doing so despite
                    having been informed, the appellant had “blatantly flouted” the
                    disqualification (see [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...this was not a case where the accused was ignorant of the fact that she
                        could not manage a business or company. <b><em>She was briefed,
                            like any other undischarged bankrupts</em></b>, by the Official
                        Assignee that she should not concern herself in the management of a business
                        or company...In this case, it was plain that the accused had <em>blatantly flouted</em> the disqualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold and in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In support of the DJ’s observations
                    above, the Prosecution argued the following (at [35] of the DPP’s
                    submissions):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While it is true that the [a]ppellant managed NSS and NCPL before she was
                        made a bankrupt[,] that <em>ipso facto</em> is not a
                        distinguishing factor from the case precedents as the fact remains that she
                        continued to run NSS and NCPL after she was made a bankrupt and thereafter
                        managed Kaseve Lite N Comm and Kaseve Lighting Pte Ltd in <em>flagrant disregard</em> of the law that prohibited her from doing
                        so...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the same vein, the court in <em>Ng Chuan Seng</em> at [10]–[12] observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    This was not a case <em>where the
                                accused was ignorant of the fact that he could not manage a
                                business. He had been briefed just like any other bankrupt that he
                                should not concern himself in the management of a
                                business</em>. However, he sought to justify his acts by
                            claiming that it was a family business and he had his wife’s
                            sanction...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    ...it is plain that the accused has quite blatantly
                            defied the disqualification order on him...His deliberate disregard of
                            the law continued for a considerable period of time</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In so far as the above views stand for the
                    proposition that an offender who committed the offence despite having been
                    briefed by the OA of the prohibition against management (or directorship) should
                    be punished with a custodial sentence, as they have “blatantly”
                    disregarded the prohibition, I would disagree. As observed by the DJ herself,
                    the offender, <em>like any other undischarged
                        bankrupts</em>, was briefed by the OA of the prohibitions. This means
                    that apart from the rare case where the undischarged bankrupt was <em>not briefed</em> by the OA (perhaps due to its hypothetical
                    rare lapse, if any or at all), all offenders would <em>inexorably</em> be punished with a custodial sentence. This would
                    render the discretion to impose a fine superfluous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Furthermore, the fact that a person has
                    breached the prohibition simply gives rise to the offence itself. As a matter of
                    jurisprudential logic, it is a self-evident sentencing principle that the very
                    fact which creates the offence cannot <em>in and of
                        itself</em> be an aggravating factor. This is different from taking
                    into account the <em>manner</em> in which the offence was
                    committed which, in appropriate circumstances, can amount to an aggravating
                    factor. However, the <em>very act</em> of committing an
                    offence cannot at the same time be an aggravating factor. Otherwise, the
                    sentencing court would be inclined to impose a <em>heavy</em> sentence for <em>all</em> instances
                    when such an offence is <em>committed</em>. If left
                    unchecked, this would lead to an inadvertent and illegitimate judicial
                    legislating of a “minimum sentence” over and above the statutorily
                    prescribed minimum sentence. As such, I emphasise that whether a custodial
                    sentence is appropriate in situations where the offender has been briefed by the
                    OA depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The circumstances that give rise to flagrant
                    or reckless disregard of the prohibition can vary across a broad spectrum of
                    factual matrix. An example is when the offender commits multiple bankruptcy
                    offences that complements his illegal management of the business, such as the
                    case in <em>Heng Boon Tong</em>, where the offender was
                    sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for managing a business without
                    leave under s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act, along with three
                    months imprisonment for obtaining credit exceeding $500 without the disclosure
                    of his bankruptcy status, under s 141(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the Bankruptcy Act. Another example of flagrant disregard is the case of
                        <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em>, where the offender <em>incorporated</em> and managed three companies <em>after</em> the accused was already made a bankrupt. The
                    offender had also deliberately used his siblings to be the formal directors on
                    record for the companies in order to evade the prohibition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Other aggravating factors include situations
                    when third parties are cheated or defrauded by the offender (although this may
                    be diluted if there is a conviction and sentence for a separate cheating
                    charge); where the offender had committed the offences whilst under an existing
                    disqualification order under s 154(1) of the Companies Act (such as in the
                    case of <em>Ong Kwang Eng</em>); and where the offender has
                    antecedents of similar bankruptcy offences of sufficient gravity. In these
                    situations, a custodial sentence would usually be appropriate as such offenders
                    show a manifest disregard for the bankruptcy regime, which if left unchecked,
                    has the potential to cause substantial harm to the interests of creditors and
                    the greater public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Before I consider the facts of the present
                    case, it is perhaps appropriate for me to comment on the observation made by
                    Yong CJ in <em>Choong Kian Haw</em>. Although it was not a
                    decision on either s 148(1) of the Companies Act or s 26(1) of the
                    Business Registration Act, the following remark in <em>Choong
                        Kian Haw</em> (at [24]) appeared to have “<em>inspired</em>” the court to impose custodial sentences in two
                    earlier decisions in <em>Heng Boon Tong</em> and <em>Ng Chuan Seng</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The magistrate misread my decision in <em>PP v. Ong Ker
                            Seng</em> [[2001] 3 SLR(R) 134]. In that case, I did not
                        contradict the trite principles that fines may be imposed in appropriate
                        circumstances. However, I stated my view that fines were, in general, not a
                        suitable means of punishment since bankrupts would typically lack the means
                        to pay for the fines themselves. If they had the funds to pay the fines,
                        these monies should clearly be channelled instead to the unpaid creditors.
                        If they lacked the funds and a third party paid for them, the punitive
                        effect of the punishments is diminished. <em>These concerns
                            apply with equal force to the sentencing of bankrupts in
                            general</em>. They are not limited to offences committed under
                            s 141(1)(<em>a</em>) [the offence of obtaining
                        credit without disclosure of bankruptcy status under the Bankruptcy
                        Act].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     This comment is, with respect, mere <em>obiter dicta</em>. Indeed, there was no charge under
                        s 141(1)(<em>a</em>) in <em>Choong
                        Kian Haw</em> in the first place. The question in that case was
                    whether the imposition of fines for three charges of leaving Singapore without
                    the OA’s permission (under s 131(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    of the Bankruptcy Act) was manifestly inadequate. Given the egregious disregard
                    of the law as the offender had committed the offence 44 times over a period of
                    15 months, it was plainly clear that the sentences imposed in <em>Choong Kian Haw</em> were indeed manifestly inadequate. It should
                    also be noted that the above comment was made to clarify an earlier decision
                        (<em>PP v Ong Ker Seng</em> [2001]
                    3 SLR(R) 134). Indeed, the comment has since been analysed and
                    clarified by Lee J in <em>Ganesh s/o M Sinnathamby v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 495:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    The force of the
                            argument, that the imposition of a fine would not be adequate punishment
                            in the case of an undischarged bankrupt, is compelling. However it is
                            not clear how a bankrupt would be able to get his hands on money to pay
                            the fine except in cases where it is paid by family members or friends.
                            Therefore, except where a third party is prepared to pay the fine, an
                            undischarged bankrupt would invariably serve the imprisonment imposed in
                            default of payment of the fine. Subsequent to <em>Choong
                                Kian Haw</em>, the lower courts have tended to impose
                            custodial sentences for such cases. Indeed, this sentencing trend was so
                            prevalent that it was raised in Parliament on 2 March 2007 (see
                                <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                                Report</em> (2 March 2007) vol 82 at cols 2348-2349) by
                            Mr Inderjit Singh, whose comments were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Sir, one particular example of how harsh the regime here is the case
                            of bankrupts who leave Singapore ... Many of these persons get hauled up
                            before the courts and face criminal sanction under the Bankruptcy Act,
                            section 131, where the Act punishes them with either a $10,000 fine or a
                            jail term of two years. But unfortunately, we had a precedent set by the
                            former Chief Justice where, under the case of Public Prosecutor
                                <em>vs</em> [Chung Kian How], he decided that
                            punishment for this offence should be a jail term. And subsequently, the
                            Subordinate Courts are bound by this precedent. I am not a lawyer, but I
                            think they are bound by this precedent set by the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I think the courts should not be playing the role of Parliament and I
                            hope that the Minister can explain this. I suggest that the Minister
                            look at Chapters 7 and 13 and also the harshness of this rule to be
                            reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Notably, the
                            response by the Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee
                            was couched in the following terms (vol 82 at col 2365):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]hy are they jailed? This is a court decision, but let me just say
                            that they are not all jailed because, in fact, the Act allows for a
                            person to be either jailed or fined. So I would say that we should leave
                            it to the court to look at the facts and circumstances of the case
                            because every case is unique - whether he has travelled before, how long
                            he stays away, whether he is a cooperative bankrupt, whether he has
                            other offences hanging over his head. That is why I think we should
                            leave it to the court. My assurance to Mr Singh is that there are cases
                            where the bankrupt is only fined and not jailed. So it is not mandatory
                            jail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    Unfortunately, the foregoing exchange underscores a
                            misconception that the case of <em>Choong Kian
                                Haw</em> has unfairly imposed a sentencing "precedent" that
                            compels the imposition of a custodial sentence on bankrupts who
                            contravene travel restrictions under the Act ([1] <em>supra</em>). This is clearly not the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    To begin with, it should be highlighted that Yong
                            CJ prefaced his guidelines by stating in no uncertain terms that he "did
                            not contradict the trite principles that fines may be imposed in
                            appropriate circumstances" (above at [22]). On appeal, the Prosecution
                            tendered a list of cases in which fines were in fact imposed in cases
                            where the accused had taken a small number of trips out of the
                            jurisdiction. While the number of trips may be an important factor to be
                            considered in determining the appropriate sentence (in so far as it
                            reflects the degree of recalcitrance), it is undoubtedly not the sole
                            factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    On this note, I feel compelled to reiterate that
                            whilst past cases serve as focal guidelines for the sentencing court,
                            these "tariffs" should be applied with due appreciation of the unique
                            facts and circumstances of each individual case (<em>Soong Hee Sin v PP</em> [2001]
                            1 SLR(R) 475  ). It remains the duty of the court to
                            remain apprised of all relevant factors and to seize the "judicial
                            prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender"
                                (<em>Abu Syeed Chowdhury v PP</em> [2002]
                            1 SLR(R) 182 at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I cannot agree more with the above
                    observations. It would require significantly more than mere <em>dicta</em> to create a fetter on a court’s sentencing
                    discretion. To expect any less would be to tread perilously close to an
                    abdication of the responsibility of the sentencing judge in applying his mind
                    and the law to the facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>The
                        Court’s decision</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Turning to the facts of the present case, it
                    is pertinent to first highlight that the Prosecution conceded that no one
                    suffered any loss <em>arising</em> from the
                    appellant’s offences. The appellant’s debt of $105,000 (as loaned
                    from Koh) was incurred <em>before</em> she was adjudged a
                    bankrupt. The sum of $85,088.40 contributed by Koh to finance the purchase of
                    the AVI equipment for onward sale to Fujitec was also incurred <em>before</em> the appellant was adjudged a bankrupt, and was
                    therefore irrelevant to the charges. At the time when the offences were
                    committed, not only did no one suffer any loss, Koh and NSS in fact received
                    some repayments in reduction of the debts owed by the appellant. Koh received
                    the sum of around $21,000 from Fujitec between January and April 2002, and
                    a sum of $350 from the appellant in March 2002, and NSS received the sum of
                    $18,454 from Fujitec on 25 April 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Prosecution argued before me that the
                    appellant had dishonestly used Koh’s monies, through the entities of
                    Kaseve and NSS, to finance the purchase of AVI equipment to supply to Fujitec,
                    and that when Fujitec made payment for the equipment, the monies were
                    dishonestly received by the appellant and NCPL. This submission was apparently
                    accepted by the DJ as can be observed from her GD (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As seen in paragraph 12 herein, Fujitec’s payments were made
                            <b><u>after</u></b> the accused became a bankrupt and
                        she utilised the money for other purposes unrelated to Koh, NSS or Kaseve
                        International...Evidently, the accused was not honest in her dealings with
                        Koh...in view of the excuses she gave Koh...and that she utilized the money
                        for other purposes, I did not believe the mitigation that it was
                        miscommunication and/or inadvertence that Fujitec paid into the incorrect
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There is no factual basis to support either
                    the Prosecution’s submission or the finding by the DJ. To begin with, the
                    reference by the DJ to [12] of her GD to support her finding is clearly
                    erroneous since [12] merely referred to payments received from Fujitec after NSS
                    was formed and not after the appellant’s bankruptcy. Fujitec’s
                    payment of $10,381.37 into NCPL’s bank account on 25 July 2001 was
                    irrelevant to the appellant’s charges as it took place <em>before</em> she was adjudged a bankrupt. Although Fujitec credited
                    the sums of $21,349.84 and $5,814.35 into NCPL’s bank account on
                    21 December 2001 and 25 January 2002 respectively, shortly <em>after</em> she was adjudged a bankrupt, there was nothing in
                    the statement of facts (“SOF”) to indicate that these payments
                    were credited for deliveries of AVI equipment made by NSS, Kaseve, or Koh
                        <em>after</em> her bankruptcy. Given that the payment
                    on 21 December 2001 took place a month after the appellant was adjudged a
                    bankrupt and that NCPL had existing dealings with Fujitec, it cannot be assumed
                    that the payments received by NCPL were not in respect of transactions with
                    Fujitec concluded prior to her bankruptcy. Even if the payments were indeed made
                    for NSS’ deliveries to Fujitec, and NSS was the proper entity to receive
                    the payment, the payment was clearly in respect of the two purchase orders dated
                    19 April 2001 and 10 July 2001<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> which were transacted some
                    time prior to the appellant’s bankruptcy. Further, it was also admitted in
                    the SOF that the goods which were delivered pursuant to these two purchase
                    orders were in turn purchased by Kaseve in March 2001<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    In my view, there was no question of any manipulation. The appellant was simply
                    seeking to fulfil NCPL’s existing obligations to Fujitec through NSS and
                    Kaseve. In any event, even if there was manipulation, it took place <em>before</em> she was adjudged a bankrupt on 23 November 2001
                    and was therefore equally irrelevant to the charges. For completeness, I
                    observed that a cheating charge initially preferred against the appellant (DAC
                    10990 of 2009) for the payments into NCPL’s account was subsequently
                    withdrawn and the appellant was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal in
                    relation to that charge<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. In these
                    circumstances, there cannot be any basis to find that the appellant had, while
                    committing the offences of managing the business of NSS, <em>dishonestly</em> made use of Koh, Kaseve and NSS to finance the
                    supply of the AVI equipment to Fujitec in order to enrich NCPL or
                    herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The DJ also found that the appellant had
                    “deliberately influenced” Koh into registering the sole
                    proprietorships of Kaseve and NSS to enable her to manage them (at [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the appellant’s] involvement was not in passing. She had
                        deliberately influenced Koh into registering sole proprietorships which she
                        then managed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The suggestion from this finding is that the appellant had asked Koh
                    to register Kaseve and NSS in Koh’s name <em>because</em> the appellant knew that she was prohibited from managing
                    these sole-proprietorships. However, it is incontrovertible that both Kaseve and
                    NSS were formed <em>before</em> the appellant was adjudged
                    a bankrupt. The present case is therefore unlike the situation in <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em>, where the offender had requested his
                    siblings to be the directors on record for three companies in order to conceal
                    his involvement in running the operations of the companies. Further, in
                        <em>Yeong Chuan Wor</em>, the companies were
                    incorporated <em>after</em> the offender’s
                    bankruptcy. Finally, the appellant had admitted (and the Prosecution does not
                    dispute this) that the reason why she requested Koh to register Kaseve and NSS
                    was <em>because</em> of NCPL’s financial difficulties
                    in performing its existing contracts with Fujitec (at [36] of SOF):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...NCPL had pre-existing contracts with Fujitec for the supply of
                        intercommunication equipment. However, NCPL was not in a financial position
                        to fulfil its contractual obligations and NCPL risked a potential lawsuit
                        from Fujitec. To avert the situation, the accused admitted to Koh that she
                        had asked him to register KI and subsequently NSS...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Further, the DJ also attached considerable
                    weight to her finding that the offences were committed over a prolonged period
                    of time and consequently decided not to attach weight to the fact that the
                    appellant was a first time offender, (at [31]–[32] of her GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The appellant’s] deliberate disregard of the law continued for a
                        considerable period of more than 4 years...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I further felt that because the offences were committed over a few years,
                        there was little reason to make a concession to the plea that she had no
                        previous conviction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With respect, this finding is flawed. Although
                    the appellant had remained as a director on record of NCPL for a period of
                    almost four years between 18 December 2001 and 4 July 2005, and hence
                    committed the offence under s 148(1) for that period of time, it cannot be
                    said that her “<em>deliberate disregard of the
                        law</em>” continued throughout a period of more than four
                    years. The appellant’s last act of management in relation to NCPL was the
                    withdrawal of a sum of $6,266.52 on 26 January 2002<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.
                    This took place slightly over a month after she was notified of the prohibitions
                    by the OA on 18 December 2001. With regard to the management of NSS, it was
                    clearly stated in the SOF (at [31]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...after the accused was notified of her duties and responsibilities as an
                        undischarged bankrupt on 18 December 2001, the accused continued to
                        operate the business of NSS until the last Purchase Order of Fujitec dated
                        10 April 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is therefore clear that the
                    appellant’s last act of management of NSS took place just slightly less
                    than four months after she was briefed by the OA. Furthermore, there are no
                    facts to suggest that the late discovery of the appellant’s continued
                    directorship of NCPL over a period of almost four years was due to the her
                    attempt to evade detection from the authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The appellant stated in mitigation that due to
                    a variety of personal problems, she was in a fragile state of mind at the time
                    when the OA briefed her on the duties and responsibilities of an undischarged
                    bankrupt and the relevant prohibitions on 18 December 2001. I agree with
                    the DJ that her alleged “fragile state of mind” did not constitute
                    valid mitigation in the circumstances. Nonetheless, I add the general
                    observation that persons adjudged as bankrupt may not fully appreciate the
                    duties and responsibilities of an undischarged bankrupt, and may not
                    sufficiently digest the lengthy list of prohibitions stated in the various
                    information sheets provided by the OA. This merely reinforces my point that
                    there should be a system in place for the OA’s office to effectively
                    liaise with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”)
                    to ensure the timely cessation of directorships held by an undischarged bankrupt
                    immediately or shortly after being pronounced bankrupt. I pause to note that
                    under s 173(6A) of the Companies Act, there is strictly no obligation for
                    the bankrupt person to file the cessation notification since such a person
                        “<em>may</em>” lodge the notification
                    without specifying the time within which it had to be filed. This is to be
                    contrasted with s 173(6) of the Companies Act that expressly stipulates
                    that the company “<em>shall</em>” lodge the
                    notification within one month after the director ceases to be or is disqualified
                    to act as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The above analysis of the facts relevant to
                    the present charges revealed that there are no aggravating factors to warrant
                    the imposition of a custodial sentence. In particular, I attached significance
                    to the fact that no one suffered any loss from the appellant’s offences
                    and that there was no dishonest element either. Further, although the offence of
                    acting as a director of NCPL was committed over almost four years, in truth, her
                    acts of management were limited only to perform the purchase orders that were
                    placed by Fujitec over a relatively short period of time following her briefing
                    by the OA. I have taken into consideration the fact that there are six TIC
                    charges, and that the appellant has no antecedents. For the reasons set out
                    above, I allow the appeal and reduce the sentences to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">DAC 10992 of 2009 – fine of $7,000 (in
                            default 4 weeks’ imprisonment)</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">DAC 10995 of 2009 – fine of $7,000 (in
                            default 4 weeks’ imprisonment)</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The sentence imposed by the court below for DAC 10999 of 2009 which is
                    not the subject of the appeal before me stands as it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Post Script</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     During the hearing of the appeal, I remarked
                    that it was odd for the appellant to have remained on record as a director of
                    NCPL for such a long time despite being made a bankrupt. I directed the
                    Prosecution to file additional submissions to explain the working protocol
                    between ACRA and the OA as regards removal of persons as directors who have been
                    adjudged bankrupt. From the further submissions, the following picture has
                    emerged:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prior to January 2001, the
                        Registry of Companies and Businesses (“RCB”) (now known as
                        ACRA) relied on the company to provide notification under s 173(6) of
                        the Companies Act whenever a person was disqualified from acting as
                        director.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     In January 2001, s 173 of the Companies Act was amended with the
                        insertion of a new subsection 6A to enable the disqualified person to
                        directly report the cessation if he has reasonable cause to believe that the
                        company may not notify the RCB.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     Currently, IPTO would provide a list of persons against
                        whom bankruptcy orders have been made to ACRA on a weekly
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_d"></a>(d)     Checks on
                        the status of a bankrupt are conducted at “<em>critical</em>” junctures in the course of bankruptcy
                        administration such as when a complaint is received against a bankrupt or
                        when the bankrupt is being reviewed for suitability for discharge. Where
                        such checks or searches reveal that the bankrupt has remained a director,
                        IPTO will then send a letter to the bankrupt to remind him or her that it is
                        an offence to act as a director and that steps should be taken to file
                        cessation notification within a stipulated time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_e"></a>(e)     IPTO would refer breaches of
                        s 148 of the Companies Act to the Commercial Affairs Department
                        (“CAD”) for investigation and
                prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is apparent from the description of the
                    existing protocol that the cessation of a person acting as a director is heavily
                    dependent on the initiative of the company or the undischarged bankrupt. As a
                    result, if steps are not taken by either the company or the director to file
                    cessation notification, it is possible that the undischarged bankrupt may remain
                    a director in the company for years following the bankruptcy adjudication.
                    Indeed, this was precisely the case in the present appeal where the appellant
                    remained a director of NCPL for almost four years following her bankruptcy.
                    Although not raised by the Prosecution, I have noted that in addition to the new
                    subsection 6A, subsection 6B was introduced at the same time to empower the
                    Registrar of Companies, on his own initiative, to remove the name of any person
                    from the registry whom he has reason to believe is no longer qualified to act as
                    a director by virtue of s 148 or s 155 of the Companies
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     From the additional submissions filed by the
                    Prosecution, the unsatisfactory state of the existing arrangement presents a
                    more compelling case for review. On 17 April 2003, the RCB issued a summons
                    against the appellant for failing to lodge a change of address in respect of
                    NLPL in 2002, an offence punishable under s 143(1) of the Companies Act. On
                    19 February 2004, the RCB issued another summons against the appellant for
                    failing to hold an Annual General Meeting and for failing to file annual returns
                    in respect of NLPL and NCPL in 2002, offences punishable under s 175(4) and
                    s 197(7) of the Companies Act. In the course of the appellant making
                    representations for the charges to be withdrawn, ACRA found out that she was a
                    bankrupt. On 25 July 2005, the charges against the appellant were formally
                    withdrawn presumably because ACRA was satisfied that given her bankruptcy
                    status, the appellant had in fact ceased to be actively involved in the
                    management of NLPL and NCPL, as the charges were in respect of her failure, in
                    her capacity as an officer of the companies, to hold an annual general meeting
                    and her failure to file annual returns for NLPL and NCPL. Despite the fortuitous
                    discovery of the appellant’s bankruptcy status, ACRA did not take any step
                    to require the appellant to lodge the cessation notification though the
                    Registrar of Companies is empowered to remove her as a director from the
                    registry pursuant to s 173(6B) of the Companies Act. Instead, the discovery
                    of her breaches came up under a different context during IPTO’s review of
                    the appellant’s suitability for discharge from bankruptcy. Thereafter on
                    24 June 2005, IPTO wrote to the appellant to advise her to take steps to
                    resign as a director which she duly did on 4 July 2005. Notwithstanding her
                    compliance with IPTO’s reminder to resign, the appellant was charged for
                    acting as a director on 22 December 2009, almost five years later. There is
                    no suggestion, from the facts provided by the Prosecution, that any letter was
                    sent to the appellant to inform her to cease her directorship in NCPL, between
                    the time when ACRA discovered her bankruptcy status to the time it was
                    discovered by IPTO in June 2005. As I have explained in <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>, the rationale for s 148 of the
                    Companies Act is to safeguard the interest of the unsuspecting public from
                    dealing with companies managed by directors who are undischarged bankrupts. The
                    existing arrangement which depends on the initiative of the company and the
                    undischarged bankrupt may not be adequate to achieve the intended objective of
                    s 148 of the Companies Act. In my view, it is imperative for ACRA or IPTO
                    to take proactive steps to ensure the immediate cessation of directorship(s) by
                    such persons and not leave it to chance to discover the breaches at
                        “<em>critical</em>” junctures in the
                    bankruptcy administration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my opinion, the following measures should
                    be <em>considered</em> for implementation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     Currently, a list of persons
                        adjudged to be bankrupt is <em>already</em> provided by
                        IPTO to ACRA on a weekly basis. From this list, a check on the directorship
                        status of persons adjudged bankrupt should be made by
                    ACRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     The results
                        of such searches should then be submitted to IPTO. I assume these steps
                        could be completed in good time with the benefit of a computerised process
                        and the use of identification numbers of persons adjudged to be a bankrupt.
                        A letter should then be sent by IPTO to these persons to inform them of
                        their obligation to file a notice of cessation in accordance with
                        s 173(6A) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the notice of cessation is not filed within the
                        requisite time, IPTO can consider taking appropriate steps, including
                        sending a further reminder or inviting the Registrar of Companies to remove
                        the person as a director from the registry or adopting the option of
                        referring the matter to the CAD or any other relevant authority for
                        consideration of further action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The rationale and importance of establishing a
                    systemic process such as this is to prevent undischarged bankrupts from
                    unwittingly committing the technical offence of remaining as a director on
                    record of companies, even if these persons had played no role in the management
                    of such companies. Equally, it would serve to ensure that public interest is
                    protected to prevent third parties from dealing with companies in ignorance of
                    the bankrupt status of its directors. The above measures are only <em>suggestions</em> for consideration as ultimately the
                    feasibility of such a system is a matter for ACRA and IPTO to implement. Having
                    said that, it is clear to me that it is not entirely satisfactory for the
                    relevant authorities to find out that an offence has been committed only when
                    the undischarged bankrupt is being reviewed for suitability for discharge. In
                    this case, instead of being <em>discharged</em> from
                    bankruptcy, to add to her woes, the appellant was instead <em>charged</em> and, worse still, faced with the possibility of a
                    custodial sentence. This is indeed an unfortunate and ironic outcome given that
                    “the underlying purpose of [these statutory provisions]... is to
                    rationalise the law of insolvency and in general to enable those involved in
                    business failure <em>to get back on their feet as rapidly as may
                        be consistent with fairness to their
                        creditors</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p>
