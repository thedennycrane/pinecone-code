<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present action, which concerns the estate of
                    the late Lim Tian Siong (“the father”) and the estate of his wife,
                    the late Goh Choon Eng (“the mother”), is a dispute amongst
                    siblings. The first defendant, Lim Boh Chuan (“D1”), was the
                    eldest child of the family and one of the administrators of the father’s
                    estate. The second defendant, Lim Puay Koon (“D2”), was the second
                    child of the family and one of the administrators of the mother’s estate.
                    The plaintiff, Mdm Lim Siew Bee, the youngest sibling, claims to have been
                    deprived of her actual entitlement in both estates by the
                defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff alleges, amongst other things,
                    that the defendants had dishonestly and in breach of trust dealt with assets
                    belonging to their parents’ estates in a manner that diminished the values
                    of both estates thereby benefitting themselves at her expense.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> As her pleadings stand, the plaintiff
                    primarily seeks the remedy of an account of both parents’ estates based on
                    the wrongdoings of the defendants. It is thus necessary for her to make good her
                    plea of dishonesty and breach of trust in order to be entitled to an account
                    grounded on misconduct of the defendants. Likewise, as her pleadings stand, the
                    plaintiff also seeks to surcharge or falsify a set of accounts prepared in
                    relation to the father’s estate that D1 had furnished to her on 11 January
                    2011 (see [64] below). She says, amongst other things, that she is entitled to
                    do so because D1 had breached his fiduciary duty in administering the
                    father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendants deny the allegations. In fact,
                    most of the defendants’ efforts at the trial were directed at refuting the
                    plaintiff’s specific allegations against them. In the alternative, the
                    defendants seek relief under s 63 of the Trustees Act (Cap 337,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 TA”) on the grounds that they acted
                    honestly and reasonably throughout the administration of their parents’
                    estates, and that they ought fairly to be excused for any breach of trust as may
                    be proved against them. Furthermore, as this case concerns events that happened
                    20 years ago, the defendants’ contention in the alternative is that the
                    plaintiff’s claims, if any, are either statute barred or barred by laches
                    and estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In determining whether the plaintiff’s
                    allegations against the defendants are made out, I have to decide not just what
                    was specifically involved in the alleged culpable acts or omissions, but whether
                    they were made out on the evidence. In addition, one of the issues I have to
                    decide is whether D1 was in breach of duty as administrator in not recouping
                    estate duty on a pro-rata basis from donees of <em>inter
                        vivos</em> gifts made within five years of the father’s death.
                    This question is to be determined based on an analysis of the provisions of the
                    Estate Duty Act (Cap 96, 1970 Rev Ed) (“the 1970 EDA”), which was
                    in force at the time of the father’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The family’s circumstances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff and her brothers were brought up
                    in a traditional Chinese household where the father was head of the family and,
                    as sole breadwinner, provided for the financial well-being of the family and
                    education of the children. The mother’s role was to take care of the
                    family and home and, as a housewife, she did not involve herself in the
                    father’s business affairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The father worked in the steel and hardware
                    partnership business founded in 1941 by Lim Hong Choon (the parties’
                    paternal grandfather), Lim Boon Wan and Lim Boon Kee (the parties’
                    paternal granduncles).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In that partnership business,
                    the father worked alongside his uncles and other male members of the extended
                    Lim family. He eventually took over his own father’s role and position in
                    that business as well as other family businesses (together referred to as
                    “the extended family business”). By the time the partnership was
                    converted into a private limited company called Hup Seng Huat Co (Pte) Ltd
                    (“Hup Seng Huat”) in 1973, Lim Boon Wan was the only surviving
                    founding partner. Prior to the father’s demise on 23 August 1983, the
                    father was the Managing Director and a significant shareholder of Hup Seng
                    Huat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The extended Lim family owned, amongst other
                    businesses, several companies. I will only mention those companies that featured
                    in this action. They are (i) Hup Seng Huat, (ii) Eastern Win Metals &amp;
                    Machinery Pte Ltd (“Eastern Win”), and (iii) Thong Seng Metal Pte
                    Ltd (“TSM”). The extended Lim family together with an unrelated
                    family also had interests in a steel hardware company known as Hoe Hup Seng
                    Hardware Company (Private) Ltd (“HHS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Following the father’s death, Lim Boon
                    Wan’s son was appointed the Managing Director of Hup Seng Huat. Almost 10
                    years after the father’s death, Hup Seng Huat was converted into a public
                    limited company and changed its name to “Hup Seng Huat Co Ltd” in
                    January 1994. The latter company was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange Main
                    Board on 4 February 1994. At the time of listing, D1 was the Deputy Managing
                    Director of Hup Seng Huat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Not everyone in the extended Lim family had an
                    equal share in the extended family business. It is clear that only the male
                    members were shareholders and hold directorships in the group of companies that
                    made up the extended family business. This situation was a well-known fact
                    within the extended Lim family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Hence, the
                    pervasive understanding in the family was that the father would pass his
                    interests in the extended family business to the sons (<em>ie</em>, the defendants).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As head of the household, the father made all
                    the important decisions for the family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The father
                    knew of the importance of education and wanted his sons and daughter to be
                        educated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> At the time the father passed away, D1
                    was 24 years old and an undergraduate student at the National University of
                    Singapore. He subsequently graduated with a degree in Estate Management. D2 was
                    23 years old when the father passed away. He left home for his studies overseas
                    in September 1981 at the age of 22. He completed his undergraduate and graduate
                    studies, before obtaining a doctorate in New York. He returned home in late
                    1989.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff acknowledged that the
                    family’s expectation of her as the daughter was to have a “good
                    education, find a good man, get married and have children”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> During the period 1981 to 1986, the
                    plaintiff studied in Hawaii where she obtained her first and graduate degrees
                    before returning to Singapore. The plaintiff was 22 years old when the father
                    passed away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Following the father’s death, D1 took up
                    the role of his father in the family and in the extended family business. He
                    provided for the upkeep of the family home, his mother and siblings. He saw to
                    it that his siblings’ studies in tertiary institutions overseas were not
                    disrupted by their father’s demise. D1’s evidence is that he did his
                    best to maintain the family in which he had become the head after the
                    father’s death. The plaintiff accepted that it was the father’s
                    intention that D1 would take over the father’s role at home and in the
                    extended family business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> According to her, she had every reason
                    to trust D1 seeing that D1 would take up the responsibility of providing for the
                    family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ involvement in the extended family
                business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     During his lifetime, initially the father did
                    not get his sons fully involved in the extended family business. However, in
                    1981 or 1982, he started to introduce D1 to the business by having D1 accompany
                    him to work, attend functions and meetings, including overseas travels to meet
                    business associates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In 1981, the father transferred 2,000 shares
                    in HHS to D1 who was also made a director of HHS. As a director, D1 gave
                    personal guarantees to banks to secure the borrowings of HHS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Further, on 8 June 1981, D1 was appointed a
                    director of Lim Tian Siong Enterprise Pte Ltd (“LTSE”). LTSE was
                    incorporated by the father on 12 May 1978 and, as can be seen below, it
                    functioned as an investment holding company. Two LTSE shares were issued at the
                    time of incorporation: one subscription share was issued to the father
                    (“the Father’s LTSE Share”) and the other was issued to the
                    mother (“the Mother’s LTSE Share”). The two subscribers were
                    the only directors of LTSE. Subsequently, the defendants were allotted shares of
                    $1 each for cash at par: on 9 July 1982 (allotment of one share each) and then
                    on 16 July 1983 (allotment of two shares each). Therefore, on 16 July 1983, the
                    brothers held three shares each and the parents held one share each in LTSE. I
                    should mention that LTSE was eventually struck off as a registered entity in
                    April 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As mentioned in [12] above, following the
                    father’s death, D1 took up the role of his father in the family and in the
                    extended family business. Even till today, the defendants continue to remain
                    involved in the extended family business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Father’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events prior to the father’s demise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The father was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis
                    in the late 1970’s. He died intestate on 23 August 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Between 1981 and 1983, the father did the
                    following things:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_i"></a>(i)     As mentioned in [14], the father
                        transferred his 2,000 shares in HHS to D1 in 1981.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     In January 1983, the father sold two
                        blocks of shares in Eastern Win, namely, 45,000 shares to a third party and
                        35,000 shares to Hup Seng Huat at $1 per share.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     By July 1983, the father sold to LTSE (i)
                        most of the father’s remaining shares in Eastern Win, TSM and Hup Seng
                        Huat, and (ii) all the shares he held in other private and publicly quoted
                        companies. It was in this sense that LTSE was used as an investment holding
                        company for the father’s substantial shareholdings. As a result of the
                        sales enumerated above, LTSE owed the father’s estate
                        $1,521,424.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At this juncture, I should mention again that
                    the defendants were each allotted three LTSE shares at $1 per share and the
                    allotments in 1982 and 1983 respectively were less than five years before the
                    father passed away (see [15] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The father also owned two immoveable
                    properties which he held as joint tenants with the mother: one at Puay Hee
                    Avenue (“the Puay Hee Property”), and one at Tyrwhitt Road
                    (“the Tyrwhitt Property”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the time of his death, the father’s
                    estate held, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                    shares:</p>

                    the surviving joint tenant, became the sole owner of both the Puay Hee Property

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Administration of the father’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     D1 and his mother were the administrator and
                    administratrix respectively of the father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Shortly after the father passed away, D1 and
                    his mother engaged M/s Wee Tin Teck &amp; Co (“WTT”), a firm of
                    solicitors, to act in connection with the administration of the father’s
                    estate. Sometime after 8 July 1987, Ng Lee &amp; Associates, a firm of
                    accountants, was appointed to assist in the valuation of Hup Seng Huat and LTSE
                    for estate duty purposes. Later on Ng Lee &amp; Associates later changed its
                    name to Ng, Lee &amp; Associates DFK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Although the petition for the Letters of
                    Administration was granted in August 1984, the grant of the Letters of
                    Administration was only extracted in September 1991 after estate duty was
                    assessed and paid. All in all, it took approximately seven years to administer
                    the father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 25 March 1991, the Commissioner for Estate
                    Duties (“the Commissioner”) provided his assessment of the estate
                    duty payable on the father’s dutiable estate as returned for estate duty
                    purposes. The schedule of assets for the father’s estate (“the
                    Father’s Schedule of Assets”) used by the Commissioner for estate
                    duty purposes is produced below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The prolonged and meandering correspondences
                    between the Commissioner and WTT revealed that for estate duty the Commissioner
                    considered the father to have sold 599 TSM shares and 4,799 Hup Seng Huat shares
                    to LTSE (see [18(iii)] above) at undervalue. This was because the father sold
                    those shares to LTSE at $100 per share whereas the Commissioner assessed the
                    true value of one TSM share to be $118.71 and one Hup Seng Huat share to be
                    $380.29 (after Commissioner’s discount).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As a result, the “inadequate
                    consideration” for estate duty purposes was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_i"></a>(i)     $11,207.29 (599 x $[118.71-100]) for
                        the TSM shares; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     $1,345,111.71 (4,799 X $[380.29-100]) for the Hup Seng Huat
                            shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I
                        pause here to mention that for estate duty purposes, the “inadequate
                        consideration” was deemed to be an <em>inter
                            vivos</em> gift from the father to LTSE (see item (I)(2)(aa) and
                        (I)(2)(bb) in the Father’s Schedule of Assets at [26] above) on which
                        estate duty was payable. I shall return to this matter later in my judgment
                        when I discuss the law on the estate duty issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The estate duty came up to a total sum of
                    $2,461,893.01 ($1,904,603.62 and interest of $557,289.39). D1 explained that the
                    estate duty was discharged in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_i"></a>(i)     $138,434.30 was paid by
                    D1;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     $110,464.30
                        was paid by D2;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     $1,902,550.59 was paid by LTSE; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     $310,443.82 was paid out of funds from the
                        father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     D1 said that both administrators treated
                    LTSE’s payment of $1,902,550.59 towards estate duty as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_i"></a>(i)     settlement of the debt of
                        $1,521,424.57 owed by LTSE to the father’s estate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                        (see [18(iii)] above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     additional payment of $381,126.02 by LTSE (see [28]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>However, it was more accurate to
                        say that the father’s estate effectively paid a total sum of
                        $1,831,868.39 ($310,443.82 directly plus $1,521,424.57 indirectly <em>via</em> LTSE) and that LTSE effectively paid $381,126.02
                        towards the discharge of estate duty. The sum of $310,443.82 paid directly
                        by the father’s estate came from the cash available in the
                        father’s estate and cash proceeds from the sale of the distributable
                        assets (other than the shares) listed in the Father’s Schedule of
                        Assets at [26] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     After estate duty was paid and the grant of
                    Letters of Administration was extracted, the shares in Eastern Win, Hup Seng
                    Huat and TSM (see [21] above) were transferred to LTSE. According to D1, this
                    was done to partially reimburse LTSE for its payments towards the discharge of
                    estate duty over and above the sum of $1,521,424.57 it owed to the
                    father’s estate (<em>ie</em> $381,126.02). The
                    correctness of D1’s explanation is an issue for determination in this
                    case. I shall return to this point later in my judgment (see [115]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Following the share transfers mentioned in
                    [30] above, the only remaining asset in the father’s estate was the
                    Father’s LTSE Share. Under the law of intestacy, the mother was entitled
                    to a half share in the Father’s LTSE share and the other half share was to
                    be shared equally amongst the three children. In other words, the plaintiff, D1
                    and D2 were entitled to a one-sixth share each in the Father’s LTSE
                    Share.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s allegations in relation to the father’s
                estate </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     At this point, it is useful to briefly mention
                    in broad outline what the plaintiff takes issue with in relation to the
                    administration of the father’s estate:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_i"></a>(i)     First, she says the Father’s
                        Schedule of Assets did not reflect the “true value” of the
                        estate which ought to be $7,500,929.04 and not the stated sum of
                        $4,218,037.03. According to her, part of this discrepancy was due to the
                        non-disclosure of assets including the under valuation of disclosed assets
                        to the Commissioner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Second, she says that estate duty that was paid in
                        respect of the <em>inter vivos</em> gifts should have
                        been borne by the donees instead of the estate and that this diminished the
                        value of the father’s residual estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Third, she says that interest charge was
                        unnecessarily incurred on the estate duty payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Fourth, she says the transfer of her
                        one-sixth interest in the Father’s LTSE share to D2 was obtained
                        fraudulently when she was misled and induced into signing a letter of
                        consent dated 18 March 1992 (“the Letter of Consent”)(see [53]
                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff claims that D1 administered the
                    father’s estate negligently and dishonestly, in breach of trust and in
                    breach of fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The
                    charges against D1 were mainly in the nature of omissions. I also mention here,
                    for the sake of completeness, that it is not the plaintiff’s pleaded case
                    that D2 should be jointly liable with the D1 as an executor <em>de son tort</em> because he had meddled or been involved in the
                    administration of the father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mother’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mother’s Will</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The mother was diagnosed with cancer in
                    January 1989.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On 16 March 1990, prior to the grant of the
                    Letters of Administration of the father’s estate, the mother made her
                    Will. She named the plaintiff and D2 as her executrix and executor respectively.
                    By her Will, the mother made the following bequeaths:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_i"></a>(i)     the Puay Hee Property was bequeathed
                        to the plaintiff with all estate duty payable out of the residuary
                        estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the
                        Tyrwhitt Property was bequeathed to the defendants in equal shares with all
                        estate duty payable out of the residuary estate;</p>

                        her half share in the Father’s LTSE Share were to be given in equal
                        shares to the defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the mother’s jewellery, gold coins and other

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_v"></a>(v)     the mother’s entire credit
                        balance in two joint POSB accounts and one joint Tat Lee Bank account with
                        one of her children, CPF monies and all other residual assets were to be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Even though the mother’s Will dealt with
                    the Mother’s LTSE Share and her half share in the Father’s LTSE
                    Share, the mother subsequently went on to deal with these shares before her
                    demise. I shall describe these events in greater detail under the heading
                    “The transfers of two LTSE shares to the defendants in 1992” (see
                    [52] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Administration of the mother’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The mother died on 26 July 1992.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Following her death, D1 believing that the
                    mother died intestate instructed Messrs Yap &amp; Leong
                    (“Y&amp;L”), a firm of solicitors, to obtain Letters of
                    Administration in respect of the mother’s estate. At the time Y&amp;L were
                    instructed, D1 did not know that the mother had made a Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Subsequently, the Will came to light at a
                    meeting at the offices of Y&amp;L to discuss the mother’s estate matters.
                    At this meeting, the plaintiff produced the mother’s Will. However, the
                    parties agreed amongst themselves to administer the mother’s estate as if
                    she had died intestate. They also agreed that they would not distribute the
                    mother’s assets in accordance with the Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     On 9 January 1993, the plaintiff and D2 filed
                    a petition for the grant of Letters of Administration in the mother’s
                        estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> In the process, the plaintiff and
                    D2 declared to the court that the mother had died intestate (when she did not).
                    This petition was accompanied by an affidavit from the plaintiff and D2
                    affirming that the contents of the petition were to the best of their knowledge
                    and belief in all respects true (when they were not).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In short, the plaintiff and D2 lied to the
                    court. I shall return to this falsehood later on in my judgment (see [145]
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Over the course of the administration of the
                    mother’s estate, Y&amp;L corresponded with the Commissioner on behalf of
                    the plaintiff and D2 as the administratrix and administrator respectively.
                    During this time, the plaintiff and D2 both resided at the Puay Hee
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     By a letter dated 16 November 1992, the
                    Commissioner wrote to Y&amp;L with a number of questions relating to the
                    administration of the father’s estate. By a letter dated 22 March 1993 to
                    the Commissioner, Y&amp;L provided a copy of the Father’s Schedule of
                    Assets which showed that the Commissioner had valued each LTSE share at
                    $337,674.99 for the purposes of calculating the estate duty payable on the
                    father’s estate. A copy of this letter was sent to the plaintiff and D2 at
                    the Puay Hee Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     By a letter dated 6 September 1993, the
                    Commissioner set out his computation of the estate duty payable on the
                    mother’s estate. The computation showed that the Commissioner had valued
                    each LTSE share at a lower figure of $224,185.25 for this purpose. A copy of
                    this letter was sent to the plaintiff and D2 at the Puay Hee
                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On 22 September 1993, Y&amp;L sent the
                    Commissioner an amended estate duty affidavit duly signed by the plaintiff and
                    D2 that adopted this lower value of one LTSE share. On 7 October 1993, the
                    Commissioner provided his assessment of the estate duty payable on the
                    mother’s estate based on the following the schedule of assets (“the
                    Mother’s Schedule of Assets”):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The grant of the Letters of Administration in
                    relation to the mother’s estate was extracted on 16 March 1994 following
                    the payment of the estate duty to the Commissioner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Deed of Family Arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The parties entered into the Deed of Family
                    Arrangement dated 11 April 1994 (“the DFA”) to distribute the
                    assets disclosed in the Mother’s Schedule of Assets. It is not disputed
                    that the DFA neither followed closely the terms of the Will nor intestate
                    succession law. Under the DFA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_i"></a>(i)     the Puay Hee Property was
                        transferred to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the Tyrwhitt Property was transferred to the defendants
                        in equal shares; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the movable assets (item nos 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of the
                        Mother’s Schedule of Assets (see [44] above)) were transferred to the
                        defendants in equal shares “by way of parity of
                        exchange”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It was not disputed that about the time the
                    DFA was entered into the Puay Hee Property was worth much more than the Tyrwhitt
                    Property. For this reason, the rest of the movable assets in the Mother’s
                    Schedule of Assets were transferred to the defendants to “top up”
                    each defendant’s share of the mother’s estate to achieve and give
                    effect to a “parity of exchange”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the course of administration of the
                    mother’s estate as an intestate estate, certain assets that was itemized
                    in the Will - the mother’s jewellery and the two POSB
                    Joint Accounts (which had a total balance of $191,418.20) (see [35(v)] above)
                        - were not disclosed to the Commissioner. Consequently,
                    they were not taken into account for the purposes of assessing estate
                    duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I should point out that before the mother
                    died, her POSB joint account with the plaintiff, POSB joint account with D1 and
                    Tat Lee Bank joint account with D1 were all closed after withdrawals of the
                    account balances. The amounts withdrawn total $435,966.78. The siblings
                    thereafter distributed the withdrawals amongst themselves. Each sibling took
                    $100,000 and the balance sum of $135,965.73 was deposited in a joint account of
                    the defendants for expenses such as the mother’s medical bills and
                    household expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s allegations in relation to the mother's
                estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This is an appropriate juncture to mention
                    what the plaintiff takes issue with in relation to the administration of the
                    mother’s estate. To be clear, it is not her case that she was persuaded to
                    execute the DFA under the undue influence of the defendants and that it should
                    be set aside. Rather, the logic of the plaintiff’s case appears to be as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_i"></a>(i)     She had executed the DFA in the
                        belief that there would be “parity of exchange” in the way the
                        assets of the mother’s estate were divided amongst the
                        siblings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     While there was “parity of exchange” amongst the parties on
                        the face of the DFA, there was in reality no “parity of
                        exchange”. This was because the total amount of assets available for
                        distribution under the mother’s estate was reduced by reason of the
                        following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_ii-p3_a"></a>(a)       D1's breaches of his
                            duties as an administrator of the father’s estate;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_ii-p3_b"></a>(b)       the
                            defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations <em>viz</em> the value of the Father’s LTSE Share and the
                            Mother’s LTSE Share (see the heading “The transfers of two
                            LTSE shares to the defendants in 1992” below).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The plaintiff would have received
                        substantially more assets under the DFA by way of “parity of
                        exchange” but for the wrongdoings of the defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     The plaintiff is not seeking to set aside the DFA.
                        Rather, she is seeking to enforce the DFA by “taking into account the
                        spirit in which the document was entered into, to ensure that the true value
                        of the mother’s estate is [being] divided equally among the Plaintiff
                        and the Defendants”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_v"></a>(v)     Both defendants should therefore “account”
                        for the mother’s estate on the basis that each party would obtain an
                        equal share of the mother’s estate. In other words, the plaintiff
                        wants the defendants to account for the mother’s estate as if the
                        mother had died intestate <em>and</em> her estate
                        included:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_v-p3_a"></a>(a)       assets which would have
                            flowed into the mother’s estate from the father’s estate but
                            for D1’s breaches of his duties as administrator of the
                            father’s estate; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_50-p2_v-p3_b"></a>(b)       the Mother’s LTSE Share and the
                            mother’s half share in the Father’s LTSE
                        Share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff stated in her Closing
                    Submissions that “the DFA must be read with the Letter of Consent and the
                    manner in which the father’s estate was administered.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, D1 had taken on the role of
                    administering the mother’s estate and should be jointly liable with D2 as
                    an executor <em>de son tort</em>. The plaintiff proclaimed
                    the DFA as the defendants’ “last step … to secure the bulk
                    of the residue of their parents’ estate for themselves to the
                    [plaintiff’s] detriment.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The transfers of two LTSE shares to the defendants in 1992</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Two events of significance to this action were
                    the transfers of the Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s LTSE Share
                    to D2 and D1 respectively. With the completion of these transfers, the
                    defendants became the only two shareholders of LTSE and held four LTSE shares
                    each. The significance of the LTSE shares is that LTSE owned shares in Hup Seng
                        Huat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First Transfer of the Father's LTSE Share</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As stated in [31] above, the mother was
                    entitled to half-share in the Father’s LTSE share and the plaintiff, D1
                    and D2 were entitled to one-sixth share each. By the Letter of Consent, the
                    mother, the plaintiff and D1 agreed to transfer their respective interests in
                    the Father’s LTSE Share to D2 free of consideration. The Letter of Consent
                    which was drafted by the company secretarial services of Ng, Lee &amp;
                    Associates read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>

                        hereby consent to transfer our share of entitlements in the one (1) ordinary
                        share of S$1.00 fully paid in Lim Tian Siong Enterprise Pte Ltd registered

                        any consideration with effect from the 18th day of March 1992.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On the same day, the mother, the plaintiff and
                    D1 signed a letter addressed to the directors of LTSE requesting the
                    registration of the Father’s LTSE Share in D2's name (“the Request

                    Request Form read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Directors of [LTSE]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We, the undersigned, being all the lawful beneficiaries of the estate of
                        [the father], deceased who died intestate on the 23rd day of August 1983,

                        now registered in the name of the said deceased. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Accordingly, the Father’s LTSE Share was
                    duly transferred to D2. I shall refer to the Letter of Consent and the Request
                    Form collectively as the “First Transfer Documents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second Transfer of Mother’s LTSE Share</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The second transfer concerned the
                    Mother’s LTSE Share. On 23 June 1992, the mother signed a transfer form
                    (“the Second Transfer Form”) to transfer her one LTSE share
                    registered in her name to D1 for $1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, the
                    Mother’s LTSE Share was duly transferred to D1’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff's allegations in relation to the transfers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is now a convenient juncture to mention
                    what the plaintiff takes issue with in relation to the two transfers described
                    above. The plaintiff's allegations in relation to the transfers are based on
                    fraudulent misrepresentation as to the value of the Father’s LTSE Share
                    and Mother’s LTSE Share. Her pleaded averments are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By their conduct, [D1] and [D2]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) fraudulently misrepresented the true value of the said one share of
                        the estate of [the father] and the one share that belonged to [the mother]
                        in LTSE;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) fraudulently drew up the Letter of Consent on
                            18<sup>th</sup> March 1992 and misrepresented to [the
                        mother] and the Plaintiff the true value of the one share of the estate of
                        [the father];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) [D1] (Administrator) deliberately did not disclose the accounts of the
                        [father’s] estate and [D1] and [D2] fraudulently misrepresented the
                        true value of the one share owned by [the mother] in LTSE and effected the
                        transfer on 23<sup>rd</sup> June 1992 to [D1] deliberately
                        to perpetuate such fraud;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) fraudulently did not disclose the true value of the one share and
                        transferred the 2 said shares (one share in LTSE owned by [the mother] and
                        one share in LTSE owned by the estate of [the father] in which both [the
                        mother] and the Plaintiff had an interest) at the value of $1.00 each to
                        themselves, thereby benefiting themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Apart from the above pleadings, the plaintiff
                    did not plead that D1 was liable for equitable compensation because he had
                    caused her loss by breaching his fiduciary duty as an administrator of the
                    father’s estate. I will be discussing this aspect of the pleaded case in
                    due course (see [138] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There is no dispute that the mother, D1 and
                    the plaintiff signed the First Transfer Documents to transfer their respective
                    entitlements in the Father’s LTSE Share to D2. The plaintiff’s case
                    at the trial is that she and her mother signed the First Transfer Documents
                    having been misled by D2 who told her and the mother that the Father’s
                    LTSE Share was worth $1. The mother was also misled into signing the Second
                    Transfer Form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     According to the plaintiff, she and her mother
                    were misled by the defendants. Had they not been misled, the mother’s
                    estate would also have one and a half LTSE shares available for distribution
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Mother’s LTSE Share and the
                    mother’s half share of the Father’s LTSE Share). Accordingly, the
                    plaintiff would have been entitled to a one-third share of the one and a half
                    LTSE shares under the law of intestacy. I note that despite basing her claim on
                    fraudulent misrepresentation, the plaintiff is not seeking damages against the
                    defendants nor is she seeking to disavow and set aside the First Transfer
                    Documents or the Second Transfer Form. Instead, she seeks to enforce the DFA to
                    acquire the “parity of exchange” agreed upon in the DFA for which
                    she did not receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Circumstances leading to this action </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The China Party Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In 2008, two nationals from the People’s
                    Republic of China commenced proceedings <em>vide</em> Suit
                    No 455 of 2008 against the siblings, alleging to be relatives with a claim to
                    their inheritance under the father's estate (“the China Party
                    Action”). The plaintiff says that the first time she saw documents
                    relating to the father’s estate was in the China Party Action.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Prior to
                    that, neither the mother (as co-administratrix of the father’s estate) nor
                    D1 had provided her with a complete set of accounts concerning the
                    administration of the father’s estate. She maintains that it was also
                    during the China Party Action that she discovered that Hup Seng Huat had grown
                    from strength to strength between 1983 and 1993, and that her one-sixth
                    entitlement in her father's estate turned out to be worth a substantial amount
                    of money. This led to a general lack of trust of her siblings. As she had not
                    received any distribution from the father’s estate, the plaintiff began to
                    wonder whether the defendants had accounted for all the assets in both
                    estates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In light of this, she began asking for an
                    account of the father’s estate. On 12 June 2009, she wrote to D1 seeking a
                    return of all that was due to her under the parents’ estates. D2 was
                    copied in this letter. However, she decided not to take any action against them
                    while the China Party Action was still on-going.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The China Party Action was eventually
                    dismissed in March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accounts of the father’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On 18 October 2010, the plaintiff wrote to D1
                    as a follow up to her 12 June 2009 letter. D2 was again copied in this letter.
                    In order to appease the plaintiff, DFK Singapore Corporate Services Pte Ltd was
                    instructed to prepare a Statement of Account of Administration (“the DFK
                    Accounts”). The plaintiff was sent the DFK Accounts on 11 January 2011.
                    The DFK Accounts showed that there was a deficiency in the father’s estate
                    of $581,085.24 such that there was nothing left in the estate to distribute to
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The current proceedings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The DFK Accounts did not satisfy the
                    plaintiff. She had some serious concerns that the DFK Accounts were incomplete
                    and incorrect. Following unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the plaintiff
                    commenced the present action on 3 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff was certain that had the
                    father’s estate been administered honestly and correctly, there would have
                    been surplus assets remaining in the father’s residual estate for
                    distribution to the plaintiff and her mother. In her pleadings, the plaintiff
                    stated that she was deceived and hence deprived of her actual entitlement in
                    both estates, and that her losses could only be ascertained after the defendants
                    have furnished proper accounts for both estates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> As such, the
                    plaintiff sought, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                        remedies:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_i"></a>(i)     an account of the two estates (the
                        father’s and mother’s) showing the “true values”
                        of the assets of the two estates including the assets that were given or
                        transferred by the father within five years of his death and the names of
                        the donees of such gifts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     liberty to falsify or surcharge the accounts;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     upon taking
                        such accounts, if the defendants are found to be liable, payment to the
                        plaintiff of her due share less what she had already received from the two
                        estates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As can be seen from the entire narrative
                    above, the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust and
                    fraudulent misrepresentation fall into three separate claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_i"></a>(i)     claims against D1 in relation to his
                        administration of the father’s estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     claims against the defendants in relation to
                        the Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s LTSE Share;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     claims
                        against the defendants in relation to the mother’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Expert witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Before proceeding further, I turn briefly to
                    consider the state of the expert evidence since the plaintiff relied almost
                    entirely on her expert’s evidence to prove the “true value”
                    of the assets forming part of the father’s estate and to falsify and
                    surcharge the DFK Accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The plaintiff's expert witness, Mr Kaka Singh,
                    is a partner in RSM Chio Lim LLP. He is not an estate duty or tax planning
                    expert. Instead, he is an auditor with 40 years of experience. Mr Kaka Singh was
                    instructed to carry out a fact finding exercise in relation to the
                    parents’ estates based on documents given by the defendants in the course
                    of discovery. Mr Kaka Singh’s report, amongst other things, sought
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_i"></a>(i)     assess the accuracy of the
                        Father’s Schedule of Assets (on which the DFK Accounts were
                        based);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     ascribe fair values to assets comprised in the father’s estate;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     establish the true residual value of the father’s estate after the
                        payment of expenses such as estate duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In his report, Mr Kaka Singh opined
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_i"></a>(i)     The “true value” of
                        the father’s estate was $7,500,929.04 (as opposed to $4,218,037.03 as
                        stated in the Father’s Schedule of Assets). In arriving at this higher
                        value, Mr Kaka Singh concluded that several of the transfers made by the
                        father prior to his demise were done by way of a sale rather than a
                        gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The
                        “true” residual value of the father’s estate was
                        $4,411,092.64.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The plaintiff’s entitlement to the father’s estate was
                        $735,182.10.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     The mother’s entitlement to the father’s estate was
                        $2,127,393.28 (after deducting her share of estate duty and
                            interest).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Kaka Singh confirmed in cross-examination that his
                        calculations and the numbers in his report were also premised on the donees

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Not surprisingly, the defendants strenuously
                    challenged Mr Kaka Singh’s report. The defendants called Mr Timothy Reid
                    (“Mr Reid”), a director from Ferrier Hodgson Pte Ltd, as their
                    expert witness. Mr Reid's report was being relied upon to critique and comment
                    on the calculations, numbers and conclusions in Mr Kaka Singh’s report.
                    The defendants’ point is that the figures mentioned in [70] above are a
                    fallacy. For instance, the allegation that the plaintiff was entitled to
                    $735,182.10 was based on the father’s estate having a value of
                    $7,500,929.04 when the declared value of the estate in the Father’s
                    Schedule of Assets was actually $4,218,037.03. Furthermore, although the
                    plaintiff relied on the father’s estate having a value of $7,500,929.04,
                    in calculating the requisite estate duty payable, she did not take the figure of
                    $7,500,929.04, but instead used the lower figure of $4,218.037.03 (which was
                    also the actual figure used by the Commissioner).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This “obvious mismatch” was
                    pointed out in Mr Reid’s report.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendants accused Mr Kaka Singh of making
                    sweeping assumptions in his report. Counsel for the defendants, Mr Davinder
                    Singh SC (“Mr Singh SC”), grilled the witness on his report, in
                    particular the basis of his computations and the numbers he had used including
                    his conclusions. He was also cross-examined on his arbitrary basis for treating
                    the disposal of assets by the father as either a gift or sale. One example of
                    this can be seen in the cross-examination of Mr Kaka Singh in respect of his
                    treatment of the 2,000 HHS shares to D1 (referred to in [14] and [18(i)]
                        above):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Where Mr Kaka Singh had in his report
                    classified a particular transaction as a sale, he would attribute the full
                    market value of the asset to the father’s estate. If the transaction had
                    been classified as an <em>inter vivos</em> gift within five
                    years of the father’s death, he would attribute the amount of estate duty
                    payable to the donee and not to the estate. That is not the end of the matter.
                    The defendants pointed out that Mr Kaka Singh in his report had conflated (i)
                    assets that ought to be included in the father’s asset base for the
                    purposes of assessing estate duty with (ii) assets from the father’s
                    estate that were available for the purposes of distribution. By doing so, Mr
                    Kaka Singh inflated the value of the father’s estate in order to shore up
                    the plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Mr Kaka Singh’s report and the
                    defendants’ criticisms will be discussed in detail under the heading
                    “Analysis and Decision” below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis and Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(1) Claims in relation to the father’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff had some
                    serious concerns about the DFK Accounts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>, and relying on Mr Kaka Singh’s
                    report, she argued that the DFK Accounts were incomplete and incorrect for
                    several reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_i"></a>(i)     First, the consideration for the
                        transfer of 2,000 HHS shares to D1 was not accounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Second, the consideration for the
                        allotment of the six shares in LTSE to the defendants was not accounted
                        for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Third,
                        not all the consideration for the transfer of Hup Seng Huat shares to LTSE
                        was accounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Fourth, the father’s investments in a company called
                        International Trust &amp; Finance Co Ltd (“International
                        Finance”) and a Taiwanese company called Brilliant Development Pte
                        Ltd (“Brilliant Development”) were not accounted
                    for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_v"></a>(v)     Fifth, D1 had
                        acted negligently in allowing a large amount of interest to accrue on the
                        estate duty payable and that the pro-rata amount of estate duty that D1
                        should have recouped from donees of <em>inter
                            vivos</em> gifts was not accounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     Sixth, the transfer of one share in
                        (i) Hup Seng Huat (ii) Eastern Win and (iii) TSM to LTSE were not with the
                        consent of the beneficiaries and the consideration was not accounted
                        for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I shall deal with each of these in turn. These
                    omissions, so the argument developed, resulted in a misleading picture of the
                    residual value of the father’s estate in the DFK Accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   2,000 HHS shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Based on Mr Kaka Singh’s report, the
                    plaintiff claims that the 2,000 HHS shares were a transfer from the father to
                    D1, and that the latter owed the father’s estate $1,848,040 for those
                        shares.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> As a result of the failure to
                    account for this $1,848,040, the plaintiff claims that the father’s
                    residual estate was reduced to her detriment. Interestingly, the plaintiff in
                    her Closing Submissions treated the transfer of 2,000 HHS shares as a
                    “gift” and her complaint was that it was not disclosed to the
                        Commissioner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> This contention of a
                    “gift” is not supported by her expert who had not seen documentary
                    evidence of a sale at $1,848,040 (see [72] above). Equally, Mr Kaka Singh
                    accepted in cross-examination that there would not be a sale of shares at
                    $1,848,040 if the purchaser had not agreed to buy at that price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Whilst D1 acknowledged that the HHS shares
                    were not gifts, D1’s evidence is that there was no agreement to buy the
                    HHS shares at $1,848,040 as alleged. It was never the intention of the father to
                    sell his HHS shares for $1,848,040 or for D1 to buy them at that price. At the
                    material time, D1 was only 22 years old. Instead, the transfer of the HHS shares
                    to D1 was part of a “packaged deal” whereby he gave valuable
                    consideration for the shares by taking up his father’s place as a director
                    in HHS and, D1 became a personal guarantor of HHS in lieu of his father (see
                    [14] above). To support his contention, D1 produced some documentary evidence of
                    the personal guarantees given by him after he became a shareholder in HHS. D1
                    explained that, given the passage of time, he could only find some but not all
                    documentary evidence of personal guarantees furnished by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In the absence of any evidence to the
                    contrary, I accept D1’s testimony that he had given valuable consideration
                    for the HHS shares through the provision of personal guarantees. I therefore
                    find and hold that the transfer of the 2,000 HHS shares did not lead to any
                    distributable value in the father’s estate in which D1 had to account to
                    the beneficiaries of the father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   The six LTSE shares allotted to the defendants within five
                years of the father’s death</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The plaintiff claims, relying on Mr Kaka
                    Singh’s report, that the six LTSE shares allotted to the defendants for $1
                    each within five years of the father’s death was not a gift from the
                    father. On that basis, she argues that D1 failed to account for the difference
                    between the fair value of these shares and the actual purchase price of the
                    shares (<em>ie</em>, $1 per share). Therefore, the
                    defendants would have owed the father’s estate $1,311,102.51 (from the
                    sale of six shares)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> and that this amount would have
                    been available for distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Under cross-examination, Mr Kaka Singh
                    deviated from the position taken in his report. He acknowledged that the six
                    LTSE shares were gifts from the father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> But
                    when pressed as to why he did not take out the value of the shares from the list
                    of distributable assets, he claimed that he had made a mistake when he told the
                    court that the six shares were gifts.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Not
                    satisfied with the explanation of a mistake, Mr Singh SC pressed Mr Kaka Singh
                    on the matter:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[B]ut the whole premise of your case, on your
                            evidence on the stand, is that the father effectively made a gift within
                            five years of his death. So if it was a gift, then how is it that you
                            have not taken it out of the distributable assets?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I have taken the view that it was not a

                            the way in which he did so, the father was transferring value to the
                            children.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It is clear from this lengthy
                    cross-examination that Mr Kaka Singh conflated two issues: (i) whether the
                    allotment of LTSE shares should have been considered <em>inter
                        vivos</em> gifts for the purposes of estate duty; and (ii) whether the
                    LTSE shares were allotted for value such that the value would then be available
                    for the purposes of distribution to beneficiaries. The evidence supported
                    D1’s version that the six LTSE shares were allotted to the defendants at
                    par value of $1 per share as part of the father’s plan to involve his sons
                    in the extended family business. The defendants’ expert, Mr Reid,
                    confirmed that from his review of the accounting records of LTSE, in 1982, the
                    company issued two new shares at a par value of $1 per share and the two new
                    shares were subscribed for, and that was a transaction between the company and
                    the two brothers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In his opinion, the subscriber
                    shareholders, being the patriarch and matriarch, arranged and agreed that the
                    company would allow two new shares to be issued at par value. In addition, Mr
                    Kaka Singh accepted that the price at which shares were allotted was a matter
                    for the shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> In contrast, there is no evidence to
                    support the plaintiff’s contention that the father intended the defendants
                    to pay him (or LTSE) the sum of $1,311,102.51 for all the six LTSE shares. I
                    agree with Mr Singh SC that there is no basis for the plaintiff’s
                    contention that there should be an “increase in value” of
                    $1,311,102.51 that ought to have been taken into account by the Commissioner in
                    calculating the estate duty payable by the father’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> I
                    find no evidential basis for the argument that the share allotments were
                    improper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I now turn to the plaintiff’s contention
                    that D1 had failed to disclose the six LTSE shares to the Commissioner. This
                    contention is baseless. The six LTSE shares were disclosed to the Commissioner
                    and he was told by WTT that the six LTSE shares were purchased by the
                    defendants. The audited accounts of LTSE were provided to the Commissioner who
                    accepted that LTSE (and not the father) had allotted six shares to the
                    defendants at par value of $1 per share. In other words, the six shares were not
                    the father’s to dispose of. The Commissioner therefore did not treat the
                    six shares as <em>inter vivos</em> gifts within five years
                    of the father’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It is not disputed that the Commissioner did
                    not levy estate duty for the six LTSE shares. Mr Kaka Singh suggested that the
                    Commissioner had made a mistake by excluding the six LTSE shares as assets of
                    the father that were disposed of within five years of his death. There is no
                    evidential basis for Mr Kaka Singh’s contention. The presumption as to the
                    correctness of the statements in the Commissioner’s certificates stands in
                    the absence of evidence to the contrary (see s 54 of 1970 EDA). In any case,
                    whether the Commissioner was wrong and should have levied additional estate duty
                    on the allotment of these six LTSE shares is completely irrelevant to the issues
                    before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   Inadequate consideration for the sale of Hup Seng Huat
                shares to LTSE</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Kaka Singh pointed out that the
                    Commissioner had computed the “inadequate consideration” for the
                    sale of Hup Seng Huat shares to LTSE (<em>ie</em>,
                    $1,345,111.71 (see item (I)(2)(bb) in the Father’s Schedule of Assets at
                    [26] above) on the basis of 4,799 shares when, in actual fact, a total of 4,949
                        (<em>ie</em> 150 more) shares were sold to LTSE. The
                    plaintiff relies on an LTSE director’s resolution dated 16 July 1983 to
                    show that D1 (who was a director of LTSE at the relevant time) knew that 4,949
                    and not 4,799 Hup Seng Huat shares were purchased by LTSE.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff initially suggested that D1 deliberately under-disclosed to the
                    Commissioner the total number of Hup Seng Huat shares purchased by LTSE to
                    reduce the estate duty payable on “inadequate consideration”. This
                    later morphed into an argument that the under-disclosure would have meant that
                    D1 had failed to recover the full consideration for these extra 150 shares from
                        LTSE.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As for the plaintiff’s initial point,
                    the amount of “inadequate consideration” that should be included
                    in Father’s Schedule of Assets for estate duty purposes is entirely
                    irrelevant for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of distributable assets
                    in the father’s estate. Turning to the latter point, it was clear to me
                    that the under-disclosure of 150 shares was an inadvertent mistake of no
                    consequence for the reason explained in the passage quoted below. The credit
                    balance of $1,521,424.57 with LTSE at the time of the father’s death would
                    have already included the consideration paid for these 150 shares. As the
                    plaintiff’s expert report states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We note that a total of 4,949 shares (4,500 + 449) owned by [the father]
                        in [the Company] were sold to [LTSE] at a consideration of $100 per share at
                        par. The total consideration of $494,900 was credited to [the
                        father’s] current account with [LTSE] on 1 March 1983 … and 16
                        July 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I therefore find that the under-disclosure of
                    the number of Hup Seng Huat shares sold to LTSE did not lead to any
                    distributable value in the father’s estate for which D1 had to account to
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(d)   The 1,000 shares in International Finance and $100,000
                investment in Brilliant Development </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The plaintiff claims that the father had (i)
                    purchased 1,000 shares at $1.70 per share in International Finance, and (ii)
                    made a $100,000 investment in Brilliant Development in 1981. She argued that the
                    shares in International Finance should have been included in the Father’s
                    Schedule of Assets and included as part of the father’s distributable
                        estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> She also asserted that the $100,000
                    investment in Brilliant Development was mischaracterised as “gifts to
                    persons unknown” and that it should not have formed part of the
                    $145,437.27 of unaccounted withdrawals at line item (F) in the Father’s
                    Schedule of Assets (see [26] above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As a result, the plaintiff
                    claimed that the size of the father’s estate was reduced to her detriment
                    since these two investments should have been available for
                distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     D1 disagreed that those investments were
                    available for distribution. According to D1, neither WTT, the mother nor him
                    were able to find out what became of the investments or whether the investments
                    were still held by the father at the time of his death.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> I
                    accept D1’s version of events. The documentary evidence clearly shows that
                    the purchase of the 1,000 shares in International Finance was disclosed to the
                    Commissioner. The fact that they did not appear in the Father’s Schedule
                    of Assets meant that the Commissioner accepted D1’s explanation and was
                    thus satisfied that those shares did not form part of the father’s estate
                    at the time of his death for estate duty purposes. I agree with Mr Singh
                    SC’s submissions that the plaintiff had not shown that the shares in
                    question were available to the defendants or the father held them at the time of
                    his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In relation to the $100,000 investment in
                    Brilliant Development, a Taiwanese company, the documentary evidence shows that
                    WTT, D1 and his mother had attempted to obtain more information about this
                    investment, but were not successful and have notified the Commissioner of the
                    efforts made and outcome.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> In the

                    was nothing improper about accounting for the $100,000 investment as gifts to
                    persons unknown. It therefore did not lead to any distributable value in the
                    father’s estate for which D1 had to account to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Even though she withdrew her complaint at the
                    trial, the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions raised it again by alleging
                    undue delay in the filing of the estate duty forms and further delay in not
                    ensuring that estate duty and interest were paid promptly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In my view, the complaint is
                    without merit. I accepted D1’s evidence that he and his mother were
                    completely dependent on WTT and had followed WTT’s advice in their
                    dealings with the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     At the outset, WTT estimated the estate duty
                    to be in the region of $600,000 on 30 May 1984.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> In fact, on 23
                    August 1984, the Commissioner’s estimate of the estate duty payable on the
                    father’s estate was in the region of $652,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> WTT’s advice to D1 and the mother on 30
                    May 1984 was that pending final assessment they should take steps to pay a
                    substantial amount as deposit of estate duty to reduce the interest that was
                    accruing. This was what D1 and the mother did in the months and years that
                    followed. The first payment of $100,000 to account of estate duty was on 15
                    September 1984.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> There were further periodic payments
                    to account such that by 30 October 1989, D1 had paid to account of estate duty a
                    total sum of $1,022,342.42 to the Commissioner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> Notably, the
                    Commissioner’s computation of the net estate duty payable (excluding
                    interest) sent under cover of the Commissioner’s letter of 16 October 1989
                    was $1,917,753.86.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I pause here to mention that from WTT’s
                    communications, the legal advice given to D1 and his mother on estate duty was
                    for the estate to continue to make periodic advance payments towards estate duty
                    in order to reduce the charge on interest. As D1 maintained, WTT did not advise
                    D1 and his mother that donees of <em>inter vivos</em> gifts
                    were accountable for estate duty purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     From the correspondence, whilst WTT engaged
                    the Commissioner in its valuation of shares in Hup Seng Huat, D1 continued to
                    make periodic payments to account of estate duty right up to 8 October 1990, and
                    by that date, a total amount of $1,749,816.17 had been paid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> The Commissioner’s revised and amended

                    (excluding interest) was finalised on 25 March 1991. By 1 April 1991, the
                    Commissioner sent the Notice of Amended Assessment and Amended Computation of
                    Interest to WTT. By that Notice of Amended Assessment, the net estate duty
                    payable (after taking in all payments to account of estate duty plus interest)
                    was $707,471.45 and interest from 11 October 1990 to 25 March 1991 on
                    $154,767.45 at the rate of 6% per annum was $4,223.79.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> D1 paid the final outstanding amount of estate

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Unfortunately, the periodic payments to
                    account of estate duty (which started in September 1984 and ended in 8 October
                    1990) were insufficient as the actual estate duty assessed by the Commissioner
                    some six years later turned out to be almost three times the original estimate
                    of $652,000. The plaintiff did not deal with this initial under-estimation of
                    estate duty and many periodic advance payments. It would be wrong not to take
                    these matters into consideration. I should mention, at this juncture, a related
                    point made in the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions that effectively
                    contradicts her overall complaints against D1 in the administration of
                    father’s estate – that interest at the rate 12% would not normally
                    be charged unless the Commissioner detected evidence of omission of assets that
                    should have been declared or undue delay in filing the estate duty
                        forms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> I note that the rate of interest
                    charged by the Commissioner was 6% and not 12% (see [95] above). For all the
                    reasons stated, I find the plaintiff’s assertion that D1 had caused a
                    large amount of interest (<em>ie</em>, $557,289.39) to
                    accrue unnecessarily to be misplaced and baseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(ii)   Accountable persons: Donees of <em>inter
                    vivos</em> gifts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I now turn to the plaintiff’s main
                    allegation in relation to estate duty: that D1, as an administrator of the
                    father’s estate, was in breach of his duty because he failed to recoup
                    estate duty paid on behalf of donees of <em>inter
                        vivos</em> gifts made by the father within five years of his death.
                    According to the plaintiff, if D1 had discharged his duty, the father’s
                    estate would have surplus assets available for distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In their submissions on this point, the
                    parties referred to the now-repealed Estate Duty Act (Cap 96, 2005 Rev Ed)
                    (“the 2005 EDA”) instead of the 1970 EDA. This is immaterial in so
                    far as the relevant provisions of the 1970 EDA are the same as the corresponding
                    provisions of the 2005 EDA, save that the section numbers differ. The following
                    provisions of the 1970 EDA applied to the administration of the father’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In my view, the following propositions can be
                    gleaned from the relevant provisions of the 1970 EDA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_i"></a>(i)     The 1970 EDA levied estate duty on
                        property which passed on the father’s death: s 6 of the 1970
                        EDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     A gift
                        that is not <em>bona fide</em> made within five years
                        of the father’s death was property which was deemed to pass on his
                        death: s 7(c) of the 1970 EDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     The persons accountable to the Commissioner for estate
                        duty on property which passed on the death of the father were: (i) the
                        executor (<em>ie</em>, the mother and D1) and (ii)
                        “persons other than the executor”: s 26 of the 1970
                        EDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Section
                        26(3) read with s 26(1) of the 1970 EDA envisages that “persons other
                        than the executor” included persons who obtained a beneficial
                        interest in property which the father was not competent to dispose of at his
                        death but which was deemed to have passed on his death. Such a definition
                        would encompass donees of <em>inter vivos</em> gifts
                        made by the father less than five years before his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_99-p2_v"></a>(v)     The estate duty owed by an
                        “accountable person” such as a donee constitutes a debt due to
                        the Government: s 34 of the 1970 EDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It is clear from the 1970 EDA that estate
                    duty should be borne by the donee of <em>inter vivos</em>
                    gifts made within five years of the donor’s death (see E J Mann, <em>Green’s Death Duties</em> (Butterworths, 6th Ed, 1967)
                    at 581; R K Johns and Roy Greenfield, <em>Dymond’s Death
                        Duties</em> (Oyes Publishing Limited, 15th Ed, 1973) at 912-913)
                        (<em>ie</em>, the “donee rule”). Although
                    the donee is an accountable person, the donee may at any time request the
                    executor to pay on his behalf and the executor may do so if he wishes in
                    exercise of his discretion under s 26(1) of 1970 EDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Section 26(1), as Mr Singh SC contends, is
                    permissive and not mandatory in that the executor “may pay” estate
                    duty “in the case of property not under his control” if the
                    accountable person requests him to make such payment. In other words, the
                    provision gives the executor discretion to decide whether he wants to pay the
                    estate duty on behalf of the donee. The provision does not go on to spell out
                    whether the estate duty paid by the executor becomes a debt recoverable against
                    the donee. Ordinarily, the executor if he chooses to exercise his discretion to
                    pay the estate duty on the donee’s behalf, he may agree to pay on the
                    basis of whatever arrangement he deems appropriate and wishes to impose on the
                    donee. This reading of the provision makes sense since the Commissioner is only
                    concerned with the proper recovery of the estate duty payable; the persons
                    accountable for estate duty may make his own private arrangements with the
                    executor to discharge his obligation to pay such duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In the present case, the executor paid the
                    whole of the estate duty without recovering pro rata estate duty from the
                    donees. A tacit understanding not to seek recovery from donees of <em>inter vivos</em> gifts is not far-fetched seeing that it was,
                    as Mr Singh SC submits, never the father’s intention that the estate duty
                    be paid by his wife and the children to whom he had given <em>inter vivos</em> gifts within five years of his death. At the time of
                    the father’s death, the mother was a housewife, and the children, who had
                    then not completed their tertiary education, were not financially independent.
                    Even the plaintiff herself conceded in cross-examination that the father never
                    intended her, her siblings and her mother to pay estate duty on <em>inter vivos</em> gifts from the father, and that instead, the
                    estate was to pay the estate duty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>
                    In these circumstances, the executor’s payment of the whole of the estate
                    duty must have been on a without recourse basis in the absence of evidence
                    pointing to the contrary. It follows that D1 was properly exercising his
                    discretion under s 26(1) of the 1970 EDA in accordance with the concomitant
                    family setting of the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For the executor to exercise his discretion
                    under s 26(1), the donee has to “request him to make such
                    payment”. In the present case, was the “request”
                    requirement satisfied even though there was no express request made by the
                    donee? Mr Singh SC argues that the requirement becomes nugatory where the
                    executor and the donee are the same person. I agree with counsel for the
                    plaintiff, Mr Chelva Rajah SC (“Mr Rajah SC”) who pointed out that
                    the case of <em>In Re Hole Davies v Witts</em> [1905] 2 Ch
                    384 cited by Mr Singh SC does not stand for the proposition that where the
                    executor was the same person accountable for the property, he will be assumed to
                    have made the payment on an implied request by himself as the accountable person
                    to himself as executor. Nonetheless, I find support for such a principle in
                        <em>Meyrick v Hargreaves</em> [1897] 1 Ch 99. In that
                    case, there was an implied request because the administrator and the beneficiary
                    were the same person. Chitty J held that a “request” may have been
                    impliedly made if the executor and the person accountable for the duty are the
                    same person:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was under his control as trustee of the settlement; for, being
                        settlement. The sub-section provides that in the case of property not under
                        his control, which plainly means under his control as executor of the
                        deceased person, he may pay the estate duty, "If the persons accountable for
                        the duty in respect thereof request him to make such payment." As trustee he
                        was one of those persons, and he did pay the duty. I need hardly say that he
                        paid the duty on the whole rightly; and <em>as for the
                            request, it was the request which he impliedly made to himself in the
                            character of trustee to himself as executor of the
                        deceased</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The principle is clear -
                    there is no need for an express request if the executor or administrator is
                    already apprised of the donee’s intention or situation. Therefore, I find
                    that D1 cannot be faulted for causing the estate to pay the whole estate duty
                    even though no actual request was made; it was plausible to view the payment of
                    the estate duty in exercise of his discretion derived from s 26(1) in light of
                    the family situation described in [102] above and the periodic payments to
                    account of estate duty made on advice of WTT (see [94] above). It would be
                    superfluous to expect D1 and his mother to make a request to D1 and his mother
                    when they together with the plaintiff and D2 were already apprised of the
                    situation that the father never intended the plaintiff, the defendants and his
                    wife to pay estate duty. Equally, the reasoning in [102] above applies to LTSE
                    and the cash gift of $15,000 to Lim Kim Luan, who was the father’s
                    sister.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In contrast to Mr Singh SC’s
                    contention that intention may be implied from the testator’s conduct based
                    on the facts of each case which is relevant to whether the executor’s
                    discretion is properly exercised, Mr Rajah SC submits that the testator’s
                    intention may only be taken into account if it is in writing. In support of his
                    argument, Mr Rajah SC relies on s 29(1) of the 1970 EDA (corresponding provision
                    is 33(1) of the 2005 EDA) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Liability of
                        executor</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29. —(1) In the case of property which does not pass to the executor
                        as such, an amount equal to the proper rateable part of the estate duty may
                        be recovered by the person, who being authorised or required to pay the
                        estate duty in respect of any property has paid such duty, from the person
                        entitled to any sum charged on such property (whether as capital or as an
                        annuity or otherwise) under a disposition <em>not containing
                            any express provision to the contrary</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Rajah SC argues that short of an
                    “express provision to the contrary, the donee cannot
                    “recover” the estate duty from the executor. This line of argument
                    is unsustainable on the present facts. First, s 29(1) does not affect the
                    executor’s discretion to pay the estate duty per se under s 26(1). Second,
                    s 29(1) does not apply to the present facts. The provision relates to the
                    apportionment of estate duty amongst beneficiaries by giving a beneficiary who
                    has made a prior payment of estate duty the right to recover a rateable
                    proportion from other beneficiaries of a particular property. The provision in s
                    26(1) gives the executor discretion to pay, while the provision in s 29(1) gives
                    the beneficiary a right to recover. The two provisions are legally distinct from
                    each other. In other words, the beneficiary’s right to recover under s
                    29(1) has little bearing on the executor’s discretion to pay under s
                    26(1). Indeed, as E J Mann observed, “[e]state duty, where it is a charge
                    on the property, is intended to fall on the beneficiaries according to their
                    respective interests. Under s 14(1) of the Finance Act 1894 a rateable part of
                    such duty, paid by a person authorised to do so, may be recovered by
                    him…” (see E J Mann, <em>Green’s Death
                        Duties</em> (Butterworths, 6th Ed, 1967) at 576). Section 14(1) of the
                    UK Finance Act 1894 which is <em>in pari materia</em> with
                    s 29(1) of the 1970 EDA allows a beneficiary who has paid the estate duty
                    (either in full or in part) to recover a rateable part of it from another person
                    holds or has held a beneficial interest to the property under the disposition.
                    For instance, the English Court of Appeal held in <em>Re Keele
                        Estates (No. 2)</em> [1952] 2 All ER 164 that a rateable proportion of
                    the estate duty was recoverable from persons entitled to portions charged on the
                    settled land under the will of the deceased remainder man. The intended effect
                    of the provision plainly makes sense as it is a mere extension of the principle
                    that the person who has received a benefit must also bear the burden. Be that as
                    it may, I will say no more because this issue did not arise on the present
                    facts. Suffice to say for now, neither the executor nor the estate received any
                    part of the <em>inter vivos</em> gift and therefore s 29(1)
                    is not applicable to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In light of the analysis above, I find that
                    D1 did not breach his duty in paying the estate duty for the donees. For the
                    sake of argument, however, even if the administrator’s payment of estate
                    duty of the <em>inter vivos</em> gift was at the
                    donee’s request and the EDA obliges the former to recoup the payment from
                    the donee, I find that D1’s omission to recoup estate duty was excusable
                    under s 63 of the 1985 TA (see [3] above) on the grounds that he had acted
                    honestly and reasonably throughout the administration of the parents’
                    estates. I should mention that the defendants referred to s 60 of the Trustee
                    Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the 2005 TA”) instead of the 1985 TA
                    which was the version in force at the material time. Section 63 of the 1985 TA
                    is the same as s 60 which is the corresponding provision of the 2005 TA, save
                    that the section number differs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Even though Mr Charles Leong of Y&amp;L
                    testified that he would ordinarily advise a client about the “donee
                    rule”, it does not follow that WTT had given the same advice to D1 and
                    his mother. D1 said that WTT’s advice to him and his mother was to find
                    money to make periodic advance payments to the Commissioner to reduce the charge
                    on interest and that he was not told by WTT that the donees of <em>inter vivos</em> gifts were accountable for estate
                    duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I accept D1’s evidence which is borne
                    out by WTT’s contemporaneous communications with D1 and his mother in
                    which the main thrust on estate duty was for the estate to continue to make
                    periodic advance payments towards estate duty in order to reduce the charge on
                    interest. D1 followed WTT’s advice of 30 May 1984 and the first advance
                    payment of $100,000 was on 15 September 1984. The documentary evidence showed
                    that D1 and his mother consistently made periodic payments to account of estate
                    duty such that a total amount of $1,749,816.17 was paid by 8 October 1990. There
                    was nothing in the contemporaneous communications to suggest that WTT advised D1
                    that donees of <em>inter vivos</em> gifts were accountable
                    for estate duty purpose. It is important to remember that throughout this period
                    of time, the Commissioner had not yet finalised his assessment of estate duty
                    payable, and the focus of WTT and the administrators during this interim period
                    was to heed WTT’s advice by sustaining the periodic payments to account of
                    estate duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The case of <em>Ng Eng Ghee
                        &amp; Others v Mamata Kapildev Dave</em> and Others [2009] 3 SLR(R)
                    109 does not assist the plaintiff. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that a
                    trustee who has sought legal advice on matters that are not within his
                    competence may take the legal advice into account but he is still required to
                    act in good faith, responsibly and reasonably in coming to his own decision. In
                    the present case, the matter of legal advice is contextually relevant to the
                    issue of D1’s bona fides. Certainly, the position is different where WTT
                    did not tell D1 and his mother that donees of <em>inter
                        vivos</em> were persons accountable for estate duty in respect of the
                        <em>inter vivos</em> gifts and that they had a duty to
                    recover estate duty paid on behalf of donees. As such, I do not see how the
                    element of dishonesty is made out in these circumstances where there was no
                    recoupment of payment per se. I find that D1 had, in good faith, relied on the
                    legal advice (or lack thereof) of WTT in carrying out his duty as an
                    administrator, and contrary to the plaintiff’s contention, the
                    non-recovery of estate duty from donees of <em>inter
                        vivos</em> gifts would not be considered dishonest by the standards of
                    ordinary and honest people to render the omission fraudulent. Furthermore, in
                    this regard, D1 ought to be excused for not recouping estate duty on a pro-rata
                    basis from LTSE and other donees under s 63 of 1985 TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In any event, even if, for the sake of
                    argument, s 63 of 1985 TA does not apply, D1’s start-date of his
                    obligation to recoup pro rata estate duty under the donee rule would 19
                    September 1991. In the absence of fraud, any claim against D1 would have been
                    time barred six years later as was the case here seeing that the present action
                    was commenced in January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    “Fraud” in the context of s
                    22(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the LA”),
                    does not mean the common law fraud or deceit but it denotes conduct by the
                    defendant that would be against conscience for him to avail himself of the lapse
                    of time (per Brightman J in <em>Bartlett and Others v Barclays
                        Bank Trust Co Ltd</em> [1980] 1 Ch 515 at 537). Brightman J in his
                    decision appropriately cited Lord Denning MR’s observations in <em>Applegate v Moss</em> [1971] 1 QB 406 at 413:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The section applies whenever the conduct of the defendant or his agent has
                        been such as to hide from the plaintiff the existence of his right of
                        action, in such circumstances that it would be inequitable to allow the
                        defendant to rely on the lapse of time as a bar to the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In this case, D1 was not advised of the
                    “donee rule” and as such there was no cover-up by D1 that the
                    estate paid the pro-rata duty for the donees. As Lord Denning MR puts it in
                        <em>King v Victor Parsons &amp; Co</em> [1973] 1 WLR 29
                    at 34:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the defendant was, however, quite unaware that he was committing a
                        wrong or a breach of contract, it would be different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(f) Transfer of shares by way of partial reimbursement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I now turn to the related issue of the
                    transfer of one share each in Eastern Win, Hup Seng Huat and TSM from the
                    father’s estate to LTSE as a form of partial “reimbursement”
                    (see [30] above). Those shares were valued by the Commissioner as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_i"></a>(i)     one share in Eastern Win at
                        $0.86;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     one
                        share in Hup Seng Huat at $380.29; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     one share in TSM at $118.71 (see [26]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The combined value of those
                        shares was $496.86.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    As for the transfers, D1 has to justify the
                    partial “reimbursement”
                    <em>in specie</em>. It cannot be disputed that after paying
                    funeral expenses and collecting assets, the duty of executors or administrators
                    is to pay the just debts and to satisfy just claims against the estate. In the
                    light of my ruling that the whole of estate duty was to be paid by the estate,
                    the father’s estate did owe LTSE money. D1’s transfer of one share
                    each in Eastern Win, Hup Seng Huat and TSM from the father’s estate to
                    LTSE as a form of partial “reimbursement” was in the circumstances
                    not unwarranted, and I find that D1 was not in breach of duty in the light of my
                    ruling on the “donee rule”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    For the sake of argument, even if D1 was
                    mistaken on this point, again on the basis of the advice (or the lack thereof)
                    which D1 and his mother received from WTT in relation to the issue of estate
                    duty, I am satisfied that D1 had acted honestly and reasonably and ought to be
                    excused under s 63 of 1985 TA for transferring one share each in Eastern Win,
                    Hup Seng Huat and TSM from the father’s estate to LTSE as a form of
                    partial “reimbursement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2) Claims in relation to the LTSE Shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I turn now to the plaintiff’s pleaded
                    case that the defendants made fraudulent misrepresentations to her and the
                    mother which induced both of them to part with their entitlements to the LTSE
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I shall first deal with the
                    plaintiff’s claim that the mother was misled into transferring her
                    interests in LTSE to the defendants. Significantly, the mother’s Will was
                    made in 1990 and by her Will she bequeathed her interests in her LTSE shares to
                    the defendants. That was well before the First Transfer Documents and the Second
                    Transfer Form were signed in 1992. The terms of her Will provided objective and
                    compelling evidence of her independent intention at the material
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I accept D2’s evidence that his mother
                    signed the Will on 16 March 1990. He remembered that a Hokkien interpreter
                    translated the Will to his mother before she signed it. At that time, his mother
                    was fully aware of what was happening and she remained clear minded until her
                    death. As it was the plaintiff who brought the mother to the lawyer’s
                    office to execute the Will, the plaintiff is not challenging the Will and it is
                    not her case that the Will did not reflect the mother’s wishes. It is not
                    disputed that D1 learned about the Will sometime after the mother passed
                    away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The plaintiff case is that there was a
                    misrepresentation of fact by D2 at the time of signing the First Transfer
                    Documents that one LTSE share was worth only $1 (when in fact the Commissioner
                    had assessed the value of one LTSE share to be $337,674.99).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>
                    Significantly, the plaintiff conceded that there was no such similar allegation
                    made against D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    According to the plaintiff, the fraudulent
                    misrepresentation of fact by D2 was made both orally and in writing. The written
                    misrepresentation took the form of D2 passing her the Letter of Consent which
                    contained the phrase “transfer our share of entitlements in the one (1)
                    ordinary share of S$1.00 fully paid in Lim Tian Siong Enterprise Pte
                    Ltd”. The oral misrepresentation took the form of D2 repeating words of a
                    similar effect to the plaintiff. She asserted that (i) the representations were
                    false; (ii) she had relied on the representations; and (iii) had it not been for
                    D2’s fraud, she would not have transferred her one-sixth entitlement in
                    the Father’s LTSE Share to D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The applicable principles in relation to
                    fraudulent misrepresentation were enunciated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd and Another v Lee Cheow Lee and another</em>
                    [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435. The Court held that there are five elements to proving
                    fraudulent misrepresentation at [13]–[14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    The law as regards fraudulent representation is
                            clear. Since the case of <em>Pasley v Freeman</em>
                            (1789) 3 Term Rep 51, it has been settled that a person can be held
                            liable in tort to another, if he knowingly or recklessly makes a false
                            statement to that other with the intent that it would be acted upon, and
                            that other does act upon it and suffers damage. This came to be known as
                            the tort of deceit. In <em>Derry v Peek</em> (1889)
                            14 App Cas 337 the tort was further developed. It was held that in an
                            action of deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud. This fraud is
                            proved only when it is shown that a false representation has been made
                            knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly, without caring
                            whether it be true or false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    The essentials of this tort have been set out by
                            Lord Maugham in <em>Bradford Building Society v
                                Borders</em> [1941] 2 All ER 205. Basically there are the
                            following essential elements. First, there must be a representation of
                            fact made by words or conduct. Second, the representation must be made
                            with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by
                            a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be
                            proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it
                            must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. Fifth,
                            the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must
                            be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief
                            that it is true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The plaintiff sought to argue that having
                    regard to the circumstances in which the Letter of Consent was signed and her
                    lack of understanding of the technical meaning of the phrase “$1.00 fully
                    paid”, she had reasonably understood D2’s representation to mean
                    that the share was only worth $1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The phrase “$1.00 fully paid”
                    which was written in the Letter of Consent and allegedly communicated to her
                    orally was literally true – the par value of each LTSE share was $1. It
                    was true that $1 par value did not reflect and was not the true value of the
                    LTSE Share but nothing in the Letter of Consent suggested that it was only worth
                    $1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    D2’s testimony was more credible than
                    the plaintiff’s version. D2 said that he never told the plaintiff that the
                    Father’s LTSE Share was worth $1. He had made no reference to $1, and that
                    he acted honestly at all material times. He further testified that D1, the
                    plaintiff and his mother were aware of what was stated in the Letter of Consent,
                        <em>ie</em> the par value of the Father’s LTSE
                    Share and that the Letter of Consent expressly stated that the transfer was free
                    of any consideration. Furthermore, D1’s payment of $1 for the
                    Mother’s LTSE share was a nominal sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    D2 also testified that the transfer of the
                    Mother’s LTSE Share to D1 and the Father’s LTSE Share to D2 by the
                    mother was in keeping with the father’s wishes to pass the business on to
                    his sons. It was for this reason that that the First Transfer Documents and the
                    Second Transfer Form was prepared and signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    He rejected the plaintiff’s claim that
                    she was misled into believing that the value of the Father’s LTSE Share
                    was worth $1. He doubted that the plaintiff who was inquisitive by nature was
                    unaware that the Father’s LTSE Share was worth more than its par value.
                    Besides, it was implausible that the plaintiff who was a graduate in business
                    studies did not understand what par value of a share meant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    While the context in which the words were
                    spoken or written are valid considerations (see <em>The Law of
                        Contract in Singapore</em> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy
                    Publishing, 2012) at 11.018), I was not convinced that this particular context
                    rendered the representation false, nor was there an intention by D2 to mislead
                    her as to the value of the father’s LTSE Share. This was not a case of a
                    misrepresentation against the plaintiff – this was <em>at
                        best</em> a case of a misunderstanding by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    For these reasons, the plaintiff has not
                    made out the five ingredients of the tort (see [122] above). Accordingly, her
                    claim against D2 fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    However, even if D2’s words and
                    conduct amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation, which was not the case, the
                    plaintiff’s case would fail because it is time-barred. As D2 was not an
                    administrator of the father’s estate, any claim against D2 for fraudulent
                    misrepresentation would have been susceptible to the statutory time bar in s
                    6(1)(a) read with s 29 of the LA:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In relation to the phrase “could with
                    reasonable diligence have discovered it” in s 29 of the LA, reference can
                    be made to English case law on s 32 of the Limitation Act 1980 (UK) (the English
                    equivalent to s 29 the LA). In <em>Paragon Finance plc v D B
                        Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm)</em> [1999] 1 All ER 400 (“<em>Paragon Finance</em>”), Millett LJ held that the
                    question is not whether the plaintiff should have discovered the fraud sooner;
                    but whether she could with reasonable diligence have done so (<em>Paragon Finance</em> at 418). The burden of proof is on her to
                    establish that she could not have discovered the fraud without exceptional
                    measures which she could not reasonably have been expected to
                take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    What measures the plaintiff is reasonably
                    expected to take is very much dependent on the context of the case (see for
                    example <em>Peco Arts Inc v Hazlitt Gallery Ltd</em> [1983]
                    3 All ER 193; <em>Paragon Finance</em>). In light of the
                    fact that the plaintiff was a co-administratrix of the mother’s estate,
                    and amongst other things she had signed the estate duty affidavit where the
                    Mother’s LTSE Share was valued as $224,185.25 by the Commissioner, in my
                    view, the plaintiff would be expected to take the same measures that an ordinary
                    prudent person would take in the management of his own affairs. This is
                    consistent with the common law standard of care expected of an administrator in
                    the management of the affairs of an estate (see <em>Re Lucking's
                        Will Trusts</em> [1967] 3 All ER 726 at 733), which to some extent,
                    has been codified in the statutory duty of care under the 1985 TA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    D2 testified that the plaintiff as
                    co-administratrix of the mother’s estate was fully aware of matters
                    relating to the administration of the mother’s estate as he would discuss
                    from time to time such matters with the plaintiff before giving instructions to
                        Y&amp;L.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff, at that time, did not voiced
                    any objections. D2 rejected the plaintiff’s assertion that she was
                    co-administratrix in name only and that it was not true that she played no
                    active role in the matter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In the course of ascertaining the value of
                    the mother’s estate for estate duty purposes, copies of the estate duty
                    affidavit and the Father’s Schedule of Assets were made available to D2
                    and the plaintiff. Y&amp;L wrote to the Commissioner of Estate Duty on 4 June
                    1993 stating that the mother did not hold any shares in LTSE at the date of
                    death and that she had sold her share on 23 June 1992 for $1. On 23 June 1993,
                    the Commissioner enquired who bought the Mother’s LTSE Share and what had
                    happened to the Father’s LTSE Share. Y&amp;L replied on 4 August 1993
                    stating that the former was purchased by D1 for $1 and the latter was
                    transferred to D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    D2 maintained that the plaintiff would have
                    known of the Commissioner’s valuation of the one share in LTSE at the time
                    of the mother’s death from the Commissioner letter dated 6 September 1993
                    that was copied to him and the plaintiff under L&amp;Y’s cover letter
                    dated 9 September 1993. The Commissioner valued the mother’s one share in
                    LTSE at $224,185.25 and her half share derived from the father’s estate
                    was fixed at $112,092.63.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    For these reasons, the defendants rejected
                    the plaintiff’s contention that she was not aware of the value of the
                    Father’s LTSE Share until the China Party Action. In addition, the
                    plaintiff confirmed at the trial that she received the listing prospectus of Hup
                    Seng Huat although her pleaded case was that she never received the prospectus.
                    The relevance of the prospectus is that it contained, amongst other things,
                    financial information relating to Hup Seng Huat, Eastern Win, TSM, LTSE’s
                    shareholding in Hup Seng Huat and the defendants’ shareholding in HHS as
                    at 22 January 1994. It is clear from the prospectus that LTSE was worth a
                    substantial amount. The defendants submitted that the plaintiff could have
                    ascertained the value of the LTSE shares if she had read the prospectus. Mr
                    Singh SC submitted that the fact remains that she chose not to read the
                    prospectus; it was irrelevant that she found prospectus too boring to
                    read.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    If the plaintiff had taken the same measures
                    as a prudent person would have in the management of his or her own affairs, she
                    would have discovered the purported misrepresentation since there was no active
                    concealment of the value of an LTSE share by the defendants. In fact, as
                    mentioned, there were several documents which she came across or ought to have
                    come across (had she exercised diligence) in the administration of the
                    mother’s estate which showed that the value of the LTSE shares in question
                    were well above $1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    As mentioned above at [58], it was not the
                    plaintiff’s pleaded case that, apart from any fraudulent
                    misrepresentation, D1 fraudulently breached his duties as an administrator by
                    failing to make disclosure of the value of the plaintiff’s entitlement to
                    her before she signed the First Transfer Documents. However, Mr Rajah SC
                    introduced this in at a late stage in the plaintiff’s Closing
                        Submissions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the defendants] contend that the Letter of Consent was not misleading
                        because that document was never intended to set out the true value of 1 LTSE
                        share. However, that submission misunderstands the Plaintiff’s case,
                        which is that <em>at no time</em> did the Defendants
                        ever inform her of the true value of the 1 LTSE share. They could have
                        stated that value in the Letter of Consent, or they could have informed her
                        before or at the time she signed the Letter of Consent. The Defendants did
                        not do so because it was clearly in their interest to keep the Plaintiff in
                        the dark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Furthermore, as trustees of her father’s estate, they had a duty to
                        ensure that if any beneficiary was transferring any interest under the
                        estate to either of them, the beneficiaries should be made aware of the true
                        value of the interest and be compensated in such amount. This the Defendants
                        failed to do, although the Defendants both knew that the 1 LSTE share had
                        been valued for estate duty purposes alone at more than $200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    This argument is not the case pleaded, and
                    is tantamount to a last attempt to augment a gap in the pleadings in Closing

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    In any event, the plaintiff’s
                    submissions appear to run into two difficulties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_i"></a>(i)     First, the First Transfer Documents
                        were drafted and premised upon the plaintiff, the mother and D1 having
                        already received their respective entitlements in the Father’s LTSE
                        Share. It is thus questionable whether any fiduciary duty would arise in
                        such a situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Second, even if D1 did owe a fiduciary duty of disclosure to the
                        plaintiff and this fiduciary duty was breached, it is hard to see how
                        D1’s silence was conduct that was dishonest by the standards of
                        ordinary and reasonable people so that the plaintiff could rely on s
                        22(1)(a) of the LA to circumvent the statutory time bar. Crucially, D1 had
                        transferred his own one-sixth entitlement in the Father’s LTSE Share
                        to D2 for no consideration. This is consistent with D1’s testimony
                        that he was, in good faith, carrying out his mother’s instructions to
                        arrange for the Father’s LTSE Share to be transferred to D2. The
                        plaintiff’s claim that D1 deliberately kept silent because he was out
                        to deceive the plaintiff into giving up her one-sixth share is without merit
                        and thus fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3) Claims in relation to the mother’s estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    I now deal with the claims by the plaintiff
                    in relation to the mother’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The plaintiff reminded this court in her
                    Closing Submissions that “the DFA must be read with the Letter of Consent
                    and the manner in which the father’s estate was
                        administered.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> She developed her arguments on how the
                    defendants cheated her of her inheritance from both estates in the following
                    manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_i"></a>(i)     Firstly, D1 “ensured that
                        the father’s estate bore the bulk of the estate duty so that there was
                        no residue left for the Plaintiff.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Secondly, the defendants “arranged for the
                        Letter of Consent to be prepared and procured the Plaintiff’s
                        execution of it. They were aware that the Plaintiff though she was signing
                        away her interest in an almost valueless share… [t]hey knew that in
                        reality she was giving up an interest in very valuable
                            shares.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_142-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Thirdly, the DFA was the final piece of documentation
                        to dispose of the remaining assets in the mother’s estate. The [DFA]
                        was “the last step… to secure the bulk of the residue of their
                        parents’ estate for themselves to the Plaintiff’s
                        detriment.”
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As mentioned in [50(v)] above, the plaintiff now wants the defendants to
                        account for the mother’s estate as if the mother had died
                        intestate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Given the findings that the plaintiff has
                    not made out her case against the defendants in relation to the father’s
                    estate and the transfers of the Father’s LTSE Share and the Mother’s
                    LTSE Share, there is no unaccounted assets due to the mother from the
                    father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    In any event, it is trite that a party
                    seeking equitable relief must come to the Court with “clean
                    hands”. In <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United
                        Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 292, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he
                    then was) held at [225] and [226]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">225    It is true that a
                            plaintiff in equity must approach the court with clean hands
                            but this does not mean he must be blameless in all ways. Firstly, the
                            undesirable behaviour in question must involve more than general
                            depravity. "[I]t must have an immediate and necessary relation to the
                            equity sued for; it must be a depravity in a legal as well as in a moral
                            sense": see <em>Dering v Earl of
                                Winchelsea</em> [1775-1802] All ER Rep 140. This
                            principle was similarly followed in <em>Moody v
                                Cox</em> [1917] 2 Ch 71 where it was held by
                            Warrington LJ at 85:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]n order to prevent a man coming for relief in connection with a
                            transaction so tainted it must be shown that the taint has a necessary
                            and essential relation to the contract which is sued upon, and it is not
                            enough to say in general that the man is not coming
                            with clean hands when the relief he seeks is not based on the
                            contract which was obtained by fraud, but is to have the contract
                            annulled on a ground which exists quite independently of the fact that a
                            bribe has been given and received.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">226    Moreover, the
                            principle has lost some of its vitality over time. The position is set
                            out thus in Halsbury's Laws of Singapore vol 9(2) (LexisNexis,
                            2003) at para 110.016:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The maxim has been relaxed over time and is no longer strictly
                            enforced. The question is whether in all the circumstances it would be a
                            travesty of justice to assist the plaintiff given his blameworthy
                            participation or role in the transaction. The whole circumstances must
                            be taken into account having regard to the relief sought, for the
                            relative blameworthiness only emerges after a complete and exhaustive
                            scrutiny and relief which is less drastic need not be defeated by
                            conduct that is less opprobrious. It has been said that the "the conduct
                            complained of must have an immediate and necessary relation to the
                            equity sued for" and "it must be a depravity in the legal as well as
                            moral sense".</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I find that the plaintiff has not come to
                    this court with clean hands. As stated above at [40], the plaintiff lied to the
                    court when she declared that the mother had died intestate when she knew that
                    this was patently untrue. This untruth had an immediate and necessary relation
                    to the equitable remedy she now seeks. Her dishonest deed was an essential
                    ingredient in her argument that the defendants should account for the
                    mother’s estate as if she had died intestate, rather than in accordance
                    with the Will. Such an argument was premised on a situation which had been
                    created as a direct result of her lying to the court to obtain the grant of
                    Letters of Administration. The plaintiff’s quest for an order that the
                    defendants account for the mother’s estate as if the mother had died
                    intestate serves to perpetuate her lie and this court should not lend its aid to
                    assist the plaintiff. For this reason alone, the plaintiff’s claim in
                    relation to the mother’s estate fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In any event, I am not satisfied that there
                    is any basis for the remedy sought by the plaintiff. Not unlike D1, D2
                    maintained that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Deed was intended to deal fully with all the assets in my
                        mother’s estate which had not already been dealt with previously, and
                        to distribute the assets among the [plaintiff], [D1] and me. The Deed was
                        also intended to resolve all outstanding matters (if any) and compromise any
                        entitlement or claims relating to or arising from both my father’s and
                        my mother’s estates, so as to keep the peace in the family and to
                        avoid a family dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The starting point of the analysis must be
                    the legal significance of the DFA on any claim by the plaintiff against the
                    defendants. The concept of a “family arrangement” was discussed at
                    length in <em>Sheares Betty Hang Kiu v Chow Kwok Chi and
                        others</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 285. V K Rajah J (as he then was) held at
                    [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16 … The term "family arrangement" is in itself a term
                        of art that has a peculiar and particular legal significance. In Halsbury's
                        Laws of England vol 18 (Butterworths, 4th Ed, 1997) at paras 301, 303, 304
                        and 312, it is stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">301. ... A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the
                            same family, intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of
                            the family either by compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by
                            preserving the family property or the peace and security of the family
                            by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is
                            more usual to embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which
                            the term "family arrangement" is applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">303. ... The following arrangements for division of property have been
                            supported as family arrangements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(1) an agreement for the division of family property by way of
                            compromise of a family quarrel or litigation about a disputed or lost
                            will, or even to prevent family friction, where there is no question as
                            to the devolution of the property nor any disputed right, there being
                            some consideration for the arrangement other than love and affection.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">304. ... Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not
                            applicable to dealings between strangers. When deciding the rights of
                            parties under a family arrangement or a claim to upset such an
                            arrangement, the court considers what in the broadest view of the matter
                            is most in the interest of the family, and has regard to considerations
                            which, in dealing with transactions between persons not members of the
                            same family, would not be taken into account…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">312. ... Since the consideration for a family arrangement is partly
                            value and partly love and affection, the pecuniary worth of the
                            consideration is not regarded too closely. The court will not, as a
                            general rule, inquire into the adequacy of the consideration, but there
                            is an equity to set aside a family arrangement where the inadequacy of
                            the consideration is so gross as to lead to the conclusion that the
                            party either did not understand what he was about, or was the victim of
                            some imposition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    A deed of family arrangement compromises any
                    potential claims in relation to the estate of the deceased. This compromise is
                    effective unless the family arrangement is set aside, whether because of undue
                    influence or the dishonest non-disclosure of material facts (see for example,
                        <em>Pek Nam Kee v Peh Lam Kong</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R)
                    750). If the plaintiff wanted to make any claim against D2 as co-administrator
                    (or against D1 as an executor <em>de son tort</em>), she
                    would first have to set aside the DFA. Nowhere in her pleaded case does she seek
                    to do this. In fact, the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions confirms that
                    this is not her intention:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Defendants claim that the reason the Plaintiff has not asked
                        for the Deed to be set aside is because she does not wish to lose the Puay
                        Hee Avenue Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a gross misreading of the plaintiff’s case. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The true reason the Plaintiff has not sought to rewrite
                            the Deed is that she seeks the enforcement of the Deed</em>,
                        taking into account the spirit in which that document was entered into; that
                        is, to ensure that the true value of the mother’s estate is divided
                        equally among the Plaintiff and the Defendants. That could only be the case
                        if the estate duty on gifts from the father had been paid by the
                        beneficiaries of those gifts in accordance with law, if the Plaintiff had
                        been informed of the true value of LTSE (and had not therefore entered into
                        the Letter of Consent) and if the Deed took into account the residue in the
                        mother’s estate on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Accordingly, even if I were to find that she
                    had come to the court with “clean hands”, her claims in relation
                    to the mother’s estate must necessarily fail since she is bound by the
                    Clause 5 of the DFA which includes a release of the administrators from and
                    against all actions proceedings claims and demands in respect of the matters
                    agreed in the DFA. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s contention that the DFA
                    was the last piece of documentation in the brothers’ plan to deprive her
                    of her inheritance in the mother’s estate is not made out in light of my
                    rejection of the plaintiff’s claims in relation to the father’s
                    estate and her additional claim that the mother was defrauded of the
                    Mother’s LTSE Share and her half share in the Father’s LTSE
                    Share.</p>

                    TA in relation to D1 in [107]–[110] above. I have also already commented
                    on time bar in relation to D1 and D2 in [111]–[113], and [130]–[137]
                    above. As for the defence of laches and estoppel, it is not necessary for me to
                    deal with them in the light of the various findings I have made in the
                    defendants’ favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    For the reasons stated, the
                    plaintiff’s claims against the defendants are dismissed in their entirety
                    with costs of the action to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
