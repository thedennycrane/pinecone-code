</div>
</div> The applicant also took the position that, while the making of leave applications for judicial review under O 53 r 1 ROC is <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>, the Government should nevertheless be considered a party to the proceedings. Reliance was placed on the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Hiang Leng Colin and others v Minister for Information and the Arts</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 627 (“<span class="font-italic">Colin Chan</span>”) at [4], where Judith Prakash J (as she then was), cited an excerpt from the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">George John v Goh Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Wah Brothers Filem Sdn Bhd</span> [1988] 1 MLJ 319 (“<span class="font-italic">George John</span>”) at 320 where Lim Beng Choon J stated that “an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application merely means that such an application is permitted to be made by one party in the absence of the other”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In my view, the applicant’s contention that the Government was already a party to civil proceedings was flawed. SUM 3167/2019 could not be considered in a vacuum. It had to be seen in the proper context, namely that it had arisen in relation to the main proceedings, OS 807/2019, in which the applicant has yet to obtain leave to commence judicial review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Under O 53 r 1(2) and O 53 r 1(3) of the ROC, an application for leave for a Mandatory Order, Prohibiting Order or Quashing Order must be made by <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> originating summons and served on the AG’s Chambers. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2017] 2 SLR 672 at [31] and [34], the purpose of this is to allow the AG to ascertain if his participation, as the guardian of public interest, is warranted. At this stage, the AG is merely to be considered a nominal party in the judicial review application, with his appearance being a matter of his discretion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In addition, the decision of <span class="font-italic">Colin Chan</span>, on which the applicant relies, does not stand for the expansive proposition that the Government becomes a party to civil proceedings once an application for leave is filed. Lim J’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">George John</span>, which were affirmed by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">Colin Chan</span>, should be properly understood as serving to reinforce the point that an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application does not bar a person with legitimate grievances from appearing against or in support of the application (see <span class="font-italic">Colin Chan</span> at [4]; <span class="font-italic">George John</span> at 320). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Pertinently, Lim J also proceeded to note that, at hearings for an application for leave to commence judicial review, it is “essential that the Attorney General should be given an opportunity to intervene … if there is good ground for him to do so in the interest of the government in particular and the public in general”. This too, supports the position that the Government, which is represented by the AG, remains a nominal party at the leave stage, and is not yet a party to civil proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 That the Government does not become a party to civil proceedings at the leave stage is further supported by the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Axis Law Corp</span><span class="font-italic"> v Intellectual Property Office of Singapore</span> [2016] 4 SLR 554 at [15]–[18], where Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) took the position, which I respectfully adopt, that the mere service of cause papers on the AG does not suffice to render him a party to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The applicant, however, presented an alternative argument: even if the Government were not a party to proceedings, the court nevertheless had inherent jurisdiction to order the disclosure of documents where necessary to prevent injustice. It was argued that Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was), in <span class="font-italic">UMCI Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 95 (“<span class="font-italic">UMCI</span>”) had ruled that had discovery been unavailable in that case, “he would have exercised inherent jurisdiction to make the necessary orders”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, in reaching his decision, Menon JC did not have any occasion to consider s 34 of the GPA, nor was s 34 raised in arguments given that neither of the parties were government bodies. In <span class="font-italic">UMCI</span> at [12], Menon JC considered whether the court possessed the inherent jurisdiction to make an order for discovery against a non-party. In deciding that the court had the inherent jurisdiction to make an order for discovery against a non-party for certain documentary samples, Menon JC provided some helpful guidance for the court’s exercise of its inherent powers. At [96], Menon JC stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I consider that the court’s inherent jurisdiction may be resorted to, to make orders that are reasonably necessary in order for justice to be done in a case or to prevent any abuse of the process of the court. In particular, this extends to the power to make suitable orders and directions that are reasonably required to prepare the way for a just and proper trial of the issues between the parties and for evidence to be gathered. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, the applicant could not rely on Menon JC’s broad pronouncements on the need to do justice to justify what he sought in the present application. To do so would conveniently gloss over the fact that due regard ought to be given in this case to s 34 of the GPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, as a point of clarification, the applicant’s references to “inherent jurisdiction” in his submissions were actually properly seen as references to “inherent power”. As made clear by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span> <span class="font-italic">Geraldo Mario </span>[2013] 3 SLR 258 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span>”) at [34], ‘the so-called inherent jurisdiction of the court is in fact no more than the exercise by the court of its fund of powers conferred on it by virtue of its institutional role to dispense justice, rather than an inherent “authority” to hear and determine a matter’. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, it would be inappropriate for the court to exercise its inherent powers in the present circumstances. Useful guidance as to the ambit of the court’s inherent powers was provided by Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) at [81] of <span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span><span class="font-italic"> Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span>”): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The parameters of O 92 r 4 are, understandably, not particularly precise. What does appear clear is that if there is an existing rule (whether by way of statute or subsidiary legislation or rule of court) already covering the situation at hand, the courts would generally <span class="font-italic">not</span> invoke its inherent powers under O 92 r 4, save perhaps in the most exceptional circumstances ... [i]t is commonsensical that O 92 r 4 was not intended to allow the courts <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> to devise any procedural remedy they think fit. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Phang J’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Wellmix</span> was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Nalpon Zero</span> at [39]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Given that there are clear limits stipulated in s 34 of the GPA and s 54 of the IA, the court should not exercise its inherent powers to circumvent these legislative provisions by granting the applicant’s request for discovery and leave to serve interrogatories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Following from my determination that the Government, represented by the AG, is not yet a party to the civil proceedings, s 34(1) of the GPA applied to preclude any potential order for discovery. However, taking the applicant’s case at its highest and assuming that I could have been mistaken on this point, I proceeded to consider the applicant’s remaining arguments before addressing the substantive merits of the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether discovery may be allowed in judicial review proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It was common ground between the parties that the process of discovery under O 24 of the ROC is available in judicial review proceedings. I agreed with this proposition, especially upon considering Philip Pillai J’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council </span>[2011] 4 SLR 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span>”) at [4], that the text of O 24 r 1 ROC is “unqualified in its application” to any party to a cause or matter. Order 24 r 1 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to this Rule and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time order any party to a cause or matter (whether begun by writ, originating summons or otherwise) to give discovery by making and serving on any other party a list of the documents which are or have been in his possession, custody or power, and may at the same time or subsequently also order him to make and file an affidavit verifying such a list and to serve a copy thereof on the other party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The scope for discovery in judicial review proceedings, however, is more restricted compared to typical civil proceedings. This stems from the fact that applications for judicial review typically only raise issues of law, rather than issues of fact, which renders the disclosure of documents unnecessary. As eloquently expressed by Lord Bingham in <span class="font-italic">Tweed v Parades Commission for Northern Ireland</span> [2007] 1 AC 650 (“<span class="font-italic">Tweed</span>”) at [2]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But the process of disclosure can be costly, time-consuming, oppressive and unnecessary, and neither in Northern Ireland nor in England and Wales have the general rules governing disclosure been applied to applications for judicial review. <span class="font-italic">Such applications, characteristically, raise an issue of law</span>, the facts being common ground or relevant only to show how the issue arises. So <span class="font-italic">disclosure of documents has usually been regarded as unnecessary and that remains the position</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Lord Bingham’s pronouncement in <span class="font-italic">Tweed</span> was affirmed by Pillai J in <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span> at [7]. Similar pronouncements of the law may be found in <span class="font-italic">Chu </span><span class="font-italic">Woan-Chyi</span> <span class="font-italic">and others v Director of Immigration</span> [2009] 6 HKC 77 (“<span class="font-italic">Chu</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Rekapacific</span><span class="font-italic"> Bhd v Securities Commission</span> <span class="font-italic">and another and other appeals </span>[2005] 2 MLJ 269 (“<span class="font-italic">Rekapacific</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Chu</span>, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal noted at [14(3)] that in judicial review proceedings, in general, “discovery is indeed much more limited than in normal private law litigation”, typically because “the factual issues in any given case are often limited” [emphasis omitted].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Rekapacific</span> at [10]–[11], the Malaysian Court of Appeal emphasised the need for restraint “when dealing with applications for … interlocutory reliefs in the course of an application for judicial review”. Specifically, the Malaysian Court of Appeal affirmed the pronouncement of Lord Scarman in <span class="font-italic">Inland Revenue Commissioners </span><span class="font-italic">v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd</span> [1982] AC 617 at 654, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Upon general principles, discovery should not be ordered unless and until the court is satisfied that the evidence reveals reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a breach of public duty; and it should be limited strictly to documents relevant to the issue which emerges from the affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The applicant, however, sought to draw another arrow from his quiver. In arguing that the approach in judicial review proceedings was not as restrictive as the AG suggested, he emphasised that there had been a number of cases decided in foreign jurisdictions where discovery applications were granted. Reference was made to the aforementioned decision of <span class="font-italic">Chu</span>, as well as <span class="font-italic">Tweed</span>, which had been cited in <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span>.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The applicant’s submissions on this point, however, ignored the fact that both holdings in <span class="font-italic">Chu</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tweed</span> were made in the context of an application at the substantive stage of the proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after leave for judicial review had already been granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 This was an important distinction, as the threshold requirement of leave serves as a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage, in order to minimise wastage of the court’s time and protect public bodies from harassment (see <span class="font-italic">Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 at [23]). The courts in those cases, having already been satisfied that the applicants possessed a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for judicial review, might presumptively have been more willing to grant the said applicants’ discovery applications. Moreover, a key reason behind the foreign courts’ willingness to order discovery after leave for judicial review has been granted lies in the duty of candour on the part of the government, but that duty only arises “once leave has been obtained by an applicant to commence judicial review proceedings. This is a recognition that an applicant must have proper grounds before commencing such proceedings and cannot simply rely on the existence of the duty of candour to ‘fish’ for a case” (see [14(1)] of <span class="font-italic">Chu</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I was thus not convinced by the applicant’s submission that the scope for discovery in judicial review proceedings was not more circumscribed than that in typical civil proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any case, the applicant’s contention raised an additional issue that fell to be dealt with in the next section – the appropriate stage at which a discovery application ought to be brought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage at which discovery applications ought to be brought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It was argued by the AG that discovery applications should only be brought after leave is granted to commence judicial review against the Government. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In contrast, the applicant took the position that discovery was available even before the court grants leave.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I was of the view that the applicant’s first argument was of little merit. The absence of legislation specifically providing for a stage at which a discovery application may be made does not necessarily mean that it may be made at any stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As for the applicant’s second argument, I noted first that in the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span> and <span class="font-italic">AXY</span>, no mention was made of the stage at which an application for discovery in judicial review ought to be made; nor was there any mention of s 34(1) of the GPA or s 54 of the IA, which ought to be considered when dealing with discovery applications against the Government. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span>, Pillai J, before making some observations on the state of discovery applications in the context of judicial review proceedings, had expressly noted at [4] that “[n]either party addressed me on whether discovery is in principle available in these judicial review proceedings”. It thus appears that in <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span>, the parties confined their submissions to the merits of the discovery application before Pillai J. The usefulness of <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span> in this regard was hence limited.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">AXY</span>, Edmund Leow JC directly addressed the question of whether a discovery application ought to be granted at the leave stage. Leow JC decided in the affirmative at [23], reasoning that the disclosure of certain documents was necessary for the court to determine whether the applicants were able to satisfy the requirement of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the Comptroller of Income Tax at the leave stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 With respect, no authority was cited by Leow JC in support of his decision on this point. Given the lack of references to s 34 of the GPA, s 54 of the IA, or any case law on the applicable stage at which a discovery application may be made, it appeared to me that Leow JC did not have the benefit of parties’ submissions on this point. He therefore may not have had a full opportunity to consider the applicability of these provisions, or to refer to any other relevant case authorities against allowing discovery applications at the leave stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I was thus of the view that neither <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span> nor <span class="font-italic">AXY</span> could stand for the proposition that discovery applications could be made at any stage of judicial review proceedings. Instead, I held that an application for discovery would only be properly made after leave had been granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 This accords with the aforementioned rationale of having the leave stage in judicial review proceedings in place to filter out groundless and unmeritorious applications (see above at [44]). It would make little sense if the Government could be subjected to potentially frivolous applications for discovery even before a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case were made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether discovery and interrogatories should be allowed in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Following from my decision that a summons for discovery should only be brought after the leave stage, the applicant’s case necessarily failed. I nevertheless considered whether, on the substantive merits of the applicant’s case, his application for discovery and leave to serve interrogatories ought to be granted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Discovery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Under O 24 r 5 of the ROC, which governs applications for specific discovery, an applicant has to show <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> that (see <span class="font-italic">Susan Lim</span> at [5]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the documents sought were or are in the other party’s possession, custody or power; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the particular documents are relevant; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) discovery is necessary either for disposing fairly of the matter or for saving costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The two points in contention in the present case were those of relevance and necessity, both of which had to be assessed having regard to the parties’ pleaded cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59  As stated earlier at [14], the applicant sought specific discovery of both the 24 September 2018 report and Zamri’s phone number documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The determination of a document’s relevance is done with reference to the parties’ pleadings; where an allegation is not pleaded, seeking discovery of a document to back up such an allegation constitutes fishing (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 465 at [19]). In deciding on the relevance of a particular document, the court must arrive at an informed view as to whether the document in question may reasonably be expected to assist in proving or disproving a fact in issue (see <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2297 v Seasons Park Ltd</span> [2004] SGHC 142 at [14]–[15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The criteria of necessity, on the other hand, is embodied in O 24 r 7 of the ROC, which states that a Court shall refuse to make an order for discovery where “discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I was of the view that the documents that the applicant sought were neither relevant nor necessary. The applicant argued that the production of the 24 September 2018 report was necessary to evaluate “IO Neo’s bare assertion that the information was useless”, and to “determine for which investigation the statement had been recorded under”.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The key problem arising from the applicant’s contention is that the latest time at which an accused may provide information for the purposes of obtaining a certificate of substantive assistance is during the trial itself (see <span class="font-italic">Muhamamd</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Abdullah v PP and another appeal</span> [2017] 1 SLR 427 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdullah</span>”) at [59]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Abdullah</span> had made clear that if the accused “withholds all or some information before and/or during the trial, he cannot fault anybody if the PP decides not to issue the Certificate when the time comes for the trial court to consider the issue of sentence”. The death sentence was passed on the accused by the High Court on 2 May 2017 (see above at [5]), and so any information given afterwards, including the 24 September 2018 report, should not be considered for the purposes of issuing a certificate of substantive assistance. It would hence be clearly unnecessary to disclose the said documents for the purpose of disposing fairly of OS 807/2019; the documents were also irrelevant given that they would not be taken into consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Similarly, Zamri’s phone number documents were plainly irrelevant and unnecessary. It appeared to me that the applicant’s key contention regarding Zamri was that the information that he had provided to the CNB in relation to Zamri’s phone number should have constituted substantial assistance. Given that the reply affidavits filed on behalf of the AG on 3 July 2019 did not challenge Zamri’s evidence that he was indeed using the phone number the applicant claimed,

</div> it is difficult to see the necessity of adducing additional documents just to confirm this fact. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Additionally, even if I were to accept that there was some ambiguity as to whether Zamri was using the phone number the applicant claimed he was using, there is little reason why a call trace report was required when the subscriber’s particulars of mobile number +65XXXXX012 (which was purportedly Zamri’s phone number) alone would have revealed Zamri’s identity. As stated by Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Ba</span><span class="font-italic">yerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and other applications</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39 at [38], the wider the range of documents requested, the more difficult it is for the court to decide that the documents are necessary for disposing fairly of the matter or cause. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interrogatories</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Under O 26 r 1 of the ROC, interrogatories may be served in order to dispose fairly of the cause or matter, or for saving costs. The court has, however, warned that interrogatories should not be used to “raid the cupboards” of opposing parties in order to “see whether they could find anything useful there for their case” (see <span class="font-italic">Wright Norman </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another appeal</span> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 452 at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2019</span> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2019)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 26/4/10, “fishing interrogatories” are not a proper use of the interrogatories procedure. For instance, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Wright Norman and others</span> [1989] 1 SLR(R) 551 at [14], in the context of negligence, a failure to particularise any specific instances of negligence renders an applicant unable to interrogate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the present case, the applicant’s interrogatories, which seek to impugn the clemency process without offering any particulars apart from allegations that the Cabinet <span class="font-italic">may</span> not have taken all relevant considerations into account when advising the President, or that the AG failed to take into account relevant material such as the information that the applicant offered and his family members’ petitions for clemency, amount to mere fishing expeditions. These are wholly speculative and cannot justify the granting of leave for interrogatories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons above, I dismissed the applicant’s application for discovery and leave to serve interrogatories. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 3764/2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Subsequently, the applicant applied for leave to appeal against my decision in SUM 3167/2019. This formed the subject of SUM 3764/2019. To be clear, the application for leave related only to the dismissal of the application for discovery. It was common ground that the applicant could not seek leave to appeal in respect of the dismissal of his application for leave to serve interrogatories, in view of the prohibition in s 34(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) read with paragraph (<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the Fourth Schedule thereto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In arguing that leave to appeal ought to be granted, the applicant raised a total of seven questions, all of which purportedly amounted to questions of general principle decided for the first time and/or questions of importance upon which further argument would be to the public advantage.

The respondent argued, as a preliminary point, that the court should decline to hear the appeal on the ground that there was no live issue to be decided between the parties. The Court of Appeal agreed with the respondent in this regard, holding that the court should not be asked to decide a question of law which was of no interest to the Ministry of Health, but was of interest “only to the four nominated subcontractors who were not parties to this appeal and who were not before this court” (see <span class="font-italic">Joo Yee Construction</span> at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The need for an appellant to possess “a real interest in the outcome” before a court would hear a matter was also affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jong Peng and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Phua Kiah Mai and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1267 at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I agreed with the AG that the seven questions raised by the applicant concerned only conceptual questions of law. These questions did not relate to issues concerning the merits of his discovery application in SUM 3167/2019; they were merely ancillary to the key issue of whether the documents sought were necessary or relevant. A finding by the Court of Appeal on, for instance, whether discovery applications ought to be allowed at the leave stage, would not affect my decision in SUM 3167/2019 that the documents and interrogatories being sought by the applicant were irrelevant and unnecessary. Moreover, the applicant had not specified from the outset in his application for leave to appeal that he was intending to challenge my decision on the substantive merits, as I next address. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the applicant needed to obtain leave to appeal on the merits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The applicant’s response to the AG’s argument on the requirement that there be a live issue before leave to appeal ought to be granted was that “an appeal lies against the order that is the outcome and not the reasons for the order”.

</div>
</div> Reliance was also placed on the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">King Royal Ltd v Lam Kwan Yuk</span> [2005] 3 HKLRD 488 (“<span class="font-italic">Lam</span><span class="font-italic"> Kwan Yuk</span>”), which was, unfortunately only adduced by the applicant on the day of the hearing itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 With respect, I found the applicant’s position to be contrived and unconvincing, as it stemmed from an incorrect reading of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The case concerned an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against an order of costs. The High Court had ordered the defendant, Tang Liang Hong, to pay the costs of the application by the plaintiff, Lee Kuan Yew, to delete certain paragraphs from the plaintiff’s first and third affidavits. At first instance, Lai Kew Chai J had found an abuse of process on the part of the defendant, and on this basis allowed the plaintiff’s application to delete the said paragraphs and awarded costs to the plaintiff. Notably, the defendant had not opposed the plaintiff’s application to delete the paragraphs during the course of the High Court proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 On appeal, counsel for the plaintiff argued that as there was no appeal on the High Court’s substantive order to delete the paragraphs, the Court of Appeal had to assume that there was an abuse of process by the defendant (see <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span> at [23]). The court disagreed that an abuse of court process had to be assumed simply because the substantive order was made on the grounds of an abuse of process against which there was no appeal. It was in this context that the Court of Appeal stated at [24] that an appeal “lies against the order (that is, the outcome) made by the judge, and not the reasons he gives for his decision”. As the defendant could not appeal against Lai J’s reasons (the presence of an abuse of process) when the outcome (the deletion of the paragraphs) was not contested, this meant that “the reasons given by the judge need not necessarily be accepted and therefore [were] binding and no longer open to challenge” (see <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span> at [25]). Thus, the Court of Appeal was conscious that the reasons put forward by Lai J might “later” have an impact on the costs order, and therefore took the view that it was “still open to argue against these reasons to oppose the order of costs” (see <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span> at [25]). It was clear that the applicant had misunderstood the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I also disagreed with the applicant’s contention that there would <span class="font-italic">never</span> be an instance where leave to appeal may be granted when there was a decision on the merits. This was clearly an overstatement. Leave to appeal may be granted in relation to a decision on the merits where, for instance, the trial judge had made a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> error in arriving at his decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I was also of the view that the decision of <span class="font-italic">Lam</span><span class="font-italic"> Kwan Yuk</span> did not assist the applicant. In the course of its decision, the Court of Appeal considered the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jones v </span><span class="font-italic">Biernstein</span> [1900] 1 QB 100. The court stated, at [10] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It does seem that <span class="font-italic">the court would not allow the appellant to argue a point because he had obtained leave to appeal from the Divisional Court on one point only and that point formed the only point in the Divisional Court’s decision</span>. The Court of Appeal confined the appellant to that point. <span class="font-italic">The point which was sought to be raised appears to have been a question of fact</span> and, in those circumstances, it may well be that a different attitude would have been taken because, of course, appeals on questions of fact from the Divisional Court which had heard an appeal from the County Court were governed by different rules from appeals on questions of law. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It appeared to me that the court was making it clear that it would not be permissible for questions of fact to be raised on appeal when leave to appeal on that specific ground had not been granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In the present case, counsel for the applicant had said nothing about the merits or why my reasons (which in any event had not been fully articulated yet at the time of the hearing) for dismissing SUM 3167/2019 were </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">prima facie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> or plainly wrong. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As I had stated in my brief oral remarks in dismissing SUM 3167/2019 on 19 July 2019, I found that the documents sought were neither relevant nor necessary.

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> I did not think it was appropriate to allow him to put in, whether as an afterthought or otherwise, oral arguments on the merits during the hearing. I found this inherently objectionable as it would effectively sanction a “drip feed” strategy and allow an applicant to mount fresh arguments pertaining to the substantive merits only upon being prompted to do so. This was little more than a calculated ambush, bordering in my view on an abuse of process. It was a deliberate and conscious decision on the applicant’s part to craft SUM 3764/2019 as he did, without any reference to my ruling on the merits in SUM 3167/2019. Having chosen this path, he must stand or fall by that decision.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I concluded that leave to appeal should not be granted. The applicant’s approach betrayed his lack of a real interest in the outcome of the appeal. Hence there was no need for me to consider whether the applicant’s seven questions satisfied the criteria in <span class="font-italic">Tang Liang Hong</span>, although I noted that the AG was prepared to concede, should the court be minded to grant leave, that Question 1 may perhaps be considered as involving either a question of general principle decided for the first time, or a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.
