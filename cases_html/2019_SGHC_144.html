In the light of the fact that the Deceased had allegedly hidden her fraud from DS by inflating the plaintiff’s “Survey Charges”, Jabbar would have been well placed to shed light on how the Deceased managed to hide the alleged fraud for so long. This was especially so given that the plaintiff’s profits before tax were reduced by upwards of 90% in some years (see [67] above). Yet, the plaintiff declined to call Jabbar as a witness. The plaintiff’s original explanation for not doing so was that D1 was calling Jabbar as a witness.

</div> If, as DS sought to portray, he was already able to establish that the Deceased had committed the fraud after he had done his own investigations, then there was no reason to wait for the prosecution to be completed. Furthermore, there was not even a letter of demand sent to the Deceased when she was alive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In addition, even if I were to accept DS’s explanation that he was waiting for the prosecution to be completed, this still would not explain why legal proceedings were not commenced in January 2016, when the Deceased was given a DNAQ, but rather only on 8 June 2016, a month after the Deceased had passed away. In my view, this inexplicable delay further undermined DS’s credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 While the plaintiff only called Kathelene and DS as witnesses, D1 called other persons as witnesses. The evidence of D1’s witnesses contradicted the plaintiff’s case that the Deceased was only paid a monthly salary of S$2,500 with occasional commissions between S$500 and S$3,000 (see [31] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 D1 called a total of five witnesses who testified that DS was paying significant sums of money to the Deceased:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sarjit, the brother of the Deceased and the executor of her estate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Uttam Singh s/o Bakhshish Singh (“Uttam”), a childhood friend of DS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Peter John Jalal @ Muhammad Jalal (“Mr Jalal”), a friend of DS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Abid Hussain Mir (“Mr Mir”), a businessman who delivered carpets and furniture to the Deceased’s 26 Bayshore Property; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Raj Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), an employee of D2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I will first deal with the evidence of Sarjit, Uttam and Mr Jalal. All three of them testified that they were aware that DS was paying significant sums to the Deceased and that he was doing so because he was having marital problems with his wife, Kathelene. DS did this because he was worried that Kathelene would file for divorce and wanted to keep her from being able to access his assets. In return for paying these moneys to the Deceased, DS would have a say as to how they were to be utilised.

In the case of Uttam, his testimony on the stand at times contradicted his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) and led me to conclude that he was not a witness deserving of credit. For example, during cross-examination, he stated that he did not know of any arrangement between DS and the Deceased whereby the former could direct the latter to do certain acts with the moneys paid to her from the plaintiff, such as make loans to others.

The plaintiff thus failed to make out its claim against D1. It was irrelevant whether in fact the arrangement between the Deceased and DS was that the Deceased was to hold the money on trust for DS as no such arrangement had been pleaded by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Having already determined that the plaintiff had not made out its claim against D1, the question of whether the plaintiff’s claim was time-barred was an academic one. I briefly consider the issue below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As mentioned at [43] above, the plaintiff provided two alternative reasons why its claim was not time-barred: (a) that s 22 of the LA applied; and (b) in the alternative, that the plaintiff was entitled to avail itself of s 29(1) of the LA.

</div> I did not need to make a finding on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The plaintiff’s claim against D1 was for fraud committed by the Deceased. If the plaintiff were to succeed in proving the Deceased’s fraud, a constructive trust would arise over the fraudulently obtained moneys. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 at 716C:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I agree that the stolen moneys are traceable in equity. But the proprietary interest which equity is enforcing in such circumstances arises under a constructive, not a resulting, trust. Although it is difficult to find clear authority for the proposition, when property is obtained by fraud equity imposes a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient: the property is recoverable and traceable in equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 While Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s reasoning has been questioned (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Shalson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Russo </span>[2005] 1 Ch. 281 at [111]), the proposition that a fraudster holds the proceeds of the fraud on constructive trust for the victim appears fairly well entrenched. <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee QC ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015)<span class="font-italic"> </span>comments at para 26-012:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">(b) Fraudulent taking. </span>A distinction must be drawn between fraud consisting in the outright taking of a person’s property, wholly without his consent, and a transaction induced by a fraudulent misrepresentation. In the first case, it has been said that a thief who steals the property of another holds it on constructive trust for the claimant. The thief’s possessory title is subject to the claimant’s equitable entitlement to have the property specifically restored to him so that he holds it as a constructive trustee…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I was of the view that, on the facts, a claim in knowing receipt could potentially have been made out against D2 if fraud on the part of D1 were proved and the knowledge requirement on the part of D2 satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Given this, my finding that the plaintiff has not made out its case against D1 is sufficient to dispose of the matter as a claim in knowing receipt is premised on the existence of a breach of trust or fiduciary duty (see [111(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Nevertheless, as much time was spent on D2’s financial ability to purchase the Rivervale Property and 70 Bayshore Property without any assistance from the Deceased and I had agreed with the plaintiff that D2 had been untruthful about the state of her finances, I will elaborate on my reasons for that conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I will deal first with the purchase of the Rivervale Property, which was purchased in October 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 According to D2, she was able to afford to purchase the Rivervale property as she had substantial savings from her previous job as a property agent and earnings from her other businesses.

It would have occurred to her to mention this source of income in her AEIC if it were true given that the alleged Indian income constituted the bulk of her income for the years leading up to the purchase of the Rivervale Property.

</div> This would have caused some inconvenience to her. It seemed unlikely that she would refuse to pay off a relatively small debt, despite having the means to do so, just because the loan was that of her ex-husband.
