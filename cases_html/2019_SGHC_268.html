Therefore, no porosity issue arises for the contents of the statement that are irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement, since the contents would not enter into the ancillary hearing in the first place on the basis of relevance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 However, I do accept that at times, the same content in the accused’s statement can relate simultaneously to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the question of voluntariness of the statement, which is a matter for the ancillary hearing, and the question of the commission of the offence, which is a matter for the main trial. In the interests of justice, I am of the view that the presence of s 279(5) of the CPC and its porosity cannot prevent the content of the statement relevant to an issue on voluntariness from being adduced during the ancillary hearing just because the same content is also relevant to the issue of the commission of the offence to be dealt with at the main trial. Two possible scenarios arise. If the statement is ruled to be voluntary, this part of the statement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the content relevant to both voluntariness and the commission of the offence) will enter the main trial anyway. If the statement is ruled to be involuntary, this part of the statement will not enter the main trial anyway. As such, I find no legal impediment for the court to have sight of the content of the statement during the ancillary hearing to ascertain if any part of it is relevant to the issues that are to be determined at the ancillary hearing. If it is found to be relevant, questions may be asked during the <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span> in relation to the making of that part of the statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 My real concern pertains to the evidence of the accused and other witnesses testifying at the ancillary hearing, if the evidence given by the accused or the other witnesses is simultaneously relevant to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the question of the voluntariness of the accused’s statement and to the question of the commission of the offence. Under s 279(5) of the CPC, there is no problem with the <span class="font-italic">evidence of witnesses,</span><span class="font-italic"> and not the accused,</span> flowing to the main trial without the witnesses being recalled back at the main trial. Since the prosecution can always call the same witnesses back at the main trial to repeat the evidence given at the ancillary hearing because the same evidence also relates to the commission of the offence, s 279(5) of the CPC renders this step unnecessary for the prosecution. I accept that this enables the trial to be conducted more efficiently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 However, I am inclined to hold a different view where the testimony of the accused given at the ancillary hearing is relevant <span class="font-italic">both</span> to the voluntariness of the statement and to the commission of the offence. In the interests of justice, the accused should not be constrained in the manner he gives evidence when challenging the voluntariness of his statements during the ancillary hearing. If the accused gives evidence relevant <span class="font-italic">both</span> to the issue of the voluntariness of his statement and also to the issue of his commission of the offence, then this part of the accused’s evidence given at the ancillary hearing should not, by virtue of s 279(5) of the CPC, be rendered automatically admissible as evidence that forms a part of the prosecution’s case even before the defence is called. To that extent, I agree with Mr Tiwary. To hold otherwise would substantially prejudice the accused by compromising the accused’s right to silence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Having a <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span> allows the accused to step into the witness box to give evidence on oath and challenge the admissibility of the recorded statements purported to be his statements before the close of the prosecution’s case, without sacrificing his right to remain silent should the court later decide to call for his defence at the close of the prosecution’s case. It was held in <span class="font-italic">Haw </span><span class="font-italic">Tua Tau v PP</span> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133 at [17] that the following principles would apply to determine if an accused ought to be called upon to give his defence (see also s 230(<span class="font-italic">m</span>) of the CPC):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… At the conclusion of the Prosecution’s case …, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding “that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction”, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The accused should be protected during the ancillary hearing, which should be insulated from the main trial. The accused should retain the freedom to give evidence during the ancillary hearing to challenge the admissibility of his statements and yet be able to retain his right to silence in the main trial before he is called upon to enter his defence. Section 279(5) of the CPC compromises this if the accused’s evidence in the ancillary hearing can be introduced into the main trial by s 279(5) when the accused’s evidence is simultaneously relevant to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the voluntariness of the statement and the commission of the offence. In such a situation, I am of the view that the court has the discretion to, and should disallow, the accused’s oral testimony during a <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span> from flowing back into the main trial via a backdoor in s 279(5) of the CPC before the accused’s defence is even called. Mr Tiwary and the Deputy Public Prosecutor avoided specific references to the substantive content of the accused’s statement when the accused was being questioned during the <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span> to ensure that the accused did not venture into any areas in his evidence that might have a bearing on the main trial itself, even though that evidence was clearly also relevant to determine the voluntariness of the statement itself. These precautions taken appear to me to be rather unachievable and awkward at times. All this is unnecessary since the court has the discretion to disallow the accused’s oral testimony at the ancillary hearing relating to the commission of the offence from entering the main trial if such testimony prejudices the accused’s right to silence in any way. Due to these concerns, the parties took the position that the court should not have sight of the statements at all during the <span class="font-italic">voir</span><span class="font-italic"> dire</span> and no statements were therefore provided to the court during the ancillary hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In any case, there is no provision in the CPC that expressly prohibits the court from having sight of the contents of the statement, which are relevant to the ancillary issue, in order to determine the ancillary issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 For the above reasons, I thus hold that the statement can be marked for identification during the ancillary hearing and the court is entitled to view the contents of the statement if it is relevant to determine the issue for which the ancillary hearing is being held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Applying this to the present case, I reject Mr Tiwary’s submission that the prosecution is barred from cross-examining and adducing any evidence from Ansari in relation to the contents of the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement whereby he incriminated Bella. The contents of the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement that were incriminatory of Bella would be relevant to the voluntariness issue under s 279(2) of the CPC, given that it contradicts Ansari’s case that he had been induced by SSGT Helmi and SI Fathli to make the Statements in order to “let Bella go”. As such, it is the fact that he had incriminated and not exculpated Bella of her involvement in these two statements (and not the factual truth or otherwise of that incrimination itself) that is relevant to the issue of inducement in the ancillary hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Turning to the evidence that inculpated Bella, Ansari admitted under cross-examination that in the 31 March 2016 Statement, he had incriminated Bella in relation to her involvement with the drugs in the apartment, and stated Bella’s knowledge of Ansari’s involvement in drug-related activities.

</div>
</div> The meaning of the words, “it depends on what you say” is not as unclear as the prosecution submits, when the words of SSGT Helmi’s Inducement, tied in with the context in which they were allegedly uttered, begets an objective inducement of Ansari to incriminate himself for the Drugs found in the Car in order for Bella to be let off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The words “it depends on what you say” could also not possibly have meant that what was required of Ansari was merely that he had to give <span class="font-italic">a statement</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether positive, negative or mixed), as the prosecution had suggested as an alternative interpretation of the words. First, the alleged SSGT Helmi’s Inducement was phrased, “it depends on <span class="font-italic">what</span> you say”, and not “it depends on <span class="font-italic">whether</span> you say anything”. The former makes specific reference to the <span class="font-italic">contents</span> of Ansari’s subsequent statements, rather than whether or not Ansari <span class="font-italic">made</span> subsequent statements at all. Second, a logical inference of the words in that context could not have meant that Ansari just had to give a statement. Giving a statement, especially if it is a completely negative statement, would have been of little utility to a CNB officer. If Ansari were to deny complete responsibility for the Drugs found in the Car, how then would Bella be let off? Nobody would then be responsible for the Drugs found. An objective interpretation of SSGT Helmi’s Inducement in that context is that Ansari would be required to sufficiently assist the CNB in a manner that justified allowing Bella to be let go. In other words, SSGT Helmi had strongly hinted that if Ansari were to give a positive statement taking full responsibility for the Drugs found in the Car, then Ansari’s plea to him to let Bella go might be acceded to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 It is also irrelevant whether in fact SSGT Helmi had the authority to let Bella off as long as the inducement had sufficiently operated on the mind of Ansari to give Ansari reasonable grounds to believe or suppose that his plea for Bella to be let go would be attended to if he had cooperated and taken full responsibility for the Drugs found in the Car. This is not a wholly self-perceived inducement on the part of Ansari. It is a clear inducement proceeding from SSGT Helmi that falls within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC. Since the alleged SSGT Helmi’s Inducement in response to Ansari’s begging SSGT Helmi to “let Bella go” would objectively involve a <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span>, I reject the prosecution’s proposition that SSGT Helmi’s Inducement could have been a form of self-perceived inducement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For the above reasons, I find that the alleged SSGT Helmi’s Inducement, had it been made, would have objectively been an inducement that would have subjectively operated on the mind of Ansari to render the Contemporaneous Statements involuntary.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether SSGT Helmi’s Inducement was in fact made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Evaluating the evidence in its totality, I have a reasonable doubt that both the plea from Ansari to SSGT Helmi to let Bella go and SSGT Helmi’s Inducement in response were not made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I find it quite hard to believe that Ansari would not have raised any concerns about Bella with the recording officer at all. Ansari, who was 43 years old at the time of the alleged offence, was significantly older than Bella, who was in her early twenties. Given their age difference, the fact that Bella had a 3-year old daughter from Indonesia whom she was responsible for, Ansari witnessing Bella crying and Ansari being the reason for Bella’s presence in Singapore, it is entirely reasonable that Ansari, as Bella’s boyfriend, would have felt protective, responsible and guilty over Bella’s situation. It would have been perfectly natural for Ansari to have asked SSGT Helmi to “let her go”. Ansari’s testimony that he begged SSGT Helmi to “please let Bella go. She is my girlfriend. She does not know anything about these drugs” is not something that I could readily dismiss as being untruthful or unlikely. I would expect emotions within Ansari to well up and his concern for Bella to be rather strong at that time after their arrest. I would find it rather unusual if Ansari had made no attempt whatsoever to seek the help of the recording officer to have Bella let off as according to Ansari, Bella was not involved at all with the Drugs found in the Car. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I find that the defence has managed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution’s case that Ansari had never raised any request in relation to letting Bella go and therefore no response was in fact made by SSGT Helmi to that non-existent request. Accordingly, I hold that the prosecution has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the plea from Ansari to SSGT Helmi to let Bella go and SSGT Helmi’s Inducement were not made and that the Contemporaneous Statements are therefore wholly voluntary. I rule that both Contemporaneous Statements are inadmissible for the purposes of the main trial.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Non-Contemporaneous Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ansari’s Testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In relation to the Non-Contemporaneous Statements recorded by SI Fathli, Ansari testified that he had been induced by SI Fathli to give the Non-Contemporaneous Statements to cooperate with CNB in order to let Bella go.

</div> Hence the Police Station Diary is not helpful in determining whether SI Fathli and Ansari could have been alone together in Interview Room 3 of Police Cantonment Complex Lock-up for a short period of time prior to the arrival of Mr Farhan for the recording of the 25 March 2016 Statement.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether SI Fathli’s Inducement was in fact made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 After considering all the evidence, I find that the prosecution has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that SI Fathli’s Inducement was not in fact made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 From the testimonies of SI Fathli and Mr Farhan, I find that a reasonable doubt exists as to whether or not SI Fathli and Ansari could have been alone in the interview room for a short while prior to the statement recording on 25 March 2016. This was when the alleged SI Fathli’s Inducement could have been made. First, SI Fathli could not recall whether he and Mr Farhan had first met at the office before heading down to the lock-up, or met straight at the lock-up. Second, neither Mr Farhan nor SI Fathli could confirm who first arrived at the interview room on 25 March 2016. Third, this information was also not recorded in SI Fathli’s investigation diary. Notably, SI Fathli testified that even if he had arrived first at the lock-up, he would have waited for Mr Farhan before interviewing Ansari together.

</div> However, I do not find SI Fathli’s testimony reliable on this due to the vacillations in his testimony and his inability to recall clearly the events preceding the taking of the cautioned statement early in the morning of 25 March 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 SI Fathli’s testimony is also not credible for the following reasons. First, SI Fathli’s oscillating testimony regarding the events prior to the recording of the 25 March 2016 statement is rather suspect. It was only after it was pointed out to him that Mr Farhan could not possibly have been on standby in the interpreter’s office at 3.00am in the morning that he admitted that he could not recall whether or not he had met Mr Farhan before heading down to the lock-up. Second, I observe that SI Fathli did not genuinely apply his mind to recall the events that occurred on 25 March 2016 before answering the questions on the stand. There were many instances during SI Fathli’s testimony whereby he replied to questions with quick affirmative or negative answers in rapid succession as if he was merely going through the motions:

</div> Given the situation that Ansari was in, after seeing Bella in the corridor, it is more likely than not for Ansari to have uttered those words to seek reprieve for Bella. If SI Fathli’s testimony were to be accepted, then it is rather odd that Ansari, given the feelings he had at that time for Bella, never sought any help at all for his girlfriend. It would be natural for Ansari to beg SI Fathli about his girlfriend after seeing Bella in the corridor. I do note however that several days later, Ansari did not appear to be as protective of Bella as before because Ansari implicated Bella in relation to the drugs found in the flat in two much later statements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement). Nevertheless, I find that a reasonable doubt still exists as to whether SI Fathli’s Inducement was in fact made six and ten days <span class="font-italic">earlier</span> respectively on 25 March 2016 before the statement was recorded and when both SI Fathli and Ansari were allegedly alone in the interview room prior to the arrival of the interpreter. This is primarily due to my assessment of Ansari’s testimony being more credible than that of SI Fathli’s testimony, coupled with a reasonable possibility that SI Fathli and Ansari were alone in the interview room for a short while before the 25 March 2016 Statement could have been recorded, whereby Ansari had the opportunity to and did plead with SI Fathli about letting Bella off and SI Fathli’s Inducement was then uttered. Accordingly, I find that the prosecution has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that SI Fathli’s Inducement was not in fact made.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Threat, Inducement or Promise</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Objective Limb</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I now turn to whether SI Fathli’s Inducement operated as an inducement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Cheng Heng Lee and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 747 at [30], the Court of Appeal held that had the investigating officer truly told the accused, “You better cooperate with me and I will help you. If not, you will surely hang”, the accused’s subsequent statement would have been inadmissible as it was caused by an inducement. Similarly, I find that the words “so far you have been cooperative. So if you continue cooperating, we will let Bella go” would objectively be an inducement for Ansari to inculpate himself, in return for letting Bella go. The prosecution also agreed that, had SI Fathli’s Inducement been made, it would have amounted to an objective inducement.

The prosecution submits that because Ansari had continued to incriminate Bella in the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement despite the fact that SI Fathli’s Inducement had been made, SI Fathli’s Inducement did not subjectively operate on the mind of Ansari.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I first turn to interpreting the meaning of the words “continue cooperating” used in SI Fathli’s Inducement and how the words would have subjectively operated on Ansari’s mind. Having considered the universe of possibilities of the meaning of the words “continue cooperating”, the natural inference from the words “continue cooperating” would refer to Ansari <span class="font-italic">inculpat</span><span class="font-italic">ing himself</span> in the Non-Contemporaneous Statements. It could not possibly mean that SI Fathli would have let Bella go if Ansari had given a statement that <span class="font-italic">exculpated himself</span>. In relation to Bella’s involvement, the words “continue cooperating” probably could not have meant requiring or asking Ansari to <span class="font-italic">exculpat</span><span class="font-italic">e Bella </span>in his statement<span class="font-italic">.</span> Finally, the words “continue cooperating”, on their own, might have included requiring Ansari to <span class="font-italic">inculpate Bella</span> in his statements. However, considering the context of the words “continue cooperating” as a <span class="font-italic">quid pro quo</span> for “letting Bella go”, it would be inherently self-contradictory for the words “continue cooperating” to mean requiring Ansari to inculpate Bella in his statements, in order for the CNB officers to “let Bella go … because she’s not involved in this”. Further, the word “continue” also necessarily implies that Ansari had previously “cooperated”. No evidence has been placed before this court to show that Ansari had previously inculpated Bella in the Contemporaneous Statements prior to SI Fathli’s Inducement on 25 March 2016 such that he was also to continue in his cooperation by continuing to inculpate Bella. The obvious and logical interpretation of “continue cooperating” would be to require Ansari to <span class="font-italic">continue inculpating himself</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at the minimum<span class="font-italic">, and not </span><span class="font-italic">so much with reference to Bella</span>. After all, Ansari testified that he had made the Non-Contemporaneous Statements with the objective of letting Bella go because she was not involved and he therefore cooperated with CNB officers by admitting to “what [Ansari] had been accused of”.

</div> I observe that Ansari was not as protective of Bella now, as demonstrated by his inculpation of Bella in the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement. His motive of self-preservation by getting the Certificate of Substantive Assistance assumed far greater importance and had overcome his motive of protecting Bella pursuant to SI Fathli’s Inducement. Ansari’s incrimination of Bella in the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement suggests that the effect of SI Fathli’s Inducement to “let Bella go” had dissipated and no longer subjectively operated on Ansari’s mind on 31 March 2016 and 4 April 2016. After all, the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement were made six and ten days after SI Fathli’s Inducement respectively. It is crucial to consider <span class="font-italic">when</span> the inducement was made: Jeffrey Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and </span><span class="font-italic">the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Edition, 2017) at para 5.031. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I find that it is more likely that Ansari’s making of the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement, where he had incriminated Bella, was incentivised by the hope of obtaining the Certificate of Substantive Assistance for himself, as he had admitted.

</div> This was his true motive, and it had eclipsed the effect of SI Fathli’s Inducement. It is inherently incoherent for Ansari to suggest that he had been induced by SI Fathli’s Inducement to make the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement in order to “let Bella go” because she was not involved, and yet Ansari chose to incriminate the very person he had sought to “let go” in those statements themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For the foregoing reasons, I find that SI Fathli’s Inducement did not subjectively operate on Ansari’s mind any longer on 31 March 2016 and 4 April 2016.

Hence, I find that the 31 March 2016 Statement and the 4 April 2016 Statement were voluntarily made and admissible. However, I still find that SI Fathli’s Inducement did operate as an inducement for Ansari’s making of the much earlier 25 March 2016 Statement and 30 March 2016 Statement.
