<p align="justify" xmlns="">1        The accused pleaded guilty

to the following charge :</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That you, Aw Teck Hock, on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of May 2002,

    between 1.00 am and 5.00 am, at Blk 31 Taman Ho Swee #01-161 Singapore, did commit

    culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Aw Swee Seng,

    male/73 years, to wit, by kicking his body and head and throwing a plastic chair at him,

    which act was done with the knowledge of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause

    death to the said Aw Swee Seng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under

    section 304 (b) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224."</p>
<b>
</b></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Facts</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        The accused, then 37 years

old, is the youngest son of the deceased. They lived together in a ground floor flat at

Taman Ho Swee. On 15 May 2002, at 12.49 pm, the accused telephoned the police to report

that he had a fight with his father the previous night and that when he woke up, he found

his father had stopped breathing.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        In response, two police

officers went to the said flat. The accused led them to the living room where his father

was lying motionless in a supine position on a mattress. Various injuries could be seen on

the father’s body. The accused informed the police officers that he used a white

plastic chair to hit his father in a fight the previous night. He was then arrested.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        At about 1.40 pm, medical

assistance arrived but the father was pronounced dead.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Subsequent investigations

revealed that the accused returned home sometime between 1 am and 5 am on 15 May 2002

after an alcohol-drinking session. His father, who was still awake then, nagged him for

returning home so late and began to scold him using Hokkien vulgarities. A quarrel ensued

and that escalated into a fight. The accused pushed his father who fell backwards. He then

went forward to kick his father’s body and head. He also picked up a plastic chair

and threw it at his father. He then carried his father to the mattress in the living room

before he went into his bedroom to sleep.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        The accused’s

neighbour informed the police that he was awakened by a commotion in the accused’s

flat at around 3 am that day. He also heard arguments and what appeared to be the sound of

something hitting the wall.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        When the accused woke up

past noon that day, he found that his father had stopped breathing and was not responding

to his calls. He then called the police. Before the police arrived, he put right a sofa in

the living room which had toppled over during the fight earlier. He also used a towel to

wipe away some blood stains on the floor.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The police found a broken

white plastic chair with bloodstains outside the rear door of the flat. Bloodstains were

also found on the mattress cover, a towel, a cushion cover, the television set and the

floor. Subsequent analysis showed that the blood came from the father.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The accused underwent a

medical examination that same day. No injuries were found on him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        The post mortem revealed

bruises and abrasions all over the deceased’s head, his neck and his 4 limbs. There

were also fractures of the ribs. The cause of death was certified as "multiple

injuries".</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Previous Convictions</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        The accused was convicted

of the offence of gaming in public in 1981, 1985 and 1994 and of the offence of gaming in

a common gaming house in 1995 for which he was fined on each occasion.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The Mitigation Plea</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        The accused was a cleaner

working in the Ministry of Environment Building. On 14 May 2002, he was invited by 4

colleagues to join them for drinks after work. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        At about 7 pm, 3 of them

shared 2 bottles of beer at a coffee shop at Bukit Merah View. The other 2 persons drank

coffee and then left the group. At about 9pm, the 3 proceeded to a pub at Clarke Quay

where they shared one jug of beer. They then went to a karaoke lounge in Kim Seng Road.

One of the trio had beer and then left. The accused and the remaining colleague drank one

and a half bottles of brandy until about 2 am when they shared a taxi home. Both lived in

Taman Ho Swee.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        The accused stumbled home

and opened the main door. In his drunken stupor, he saw his father storming towards him

and hurling vulgarities at him. They quarrelled and he vaguely remembered having pushed

his father away. The rest of the events in the early hours that day were completely hazy

to him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        When he woke up around

noon and saw his father lying motionless on the floor, he tried to rouse him. He then

telephoned the police and his sister and waited for the police to arrive.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16        The accused married in

1989 and divorced in 1997. His wife has custody of their son aged 9 and their daughter

aged 12. After his divorce, he moved in with his father. He was usually unemployed due to

his low education and the poor state of his mental and physical health. He used to do odd

job labour until March 2002 when he got a job as a cleaner earning $40 per day. He was

paid fortnightly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17        Being the youngest in a

family of 7 siblings, he was doted on by his father with whom he had lived harmoniously

for the past 5 years. His mother passed away a few years ago. The family had a tragic

history. His eldest brother committed suicide in 1986 and his second eldest brother was

stabbed to death in 2001. The attack on his father was completely uncharacteristic and he

offers no excuse for his actions. He is truly remorseful and suffers immense agony over

the tragic incident day after day. He "is the one who will suffer the most from the

loss of his father who died at his hands". The tragedy happened within the family and

the accused is not a danger to anyone.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18        His previous convictions

were rather long ago and did not involve offences of violence. He used no weapon in the

attack on his father. He was not a habitual drinker of alcohol – he could scarcely

afford to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19        Among the many cases cited

was <b><i>PP v Jamal anak Nyalau </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63428&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 3 SLR 66</a> </b>where the 3 accused persons there

were convicted of an offence under section 304 (b) Penal Code and sentenced to

imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months each. There, the 3 accused persons had attacked a

helpless victim without provocation. They had no previous conviction and had pleaded

guilty at the first opportunity. No weapons were used. It was argued that there was some

provocation by the father in the present case. Further the victim here was not

outnumbered. I was therefore urged to imprison the accused for no more than 6 years. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</p>
</b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20        I acknowledge that the

accused did inform and cooperate with the police and has pleaded guilty. I also accept

that the previous convictions show him to be a man given to gambling rather than to

violence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21        The father was 73 years

old. It is quite apparent from the extensive injuries suffered by him and the total lack

of injury on the accused’s body that the deceased was frail while the accused was

much more robust despite his assertion about having a rather weak disposition. Whatever

little provocation came from the elderly man was not something that was so out of the

ordinary that it should cause so explosive a reaction. The accused literally kicked a man

who was down and out.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22        It was highlighted in

mitigation that the accused carried his father to the mattress after the attack before he

went to bed. Even so, I seriously doubt it was an act of filial piety or of tender mercy

or even of remorse. It is as comforting as having been robbed and then having the robber

wish you, "Have a good day". It would of course be quite different if he had the

good sense then to call for the police or for an ambulance.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23        It was also said that the

accused was no habitual drinker of alcohol. However, the merry-making sessions in the

evening of 14 May 2002 showed that this could not be so. The effects of consuming

excessive alcohol are well known and should certainly be known to the then 37 year old

accused. The law does not allow intoxication as a defence to a criminal charge except in

very limited circumstances (sections 85 and 86 Penal Code). Intoxication is also of no

mitigating value in the case of a grown-up man like the accused. He who imbibes

excessively and is then imbued with Dutch courage should not be heard crying,

"Don’t blame me, it’s the alcohol" when charged with some offence

committed in the state of intoxication.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24        In the circumstances, I

could not agree that the accused should be given a sentence at the lower end of the scale

provided in section 304 (b) Penal Code. I therefore sentenced him to 9 years imprisonment

with effect from 15 May 2002, the date of his arrest.</p>
