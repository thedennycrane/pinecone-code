<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, ANL Singapore Ltd
                    (“ANL”), instituted Admiralty in Rem No 175 of 2009 (“Adm
                    No 175”) against the owners of the vessel, “<em>Makassar Caraka Jaya Niaga III-39</em>” (the “<em>Makassar</em>”). ANL contended in its Statement of
                    Claim that the respondent, PT Djakarta Lloyd (Persero) (“PTDL”),
                    an Indonesian State-owned company, owed it US$719,440.17 for slot fees due and
                    owing under invoices rendered pursuant to a slot charterparty entitled
                    “AAX Main Agreement”, which was entered between the parties on
                    1 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 16 May 2009, ANL arrested the <em>Makassar</em>, which was registered in PTDL’s name, as
                    security for its claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       PTDL intervened in the action and claimed that
                    although the <em>Makassar</em> was registered in its name,
                    it was actually owned by Indonesia (the “State”). PTDL asserted
                    that it is merely the State-appointed operator of the said vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 24 September 2009, PTDL filed SUM
                    5039/2009. In this Summons, PTDL sought to have the <em>Makassar</em> released and the arrest set aside. It also sought an
                    order that ANL’s application for default judgment and sale of the vessel
                    and all further proceedings be stayed in favour of foreign
                arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 15 January 2010, the Assistant Registrar
                    set aside the arrest of the <em>Makassar</em> and ordered
                    the release of the vessel on the ground that the requirements under s 4 (4)
                    of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act’) had not been satisfied. He also ordered that
                    ANL’s application for default judgment and sale of the <em>Makassar</em> and all further proceedings be stayed in favour of
                    foreign arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Dissatisfied with the Assistant
                    Registrar’s decisions, ANL filed RA 16 of 2010 for the purpose of
                    appealing against his decisions. After hearing further arguments on the matter,
                    I reserved judgment and now set out my final conclusions and the reasons for my
                    conclusions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the writs and arrests should be set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The <em>Makassar</em> was
                    arrested pursuant to s 3(1)(h) and s 4(4) of the Act. The relevant
                    part of s 3(1) of the Act provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3 —(1) The admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court shall be as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       ANL arrested the <em>Makassar</em> on the basis that PTDL is its beneficial owner. In
                        <em>The Pangkalan Susu/Permina 3001</em>
                    [1977-1978] SLR(R) 105 (“<em>Pangkalan
                        Susu</em>”), Wee Chong Jin CJ explained what
                    “beneficial ownership” entails at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is what do the words "beneficially owned as respects all the
                        shares therein" mean in the context of the Act. These words are not defined
                        in the Act. Apart from authority, we would construe them to refer only to
                        such ownership of a ship as is vested in a person who has the right to sell,
                        dispose of or alienate all the shares in that ship. Our construction would
                        clearly cover the case of a ship owned by a person who, whether he is the
                        legal owner or not, is in any case the equitable owner of all the shares
                        therein. It would not, in our opinion, cover the case of a ship which is in
                        the full possession and control of a person who is not also the equitable
                        owner of all the shares therein. In our opinion, it would be a misuse of
                        language to equate full possession and control of a ship with beneficial
                        ownership as respects all the shares in a ship. The word "ownership"
                        connotes title, legal or equitable whereas the expression "possession and
                        control", however full and complete, is not related to title. Although a
                        person with only full possession and control of a ship such as a demise
                        charterer, has the <em>beneficial</em> use of her, in
                        our opinion he does not have the beneficial ownership as respects all the
                        shares in the ship and the ship is not "beneficially owned as respects all
                        the shares therein" by him within the meaning of s 4(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The ascertainment of beneficial ownership of a
                    vessel is a matter of Singapore law as it relates to the admiralty jurisdiction
                    of the Singapore courts. While the court will, in the case of foreign ships,
                    take into account relevant aspects of the relevant foreign law for a better
                    picture of how ships may be owned or transferred in order to determine who has
                    the beneficial ownership under that foreign law, Singapore law, being the
                        <em>lex fori</em>, cannot be supplanted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To explain the effect of Indonesian law
                    relevant to the present proceedings, the parties each called an expert witness.
                    ANL’s expert witness, Mr M Husseyn Umar
                    (“Mr Husseyn”), has had much experience in legal and
                    commercial work relating to shipping. He was the former Head of the Legal
                    Division of the Indonesian Ministry of Sea Communications, a former Director for
                    Maritime State Enterprises at the Ministry of Communications, a former President
                    Director of PT Pann Ship Finance and Leasing Corporation, a former President
                    Director of PT PELNI National Shipping Co, and presently a member of the
                    Indonesian National Arbitration Board as well as partner of a Jakarta law firm,
                    M/s Ali Budiadjo Nugroho, Reksodiputro.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     PTDL’s expert witness was Mr Ari
                    Wahyudi Hertanto (“Mr Ari”), a lawyer at Syahmirza Irsan
                    Attorneys at Law, Jakarta. ANL’s counsel, Mr Toh Kian Sing SC
                    (“Mr Toh”), pointed out that it was not apparent from
                    Mr Ari’s <em>curriculum vitae</em> that he had
                    any special or relevant expertise with respect to the admiralty law issues in
                    this case. In <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v SY Technology Inc
                        and another appeal</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<em>Pacific Recreation</em>”), V K Rajah JA stressed at
                    [66] that an expert “must show that he is a person specifically skilled
                    in such foreign law” and at [67] that an expert should also show
                    “the precise manner, and not merely the general area of inquiry”
                    in which he or she would be of use to the court. It appears from
                    Mr Ari’s <em>curriculum vitae</em> that he
                    graduated from the University of Indonesia with a law degree in 1998 and a
                    Masters in Business Law in 2005, that he practised law for a few years before
                    becoming a partner at his present law firm, and that he taught “General
                    Theory of State” as well as “Pancasila (Indonesian)
                    Ideology”. I thus agreed with Mr Toh that there are valid questions
                    about Mr Ari’s suitability as an expert witness for the purpose of
                    the present proceedings, which involves a determination of the beneficial
                    ownership of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     To ascertain who is the beneficial owner of a
                    vessel, the court may trace the history of ownership of the vessel from the time
                    of its construction: see <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>
                    [1993] 3 SLR(R) 71. In the present case, it is relevant that in 1989, the
                    Indonesian government launched a five-year plan called the “Caraka Jaya
                    III Implementation Program” (“Caraka Jaya III”) to
                    strengthen the Indonesian national shipping sector. A State-owned company, PT
                    PANN (Persero) Multi Finance (“PT Pann”), was designated as the
                    implementing agency for Caraka Jaya III. The Indonesian government obtained two
                    offshore loans for Caraka Jaya III. It then entered into two subsidiary loan
                    agreements with PT Pann on 27 September 1993 and 6 October 1993 to sub-loan
                    the offshore funds to the latter to finance the construction of the vessels in
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently, PT Pann faced financial problems
                    and was unable to complete the construction of the Caraka Jaya III vessels. On 2
                    September 1996, PTDL was directed by the Indonesian Minister of Finance to take
                    over the duties and responsibilities of PT Pann. While the relevant shipbuilding
                    contracts were first entered into between the shipyards and PT Pann, they were
                    transferred to PTDL with the tacit approval of the shipyards in question. The
                    Indonesian government provided loans to PTDL to complete the construction of the
                    vessels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 25 February 1998, the <em>Makassar</em> was delivered to PTDL by the shipyard. On
                    22 October 1998, the <em>Makassar</em> was registered
                    in PTDL’s name at the Jakarta registry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Under Singapore law, a registered owner of a
                    vessel is, without more, its beneficial owner and the party who asserts
                    otherwise has the burden of rebutting this presumption. The significance of this
                    presumption of ownership has been reiterated in a number of cases. In <em>The Kapitan Temkin</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 573
                        (“<em>The Kapitan Temkin</em>”), G P
                    Selvam J stated at [7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is a <em>prima facie</em> case to establish
                        jurisdiction depends on the facts of the case…. [T]he certificate of
                        registration is important documentary evidence in deciding who the
                        beneficial owners of a ship for purposes of jurisdiction are, especially
                        when it is produced and relied upon on behalf of the State or a department
                        which issued the certificate. It is so because the certificate of
                        registration is also a certificate of ownership…. It is not
                        conclusive but furnishes at least <em>prima facie</em>
                        evidence of the registered owner being the true owner, thus resulting in a
                        shifting of the burden of proof. Whoever, without being registered, claims
                        ownership must displace that <em>prima facie</em>
                        evidence"…. Today the certificate of registration fulfils the dual
                        function of proclaiming the nationality and ownership of the ship….
                        In other words the person who is stated as the owner and <em>the State which issued the certificate would generally be estopped from
                            asserting a contrary proposition unless the register is rectified before
                            third parties act on it. Thus even though as a general rule the entry

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>The Tian Sheng No
                        8</em> [2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 430, the Hong Kong Court of Final
                    Appeal made it clear that it is not easy to prove that the registered owner of a
                    vessel is not its beneficial owner. The Court explained at 433:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is possible that registration is, as a matter of law, not conclusive on
                        the issue of ownership; conceivably, there are circumstances where it might
                        be shown that the registered owner was in fact <em>not</em> the legal and beneficial owner of all the shares in the
                        ship: The fraudulent procurement of registration would be an example. But,
                        in the general run of things, registration would be virtually conclusive,
                        and it would take a wholly exceptional case for it to be otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Indonesian law also places much emphasis on
                    the registration of ownership of a vessel as Art 46(4) of Law No 21 of 1982
                    concerning Shipping provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As evidence that a vessel has been registered, the owner of such vessel
                        shall be given a Certificate of Registration, which shall serve as <em>evidence of ownership</em> over the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The effect of Law No 21 of 1992 concerning
                    Shipping was explained by ANL’s expert, Mr Husseyn, as follows in his
                    report in his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit at paras 5.9 and
                    5.10:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.9    We reiterate here that Law No 21 of 1992
                            concerning Shipping, which was in effect at the time of the construction
                            and registration of both Vessels, in its Article 46 paragraph (4)
                            explicitly stipulates that <u>the Certificate of
                                Registration over a vessel ie Deed No 1514 and Deed 1516 shall serve
                                as evidence of ownership over such vessel</u>;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.10  Consequently, the valid and legitimate owner of a
                            vessel is the one who is registered in the Certificate of Registration
                            (currently known as Deed of Registration or <em>Grosse
                                Akta Pendaftaran</em>) of such vessel. In this case, it can be
                            clearly concluded that both Vessels are legally and validly owned by
                            [PTDL] as stated in Deed No 1514 and Deed No 1516.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     PTDL submitted that Law No 21 of 1992
                    concerning Shipping must be viewed in the context of other Indonesian laws. It
                    insisted that the vessel was a State asset under Indonesian law because
                    government funds had been used to purchase it. It added that State assets in the
                    hands of a State-owned company remained State assets unless a government
                    regulation has been passed to convert them from State assets to State equity in
                    the said company. As no government regulation had been passed to effect such a
                    conversion in the present case, PTDL submitted that the vessel remained a State
                    property and should not have been arrested by ANL. PTDL’s expert,
                    Mr Ari, who adopted a rather simplistic position, referred to Law No 19 of
                    2003 and Law No 1 of 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Art 4 of Law No 19 of 2003 provides as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Art 1 of Law No 1 of 2004 provides that
                    “State property” refers to “any property purchased or
                    obtained from the [national budget] or acquired from other valid source”.
                    Furthermore, Art 41 of Law No 1 of 2004 reiterates that the government’s
                    “equity participation” in any company “shall be stipulated
                    under a government regulation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     ANL pointed out that Mr Ari’s
                    reliance on Law No 19 of 2003 and Law No 1 of 2004 was totally misplaced because
                    these laws were enacted many years <em>after</em> the
                    registration of the vessel in 1998. Mr Husseyn explained that Indonesian
                    legislation does not have retrospective effect unless this has been expressly
                    provided for in the legislation in question and there was no provision in either
                    Law No 19 of 2003 or Law No 1 of 2004 for the retrospective application of these
                    laws. As such, PTDL was not entitled to rely on these laws to support its
                    assertion that the <em>Makassar</em> is a State
                    asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the face of ANL’s assertion that PTDL
                    relied on laws that had no retrospective application, the latter clarified that
                    its case did not depend entirely on laws enacted after the vessel was registered
                    in 1998. PTDL contended that Law 1 of 1969, Government Regulation 12 of 1969,
                    and Government Regulation 12 of 1998, which replaced Government Regulation 12 of
                    1969, also support its case. However, Articles 1 and 2 of the 1969 legislation
                    merely provide that the State may participate in a limited liability company and
                    that its investment by way of equity participation is to be stipulated by a
                    government regulation. Evidently, the 1969 legislation does not support
                    PTDL’s assertion that the <em>Makassar</em> is State
                    property. Government Regulation 12 of 1998 did not alter this
                position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     ANL accepted that in relation to the <em>Makassar</em>, the use of State funds, even through loans, to
                    finance the construction and purchase of the vessel, could and should have
                    resulted in equity participation in PTDL in the form of shares in the company
                    under Indonesian law if a Government regulation had been passed. It is
                    ANL’s case that in regard to the funds loaned to PTDL for the construction
                    of the vessels under the Caraka Jaya III project, the State had the following
                    two options:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Pass a government regulation to convert the funds
                            loaned to PTDL into the State’s equity participation in [PTDL];
                            or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Treat the funds loaned to PTDL as loans and
                            recover them in full from PTDL.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     ANL pointed out that the importance of having
                    a government regulation to convert the State loan to PTDL into State equity was
                    on the mind of the Indonesian Minister of Industry and Trade when he wrote to
                    his colleague, the Minister of Finance in a letter dated 3 September 2002
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n order to <em>strengthen the legal status</em> of
                        24 Caraka Jaya III phase 3 ownership, therefore we suggest you to follow up
                        the issuance process of the government regulation regarding equity
                        participation accordance the applicable law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     ANL contended that as there was no government
                    regulation converting the loans to PTDL to equity in the latter, the question of
                    conversion of the loans into state equity participation in PTDL did not arise.
                    It submitted that the lack of such a government regulation cannot have the
                    effect of converting the loans into beneficial ownership of the shares in the
                        <em>Makassar</em>, and especially so when the concept
                    of beneficial ownership is, as Mr Huseyn pointed out, alien to Indonesian
                    law. In <em>The Kapitan Temkin</em>, G P Selvam J found at
                    [5] that as Ukranian law does not recognise the concept of beneficial ownership,
                    Ukranian law is of little assistance to the court for the purpose of determining
                    who is the beneficial owner of a Ukranian vessel. The same line of reasoning
                    applies to the limits on the usefulness of Indonesian law to determine the issue
                    of beneficial ownership in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Mr Husseyn explained in his report in his
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit, at paras 5.28-5.33 that the loan
                    agreements had nothing to do with ownership of the vessel. Under the terms of
                    the loan documentation between the Indonesian government and PTDL in 1996, the
                    former had assumed the role of an unsecured lender as it was content to lend
                    money to PTDL without any reservation of ownership or the security of a
                    mortgage. Even PTDL’s expert, Mr Ari, had characterised the loans by
                    the government to PT Pann under the Caraka III project as “loans”
                    in para 8 of his report in his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit although
                    he classified the loans as “shareholder’s
                loans”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the question of beneficial ownership, I
                    accept the evidence of ANL’s expert, Mr Husseyn, that Indonesian law
                    does not support PTDL’s assertion that the <em>Makassar</em> is a State asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Correspondence between PTDL and various Indonesian Ministries and
                Agencies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     PTDL also asserted that its correspondence
                    with Indonesian Ministries and agencies ought to be taken into account to
                    determine the beneficial ownership of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     To begin with, PTDL pointed out that it wrote
                    to the Minister of State-owned Enterprises on 27 February 2009 for approval of
                    its plan to pledge two Caraka Jaya III vessels to obtain a loan of US$3m. On 30
                    March 2009, the Minister rejected the request to pledge the two vessels and
                    pointed out that the vessels still bore the status of “Government Aid
                    Whose Status Has Yet To Be Determined”. PTDL’s counsel, Mr Gan
                    Seng Chee, argued that if his client is the beneficial owner of the vessels, it
                    would not have required the Indonesian government’s permission to pledge
                    the two vessels in question. However, ANL retorted that PTDL had specifically
                    stated in its letter of 27 February 2009 to the Minister that approval for the
                    proposed pledge was being sought “from the <em>shareholders</em>” of the company. Furthermore, in its letter
                    of 11 March 2009 to the said Minister, PTDL’s Board of Commissioners
                    referred to the earlier letter of 27 February 2009 and stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The management in [its letter dated 27 February 2009] basically <em>requests for an approval from the Share Holders</em> to
                        pledge as collateral 2(two) Caraka Jaya Niaga ships in order to secure a
                        loan for the sum of USD3,000,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Husseyn explained that the approval
                    from the relevant Minister was sought by PTDL as this was required under its own
                    Articles of Association. In his report in his 1<sup>st</sup>
                    affidavit, he stated at paras 7.29-7.31 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.29  The exchange of correspondence between [PTDL] and
                            the Ministry of State-Owned Companies ... merely reflects the obligation
                            of [PTDL] to consult and obtain prior approval from its shareholders to
                            encumber its assets as security in accordance with Article 11 of
                            Articles of Association as elaborated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.30  The position of the Minister of State-Owned
                            Companies as the shareholders of [PTDL] is stipulated under Article 2
                            point a of GR No 41/2003, which states that the Minister of State-Owned
                            Companies shall serve as the representative of Government as the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.31  
              <em>Under Indonesian law, which
                                does not recognise the concept of beneficial ownership, the

                                the vessels in the Ministry of State-Owned
                            Companies</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     ANL likened PTDL’s request for approval
                    of its proposal to pledge the vessels in question to that of a borrower seeking
                    the consent of a financing bank before entering into a contract for the sale of
                    the mortgaged vessel or a further mortgage over the vessel. Such approval from
                    financial institutions providing loans to shipowners is a common feature in ship
                    financing and does not affect the beneficial ownership of the mortgaged vessel.
                    In any case, ANL’s counsel rightly pointed out that the <em>Pangkakan Susu</em> test of beneficial ownership does not require
                    that an owner of a vessel must have an absolute or unqualified right to sell,
                    dispose of or alienate the shares. Otherwise, an owner who has mortgaged his
                    vessel to a bank cannot be regarded as a beneficial owner of the vessel
                    registered in his name if the bank must agree before he can dispose of the
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     PTDL also relied on a letter from the
                    Indonesian Minister of Finance to his colleague, the Minister of Transportation,
                    on 14 April 1998, stating that he may approve the latter’s request to
                    reallocate “the operation” of all Caraka Jaya III phase 3 vessels,
                    a total of 24 vessels, to PTDL. According to Mr Ari, this letter had
                    statutory force and gave PTDL a statutory right, and not a mere contractual
                    right, to operate the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     While discussing the legal consequences of the
                    correspondence between the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, Ministry of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.37  Further Article 7
                            paragraph (4) of Law on Law Making has broadened the source of
                            Indonesian legislation by specifically providing as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“<em>Forms of legislation other than as intended
                                in paragraph (1) above shall be recognized and is legally binding in

                                hierarchy”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Elucidation of Article 7 paragraph (4) on Law on Law Making
                        provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>“Forms of Legislation as intended in this
                                paragraph are, inter alia</em>, <em><u>regulations issued by</u></em><em>the People’s Consultative Assembly and House of
                                Representatives, Regional Representatives, Supreme Court,
                                Constitutional Court, Financial Audit Agency, Bank Indonesia,
                                Ministers ....”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.38  From the above, it is clear and can be concluded
                            that the letters from the various Ministries relied upon … ie
                            Letter in the affidavits of Ari Wahyudi Hertanto … could not, in
                            any way, be regarded as having statutory force, as this will be …
                            contrary to the prevailing laws and regulations;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.39  The various letters of Ministers relied upon
                            … are merely correspondence between the parties which cannot and
                            does not carry any evidential weight as far as the contents are
                            concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In relation to Mr Ari’s assertion
                    that the Minister’s letter of 14 April 1998 gave PTDL a statutory right to
                    operate the vessel, Mr Husseyn rebutted it as follows in his report in his
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit at para 5.40:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…. It is to be noted that [this letter] was only correspondence
                        between the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Transportation which
                        cannot and does not carry any evidential weight as far as the contents are
                        concerned. In any event, the said letter does not specifically assign the
                        operations of Caraka Jaya III phase 3 vessels to [PTDL]. Above all, the
                        Minister of Finance does not have the right to assign the operation of both
                        Vessels ... concerned as the valid and legal owner of both Vessels is
                        [PTDL].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As for PTDL’s reliance on a letter dated
                    31 July 2009, in which the Minister of State-owned Company wrote to PTDL to
                    point out that the <em>Makassar</em> and another vessel,
                    the <em>Pontianak</em>, are assets “owned by the
                    State”, ANL contended that this was a self-serving letter written after
                    the vessel had been arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I accept the expert opinion of Mr Husseyn
                    on the effect of the correspondence relied on by PTDL. As such, I find that that
                    the correspondence relied on by PTDL did not prove that the State is the
                    beneficial owner of the <em>Makassar</em>. It should not be
                    overlooked that although PTDL claimed that it was the mere operator of the said
                    vessel, it furnished no evidence of the contractual documents relating to the
                    operation of the vessel. Furthermore, although the <em>Makassar</em> was arrested more than a year ago, the alleged owner of
                    the vessel, the State has not intervened in these proceedings to assert its
                    claim to ownership of the same. It is also noteworthy that in response to
                    queries on the ownership of the vessel <em>after</em> PTDL
                    had already intervened in these proceedings and asserted that it was not the
                    beneficial owner of the vessel, the Indonesian Directorate General of Sea
                    Communications issued a statement on the ownership of the vessel on 20 October
                    2009, which confirmed that PTDL is the owner of the <em>Makassar</em> and that this vessel was unencumbered. No mention was
                    made of the State’s alleged interest in the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on beneficial ownership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     To sum up, PTDL clearly failed to displace the
                    presumption of ownership arising from the registration of the vessel in its
                    name. On balance, I prefer the more persuasive arguments presented by
                    ANL’s expert, Mr Husseyn, whose views were not effectively countered
                    by PTDL’s expert, Mr Ari. For the sake of completeness, it ought to
                    be noted that there is no room for finding a resulting trust in favour of the
                    State merely because it had furnished PTDL a loan for the construction of the
                    vessel. The common intention of the parties to the Loan Agreement to create a
                    loan for a specified purpose, namely the acquisition of the vessel, rebuts any
                    possible presumption of a resulting trust arising from the purchase of the
                    vessel with funds disbursed under the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the reasons stated, I hold that PTDL is
                    the beneficial owner of the <em>Makassar</em> and allowed
                    the appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s decision to set aside the
                    writs and the arrest of the vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the proceedings should be stayed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     PTDL asserted that the main proceedings should
                    be stayed in favour of arbitration as the AAX Main Agreement contains
                    arbitration clauses requiring the parties to resolve their disputes through
                    arbitration. Clause 17.2 of the said agreement provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]ll disputes or differences arising under the Agreement which cannot be
                        amicably resolved shall be referred to arbitration in England in accordance
                        with the Arbitration Act 1996 together with London Maritime Arbitration
                        Association (LMAA) terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Furthermore, clause 17.4 of the said agreement
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding anything in Articles 17.2 and 17.3 to the contrary, if the
                        dispute or difference arises in relation to an outward liner cargo shipping

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Section 6 of the International Arbitration Act

                            being performed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>Tjong Very Sumito and
                        Ors v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 732
                        (“<em>Tjong</em>”), the Court of Appeal
                    reiterated that s 6 of the IAA acknowledges the primacy of the specific
                    arbitration agreement in question and made it clear at [22] that if there is a
                    dispute, a stay under s 6 of the IAA is mandatory if there is an applicable
                    arbitration agreement “unless the party resisting the stay can show that
                    one of the statutory grounds for refusing a stay exists, <em>ie</em>, that the arbitration agreement is "<em>null
                        and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed</em>”. In
                    the present case, there is no allegation that the arbitration agreement is null
                    and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It cannot be overlooked that when ANL arrested
                    the <em>Makassar</em>, it stated that it was “ready,
                    willing and able to refer their disputes to arbitration”. ANL now
                    questions whether there is a “dispute” between the parties to
                    warrant a stay of proceedings. The word “dispute” is interpreted
                    broadly and courts will “readily find that a dispute exists unless the
                    defendant has unequivocally admitted that the claim is due and payable”.
                    In <em>Tjong</em>, the Court of Appeal explained at
                    [69]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">.…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    In line with the prevailing philosophy of judicial
                            non-intervention in arbitration, the court will interpret the word
                            "dispute" <em>broadly</em> …., and will
                            readily find that a <em>dispute exists unless the
                                defendant has unequivocally admitted</em> that the claim is
                            due and payable ….The court should not be astute in searching for
                            an admission of a claim, and would ordinarily be inclined to find that a
                            claim is not admitted in all but the clearest of cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    There is undoubtedly a "dispute" referable to
                            arbitration if the defendant expressly asserts that he denies the
                            claim….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     ANL sought to rely on its correspondence with
                    PTDL to prove that there is really no dispute as to what is owed by the latter.
                    It also referred to a Letter of Undertaking dated 5 May 2009, in which PTDL
                    admitted owing it “an estimated US$2.8m”. However, PTDL claimed
                    that the letter in question did not unequivocally admit ANL’s claim and
                    that the letter was, in any case, written on a “without prejudice”
                    basis. Whether or not PTDL had admitted owing an estimated US$2.8m in the said
                    correspondence between the parties or in its Letter of Undertaking, it has now
                    denied that it owed ANL the amount claimed by the latter. PTDL added that if
                    there was any admission of liability, it had been made by mistake. In <em>Tjong</em>, the Court of Appeal dealt with the issue of
                    prevarication on the alleged debtor’s part and stated at [62]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What about the case where the defendant prevaricates; first making an
                        admission and then later purporting to deny the claim on the ground that the
                        admission was mistaken, or fraudulently obtained, or was never made? In such
                        a case, there might well be a dispute before the court, both over the
                        substantive claim as well as over whether the defendant can challenge the
                        alleged earlier admission, and the matter should ordinarily be referred to
                        arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In line with the approach adopted by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Tjong</em> and after taking all
                    circumstances into account, I agreed with the Assistant Registrar that the
                    parties should resolve their dispute by arbitration. As such, the appeal against
                    his decision to stay the proceedings in favour of foreign arbitration is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Each party will bear its own costs for the
                    appeal. The order on costs below is set aside.</p>
