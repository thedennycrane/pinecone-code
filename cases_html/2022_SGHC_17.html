Where a party fails to do so, the court may not allow an applicant a “second bite of the cherry”, in a setting-aside application, to introduce an issue or argument material to the merits of the underlying dispute which was not but which could and should have been raised during the arbitration proceedings. In such circumstances, the court may dismiss such a belatedly raised objection as an abuse of the setting aside process (<span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other matters </span>[2020] 5 SLR 266<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">BAZ</span>”) at [64]–[65]).

OS 433 is CLX’s application to partially set aside a final award dated 18 November 2020 (the “Final Award”) rendered by a sole arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) and a Decision and Memorandum of Corrections dated 8 February 2021 rendered by the Arbitrator under r 33 of the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (6th Edition, 1 August 2016) (“SIAC Rules”) (the “Rule 33 Decision”).

Firstly, the Corrected Final Award is induced or affected by fraud because the first defendant dishonestly concealed and/or gave false evidence to the Arbitrator regarding the alleged actual condition of the Overhead Cranes, which was the subject of the parties’ dispute. This is the main ground relied upon by the plaintiff. Secondly, there is a breach of natural justice in the making of the Corrected Final Award because the plaintiff was deprived of the opportunity to make arguments regarding the alleged actual condition of the Overhead Cranes, and specifically, to resist the claim by the first defendant for rescission of the underlying contract and/or mount significant defences to the claim for rescission. Thirdly, the Corrected Final Award is contrary to public policy because it was rendered on the basis of an egregious error of fact that the Overhead Cranes had not been damaged. As is quite common, the plaintiff relies on these same grounds to also set aside the Leave Order. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The parties are all companies incorporated in Singapore.

The first defendant is in the business of land transportation of containers and general cargoes. It is also the owner of a multi-level warehouse and container depot in Singapore (the “Development”). The second defendant is in the business of general construction and design and build construction work. The first defendant appointed the second defendant as the main contractor for the Development.

During the Site Visit, the plaintiff’s representatives took several photographs of the Overhead Cranes. According to the plaintiff, it was only during the Site Visit that it discovered for the first time that the Overhead Cranes had not just been dismantled as previously asserted by the plaintiff but had been damaged and/or destroyed, with several key parts missing and/or cannibalised by the first defendant.

</div> In essence, the plaintiff requested that the Arbitrator correct double-counting errors, provide further directions in relation to the alleged damage to the Overhead Cranes and extend the timeframe for the plaintiff to comply with the Removal Order. There were a total of five requests made by the plaintiff in its Rule 33 Application. Only one (categorised by the Arbitrator as “Request 4”) is relevant to the applications before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Given its centrality to the plaintiff’s applications, in the following paragraphs, I set out in some detail (a) the plaintiff’s Request 4 in relation to the Removal Order; and (b) the Arbitrator’s decision on that request. The plaintiff submitted that upon inspection of the Overhead Cranes during the Site Visit, it realised for the first time that instead of dismantling and properly taking down the Overhead Cranes, the first defendant had “severed the steel structural components into pieces”. As a result, the Overhead Cranes had been damaged and/or destroyed. Any residual value in the dismantled components had been destroyed and the remaining structural parts would only amount to scrap metal. In addition, various components of the Overhead Cranes had gone missing and “may have been cannibalised by the [first defendant] for its own use”. These include (amongst others) the main control panels, various motors, cables, drag chains, power cables and cable festoon systems of the Overhead Cranes.

</div> Thus, the plaintiff and the Arbitrator were not in a position to take into account the destruction of the Overhead Cranes and the resulting depreciation in their value in the plaintiff’s earlier evidence and submissions in the Arbitration, and thus, this issue was not dealt with by the Arbitrator in the Final Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In the main, the plaintiff was dissatisfied that, unbeknownst to itself and the Arbitrator, the Overhead Cranes had allegedly been destroyed in the course of being dismantled/uninstalled by the first defendant following the termination of the Contract. According to the plaintiff, this was contrary to the first defendant’s constant representations throughout the Arbitration that the Overhead Cranes had merely been dismantled and stored at the first defendant’s premises pending the outcome of the Arbitration, which in turn led to the natural inference that the “parts remained capable of reassembly (in which case their resale value would have been considerable)”.

</div> The plaintiff contended that as a result of the alleged destruction of the Overhead Cranes, their resale value would have deteriorated by about 50% of the original value. The plaintiff argued that the issue necessitated further consideration and an order from the Arbitrator, by way of an interpretation of the Final Award and/or additional award.

The Arbitrator rejected the plaintiff’s request for an interpretation of the Final Award and/or an additional award on account of the alleged damage to the Overhead Cranes. The Arbitrator noted that he was <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>after the release of the Final Award save in the limited circumstances set out in r 33 of the SIAC Rules. The Arbitrator found that r 33.3 (which dealt with the making of an additional award) only applied in respect of claims presented in the arbitration but not dealt with in the award. As it was not in dispute that the plaintiff had not, prior to the release of the Final Award, raised the matters relating to the alleged damage to/cannibalisation of the Overhead Cranes and consequent diminution in value in the course of the Arbitration, r 33.3 of the SIAC Rules did not provide a basis for the Arbitrator to determine those matters. Accordingly, he was not in a position to issue the directions sought by the plaintiff.

The Arbitrator was of the view that while the first defendant framed its suggestion as such, it was in fact requesting the Arbitrator to make the clarificatory order. The Arbitrator found that there was no basis to grant this request as it would not be within his powers to do so under r 33 of the SIAC Rules. The Arbitrator concluded that r 33.1 did not apply as the first defendant’s request did not involve any “error in computation, any clerical or typographical error or any error of a similar nature”. Further, in the Final Award, the first defendant’s request for the plaintiff to “remove <span class="font-italic">and dispose</span>” of the Overhead Cranes had been expressly rejected by the Arbitrator. Thus, it could not be said that the Arbitrator had not dealt with the first defendant’s request, and therefore r 33.3 did not apply. As for an interpretation of the Final Award, the Arbitrator considered that the first defendant was unable to identify the relevant parts of the Final Award which were unclear, ambiguous or vague and as such, there was nothing in the Final Award to be interpreted such as to make r 33.4 applicable.

At no point in time prior to the release of the Final Award did the first defendant indicate that the dismantling of the Overhead Cranes could have resulted in destruction of the same to any extent or that the components of the Overhead Cranes had been removed. If the first defendant had so indicated, this would then have been a matter for determination in the Final Award. As it stood, there was no basis for the first defendant’s request that the Removal Order be clarified as one on an “as is where is” basis.

</div> As a result of the false representations and from the documents and information disclosed by the first defendant during the Arbitration, there was no “trigger” or reason for the plaintiff to “set a train of inquiry in motion at the arbitration” or to apply to inspect or seek further orders during the course of the Arbitration to preserve the “dismantled” Overhead Cranes.

Since the first defendant sought the relief of rescission in the Arbitration, the Arbitrator would not have upheld the rejection of the Overhead Cranes and/or awarded the first defendant the purchase price since these were premised on the Overhead Cranes having merely been dismantled and therefore, being returned to the plaintiff without any damage and/or parts missing.

Firstly, the plaintiff did not plead any diminution or depreciation in value which was a defence readily available to it in the light of the first defendant’s claim for rescission under the SOGA.

</div> The contract entered into by the plaintiff with the third party (the “Third Party Contract”) demonstrates that the plaintiff sought to enjoy the fruits of the Corrected Final Award (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by removing the dismantled Overhead Cranes and reconfiguring the same for sale to a third party). OS 433 is grossly inconsistent with its course of conduct in entering into the Third Party Contract. Thus, having secured an actual benefit from the Corrected Final Award in the remains of the Overhead Cranes and going on record in enforcement proceedings relating to the seizure and sale of the Overhead Cranes to affirm their election to treat the Overhead Cranes as their property, the plaintiff should be barred from applying in OS 433 to set aside the same Corrected Final Award giving it the rights to the Overhead Cranes and which it seeks to sell under the Third Party Contract.

For the following reasons, I answer this question in the negative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Court of Appeal, in <span class="font-italic">BWG v BWF </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1296 (“<span class="font-italic">BWG</span>”) (at [102]) set out the law on approbation and reprobation as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">102 The foundation of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is that the person against whom it is applied has accepted a benefit from the matter he reprobates (<span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam </span>[1937] AC 473 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Russell of Killowen at 483). The doctrine of approbation and reprobation has also been referred to as a principle of equity that a person ‘who accepts a benefit under an instrument must adopt it in its entirety giving full effect to its provisions and, if necessary, renouncing any other rights which are inconsistent with it’ (Piers Feltham, Daniel Hochberg &amp; Tom Leech, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower: Estoppel</span> <span class="font-italic">by Representation </span>(LexisNexis UK, 4th Ed, 2004) (‘<span class="font-italic">Estoppel by</span> <span class="font-italic">Representation</span>’) at para XIII.1.10). We endorse Belinda Ang Saw Ean J’s description of the doctrine in <span class="font-italic">Treasure Valley Group Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Saputra Teddy</span> <span class="font-italic">and another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, Intervener) </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 358 (‘<span class="font-italic">Treasure Valley</span>’) at [31]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The doctrine of approbation and reprobation precludes a person who has <span class="font-italic">exercised a right </span>from <span class="font-italic">exercising another right which is alternative to and</span> <span class="font-italic">inconsistent with the right he has exercised</span>. It entails, for instance, that a person ‘having accepted a benefit given him by a judgment cannot allege the invalidity of the judgment which conferred the benefit’: see <span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam</span> [1937] AC 473 at 483 and <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Australia </span>vol 12 (Butterworths, 1995) at para 190-35 where the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is conveniently summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A person may not ‘approbate and reprobate’, meaning that a person, <span class="font-italic">having a choice between two inconsistent courses of conduct and having</span> <span class="font-italic">chosen one, is treated as having made an election from which he or she</span> <span class="font-italic">cannot resile </span>once he or she has taken some benefit from the chosen course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The doctrine does not necessarily require the electing party to make a conscious choice between alternative rights and remedies (as required in the common law doctrine of election) but a party’s election which gives rise to a prior position must still be reasonably clear to be effective (<span class="font-italic">Aries Telecoms (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v ViewQwest Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 108 at [5]). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BWG </span>(at [118]–[119]) also accepted that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation extends to inconsistent positions taken against different parties in different proceedings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">118 Based on our survey of the above authorities, it is clear that the operation of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does extend to inconsistent positions asserted against different parties in different proceedings, as long as the party has received an actual benefit as a result of an earlier inconsistent position. This is illustrated by cases such as <span class="font-italic">Express</span> <span class="font-italic">Newspapers </span>and <span class="font-italic">First National Bank</span>, where the doctrine was applied because the parties who sought to advance inconsistent positions had already secured actual benefits from their prior positions.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">119 In the present case, and as noted above, there is an apparent inconsistency in the respondent’s position in pursuing proceedings against Sit to judgment on the one hand, and its illegality defence here on the other. In our view, the judgment which the respondent has obtained against Sit in bankruptcy proceedings is a ‘benefit’. Cases show that the ‘benefit’ that triggers the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is constituted by a judgment (<span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam </span>[1937] AC 473 at 483; <span class="font-italic">PW &amp; Co v Milton Gate</span> <span class="font-italic">Investments Ltd </span>[2004] Ch 142, at [252] and [257]) or an arbitral award (<span class="font-italic">Dexters</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Hill Crest Oil Co (Bradford) Ltd </span>[1926] 1 KB 348 at [47]; <span class="font-italic">European Grain and Shipping Ltd v Johnston </span>[1982] 3 All ER 989) rendered to the successful party, without further specifying that the resulting judgment debt has to be satisfied in order for the requisite benefit to be conferred. This was equally the case in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>where the judgment obtained against the director was considered to be a benefit notwithstanding its non-satisfaction (<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]). Notably, as held in <span class="font-italic">R </span><span class="font-italic">Durtnell &amp; Sons Limited v Kaduna Limited </span>[2003] EWHC 517 (TCC) at [47], the requisite ‘benefit’ is made out by ‘an entitlement to payment’.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The defendants argue that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation bars the plaintiff from proceeding with OS 433 because it has accepted an actual benefit, or has at least elected to, under the Corrected Final Award in the form of the entitlement to take back possession of the Overhead Cranes. Through its conduct of entering into the Third Party Contract, it elected to treat the Overhead Cranes as its property. It is thus inconsistent for the plaintiff to now seek to set aside the Corrected Final Award which grants it the right to the Overhead Cranes.

</div> The plaintiff’s conduct of concluding the Third Party Contract on 23 March 2021 could therefore be described as being inconsistent with its filing of OS 433 and seeking to set aside the Final Corrected Award in its entirety, <span class="font-italic">if</span> viewed in isolation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, I agree with Mr Edmund Kronenburg, counsel for the plaintiff, that the facts <span class="font-italic">in their totality</span> do not show a clear or unequivocal communication by the plaintiff of its intention to take the benefit of the Overhead Cranes pursuant to the Final Corrected Award and rest its case. On the contrary, its overall conduct is relevant and should be considered. For example, the plaintiff’s Rule 33 Application seeking further orders and clarifications from the Arbitrator including orders related to the allegedly damaged Overhead Cranes demonstrates otherwise. In applying for an extension of time to set aside the Leave Order and explicitly reserving its position as regards the setting-aside application, the plaintiff was making clear that it may seek to set aside the Corrected Final Award. The fact that the plaintiff entered into the Third Party Contract does not, in and of itself, evince a clear or unequivocal intent as regards its legal position. It is understandable that the plaintiff would be exploring its options on the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> that the Corrected Final Award would not be set aside. It is also plausible that the plaintiff may subsequently renegotiate the Third Party Contract or fulfil its contractual obligations using other materials or parts if it did not obtain the Overhead Cranes from the defendants. I would not consider the plaintiff’s overall conduct to mean that the plaintiff has taken a benefit from the Corrected Final Award from which it cannot later resile. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As I have found that the plaintiff’s conduct is not sufficiently unequivocal to constitute approbation and reprobation, it is strictly unnecessary for me to go any further.

The decision upon a particular dispute must either be accepted in whole or not at all, assuming that the latter option is otherwise available. I accept that for the doctrine to apply it is necessary for a party, with knowledge that it is open to him to object to the decision, to take the benefit of part of it. However, I do not accept that what constitutes a ‘benefit’ for this purpose depends simply upon whether the party whose receipt of a ‘benefit’ is in question has obtained net cash sum or an entitlement to a payment. <span class="font-italic">It is, in my judgment</span><span class="font-italic">, a ‘benefit’ to a party, for the purposes of the doctrine, that his liability to another party in respect of any particular matter is crystallised on an interim basis at a particular amount</span>, even though that is an amount which he is called upon to pay. Thus a party who contends that his obligation towards another party is limited to payment of a particular sum by reason of the decision of an adjudicator has both claimed and derived a ‘benefit’ from that decision. It is probably also correct, as Mr. Bowdery submitted, that a party who is, in consequence of the decision of an adjudicator, <span class="font-italic">entitled to take possession of a building and does so, has claimed and derived a </span><span class="font-italic">‘benefit’ from the decision</span>.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">AMEC </span>(at [96]), Coulson J commented on the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">96 But secondly, if this point had been critical, I would have needed to have been persuaded that, with great respect, Judge Seymour’s <span class="font-italic">analysis of benefit</span>, a vital ingredient of this argument was correct …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">97 Taken<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic">to its logical conclusion, a benefit so defined could mean that a party who has lost an </span><span class="font-italic">adjudication, and has dutifully followed every aspect of the decision against him when preparing his next withholding notice, would still be deriving a benefit from the decision. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">That seems, on the face of it, to be a surprising conclusion. No authority is identified by Judge Seymour in support of his definition</span><span class="font-italic">. </span><span class="font-italic">Thus, whilst I can see that a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">losing party who seeks to rely positively on some aspect of a decision</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on which he has been successful</span><span class="font-italic">, whilst continuing to challenge the </span><span class="font-italic">decision as a whole, might be attempting to gain a benefit, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I find it difficult to reach the same conclusion when the losing party has simply applied, to his detriment, the findings of the adjudicator on which he has been unsuccessful</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [47]) is correct in so far as it holds that an order or judgment in a party’s favour can <span class="font-italic">per se</span> amount to a “benefit” – that proposition has been accepted in our courts. In <span class="font-italic">BWG </span>(at [119]), the Court of Appeal noted that the “benefit” that triggers the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is constituted by a judgment or an arbitral award rendered to the successful party and there is no need for the resulting judgment debt to be satisfied in order for the requisite benefit to be conferred. <span class="font-italic">BWG</span> in fact referred to <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for the proposition that the requisite benefit is made out by an “entitlement to payment”. The same point was recently noted in <span class="font-italic">Goldbell</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering Ltd v Etiqa Insurance Pte Ltd (Range Construction Pte Ltd, third party) and another matter </span>[2022] SGHC 1 (at [79]). The inquiry as to whether a party had taken “a benefit” would ultimately depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. In this regard, I am also prepared to accept that a judgment or award for <span class="font-italic">non-monetary</span> benefits can in some cases also constitute a “benefit” under the doctrine. Contrary to Mr Kronenburg’s submission, I do not read Coulson J’s comments above in <span class="font-italic">AMEC </span>as doubting Seymour J’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [47]) in its entirety. Instead, Coulson J was in some doubt as to whether <span class="font-italic">a liability</span> that is adjudged against a <span class="font-italic">losing</span> party could amount to a “benefit” to that party. I am inclined to agree that it may be stretching the scope of the concept of a “benefit” too far to extend it as including a judgment or award against the losing party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As regards the example mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span> of “a party who is, in consequence of the decision of an adjudicator, <span class="font-italic">entitled to take possession of a building </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and does so</span>, has claimed and derived a ‘benefit’ from the decision” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics], I make three points. Firstly, the issue of taking possession of a building <span class="font-italic">did not</span> arise on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span>. Seymour J merely made a tentative observation that counsel’s submission was “probably correct”. The context in which the submission was made by counsel in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span> is not clear from the case report. Secondly, that sentence in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>cannot be read to stand for the proposition that an entitlement to a chattel “in consequence of a decision” of an adjudicator or tribunal, even if the entitlement arises <span class="font-italic">implicitly</span>, can or will always be considered a “benefit” for the purposes of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation. The context behind what “in consequence of a decision” means is also unclear from <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span>. Without the benefit of argument on these points, I decline to come to any definitive conclusion on them. I would however observe that from the language used by Seymour J and extrapolating it to an example of a chattel, it would appear that the title to or right to possession of the chattel would need to have been an issue before the adjudicator or tribunal, or at the least formed part of the relief requested <span class="font-italic">by the party</span> alleged to have taken the “benefit” of the decision. Thirdly, the example cited seems in any event to contemplate the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> taking of possession of the property in question as being necessary before the approbating party could be said to have claimed and derived a “benefit”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present case, I reject the defendants’ argument that the plaintiff has taken an actual benefit for two reasons. Firstly, the Corrected Final Award did not explicitly make any finding that the title to the Overhead Cranes vests or re-vests in the plaintiff. The title to or right to possession of the Overhead Cranes was not in issue before the Arbitrator. Nor was it the subject of any relief sought by the plaintiff. Instead, the Arbitrator only ordered that the plaintiff remove the Overhead Cranes from the first defendant’s premises at its cost within four weeks of the date of the Final Award (see [12] above), and subsequently extended the deadline to six months in the Rule 33 Decision. The Removal Order is only a <span class="font-italic">consequence</span> of the remedy of rescission sought by the <span class="font-italic">successful </span><span class="font-italic">first defendant</span>, which the Arbitrator allowed. It would not, in my judgment, be fair or reasonable to consider the vesting (or re-vesting) of title to the Overhead Cranes with the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">as the losing party</span>, in circumstances where that occurred merely as an <span class="font-italic">implied</span><span class="font-italic"> consequence</span> of the Contract being rescinded, as constituting an “actual benefit” for the purposes of the doctrine. That would be extending the concept of “actual benefit” too far, at least in the context of the case before me. Secondly, the plaintiff has not in fact taken possession of the Overhead Cranes. Therefore, even on the basis of the example referred to in <span class="font-italic">Durtnell</span>, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has taken the benefit of the Corrected Final Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In sum, I hold that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation does not apply on the facts of this case to bar the plaintiff from seeking to set aside the Final Corrected Award in OS 433 or the Leave Order. Accordingly, I turn now to address the substantive merits of the plaintiff’s challenge against the Corrected Final Award.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Second issue: whether the Corrected Final Award is induced or affected by fraud</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Under s 48(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(vi) of the AA, an award rendered in a domestic arbitration may be set aside by the court if the “making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption”. For international arbitrations, an identical ground may be found in s 24(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the International Arbitration Act 1994 (2020 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is well-established that the threshold for establishing fraud, which is rooted in dishonesty, is a high one. In <span class="font-italic">BNX v BOE </span>[2018] 2 SLR 215 (“<span class="font-italic">BNX</span>”) (at [82]), the Court of Appeal was at pains to re-emphasise that dishonesty is the cornerstone for fraud and that “inadvertent errors in the evidence, the drawing of wrong inferences, conjectures, lack of corroborative evidence or even false evidence … short of actual and deliberate fraud would not be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span><span class="font-italic"> Resorts and Hotels Inc and another v Global Gaming Philippines LLC and another </span>[2021] 3 SLR 725 (“<span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span>”) (at [99]), Belinda Ang Saw Ean J (as she then was) noted that where fraud is alleged, “strong and cogent evidence” has to be adduced and the court will not infer a finding of fraud. In short, a convincing case of fraud must be shown (<span class="font-italic">BVU v BVX</span> [2019] SGHC 69 (“<span class="font-italic">BVU</span>”) at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The law concerning perjury and concealment of evidence (including concealing documents or information) in an arbitration was also helpfully and clearly summarised by Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [103]–[109]). The key principles are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Perjury and the deliberate suppression or withholding of documents in an arbitration can in a proper case amount to obtaining an award by fraud.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the fraud alleged is perjury, the applicant must prove that:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) false evidence is given which is intended to cause any person in that proceeding to form an erroneous opinion that touches any point material to the result of such proceeding;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the new evidence demonstrating fraud could not have been discovered or produced, despite reasonable diligence, during the arbitration proceedings; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the newly discovered evidence must be decisive in that it would have prompted the arbitrator to have ruled in favour of the applicant instead of the other party. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the fraud alleged is concealment or non-disclosure of material information or documents, the applicant must prove that: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) there is deliberate (as opposed to innocent or negligent) concealment aimed at deceiving the arbitral tribunal or the other party/parties to the arbitration; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) there is a causative link between the deliberate concealment and the decision in favour of the concealing party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the concealment must have substantially impacted the making of the award). The document(s) (or information) concealed must be so material that earlier discovery would have prompted the arbitrator to rule in favour of the applicant; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) there must not have been a good reason for the non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Where new evidence is being introduced to demonstrate fraud, the applicant would have to demonstrate why it was not available or could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The three common core elements to such procedural fraud (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, perjury and concealment of documents/information) include: (a) dishonesty or bad faith; (b) the materiality of the new evidence to the decision of the tribunal; and (c) the non-availability of the evidence during the earlier proceeding. Further, while proving fraud, dishonest or unconscionable conduct is essential, it is not sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Turning back to the case at hand, the lynchpin of the plaintiff’s case is that the first defendant had either dishonestly concealed from the Arbitrator or falsely misrepresented to the Arbitrator the actual condition of the Overhead Cranes.

It was dishonest for the first defendant to conceal that the Overhead Cranes had not just been dismantled but had been dismembered/destroyed and with parts either missing or cannibalised.

As summarised above at [18]–[23], the Arbitrator’s comments were in response to the <span class="font-italic">first </span><span class="font-italic">defendant’s</span> suggestion (which the Arbitrator found in fact amounted to a request) that the Arbitrator clarify the Removal Order in the Final Award to require the plaintiff to remove the crane parts on an “as is where is” basis, and various arguments that the first defendant raised in support of that suggestion. The Arbitrator found that the first defendant had not shown that its request fell within <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the provisions of r 33 of the SIAC Rules. Accordingly, r 33 was not engaged and the Arbitrator had no power to make the order requested. While Mr Kronenburg argued that the Rule 33 Decision provides a clear indication that the Arbitrator himself was unaware of the actual condition of the Overhead Cranes,

</div> He therefore had no power to determine whether the Removal Order by the plaintiff should be on an “as is where is” basis as per the first defendant’s request.

Nor am I bound to follow the Arbitrator’s views or observations on this issue. The Arbitrator considered that there would have been no basis for the first defendant’s request since it was premised on an incorrect assumption that the plaintiff “should have been aware of, or at least suspected that (1) the dismantling could have resulted in some destruction and/or (2) the components of the [Overhead Cranes] may have been removed”.

It is thus inappropriate for this court, in a setting-aside application, to embark on a fact-finding mission to determine the veracity of this potential course of action. I therefore say no more on its merits but will come back to this point later in a different context. Suffice to say, the Arbitrator found it unnecessary, in the Rule 33 Decision, to deal specifically with the first defendant’s submissions on the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>/abuse of process.

</div> I have rejected this argument at [66] above, but even if I accept that the Arbitrator was unaware, this only brings the plaintiff’s case so far. To make out its case on the Corrected Final Award being induced or affected by fraud, the plaintiff must meet the requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(above at [59]) and prove that the first defendant has deliberately concealed material information from the Arbitrator or given false evidence to mislead the Arbitrator.

It also remains the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate with cogent evidence that the first defendant has in fact damaged the Overhead Cranes or cannibalised parts for its own use. Had the evidence shown that the first defendant intentionally destroyed or cannibalised the Overhead Cranes or parts thereof, this would have provided strong support for the allegation that there was a <span class="font-italic">deliberate </span>misrepresentation to the Arbitrator (or plaintiff) and/or a <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> concealment from the Arbitrator (or plaintiff) of the actual condition of the Overhead Cranes, in contrast to the first defendant’s assertion that the Overhead Cranes had merely been dismantled and stored at the first defendant’s premises pending the outcome of the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 On the contrary, in the present circumstances, it is entirely possible that the damage and/or missing parts asserted by the plaintiff had existed from the beginning when the first defendant took possession of the Overhead Cranes.

It is close to impossible, simply from a comparison of the photographs taken during the Site Visit with a selection of photographs taken by the first defendant after the dismantling process, to say with any degree of confidence that there has been deliberate damage, destruction or cannibalisation of the Overhead Cranes, or to what extent.

</div> In my view, this argument places the cart before the horse. The legal burden of proving fraud lies on the plaintiff as the applicant and its evidential burden is to adduce strong and cogent evidence of the fraudulent conduct complained of. As I have said above at [75], the plaintiff’s evidence on the actual condition of the dismantled Overhead Cranes is sketchy at best. It cannot be that the plaintiff can then simply rely on the alleged silence of the defendants to then contend that it has thereby discharged its burden to prove fraud – in effect, the plaintiff asks the court <span class="font-italic">to </span><span class="font-italic">infer</span> fraud from the alleged silence. It is clear that the court will not infer fraud (see [58] above), and it would, in my view, be dangerous for the court to make a finding of fraud simply on account of a party’s alleged silence. In any case, I also note that the defendants, in their reply affidavit, <span class="font-italic">do make</span> the specific assertion that the plaintiff has not established that there was any cannibalisation or destruction specifically and intentionally by the first defendant;

</div> In essence therefore, the defendants are disputing the plaintiff’s case that there has been any form of nefarious or reprehensible conduct by the defendants. It is thus not strictly correct for the plaintiff to say that there has been <span class="font-italic">no </span>denial by the defendants that the Overhead Cranes had been cut up, destroyed and with parts missing or cannibalised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I also find that the plaintiff has not established that the first defendant deliberately concealed information regarding the condition of the Overhead Cranes from the Arbitrator or gave false evidence in the Arbitration with the intention to mislead the Arbitrator. The plaintiff’s argument that the first defendant’s conduct amounts to fraud simply because the first defendant must have known the true state of affairs regarding the Overhead Cranes and did not disclose any information regarding the condition of the Overhead Cranes to the Arbitrator requires somewhat of a quantum leap. In my judgment, the mere fact that the first defendant must or ought to have known about the condition of the Overhead Cranes because the Overhead Cranes were dismantled by its contractor and remained in its possession and care throughout the Arbitration is insufficient to demonstrate fraud. As stated in <span class="font-italic">BNX </span>(at [82]), <span class="font-italic">dishonesty</span> is the cornerstone of fraud. There is no indication of dishonesty or bad faith in the way that the first defendant had conducted itself during the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I accept the defendants’ argument that the first defendant’s behaviour could not be described as a party seeking to mislead the Arbitrator by giving false evidence or concealing material information from him. <br/>The first defendant had consistently put forth evidence regarding the Overhead Cranes when it considered it appropriate to do so. In various witness statements adduced by the first defendant in the Arbitration, the backdrop to the dismantling of Overhead Cranes and its condition prior to, during and after dismantling was provided. The first defendant also provided photographs of the Overhead Cranes throughout the course of the Arbitration and an invoice in support of its claim for the costs of dismantling by a third-party contractor which referred to the cutting of crane girders if the length was more than 12m.

</div> The very fact of some girders requiring cutting would indicate the possibility of some damage occurring in the process. Further, I also note that, in their Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) filed in the Arbitration, one of the pleaded claims made by the first defendant was for the “[C]osts associated with <span class="font-italic font-underline">the disposal</span> of the defective crane parts; <span class="font-italic font-underline">sale of scrap metal</span>” for an amount “to be quantified” [emphasis added]. The reference to sale of “scrap metal” should have given some forewarning to the plaintiff that the dismantled Overhead Cranes, whether in whole or in part, were intended to be disposed of by the defendants as scrap metal. That pleading would have given some indication that the state of the Overhead Cranes might be more than just “dismantled” if, by that, the plaintiff thought or had the impression that the Overhead Cranes as a system were still intact and could simply be re-assembled or re-used at another location, in the event the rescission claim succeeded. I shall return to this point later when I consider the issue of whether the alleged new evidence would have been available to the plaintiff with reasonable diligence. Overall, and for the reasons above, I find that the first defendant’s behaviour does not evince any dishonest intention to conceal facts or information from the Arbitrator regarding the Overhead Cranes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It is also material that, in response to the Arbitrator’s email dated 18 June 2020 seeking clarification from parties on whether the removal of the Overhead Cranes ought to be dealt with in the Final Award (see [10] above),

</div> I accept that this objectively shows that the first defendant was not actively trying to divert the Arbitrator’s attention away from the Overhead Cranes. This is especially so in the light of s 36 of the SOGA, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Buyer not bound to return rejected goods</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36.

This would have been a more strategic position to adopt had the first defendant intended to conceal the alleged actual condition of the Overhead Cranes from the Arbitrator and the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In any event, I also agree that there was good reason for the first defendant not to have disclosed anything regarding the alleged actual state of the Overhead Cranes to the Arbitrator. It is not disputed that the plaintiff had not, at any stage in the Arbitration, pleaded or otherwise asserted either a defence and/or counterclaim of a diminution in the value of the Overhead Cranes resulting from the first defendant’s dismantlement of the Overhead Cranes or any alleged removal of components of the system.

</div> While the plaintiff did have the opportunity to inspect the Overhead Cranes throughout the course of the four-year long Arbitration (and even before the Arbitration commenced), it did not so.

</div> In other words, the <span class="font-italic">condition</span><span class="font-italic"> (and therefore associated value)</span> of the Overhead Cranes cannot be said to have been put into issue in the Arbitration by the plaintiff. I will shortly address the submission by the plaintiff that there was no “trigger” or anything that would have caused it to suspect that the Overhead Cranes had, as it alleged, been destroyed or cannibalised, so as to put it on notice to inspect or otherwise assess the actual condition of the Overhead Cranes at any time during the course of the Arbitration. However, based on the state of play in the Arbitration <span class="font-italic">including</span> the responsive case that the plaintiff decided to run in the Arbitration, there was, in my judgment, no obligation on the first defendant to disclose the “true” condition of the Overhead Cranes, even if they had been damaged during or after the dismantling process or there were missing parts as a result of the dismantling or relocation of the Overhead Cranes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It was, in my view, justifiable for the first defendant to take the position that the actual alleged condition of the Overhead Cranes was not <span class="font-italic">legally</span><span class="font-italic"> material</span> to the pleaded positions taken by <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff and </span><span class="font-italic">first defendant</span> in the Arbitration.

</div> This, in my view, at least suggests an explanation that is not implausible or fanciful as to why the first defendant did not make any alleged damaged/destruction of the Overhead Cranes or any alleged missing/cannibalised items known to the Arbitrator. It also provides, in my view, further support for my conclusion that the necessary strong or cogent evidence of dishonesty or bad faith on the part of the first defendant has not been established by the plaintiff to the standard expected by the law. As this fundamental requirement of dishonesty or bad faith has also not been met by the plaintiff, it is, in my judgment, equally fatal to the fraud objection raised by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there is a causative link between the new evidence and the Arbitrator’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Since I have concluded that the plaintiff has failed to prove dishonesty or bad faith on the part of the defendants or an overall convincing case of fraud, it is strictly unnecessary for me to go on to address the other two requirements. Nevertheless, assuming that I am wrong on the first core element and there was dishonesty on the defendants’ part, that in itself is still insufficient. The plaintiff must go on to also show that the “reprehensible conduct or fraud had caused it substantial injustice in that the same procured or substantially impacted the making of the award” (<span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore </span>at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span> at [106(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I also find that the requirement of a causative link between the new evidence and the Arbitrator’s decision is not satisfied.

Relying on the Rule 33 Decision, he argues that if the Arbitrator had been aware of the condition of the Overhead Cranes, in all likelihood, he would not have upheld the first defendant’s rejection of the Overhead Cranes and/or allowed the claim for rescission of the Contract and/or awarded the first defendant the return of the purchase price of the Overhead Cranes since these remedies awarded were all premised on the Overhead Cranes being returned to the plaintiff without any parts missing and/or destroyed.

In any case, even if substantial rescission was possible, the court (or tribunal) will do what is “practically just” and adjust for any change to the property or benefits derived to put the owner in “as good a position as before”.

</div> Additionally, the principle of substantial rescission was applicable, and the onus lay on the representor to “assert and prove” its compensation for any depreciation of the goods to be returned as a result of rescission. Where the property in question retained its substantial identity, rescission may still be ordered “even though it has deteriorated or depreciated or cannot be restored to its original state”. The substantial identity of the Overhead Cranes was retained and rescission was therefore possible. This is supported by the plaintiff’s own conduct in entering into the Third Party Contract. Therefore, it does not follow that a claim for rescission would necessarily fail, even if the value of the subject property had decreased substantially or had been changed or altered.

However, even then, I disagree that it would necessarily be one <span class="font-italic">in favour of the plaintiff</span> instead of the first defendant. The Arbitrator could, for example, have awarded the first defendant damages for breach of warranty <span class="font-italic">in lieu</span> of rescission, but even so the damages awarded could still have been by way of repayment of the purchase price paid by the first defendant under the Contract instead of, for example, replacement cost. Even if the Arbitrator took the view that substantial rescission was possible, he could have made an adjustment to account for the alleged damage to the Overhead Cranes or missing parts. The Arbitrator seemed to be of the view that the remedy of rescission was predicated on the return of the Overhead Cranes when he stated in the Rule 33 Decision that:

</div> In other words, the plaintiff was <span class="font-italic">content</span> to run its case in the Arbitration on the basis that there was no diminution to or depreciation in the value of the Overhead Cranes (aside from normal wear and tear), however unfounded that belief may be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As such, even if the first defendant had disclosed information in the Arbitration that there was damage to the Overhead Cranes or missing parts, the plaintiff would have had to amend its defence and counterclaim to put this in issue before the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator would then have had the opportunity to determine, as a fact, whether there was damage to and/or cannibalisation of the Overhead Cranes by the first defendant. The Arbitrator could then consider the appropriate relief taking into account the doctrine of substantial rescission. However, given the Arbitrator’s recognition that the issue was not put before him, any new evidence relating to the condition of the Overhead Cranes cannot be said to have “substantially impacted” the making of the Corrected Final Award. Whilst this analysis may, at first blush, seem somewhat circular given that the plaintiff argues that it did not raise this issue in the Arbitration <span class="font-italic">because</span> of the fraud on the part of the first defendant, it is closely linked to the next issue which I consider – whether the alleged new evidence could have been obtained with reasonable diligence during the course of the Arbitration. Related to this issue are the wider questions of whether the plaintiff could or ought to have raised this issue in the Arbitration and if so, whether it should<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>be permitted to raise it now in a setting aside context. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the new evidence could have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of the arbitration</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Where new evidence is being introduced to demonstrate fraud, the applicant would have to demonstrate why it was not available or could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence at the time of the arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [107]). As noted by Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span> (at [221]), the current position in Singapore appears to lean in favour of the requirement being applied in an unattenuated manner despite the allegation of fraud. Ang J also noted (at [222]) that the position in England, at least in the context of an application to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud, may be that there is no requirement that evidence of the fraud could not have been obtained in the earlier proceedings by exercise of reasonable diligence (see the UK Supreme Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Takhar v </span><span class="font-italic">Gracefield Developments Ltd and others </span>[2020] AC 450 (“<span class="font-italic">Takhar</span>”) (at [46])). Nonetheless, this requirement stands in so far as Singapore law is concerned. That said, it was noted in <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul, deceased, and others v Ching </span><span class="font-italic">Pui Sim and others </span>[2011] 3 SLR 869 (at [41]), again in the context of applying to set aside a court judgment obtained by fraud, that the requirement “ought not to be imposed rigidly such as to cause injustice in a situation where the fresh evidence uncovers fraud on the other party”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Bearing the above principles in mind, and whether applying the requirement in an unattenuated manner or not, I find that the plaintiff has failed to show that the information or evidence relating to the condition of the Overhead Cranes could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence, and consequently, that the arguments and claim it sought to make under Request 4 in the Rule 33 Application could not have been made by it in the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Mr Kronenburg submits that the exercise of reasonable diligence requires a “trigger”, drawing an analogy with how a party requires a “trigger” before it seeks specific disclosure of a particular document from the opposing party. Further, there is a legitimate expectation that the first defendant would be taking care of its own property during the course of the Arbitration and there would be no reason for the plaintiff to suspect that the first defendant would sabotage its own claim for rescission. Since what a party ought to have done is tempered by reasonableness and there was no indication for the plaintiff to suspect that the first defendant would damage the Overhead Cranes, this evidence cannot be considered to have been available with the exercise of reasonable diligence.

Prior to the commencement of the Arbitration, the plaintiff had the opportunity to prescribe a method of dismantling and removal of the Overhead Cranes but chose not to do so despite being better placed to do so as a crane specialist. The plaintiff was also aware that the first defendant would engage a third party to dismantle the Overhead Cranes and the invoices for the dismantling costs were produced in evidence and suggested that the Overhead Cranes were to be dismantled “for scrap”. The Statement of Claim claimed the costs of disposal of the crane parts and sale of “scrap metal”. In addition, during the Arbitration, the plaintiff also had the right to make a disclosure request under r 19.2 of the SIAC Rules or a request to inspect the Overhead Cranes under r 27(d) of the SIAC Rules to inform its case on whether it was necessary to plead a defence or counterclaim for potential depreciation. Alternatively, it could have requested for an order to preserve or sell the Overhead Cranes but did not do so. Finally, the plaintiff had an opportunity to raise issues relating to the condition of the Overhead Cranes when the first defendant adduced photographic evidence showing the condition of the Overhead Cranes in the open yard. The evidence presented in the Arbitration should have been sufficient to put the plaintiff on notice of the case it should plead in order to safeguard its own position.

At the heart of it, the decision on whether to advance a defence to bar a claim for rescission, or a counterclaim for potential depreciation due to the condition of the Overhead Cranes lies with the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot shirk from its duty to evaluate its own legal position and take the necessary measures to determine if there was a need to advance such a case, even if in the alternative. It is not commercially sensible or plausible for the plaintiff to simply equate the first defendant’s response that the Overhead Cranes would be dismantled and stored in parts and/or not tampered with to a confirmation by the first defendant that there was <span class="font-italic">no deterioration </span>in the condition or diminution in the value of the Overhead Cranes throughout the period that it was within the first defendant’s custody or that there was no damage. As with any claim, it is for the plaintiff to seek the relevant evidence before deciding whether it should pursue that claim. The same goes for a counterclaim or a defence to a remedy. If the plaintiff was even the least bit concerned with the preservation of the value of the Overhead Cranes, it was up to the plaintiff to evaluate whether it was necessary to advance the required pleadings to safeguard its position, bearing in mind the pleaded claims and reliefs advanced by the first defendant in the Arbitration. This ought to be done by taking the appropriate measures to evaluate the evidential basis for those claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 During the Arbitration, the plaintiff knew that the first defendant sought the remedy of rescission. It would have been aware of the original value of the Overhead Cranes (as the seller under the Contract). It was aware that the first defendant was going to dismantle the Overhead Cranes using a third party. As early as 19 January 2016, the plaintiff (through its solicitors at the time) had requested permission from the first defendant to enter the first defendant’s premises to take photographs and video recordings of the Overhead Cranes <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to their dismantling – clearly, the importance of obtaining and securing contemporaneous evidence on the condition of the Overhead Cranes was not lost on the plaintiff. It would have been aware that it would take time for the Arbitration to run its course; as it turned out, the Arbitration took some four years to conclude. During that entire time, the Overhead Cranes were stored at the first defendant’s premises <span class="font-italic">as evidence</span>. Again, as early as January 2016, the plaintiff had expressly cautioned the first defendant that it was not to tamper with the Overhead Cranes as “the same constitutes evidence in the impending arbitration proceedings”.

</div>
</div> It was also aware that the first defendant had pleaded a claim for disposal costs of the crane parts and/or sale of scrap metal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Taking all of the above into account, it is not outside the realm of reasonable contemplation that the dismantling process, relocation and extended period of storage over time may cause damage to and/or depreciation of the Overhead Cranes, or at the least that the first defendant might advance an argument that the Overhead Cranes were in such a state or had depreciated to a state that they were worth no more than scrap value. Similarly, the prospect of parts going missing from the Overhead Cranes, which was a complex system comprising many components, was also within reasonable contemplation. In my judgment, the plaintiff ought to have made use of the various avenues that were available to seek and obtain information and evidence regarding the condition of the Overhead Cranes, either during or after the dismantling process and during the course of the Arbitration. Its failure to do so is, in my view, inexplicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 To this end, there is force in the defendants’ submission that there were several opportunities open to the plaintiff to seek further information or evidence regarding the condition of the Overhead Cranes. The evidence as to whether there was damage to or destruction of the Overhead Cranes as alleged and/or missing or cannibalised parts was plainly available for the plaintiff to discover. As mentioned at [97] above, there were procedural avenues available to the plaintiff under the SIAC Rules; indeed, Mr Kronenburg does not contend otherwise. The fact that the plaintiff did not think to inquire or investigate further because it <span class="font-italic">assumed</span> that there would be no change (apart from wear and tear) to the condition of the Overhead Cranes (on the basis of the first defendant’s confirmation that it would not tamper with the evidence), amounts in my judgment, to a failure to act with reasonable diligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I find support for my conclusion in the approach taken by Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">BVU</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ang JC considered the availability of orders that a party could have requested for within the relevant arbitration rules. In that case, Ang JC considered that the applicant “could have requested for the documents that were the subject of the subpoena during the arbitration if it truly believed that these categories of documents were crucial” (at [73]). The question was why it did not do so. He rejected the applicant’s argument that it “had no means of knowing or ascertaining the existence of internal documents in the [other party’s] possession” (at [74]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I similarly reject the plaintiff’s argument that there must have first been a “trigger” to indicate that there was a possibility that the Overhead Cranes would be in a damaged or cannibalised state before the plaintiff could be expected to advance the relevant pleadings or obtain evidence of the actual condition of the Overhead Cranes post-dismantling. It is no answer to say that the first defendant did not disclose anything of note. As I have found at [82] above, the first defendant was not required to do so given that the issue was not put before the Arbitrator and therefore was legally immaterial. Further, the first defendant was not relying on any information or evidence relating to the condition of the Overhead Cranes to advance its own case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Mr Kronenburg relied on a passage from the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span> (at [63]) where Lord Sumption reasoned that the basis on which the law unravels judgments obtained by fraud is that “a reasonable person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom he deals” and is “not expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing that other persons are dishonest unless he knows that they are”. Mr Kronenburg argues that similarly, the plaintiff was entitled to take the statements by the first defendant that the Overhead Cranes had been dismantled and not tampered with at face value and had no reason to suspect that it was dishonest in making these assertions. For the reasons below, I disagree that <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span> offers any assistance to the plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Firstly, as far as the law currently stands in Singapore, the position adopted in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [46] and [54]), namely, that for judgments obtained by fraud there is no requirement to show that the fraud could not be uncovered with reasonable diligence in the earlier proceedings, does not appear to have found favour in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">particularly</span> in the context of attempts to set aside arbitral awards alleged to have been obtained or that are tainted by fraud – the cases of <span class="font-italic">Swiss Singapore</span>, <span class="font-italic">Dongwoo</span><span class="font-italic"> Mann</span>+<span class="font-italic">Hummel</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd v Mann</span>+<span class="font-italic">Hummel</span><span class="font-italic"> GmbH</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 871, <span class="font-italic">BVU</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span> have all accepted and reaffirmed this requirement as part of our law. Lord Sumption’s statement above was made, and is to be understood, in the context of the position ultimately taken by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span> that there was <span class="font-italic">no</span> such requirement under English law. Thus, accepting Lord Sumption’s statements above as also representing our law would, in my view, be somewhat inconsistent with the present weight of authority in our jurisprudence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 However, even if I were to accept Lord Sumption’s statements as to the basis on which a court unravels a transaction (including a judgment) obtained by fraud as correct, those statements must be understood in the proper context of the observations preceding them. In particular, they must be understood in the context of Lord Sumption <span class="font-italic">also recognising</span>, in the same paragraph, the principle (based on the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>/abuse of process) that the court considers proceedings to challenge a judgment obtained by fraud as abusive where “the point at issue and the evidence deployed in support of it not only could have been raised in earlier proceedings <span class="font-italic">but should have been</span>” and that “should” in this formulation “refers to something <span class="font-italic">which the law</span> <span class="font-italic">would expect a reasonable person</span> <span class="font-italic">to do</span> <span class="font-italic">in his own interests</span> and in that of the efficient conduct of litigation” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As is evident from the reasons I have given above at [98]–[103], I consider that a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s shoes could <span class="font-italic">and should</span> have, in the factual matrix of this case, taken the necessary steps to (a) plead the necessary reliefs/defences to the claim for rescission; and (b) inspect and assess the condition of the Overhead Cranes for itself at the material times, in order to protect and advance its own interests in the Arbitration; this would be the case <span class="font-italic">even if</span> it was entitled to assume that the first defendant was honest when it stated that the Overhead Cranes had been dismantled and had not been tampered with. Thus, the passage in <span class="font-italic">Takhar</span> that the plaintiff drew my attention to, when read and understood in proper context, does not assist the plaintiff or take its case as far as it wishes to. Otherwise, it would be all too easy for an applicant in a setting aside context to contend that it did not take any steps to discover the new evidence because it was entitled to assume that its counterparty would deal with it honestly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In my judgment, it remains the case that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the requirement that the new evidence could not have been obtained by it with reasonable diligence. It is simply not enough that the plaintiff did nothing because <span class="font-italic">it did not</span> <span class="font-italic">think </span>that it was possible that the Overhead Cranes may have been damaged/destroyed or cannibalised in the course of or after the dismantling process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For the foregoing reasons, the fraud objection is not made out by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I had at [93] above indicated that the question of whether the new evidence was available with the exercise of reasonable diligence is, in this case, also connected to a wider principle which I had referred to at the beginning of this judgment (see [1] above), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a party to an arbitration is expected to raise all issues or arguments that it could and should have raised in the course of the arbitral proceedings.

This inquiry will necessarily be a fact-sensitive one, and much will depend on the precise circumstances of each case … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Mr Kronenburg submits that as a result of the <span class="font-italic">first defendant</span>’s conduct, the plaintiff was precluded from arguing during the Arbitration that the Arbitrator ought not to have ordered the relief of rescission, or if he was minded to do so, to make appropriate deductions therefrom considering the condition of the Overhead Cranes. The plaintiff also did not have the opportunity to argue that the amounts awarded to the first defendant in respect of consequential costs should be correspondingly reduced.

The plaintiff, however, accepts that in this case, there is no act or omission on the part of <span class="font-italic">the Arbitrator</span> that has resulted in any breach of natural justice, which is typically what an applicant would contend when it raises a breach of natural justice objection (see <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry</span> at [226]).

</div> There was accordingly no breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In my judgment, there has been no breach of the fair hearing rule. I agree with the defendants that the nub of the plaintiff’s complaint is that it was prevented from presenting to the Arbitrator a different defence or counterclaim based on the Overhead Cranes being allegedly damaged or destroyed and/or having parts missing or cannibalised. In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Bloomberry </span>(at [226]–[227]), Ang J rejected the applicants’ arguments on breach of natural justice on a similar basis. The learned Judge stated that she understood the applicant’s case “more appropriately, to be described as one where they were arguably deprived of an opportunity to present a <span class="font-italic">different case </span>rather than one where there were unable to present their case <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Therefore, it is difficult to see <span class="font-italic">how</span> the <span class="font-italic">audi</span><span class="font-italic"> alteram partem </span>rule has been breached.” [emphasis added]. I can do no better than to echo that conclusion here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 As I stated above (at [107]), it is the plaintiff’s duty to seek and adduce evidence regarding the condition of the Overhead Cranes and to take all the relevant points in its pleadings and submissions if there was a basis for it, however slight. Where it has failed to do so, it cannot be permitted, at the setting-aside stage and after the award has gone against it, to attempt to characterise its dissatisfaction with the outcome as a failure of natural justice. In my judgment, ultimately, the plaintiff is in effect seeking to regain ground from its omission to make the relevant inquiries or obtain the necessary evidence during the Arbitration, <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">its decision</span> to run its case in a certain way, on an assumption or belief that there was no damage to or diminution in the value of the dismantled Overhead Cranes. That is impermissible and I reject the plaintiff’s breach of natural justice objection accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fourth issue: whether the Corrected Final Award is contrary to public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For this ground to succeed, the court must be satisfied that upholding the Final Corrected Award would shock the conscience, be clearly injurious to the public good or violate the forum’s most basic notions of morality and justice (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [59]). Egregious circumstances such as “corruption, bribery or fraud which would violate the basic notions of morality and justice” would allow recourse to the public policy ground (<span class="font-italic">BLB and another v BLC and others </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1169 at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The crux of the plaintiff’s public policy arguments overlaps substantially with those advanced in support of its fraud ground. The plaintiff argues that the Corrected Final Award should be set aside as being contrary to public policy because there was an egregious error of fact in the making of the Corrected Final Award caused by the first defendant’s alleged false representation to and/or deliberate concealment of material facts from the Arbitrator.

If the plaintiff is unsuccessful in establishing fraud on the part of the first defendant, the public policy ground would be a non-starter as the public policy arguments are “wrapped up” with the fraud arguments.

Given that I have rejected the plaintiff’s allegations that the first defendant had dishonestly concealed the state of the Overhead Cranes from the Arbitrator or made false representations during the Arbitration (see [79] above), the public policy objection which is grounded on those same allegations also fails. In any event, it could only, at best, be said that the Arbitrator had made the Corrected Final Award without being cognisant that there <span class="font-italic">could</span> have been some damage or deterioration to the condition of the Overhead Cranes.
