        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant execution debtor, South East
                    Enterprises (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”), commenced
                    proceedings against the respondents for losses it allegedly suffered during the
                    execution of a writ of seizure and sale against machinery belonging to it. The
                    first respondent, Hean Nerng Holdings Pte Ltd (“the First
                    Respondent”), was the execution creditor, and the second respondent,
                    Mr Sapuan Sanadi (“the Second Respondent”), was the bailiff
                    from the Subordinate Courts who had personal conduct of the execution process.
                    The Appellant now appeals against the High Court’s dismissal of its
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appeal raises some knotty questions of law
                    relating to the process of executing such writs. What are the duties of court
                    bailiffs during the execution process and to whom are these owed? When, if at
                    all, does common law liability arise? How far does such liability, if it exists,
                    extend? Have court bailiffs in Singapore been conferred absolute statutory
                    immunity from suit? Assuming court bailiffs have absolute statutory immunity
                    from suit, can an execution creditor nevertheless be held liable for any
                    instructions given by it? In analysing and responding to these questions, it is
                    plain that a careful balance needs to be struck between protecting bailiffs and
                    execution creditors from frivolous and potentially harassing claims and
                    concurrently protecting the interests of debtors to ensure that they are not
                    prejudiced by negligent, unfair or even malicious execution procedures carried
                    out by misguided or overzealous execution creditors. This is a difficult task as
                    bright lines cannot readily be drawn. This abstruseness has often prompted
                    judicial disquiet; for instance, in <em>Wilson v South Kesteven
                        District Council</em> [2001] 1 WLR 387 at 388, Simon
                    Brown LJ lamented (albeit with some overstatement) that “[i]f ever
                    clarity were needed in the law it is surely with regard to the seizure and sale
                    of a debtor’s goods”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The judgment debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The First Respondent was in the business of
                    renting out storage space at an open air warehouse at No 27 Jalan Buroh,
                    Singapore 619483 (“the warehouse”). In February 2003, the
                    Appellant entered into a warehouse service agreement with the First Respondent
                    for the use of Bays A2 and A3 for the storage of two sets of machine parts. The
                    first set of machine parts formed a plant for the manufacture of wooden hard and
                    soft-boards (“hard and soft-board parts”) and the second set of
                    machine parts formed a plant for the manufacture of wooden particle boards
                    (“particle board parts”). In March 2003, the Appellant contracted
                    for the rental of additional space at Bay A4 of the warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant later fell into arrears in monthly
                    rent which amounted to $27,794.00 by early February 2004. On 9 February
                    2004, the First Respondent commenced Magistrate’s Case Suit No 3070
                    of 2004 against the Appellant to recover the sum and, on 5 March 2004,
                    obtained judgment in default of appearance against the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The writ of seizure and sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 19 March 2004, the First
                    Respondent’s solicitors issued Writ of Seizure and Sale No 2136 of
                    2004 (“the Writ”) for the sum of $29,771.57 (“the judgment
                    debt”) to be executed against the Appellant’s property in the
                    warehouse. The material portion of the Writ read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To the Bailiff,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are directed that you cause to be levied and made out of the <em>property liable to be seized under a Writ of Seizure and Sale
                            which shall be identified by or on behalf of [the First
                            Respondent]</em>, the Plaintiffs / Execution Creditors,
                        as belonging to [the Appellant], the abovenamed
                        Defendants / Execution Debtors now or late of 47 Beach Road,
                        #02-07, Kheng Chiu Building, Singapore 189683, and having their place of
                        business at No. 27 Jalan Buroh, Singapore 619483 <em>by
                            seizure and if it be necessary by sale thereof $29,771.57</em>
                        ($27,794.00 being the sum adjudged, [plus interests, costs and
                        disbursements])… which [the First Respondent] recovered against [the
                        Appellant] by a Judgment bearing the 5<sup>th</sup> day of
                        March 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Writ referred to both “47 Beach
                    Road” and “27 Jalan Buroh” without specifying which
                    was to be the place of execution. This error was compounded by a series of other
                    procedural anomalies. In the Praecipe for Writ of Seizure and Sale bearing the
                    same date, only the Appellant’s “registered office” at 47
                    Beach Road was mentioned. Perhaps as a result of this, the Subordinate Courts
                    Bailiff Section’s (“the Bailiff Section”) “General
                    Notice to Execution Debtor(s)” dated 23 March 2004 to the Appellant
                    and letter to the First Respondent dated 29 March 2004 referred to
                    47 Beach Road as the place of execution. The original date of execution was
                    set at 28 April 2004. By a letter dated 5 April 2004 to the Bailiff
                    Section, the First Respondent’s solicitors clarified that the place of
                    execution was to be 27 Jalan Buroh instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This was then followed by a second letter from
                    the Bailiff Section to the First Respondent dated 29 April 2004 stating
                    that the place and the amended date of execution were, respectively,
                    27 Jalan Buroh and 11 May 2004. By the same letter, the First
                    Respondent was requested to report at the Bailiff Section in the morning of the
                    date of execution to accompany the Second Respondent to the place of execution
                    and to bring along <em>inter alia</em> a typewritten letter
                    of authority and signed indemnity in the prescribed form.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The seizure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 11 May 2004, an authorised employee of
                    the First Respondent, Mr Eugene Lim Chang Chye (“Eugene
                    Lim”), met the Second Respondent at the Bailiff Section and handed the
                    Second Respondent a letter of indemnity dated 11 May 2004 (“the
                    Indemnity”). The Indemnity, which was addressed to “the
                    Bailiff” and signed off by the First Respondent, read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I/We hereby confirm that on the appointed date for
                            execution, the judgment debt remains unsatisfied to the extent of

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I/<em>We hereby authorize [Eugene
                                Lim] to accompany the bailiff to point out the assets of the

                                Buroh</em>, Singapore 619483.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I/<em>We hereby indemnify you and

                                yourself legally liable and against all actions, suits,

                            execution.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Eugene Lim then accompanied the Second
                    Respondent to the warehouse and, upon arrival, pointed out the machinery which
                    was to be seized and which was so seized by the Second Respondent (“the
                    seized items”). It bears mention that the Second Respondent was seizing
                    machinery for the very first time. It is unclear what information Eugene Lim
                    relied upon in assessing the value of the seized items. Indeed, from the record,
                    it appears to us that he took no steps prior or subsequent to the seizure to
                    assess the value of the seized items seized at his behest. The Second Respondent
                    on his part asserts with alacrity that he entirely relied on Eugene Lim when he
                    seized the items (see below at [35] and [82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After pasting seals on the seized items at
                    Bays A2 and A3, the Second Respondent valued the seized items at $15,000 and
                    noted this in the Notice of Seizure and Inventory (Form 94) (“Form
                    94”). There was also an “<u><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Inventory</font></u>” annexed to Form 94, which the Second
                    Respondent completed with the brief description “all machineries and
                    parts of timber at Lot A2 to A3 (inside)”. It transpired during
                    cross-examination of the Second Respondent that this was an inaccurate
                    description of the seized items, which should have been properly described as
                    “machine for cutting timber”. Notwithstanding this error, Eugene
                    Lim signed the indemnities at the bottom of the inventory which provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the above articles seized by the Bailiff were pointed out by me and I
                        indemnify him against any damages for wrongful seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">__________</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Signature of Execution Creditor</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(or his representative)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The entire process of the seizure took about
                    thirty minutes. Before leaving the warehouse, the Second Respondent left a copy
                    of the Writ, Form 94 and a General Notice to Execution Debtors dated
                    11 May 2004 with Eugene Lim. It should be noted that this General Notice
                    was not a document prescribed under the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5
                    2004 Rev Ed). This General Notice to Execution Debtors read:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The auction sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Two weeks later, by a letter dated 26 May
                    2004, the Second Respondent appointed Kiong Chai Woon and Co Pte Ltd
                    (“the Auctioneer”) as the auctioneer to sell the seized items by
                    public auction. Unfortunately, the Auctioneer failed to inspect the seized items
                    prior to putting up the auction advertisement. Consequently, the error in the
                    inventory annexed to Form 94 eventually found its way into the 9 June 2004
                    advertisement in The Straits Times which described the auction items as
                    “Machineries and Parts of Timber (Lots A2 to A3)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The auction took place on 11 June 2004.
                    On the same day, before the auction, Eugene Lim handed the Second Respondent
                    another letter of indemnity in the same terms as the one given on 11 May
                    2004. The auction was attended by 20 to 30 potential bidders who were given
                    about half an hour to inspect the seized items before the start of the auction.
                    There were at least four or five bids before the seized items were sold to the
                    highest bidder, Kim Hock Corporation Pte Ltd (“Kim Hock
                    Corporation”), for $51,500 as scrap metal. We should add that there do
                    not appear to have been any instructions given to the Auctioneer by either of
                    the Respondents to independently value the seized items or fix a reserve price
                    before the commencement of the auction process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Kim Hock Corporation shortly thereafter
                    on-sold the machinery to a business associate, Mr Lau Swee Nguong of Hua
                    Seng Sawmill Co Bhd (“Hua Seng Sawmill”) in Sibu, Sarawak for
                    $132,174. The seized items apparently remain unassembled at Hua Seng
                    Sawmill’s premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ pleadings at the trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At the trial below, the Appellant raised a
                    montage of variegated assertions that the Second Respondent had executed the
                    Writ negligently and in breach of numerous statutory duties, <em>viz</em>, (a) failure to provide adequate notice of seizure;
                    (b) failure to sufficiently particularise the seized items;
                    (c) excessive seizure; (d) failure to publish an adequate
                    advertisement describing the true nature of the seized items; (e) failure
                    to give adequate notice of sale; (f) sale of machinery which had not been
                    seized pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale and (g) failure to sell at
                    the best possible price. Its main complaints related to the alleged excessive
                    seizure followed by undervalue sale of the seized items, which the Appellant
                    asserted bore a market value of $1,224,294.50. It relied on two documents to
                    support this claimed worth of the machine parts: (a) a contract dated
                    28 February 2001 providing that a Vietnamese company, Ngan Linh TNHH
                    Company Ltd, was to buy the hard and soft-board parts for US$441,000 (“NL
                    contract”); and (b) a “subject-to-contract” agreement
                    dated 8 May 2004 providing that a Pakistani buyer, Best Chipboard
                    Industries, was to pay US$295,000 for the particle board parts
                    (“BC contract”). It also sought to make the First Respondent
                    jointly and severally liable by arguing that the Second Respondent had acted as
                    the First Respondent’s agent during the seizure and sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Second Respondent denied that there had
                    been any breach on his part and argued that he was, in any event, immune under
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“Subordinate Courts Act”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No officer of a subordinate court charged with the duty of executing any
                        writ … shall be liable to be sued for the execution of or attempting
                        to execute such writ … unless he knowingly acted in excess of the
                        authority conferred upon him by such writ, summons, warrant, order, notice
                        or other mandatory process of the court in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As for the First Respondent, it argued that even if the Second
                    Respondent was held liable, no agency relationship existed between them so as to
                    give rise to liability on its own part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    dismissed the Appellant’s claims, holding that the Second Respondent was
                    not in breach of any common law or statutory duty. The Judge agreed with the
                    Second Respondent that s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act would in any
                    event have shielded him from liability. In this regard, the Judge held that
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act protected the bailiff from the
                    consequences of any breach of his statutory as well as common law duties, and
                    that such statutory immunity would be displaced only where there was actual
                    knowledge or wilful blindness of excess of authority on the bailiff’s
                    part. The Judge found that the Second Respondent did not in fact act in excess
                    of authority, let alone “<em>knowingly</em>”
                    act in excess of authority [emphasis in original] (see <em>South
                        East Enterprises (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hean Nerng Holdings Pte Ltd and
                        anor</em> [2012] 3 SLR 864 (“the Judgment”) at
                    [57]). The Judge then held that the First Respondent could not in any event be
                    liable as no agency relationship arose between the First and Second
                    Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s submissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant has, on appeal, abandoned most
                    heads of its original claim against the Second Respondent for breaches of duty
                    and has confined its submissions to that of excessive seizure. It made three
                    primary submissions. First, that the Judge erred in finding that there was no
                    excessive seizure, and should have placed weight on the fact that Hua Seng
                    Sawmill subsequently bought the seized items for S$132,174. Second, that
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act did not exonerate the Second
                    Respondent from the consequences of his breaches as it deals only with
                    “excess of authority claims” and has nothing to do with common law
                    claims. Third, that the Judge was wrong to conclude that the Second Respondent
                    was not the First Respondent’s agent in executing the Writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondents’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The First and Second Respondents’ cases
                    on appeal echo their submissions made at trial. The Second Respondent insists
                    that he had not seized property worth well in excess of the judgment debt and,
                    even if he had been negligent in that respect, he is protected under
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The First Respondent argues that an execution
                    creditor only assumes responsibility for the bailiff’s acts where the
                    execution creditor has intervened in the bailiff’s performance of a writ
                    of execution, or has identified himself with the bailiff’s wrongful acts.
                    It argues that there was no evidence of such intervention or instructions to the
                    Second Respondent, who had acted independently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The issues before the court are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there has been an excessive
                        seizure and whether the Second Respondent exercised a reasonable and honest
                        discretion in choosing how much of the Appellant’s property to be
                        seized (“Issue 1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Second Respondent was nonetheless protected
                        under s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act (“Issue 2”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the
                        First Respondent may be made liable for any excessive seizure by the Second
                        Respondent (“Issue 3”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A bailiff may be sued at common law for
                    wrongful execution, which may occur in any of three ways, <em>viz</em>, (a) where the execution is authorised by neither the
                    judgment nor the writ (<em>eg</em>, where the execution is
                    excessive, carried out at the wrong address or against the wrong person’s
                    goods); (b) where it is issued maliciously or without reasonable cause; and
                    (c) where it is done in breach of common law powers or procedure laid down
                    by the rules of court (see John Kruse, <em>The Law of Seizure of
                        Goods: Debtor’s Rights and Remedies</em> (Barry Rose Law
                    Publishers, 2000) (“<em>Law of Seizure of
                    Goods</em>”) at pp 68-69).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For the present case, we are only concerned
                    with one particular wrong, namely, excessive seizure. The bailiff has a duty to
                    seize only such quantity of goods as would be reasonably sufficient to pay the
                    amount, and where the bailiff seizes more, <em>prima
                        facie</em>, he is a wrongdoer (<em>Gawler v Chaplin and
                        ors</em> (1848) 154 ER 590 at 592, <em>Watson v
                        Murray &amp; Co</em> [1955] 2 QB 1 (“<em>Watson</em>”) at 12, <em>Moore v Lambeth County
                        Court Registrar and Others (No 2)</em> [1970] 1 QB 560
                        (“<em>Moore</em>”) at 572). This is also
                    the position in Australia (see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Australia</em>, vol 20 (Butterworths, 1995) (“<em>Halsbury’s Australia</em>”) paras 325-9905
                    and 325-9915, and Bernard Cairns, <em>Australian Civil
                        Procedure</em> (Lawbook Co, 9th Ed, 2011) at
                p 741).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We should add that in Singapore, the execution
                    creditor or his representative is required to identify the property (other than
                    real property) to be seized by the bailiff. This is mandated by Form 82
                    (“Writ of Seizure and Sale”) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), and Form 88
                    in the previous Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed), which
                    state that the property to be seized “shall be identified by or on behalf
                    of [the execution creditor]”. In other words, the property to be seized
                    shall either be identified by the execution creditor, or by someone authorised
                    by the execution creditor to identify the property to be seized on the execution
                    creditor’s behalf. This is a crucial step of the process in which the
                    execution creditor has to ensure that only the appropriate amount of items owned
                    by the judgment debtor are seized (see below at [79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Traditionally, liability for wrongful seizure
                    seemed to be strict, and did not seem to be fault-based, <em>viz</em>, the wrong was not dependent on the conduct of the bailiff
                    (see <em>Watson</em> at 12 and <em>Moore</em> at 570). In <em>Steel Linings Limited and
                        anor v Bibby &amp; Co</em> [1993] RA 27 (“<em>Steel Linings</em>”) the English Court of Appeal introduced a
                    refinement when it stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be noted in this regard that to be proved excessive the value of
                        the goods seized must be clearly disproportionate to the arrears and
                        charges, taking into consideration the conditions under which a forced sale
                        of the effects must take place; <em>to avoid an excessive
                            distress all that is required is that the distrainor should exercise a
                            reasonable and honest discretion in estimating what the goods will
                            realise</em> at auction; he need not consider what value the
                        ratepayer himself could have obtained for them or what they would be worth
                        to a business successor. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This introduced a defence to excessive seizure
                    such that where the bailiff, when choosing how much of the judgment
                    debtor’s property to seize, exercised a reasonable and honest discretion
                    in estimating what the goods will realise at auction, the bailiff will not be
                    liable for excessive seizure. In our view, this measured approach strikes the
                    desired balance between the need to protect the debtors from excessive seizure,
                    and the need to protect court bailiffs from spurious litigation. We would add
                    that the bailiff has the burden of showing that he exercised both a reasonable
                        <em>and</em> honest discretion in estimating what the
                    goods will realise at auction once the debtor proves that there has been an
                    excessive seizure of its property. On the issue of the honest exercise of the
                    discretion, we should point out that this is also relevant as a prerequisite to
                    the statutory immunity (whenever a discretion is exercised) as a bailiff must
                    not knowingly exceed his authority (see discussion on s 68 of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act below at [44]–[56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We are of the view that this defence is also
                    available to an execution creditor or his representative who identifies the
                    items to be seized, and who would otherwise be liable for the bailiff’s
                    wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Since the bailiff is confined to seizing
                    sufficient goods to cover the debt, and is not necessarily entitled to all the
                    goods on the premises, the seizure must <em>involve some process
                        of</em> selecting and securing items (<em>Law of
                        Seizure of Goods</em> at p 117). For example, as a general
                    principle, while there is no basis for an excessive seizure claim, if there
                    appears to be only one thing to seize, even if its value might considerably
                    exceed the sum due, liability for excessive seizure may arise where the bailiff
                    had the opportunity to seize fewer goods or goods of lesser value than <em>he actually seizes</em>. As Lord Ellenborough observed in
                        <em>Field v Mitchell</em> [1806] 6 Esp 71
                        (“<em>Field</em>”) at 72 (see, also,
                        <em>Roden v Eyton (</em>1848) 6 CB 427 at 430-431,
                        <em>Avenell v Croker and another</em> (1828) Mood &amp;
                    M 172 at 173-174, and <em>Law of Seizure of Goods</em> at
                    p 66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a distinction between the cases, where there is but one thing
                        which can be distrained, and where there are many, and so the distress is
                        divisible. <em>If there is but one thing which can be taken,
                            so that it must be taken, or the party must go without his distress, for
                            taking it no action lies, though it much exceeds the sum for which the
                            distress is taken : but if there are several articles of some value, and
                            there is much more taken than is sufficient to satisfy the rent and
                            expen[s]es; this action is maintainable</em>, <em>and express malice is not necessary to the maintaining of the action,
                            nor required to be proved</em> ; but it is not for every trifling
                        excess that this action is maintainable, it must be disproportionate to some
                        extent, and if disproportionate to an excess, the action is clearly
                        maintainable. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     To succeed in an excessive seizure claim, the
                    plaintiff must show that the seizure was obviously excessive or clearly
                    disproportionate to the debt <em>(Moore</em> at 570 and
                    572, and <em>Steel Linings</em>), <em>eg</em>, where £100 of goods were seized for a debt of less than
                    £1 <em>(Baker v Wicks</em> [1904] 1 KB 743 at
                    747-748), or where property worth about £87 was seized in satisfaction of a
                    debt of at best £4 5s <em>(Moore</em> at 570). A
                    trifling excess would not do (<em>Field</em> at 72). In
                    assessing whether the value of the goods seized had been clearly
                    disproportionate to the debt, the court should take into consideration the
                    conditions under which a forced sale of the goods takes place (<em>Law of Seizure of Goods</em> at p 66 and <em>Steel Linings</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Two questions arise in this regard, <em>viz</em>, (a) whether there was excessive seizure; and
                    (b) if there was an excessive seizure, whether the Second Respondent, when
                    choosing how much of the Appellant’s property to seize, exercised a
                    reasonable and honest discretion in estimating what the goods will realise at
                    auction to avoid excessive seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Excessive seizure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellant’s case at trial was that
                    the seized items were worth $1,224,294.50, vastly in excess of the judgment
                    debt. That valuation, which was based on the values of the NL contract and the
                    BC contract (see [15] above), was rejected by the Judge for reasons set out in
                    [95]–[99] of the Judgment, which we agree with. Those reasons need not be
                    rehearsed here since the Appellant has not, on appeal, sought to persist with
                    its original assertion that the seized items were worth $1,224,294.50. Instead,
                    the main evidence on which Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Cheong Yuen Hee
                    (“Mr Cheong”), relies in his written and oral submissions to
                    prove excessive seizure was the resale price of $132,174 to Hua Seng Sawmill.
                    Notwithstanding the earlier overstatement in the Appellant’s case about
                    the value of the seized items which the Judge rightly rejected, we are inclined
                    to find that the sale and resale prices are in reality indicative of an
                    excessive seizure by the Second Respondent for the following
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     First, we note that even if the sale price to
                    Kim Hock Corporation reflected the true worth of the seized items -which we do
                    not accept, given that the mis-description of the seized items may have
                    attracted the wrong group of bidders -that figure of $51,500, was almost twice
                    the amount of the judgment debt. Second, and as Mr Cheong rightly argued,
                    the sale to Hua Seng Sawmill showed that, even as scrap metal, the seized items
                    were worth at least $132,174, <em>ie</em>, 4.5 times the
                    judgment debt. Mr Cheong’s argument was plausibly supported by the
                    sale invoice dated 30 July 2004, which described the seized items sold as
                        “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">machine </font><em><font style="text-transform: uppercase;">scrap</font></em>” [emphasis added]. Mr Lim Kim
                    Hock of Kim Hock Corporation also testified that he had sold the seized items to
                    Hua Seng Sawmill as scrap metal. This on-sale took place shortly after the
                    auction in June and the seizure in May, and is cogent evidence of the worth of
                    the seized items during the material period. Significantly, even after a 20%
                    discount is applied to reflect the forced sale value of the seized items (the
                    First Respondent’s expert valuer, Mr Robert Khan, testified that a
                    20% discount is typically applied to the market value to reflect the forced sale
                    value), the resultant figure of $105,739.20 would still be about 3.5 times the
                    judgment debt of $29,771.57, <em>ie</em>, clearly
                    disproportionate to the judgment debt. In the circumstances, we are prepared to
                    conclude that the seizure was obviously excessive and clearly disproportionate
                    to the debt. Applying the 20% discount to take into account the forced sale
                    value, the hypothetical bailiff could have seized items that would have a market
                    value of $35,725.88 so as to satisfy the judgment debt. Although this figure is
                    used for the purposes of calculating the loss, we emphasise that the Second
                    Respondent was not required to seize items with a value that would coincide with
                    this figure because a bailiff will only be liable for excessive seizure if the
                    seizure was obviously excessive or clearly disproportionate to the debt (see
                    above at [29]). The excessive seizure caused the Appellant a loss of $96,448.12,
                    being the difference between the market value ($132,174) and the value of the
                    items that should have been seized to satisfy the judgment debt
                    ($35,725.88).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Reasonable <em>and</em> honest
                discretion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We are of the view that the Second Respondent
                    plainly did not exercise a reasonable discretion in estimating what the goods
                    would realise at an auction when he chose how much of the Appellant’s
                    property to seize, so as to avoid excessive seizure. The one consistently
                    disturbing thread in his testimony was his obvious confusion as to the nature
                    and value of the items he was seizing, as well as the quantity of goods seized.
                    When asked by the Judge whether he knew how much items were seized, he replied
                    “I got no idea what item I seized”. His lack of even a basic
                    understanding of the nature and value of the seized items was starkly
                    underscored during cross-examination, when he admitted that he was unable to
                    describe the seized items in the inventory annexed to Form 94 and had to
                    rely on Eugene Lim and some other workers who were also on the premises to pen
                    the description:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. Now, if it is machine to cut timber …
                            Why did you describe it as, “All machineries and parts of
                            timber”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Because on---on that list---because on---<em>the only conclusion given to me is, er, from the

                            representative and the---this, er, people there.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     What we found troubling was the Second
                    Respondent’s failure to take even basic steps to ensure the accurate
                    seizure of items in the face of his inexperience and lack of familiarity with
                    the subject matter of the seizure. It bears emphasising that while a bailiff is
                    not obliged to obtain independent valuation in every case, he must, at the very
                    least, have a basic grasp of the nature and value of what he is seizing in order
                    to avoid an excessive seizure. Surely, the Second Respondent could not have
                    properly carried out a process of “selecting” the items to be
                    seized when he had absolutely no idea what he was seizing and entirely relied on
                    Eugene Lim. His own admission as to his unfamiliarity with the items he was
                    seizing also rendered unconvincing his insistence that he had independently
                    appraised the items at Bays A2 and A3. On the contrary, the fact that the Second
                    Respondent seized only some of the items in Bays A2 and A3 but not all of the
                    items in Bays A2 and A3, coupled with his lack of a basic understanding of the
                    nature and value of the seized items, only go to show that the seizure was an
                    arbitrary process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Further, we find persuasive the
                    Appellant’s contention that the Second Respondent had allowed himself to
                    be entirely “directed” by Eugene Lim as he had appeared content to
                    rely on the latter’s vague description of the seized items, and had not
                    attempted to even begin to seek more specific details to enable him to
                    accurately complete the inventory annexed to Form 94:</p>

                            what are all these items? Okay, now <em>what did he tell

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This was highly unsatisfactory since the
                    inventory annexed to Form 94 is absolutely vital for all parties involved in the
                    execution process. It forms part of the notice of seizure and provides tangible
                    evidence of <em>what debt</em> is being enforced and on
                        <em>what goods</em> this enforcement has been effected
                    (John Kruse, <em>Sources of Bailiff Law</em>
                    (PP Publishing, 2012) (“<em>Sources of Bailiff
                        Law</em>”) at p 109). It <em>inter
                        alia</em> protects the execution creditor by showing the items against
                    which the debt is secured, enables a debtor to take court action if goods not
                    included in the inventory were removed and sold, and enables third party
                    claimants to the seized goods to initiate court action. <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the bailiff, the inventory also forms part of the
                    evidence that a levy has taken place and serves to guide the bailiff during his
                    subsequent removal of the goods for sale (<em>Sources of Bailiff
                        Law</em> at p 110). In this regard, it is crucial that the stated
                    inventory be precise and not vague. Regrettably, the Second Respondent’s
                    lackadaisical attitude in effecting the seizure was again reflected when he
                    failed to draw Eugene Lim’s attention to his description of the seized
                    items in the inventory annexed to Form 94 (which, as mentioned at [10]
                    above, was in error) despite his unfamiliarity with the subject of
                    seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Although not directly relevant to the issue of
                    excessive seizure, we observe that the Second Respondent’s conduct
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the auction also left much to be
                    desired. It transpired during cross-examination that he was unaware that the
                    Auctioneer had not inspected the seized items before preparing the
                    advertisement. Instead, he appeared quite content to assume that the necessary
                    inspection had been carried out:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When [the Auctioneer] sent you the draft
                            advertisement, did you ask him whether he has gone to the site to
                            inspect the goods or not? Did you ask him?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Right. When you got the draft advertisement, you
                            thought that the auctioneer had gone to the site, inspected and came to
                            a---this---to an agreement with your description, so he put it on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We note the practice requirement that
                    auctioneers are to inspect the goods before preparing the advertisement for
                    auction. The Second Respondent did not check whether this inspection had been
                    duly completed by the Auctioneer despite his knowledge of such a
                    requirement:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… before you did the seizure here, is it the
                            practice that the Court requires the auctioneer to go down, inspect and
                            then prepare the advertisement?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Actually by right, it’s yes, but---but, mm,
                            the Bailiff did not do that and then---and then suddenly the Chief
                            Bailiff realised that, then they give instruction to inspect the---to

                            Chief Bailiff realised it after this case---</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     This was an unsatisfactory state of affairs
                    when viewed in the light of the fact that the Second Respondent had absolutely
                    no idea precisely what he had seized and what the value of those items might
                    have been. Common prudence would have required that he at least checked that the
                    Auctioneer had inspected the seized items before adopting the description set
                    out in the inventory annexed to Form 94.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the circumstances, we are of the view that
                    the Second Respondent <em>did not exercise a reasonable
                        discretion in estimating what the goods would realise at auction</em>
                    when he chose how much of the Appellant’s property to seize, so as to
                    avoid excessive seizure. Therefore, the defence to excessive seizure does not
                    apply, and the Second Respondent is not exempt from liability for excessive
                    seizure.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Counsel for the Second Respondent,
                    Mr Chou Sean Yu (“Mr Chou”), accepts that the Second
                    Respondent could have done more to find out about the nature and value of the
                    seized items. However, he argues that s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act
                    nonetheless absolved the Second Respondent of any liability in this
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Mr Cheong disagrees, arguing that
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act deals only with “excess of
                    authority claims” and does not deal with breach of common law duties.
                    This argument is, however, difficult to follow, since excessive seizure is but
                    one example of an unauthorised execution in excess of authority (<em>Halsbury’s Australia</em> at para 325–9915

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Scope of s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In construing the scope of s 68(2) of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act, consideration must be given to the “occupational
                    hazard” faced by bailiffs of <em>inter alia</em>
                    seizing goods not belonging to the execution debtor (Claire Sandbrook, <em>Enforcement of a Judgment</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    11th Ed, 2011) at para 12–149). Protection of the bailiffs
                    against such risks must however be also fairly balanced against the need to
                    protect private rights affected by the bailiffs’ actions (Balkin &amp;
                    Davis, <em>Law of Torts</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths,
                    4th Ed, 2009) at para 6.48). Against this backdrop, how far does
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act extend? Does it cloak the Second
                    Respondent with immunity from liability arising from his numerous lapses?
                    Specifically, does it protect the Second Respondent from liability arising from
                    his excessive seizure?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We are of the view that a proper reading of
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act is that the protection extends to
                    excessive seizure claims. Indeed, no liability would attach to a bailiff who
                    seized excessively unless he had done so “knowingly”, a finding
                    which does not appear to be supported by the state of evidence
                here.</p>

                    when the Subordinate Courts Bill was introduced in 1970. Some assistance may

                    and 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act may have come from a similar provision
                    in India’s Judicial Officers’ Protection Act 1850 (“the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The first part of the Indian Act, which
                    confers judicial immunity on judicial officers, is broadly similar to
                    s 68(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act: to invoke the exemption, the
                    judicial officer has to show that he had in good faith believed he had
                    jurisdiction. The latter part of the Indian Act extends protection to court
                    officers, such protection being derivative of or ancillary to the immunity
                    conferred on judicial officers (Law Commission of India, <em>One
                        Hundred and Fourth Report on the Judicial Officers’ Protection Act,

                        Immunity</em> (Clarendon Press, 1993) at pp 114-115), and is
                    replicated in s 14(2) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964
                    (“the Malaysian Act”), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No officer of any court or other person bound to execute the lawful
                        warrants or orders of any Judge or other person acting judicially shall be
                        liable to be sued in any civil court <em>for the
                            execution</em> of any warrant or order which he would be bound to
                        execute if within the jurisdiction of the person issuing the same. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This derivative immunity in s 14(2) of
                    the Malaysian Act is however less broad, and only extends to the <em>act of executing</em> the order as opposed to the <em>manner of its execution</em>, with the consequence that an
                    officer of court who carries out the execution negligently is <em>not</em> protected because the negligence relates to the manner of
                    execution, rather than just the act of execution (<em>Wong Cheong
                        Kai and ors v Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank &amp; anor</em> [1996]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Apart from s 14(2) of the Malaysian Act
                    which provides protection “for the execution” of court orders,
                    there is, additionally, s 14(3) of the Malaysian Act, which protects
                    sheriffs and bailiffs in respect of damage caused “in effecting, or
                    attempting to effect the execution”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No sheriff, bailiff or other officer of the Court charged with the duty of

                        property before judgment, shall be liable to be sued in any civil court
                            <em>in respect of any property seized by him, or in
                            respect of damage caused to any property in effecting, or attempting to
                            effect the seizure</em>, unless it shall appear that he knowingly
                        acted in excess of the authority conferred upon him by the writ, warrant or
                        order in question, and he shall not be deemed to have acted knowingly in
                        excess of his authority merely by reason of knowing of the existence of a
                        dispute as to the ownership of the property so seized. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On its face, “in effecting, or
                    attempting to effect the seizure” in s 14(3) of the Malaysian Act
                    embraces a wider range of situations than “the execution” referred
                    to in s 14(2) of the Malaysian Act. This suggests that s 14(3) of the
                    Malaysian Act may extend protection to the <em>manner of
                        execution</em>, rather than just <em>the act of
                        executing</em> the order. Since s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts
                    Act is similar to s 14(3) of the Malaysian Act as both provisions refer to
                    “in effecting, or attempting to effect”, rather than just
                    “the execution”, this supports the proposition that the
                    bailiff’s immunity under s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act
                    extends to the manner of the execution, rather than being merely confined to the
                    act of executing. Since excessive seizure on the part of the bailiff relates to
                    the manner of the execution, this lends support to Mr Chou’s
                    submission that s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act protects bailiffs
                    from liability arising from excessive seizure committed in the course of
                    executing a writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Further, we find persuasive the contention
                    that “the execution of or attempting to execute” and “in
                    effecting or attempting to effect execution” in s 68 of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act can be read widely to include a bailiff’s excessive
                    seizure relating to the manner of execution. Two Indian Supreme Court cases give
                    some tangential guidance on this issue (see <em>Anowar Hussain v
                        Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee and others</em> AIR 1965 SC 1651 and <em>Rachapudi Subba Rao v Advocate-General, AP</em> (1981)
                    2 SCR 320 (“<em>Rachapudi</em>”)). They
                    affirm that “jurisdiction” in the Indian Act encompassed the
                    erroneous <em>exercise of</em> jurisdiction, although this
                    was not explicitly set out in the Indian Act. As was astutely observed by the
                    court in <em>Rachapudi</em> at 325-326:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The expression “jurisdiction” in this Section has not been
                        used in the limited sense of the term, as connoting the
                        ”power” to do or order to do the particular act complained of,
                        but is used in a wide sense as meaning “generally the authority of
                        the Judicial Officer to act in the matters”. Therefore, if the
                        judicial officer had the general authority to enter upon the enquiry into
                        the cause, action, petition or other proceeding <em>in the
                            course of which </em><b><em>the impugned act was done
                            or ordered by him in his judicial capacity, the act, even if erroneous,
                            will still be within his ‘jurisdiction’</em></b>, and the
                        mere fact that it was erroneous will not put it beyond his
                        “jurisdiction”. <em>Error in the exercise of
                            jurisdiction is not to be confused with lack of jurisdiction in
                            entertaining the cause or proceeding</em>. It follows that if the
                        judicial officer is found to have been acting in the discharge of his
                        judicial duties, then, in order to exclude him from the protection of this
                        statute, the complainant has to establish that (1) the judicial officer
                        complained against was acting without any jurisdiction whatsoever, and
                        (2) he was acting without good faith in believing himself to have
                        jurisdiction. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Given the broad language of s 68(2) of
                    the Subordinate Courts Act, which refers to “the execution of or
                    attempting to execute such writ”, and reading the provision expansively,
                    we agree with the Judge that the protection provided under s 68(2) of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act extends to excessive seizure claims <em>“unless [the bailiff] knowingly acted in excess of the
                        authority”</em> [emphasis added]. Even if the bailiff exceeds
                    his authority he cannot be held responsible unless it is established that he had
                    knowledge that he was acting beyond his authority. It may be more difficult to
                    establish such wilfulness than the absence of good faith prescribed in
                    s 68(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Flowing from the above analysis, a bailiff who
                    would otherwise be liable for excessive seizure is protected by s 68(2) of
                    the Subordinate Courts Act. The s 68(2) protection is only stripped where
                    it could be said that the bailiff had knowingly seized in excess of the judgment
                    debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On the present facts, the Second Respondent
                    could by no measure be said to have “knowingly” caused such a
                    state of affairs. Although he failed to take reasonable steps to find out the
                    nature and true worth of the seized items, there was nothing in the “old
                    and rusty” appearance of the seized items which might have alerted him to
                    any particular need for a valuer to be appointed. Indeed, the old and rusty
                    appearance was confirmed by several witnesses. In these circumstances, we are
                    not prepared to find that there were sufficient facts suggesting to the Second
                    Respondent that the seized items were in fact highly valuable in themselves. In
                    the light of the foregoing, the Second Respondent is exempt from liability for
                    excessive seizure, and the claim against the Second Respondent is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There is of course an understandable
                    discomfort with according such wide immunity to bailiffs since due consideration
                    must also be given to the debtor’s interests. As mentioned at [2] and [44]
                    above, the protection of bailiffs must be balanced against the need to protect
                    the interests of debtors. <em>In this regard, a
                        “check” indeed exists by way of the potential liability of the
                        execution creditor who oversees the seizure without adequately guiding the
                        bailiff on the proper and accurate seizure of property.</em> We pause
                    here to observe that the general practice and procedures observed by Subordinate
                    Court bailiffs today are very different from those ascribed to the Second
                    Respondent. Better safeguards to protect debtors have also been put in place.
                    For instance, in addition to more rigorous recording procedures of seized items,
                    digital records are also maintained. Every bailiff now utilises a digital camera
                    to take photographs of seized items. This allows written records to be
                    independently verified in the event of a dispute. Further, for cases involving
                    the sale of unusual or more valuable items, an independent valuer will be
                    appointed to make an assessment. Bailiffs are also now more rigorously trained
                    and supervised, and there is closer oversight of their work by judicial officers
                    to ensure that best practices are observed. Taking these developments into
                    account, we are minded to sound a note of caution to future debtors and counsel
                    who might be tempted to extend the ambit of the legal principles we have stated
                    here on excessive seizures – it will be necessary to present a clear case
                    supported by proper valuations (and not vague estimations) that the impugned
                    seizure is plainly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     This brings us to the third issue. Can the
                    Appellant nevertheless recover against the First Respondent on the ground that
                    the Second Respondent was the First Respondent’s agent for the purposes of
                    the seizure and sale?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Before us, Counsel for the First Respondent,
                    Mr Daniel Koh, rightly conceded that the protection extended to the Second
                    Respondent under s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act would not absolve
                    the First Respondent from liability, if any arose by reason of agency or
                    otherwise. This concession was rightly made, since the immunity under
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act is narrowly focussed only on
                    absolving the procedural conduct of the court officer concerned. There is no
                    doubt that the Second Respondent, the actual doer of the wrongful act, did
                    commit the tort. As soon as the tort was committed, a cause of action against
                    both the First and Second Respondents vested in the Appellant (see
                    P S Atiyah, <em>Vicarious Liability in the Law of
                        Torts</em> (Butterworths, 1967) (“<em>Vicarious
                        Liability</em>”) at pp 8 and 307), and although the cause
                    of action against the latter had been statutorily expunged by virtue of
                    s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act, the same cannot be said in relation
                    to the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The role of the bailiff vis-à-vis the execution creditor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Judge held, and the parties accept, that a
                    bailiff is not typically the agent of the execution creditor. This was the
                    position set out in <em>Curtis v Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer (Oriental)
                        Inc</em> [1931] SSLR 42 (“<em>Curtis</em>”), where the Straits Settlements Supreme Court held
                    that the sheriff acting under a valid writ of seizure and sale was in no sense
                    the servant or agent of the execution creditor “who merely sets the Court
                    in motion”. That does not, however, mean that an agency relationship can
                    never arise. By the following observation, the court in <em>Curtis</em> rightly left the door open for an execution creditor to
                    be found liable where the execution creditor actively participates in the
                    execution by the bailiff (at 51–52):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the execution-creditor does not mislead the sheriff, and <em>takes no such active part in the actual execution as to
                            identify himself with any wrongful acts of the sheriff</em> or his
                        officers or agents committed in the course of the execution of the writ,
                        then he is not liable or responsible for such wrongful acts. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The position in England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The law as stated in <em>Curtis</em> is consistent with the English authorities. The default
                    position is that the bailiff is not the execution creditor’s agent, but a
                    “public functionary” with much wider responsibilities to those who
                    set him in motion as well as those against whom the writs are directed
                        (<em>Hooper v Lane</em> [1857] 6 HLC 442 at
                    549-550, <em>In re A Debtor (No 2 of 1977)</em> [1979]
                    1 WLR 956 at 961). As aptly put by Greer LJ in <em>Williams v Williams &amp; Nathan</em> [1937] 2 All ER 559
                        (“<em>Williams</em>”) at 561A, it is
                    “clear to demonstration” that a bailiff executing a judgment of
                    the court acted on behalf of the court as an officer of the court, and not as
                    agent of the judgment creditor (see, also, <em>Wilson v
                        Tumman</em> (1843) 6 Man &amp; G 236 (“<em>Wilson v Tumman</em>”) at 243). This explains why the bailiff
                    need only have regard to the execution creditor’s instructions “so
                    far as they are reasonable” (<em>In re Crook</em>
                    (1894) 63 LJ QB 756 at 757), and why goods seized by him are held in
                    custody of the law, and not in the execution creditor’s possession
                        (<em>Baylis v Bishop of London</em> [1913] 1 Ch
                    127 at 141).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     An agency relationship can nonetheless arise
                    exceptionally where it is shown that the execution creditor intervened to make
                    the bailiff do something which is not legitimately covered by the writ
                        (<em>Williams</em> at 561), <em>ie</em>, where the bailiff acts not under the writ, but on the
                    execution creditor’s directions falling outside the scope of the writ.
                    Otherwise, the default position remains and the bailiff will be deemed to be
                    acting on behalf of the court. Sir Evershed MR noted in <em>Barclays Bank Ltd v Roberts</em> [1954] 3 All ER 107
                        (“<em>Barclays Bank</em>”) at 112 (see,

<em>There is no question here, as it seems to me, such as
                            was in the mind of Greer LJ, of the sheriff of his officers departing,
                            at the instance of a judgment creditor, from the terms of the writ of
                            execution. The sheriff’s officers adhered throughout to the strict
                            terms and command of the writ of possession and, having done so, must
                            prima facie at any rate, on the authority of Williams v Williams &amp;
                            Nathan, be treated as having acted independently of the landlord and as
                            officers of the court.</em> As a matter of principle, it seems to
                        me impossible that the character and quality of their actions were entirely
                        altered because they sought advice and then chose to act on that advice
                        … They cannot, in my judgment, be converted into agents of the
                        persons on whose behalf the advisors were acting … unless, at the
                        very least, it were shown that the sheriff’s officers made it plain
                        that their subsequent actions were only undertaken on the basis of that
                        other person assuming responsibility therefor. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     This appears to be nothing more than the
                    expression of the general principle, as stated in <em>Bowstead
                        &amp; Reynolds</em> at para 8–176, that a person is liable
                    for torts committed by another which he specifically instigates or authorises
                    (see also <em>Law of Seizure of Goods</em> at p 71). As
                    Tindal CJ explained in <em>Wilson v Tumman</em> at 244
                    (endorsed in <em>Morris v Salberg</em> (1889) LR QB 614

<em>If the [execution creditor] had directed the sheriff to

                            previous direction would undoubtedly have made him a trespasser, on the
                            principle that all who procure a trespass to be done are trespassers
                            themselves, and the sheriff would be supposed not to have taken the
                            goods merely under the authority of the writ, but as the servant of the
                            plaintiff.</em> But where the sheriff, acting under a valid writ
                        by the command of the Court and as the servant of the Court, seizes the

<p class="Judg-1">Similar comments were made by Jessel MR in <em>Smith v Keal</em> (1882) 9 QBD 340 (“<em>Smith</em>”) at 351:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the sheriff’s duty to levy execution on the goods of the
                        judgment debtor. <em>If therefore the [judgment
                            creditor’s] solicitor interferes, and directs the sheriff to levy
                            on the goods of another person, he is answerable on the same principle
                            as any one else who directs a trespass.</em> Though the sheriff is
                        an officer of the law he is liable if he commits a trespass, and any one who
                        joins in the trespass is equally liable. … It is not the province of
                        the [judgment creditor’s] solicitor to interfere with the sheriff. The
                        sheriff must ascertain himself whether the goods he seizes are the judgment

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The “agency” referred to in this
                    context therefore does not impose on the bailiff the usual duties of an agent,
                    but operates only to make the execution creditor liable for the bailiff’s
                    misconduct (Tamara Buckwold, “From Sherwood Forest to Saskatchewan: The
                    Role of the Sheriff in a Redesigned Judgment Enforcement System” (2003)
                    66 Sask L Rev 219 at fn 66). As noted in <em>Vicarious
                        Liability</em> at p 136:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is to be noted, in the first place, that a sheriff, in executing a
                        judgment for a court in the ordinary way is not an agent of the judgment
                        creditor for whose acts the creditor can be held liable. If, for example, in
                        executing a writ of <em>fi. fa.</em> the sheriff simply
                        seizes the wrong person’s goods the creditor is not liable. <b><em>And though there are many cases in which the creditor has been
                            held liable for a wrongful seizure they can all be explained as cases in
                            which the creditor has given specific instructions to the sheriff as to
                            the goods to be seized, or the place where they are to be found, etc.
                            </em></b><b>In such circumstances </b><b><em>the creditor becomes liable on the ground that he has himself
                            authorised the specific conduct which turns out to be
                            tortious.</em></b> These are not cases of vicarious liability, for it
                        has been repeatedly said that the sheriff acts as an officer or agent of the
                        court and not of the creditor in executing its judgments. [emphasis added in

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The position in Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There are comparatively few Australian cases
                    discussing the relationship between the bailiff and the execution creditor. The
                    available authorities are however in line with the position in England, as set
                    out from [63]–[65] above. It is, for instance, recognised that the bailiff
                    is an officer of the court (<em>Halsbury’s
                        Australia</em> at para 325-9905 and <em>Owen v
                        Daly</em> [1955] VLR 442 (“<em>Owen</em>”) at 448-449) who is duty bound to act reasonably with
                    due regard to the interests of both the judgment creditor and judgment debtor.
                    As Dean J observed in <em>Owen</em> at 446 (endorsed
                    in <em>Kousal Suncorp-Metway Limited</em> [2011] VSC 312 at
                    [35] and <em>Zhipping Zhou v Ronald Geoffrey Kousal and
                        ors</em> [2012] VSC 187 at [93]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, I think, clearly established that at common law a sheriff selling
                        the chattels, including chattels real, of a judgment debtor is bound to act
                        reasonably in the interests of the judgment creditor and of the judgment
                        debtor in order to obtain a fair price, not necessarily the market value,
                        for it is well recognized that compulsory sales under legal process rarely
                        bring the full value of the property sold …
                        <em>The duty of the sheriff to act reasonably with due regard
                            to the interests of both sides</em> and his liability in damages
                        if he fails to exercise reasonable care has been frequently stated.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As with the position in England, a judgment
                    creditor may nonetheless be exposed to liability in damages resulting from
                    wrongful seizure if he or his solicitor gives misleading directions to the
                    bailiff charged with the execution (<em>Halsbury’s
                        Australia</em> at para 3259-915). This principle was also
                    recognised by Stone J in <em>Sparrow v Cornell</em>
                    (1900) 2 WALR 78 (“<em>Sparrow</em>”) at
                    79:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that in certain cases a direction by the solicitor on the writ,
                        although it forms no portion of the writ, may involve the liability of his
                        client. For instance, in this case <em>the endorsement on the
                            writ that the execution debtor was a patent agent who resides in Perth,
                            might have made the execution creditor liable in the event of the debtor
                            not being such an agent, because the Sheriff might have been misled into
                            seizing at the debtor’s office</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The adverse authorities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There are two cases which contradict the
                    position that a bailiff is generally not an agent of the execution creditor. The
                    Appellant has quite rightly refrained from relying on these authorities on
                    appeal. However, for good measure, we shall briefly explain why these two cases
                    are not authoritative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The first case is <em>In re
                        Caidan</em> [1942] 1 Ch 90 (“<em>Caidan</em>”), where the court held (at 96) that the bailiff
                    is an agent of the person levying distress. It is important to note that
                        <em>Caidan</em> was decided in the context of levying
                    distress, which, unlike in Singapore, was a self-help remedy in England. This is
                    a difference which matters when conceptualising the role of the bailiff
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the person for whom the writ is
                    executed. As Judith Prakash J explained with considerable clarity in
                        <em>Ginsin Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Khoon (trading as Chan
                        Eng Soon Service) and another</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 500
                        (“<em>Ginsin</em>”), distress in
                    Singapore is obtained only after judicial intervention; a writ of distress has
                    to be issued by court order and it is the court bailiff who distrains the
                    tenant’s chattels pursuant to the writ (<em>Ginsin</em> at [7] and [14]). The seizure of the goods is not,
                    therefore, directly effected by the landlord, but aided by the judicial
                    interposition of the court bailiff (<em>Ginsin</em> at
                    [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In other words, writs of distress, like writs
                    of seizure and sale, require judicial intervention in Singapore. The execution
                    creditor merely “sets the court in motion”. The bailiff derives
                    authority from the writ, not the execution creditor. The manner in which the
                    bailiff is expected to perform his function is subject to the Rules of Court and
                    not defined by ad hoc agreement with the execution creditor. Viewed in this
                    light, it becomes less intuitive to regard the court bailiff as the agent of the
                    execution creditor. <em>Caidan</em> is therefore not useful
                    for the purpose of defining the role of the bailiff in Singapore. As the Hong
                    Kong court in <em>Au Tak Chen v Li Hon Ming</em> [1960]
                    HKDCLR 247 held at 252-253:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is abundantly clear that distress for arrears of rent cannot be
                        levied except under a warrant of the Court, obtained under the provisions of
                        the [Distress for Rent Ordinance (Cap. 7)].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am quite satisfied that the bailiff in the Colony is not, and cannot be
                        said to be the agent of a landlord except under certain circumstances an
                        example of which would be the case where the landlord himself is present at
                        the time of the levy and personally directs the bailiff what property to
                        seize. <em>The position of the bailiff in the levying of a
                            distress by a landlord in England is different from that of a bailiff in
                            the Colony having regard to the provisions of the Distress for Rent
                            Ordinance (Cap. 7) whereunder the bailiff acts under a distress warrant
                            issued by the Court and acts therefore as an officer of the
                            Court</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The second case is <em>Heng
                        Chyu Kee v Far East Square Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 651
                        (“<em>Heng Chyu Kee</em>”), where the
                    Singapore High Court observed that a bailiff’s negligence in distraining
                    property could expose the landlord to liability as the bailiff distaining
                    movable property was deemed to be the landlord’s agent (<em>Heng Chyu Kee</em> at [5]). However, the observation was strictly
                        <em>obiter</em> -while the plaintiff rightly asserted
                    that the writ of distress had been negligently executed, her claim failed
                    because she did not prove her damages (<em>Heng Chyu
                        Kee</em> at [14]). Further, as the judge quite rightly pointed out,
                    the issue did not appear to have had been disputed in <em>Heng
                        Chyu Kee</em> (at [25], [32] and [35] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">When will the creditor be liable for a bailiff’s
                wrong?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As set out above (see [62]–[72]), the
                    starting point is that a bailiff is not an agent of the execution creditor.
                    However, the bailiff will be deemed to be an agent for the purpose of assigning
                    liability to the execution creditor where the execution creditor takes an active
                    part in the actual execution so as to identify himself with any wrongful act of
                    the bailiff. In other words, the execution creditor who is found to be liable
                    for the bailiff’s wrong may be seen as a joint tortfeasor. The issue is
                    then in what circumstances the execution creditor can be said to have played a
                    sufficiently active part in the actual execution. Whether the execution creditor
                    has played a sufficiently active part in the execution is in the final analysis
                    always a question of fact, and clear evidence is required to establish this
                        (<em>Smith</em> at 350, <em>Morris</em> at 622).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Plainly, where the execution creditor directs
                    the bailiff to seize items of another person other than the debtor, the
                    execution creditor is liable (see <em>Wilson v Tumman</em>,
                    and <em>Smith</em>, quoted at [65] above). For example, the
                    bailiff in <em>Chedin Mohamed Hashim v Teoh Ong Thor and Chew
                        Chan Seng</em> [1950] 16 MLJ 238 (“<em>Chedin</em>”) seized and sold two lighters which the execution
                    creditor had personally pointed out. Significantly, the execution creditor
                    informed the bailiff that the two lighters were the debtor’s property,
                    though this turned out to be false. The plaintiff, to whom the lighters had been
                    mortgaged, successfully sued both the execution creditor and the purchaser for
                    conversion. The court in <em>Chedin</em> held as follows
                    (at 239):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Bailiff gave evidence that the first defendant personally pointed out
                        the two lighters in question and <em>informed him that they
                            were the property of [the debtor]</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In the present case the first defendant personally indicated the goods
                        of plaintiff to the Sheriff and as they were not those of the execution
                        debtor the sale was wrongful and passed no title.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I find therefore that the sale of these tongkangs was wrongful and the
                        plaintiff is entitled to damages against the defendants for their
                        conversion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is clear mere presence at the scene of
                    execution, as in <em>Williams</em>, would not render the
                    execution creditor liable for the wrongful acts of the bailiffs (Alastair Black,
                        <em>Execution of a Judgment: including other methods of
                        enforcement</em> (Oyez Publishing Limited, 6th Ed, 1979)
                        (“<em>Execution of a Judgment</em>”) at
                    p 59). The debtor in <em>Williams</em> was wrongfully
                    evicted by the bailiff because a portion of the house he occupied was controlled
                    by statute. Greer LJ found that there was no evidence to show that any
                    “special direction” (at 561D) had been given to the bailiff which
                    might make him the execution creditor’s agent. Although the execution
                    creditor, who was present at the time of the eviction, did not tell the bailiff
                    that part of the house was controlled, this was in Greer LJ’s mind
                    “quite different” (at 561H) from saying that the execution
                    creditor had instructed the bailiff to execute the writ in an irregular
                    manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, where the execution creditor is
                    present in a supervisory capacity and fails to intervene to correct any error in
                    the goods seized, the creditor will be liable (<em>Execution of a
                        Judgment</em> at 59 citing <em>Meredith v
                        Flaxman</em> (1831) 5 Car &amp; P 99 (“<em>Meredith</em>”)). The plaintiff in <em>Meredith</em> claimed that the property seized by the bailiffs had
                    belonged to him instead of the execution debtor. The plaintiff sought to make
                    the defendant execution creditor liable for the wrongful seizure.
                    Lord Lyndhurst CB instructed the jury as follows (<em>Meredith</em> at 101):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>If a man employing an officer chooses to attend with
                            the officer, who seizes, in his presence, the goods of a third person,
                            under the execution he has sued out, he makes himself responsible for
                            the officer's act;</em> but, <em>if he is not
                            there, and does not personally interfere in the matter, he is not
                            liable.</em> The questions, therefore, for your consideration will
                        be, whether the goods said to have been transferred were the property of
                        [the plaintiff] or of [the execution debtor]; and, if of [the execution
                        debtor], then whether these particular articles, viz. the two pictures and
                        the table, were the property of [the plaintiff], and were taken among the
                        rest by the authority of [the execution creditor]; for, if they were, then
                        he is liable. It will be for you to say, whether he was so acting as to
                        identify himself with the particular goods taken. As it seems to me, he
                        ought to have pointed out to the officers what was to be taken, and what
                        not. He was there in communication with the officers, and it appears to me,
                        that by this he has made himself responsible for their acts. <em>The question will be, whether these goods with the rest were
                            taken by the direct authority of [the execution creditor]; for, if they
                            were, then he will be liable; if not then these goods must share the
                            same fate as the rest. If you think [the execution creditor] left it
                            entirely to the officer and the broker to act according to their
                            discretion, then he will not be responsible.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Obviously, the execution creditor may only be
                    said to have procured the bailiff’s tort where the bailiff has effectively
                    relied on the execution creditor’s instructions in the discharge of his
                    statutory responsibilities. For example see, <em>Morris</em> at 617 and <em>Lee v Rumilly</em>
                    (1891) 7 TLR 303 (“<em>Lee</em>”), where
                    the execution creditors’ solicitors wrongly endorsed on the writs
                    statements that the debtor resided at certain addresses, which were in fact
                    those of third parties whose goods were thus seized. As the bailiffs in both
                    cases were misled by the solicitors’ endorsements, the execution creditors
                    were liable for trespass upon the third parties’ goods. As long as
                    misleading instructions, which in fact misled, were given, it did not matter
                    that the execution creditor did not mean to mislead the bailiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     
          <em>Morris</em> and
                        <em>Lee</em> may be contrasted against <em>Hewitt v Spiers and Pond (Limited)</em> [1896] 13 TLR
                    64, where misleading instructions were given to the sheriff who was <em>not in fact misled</em>. Lord Esher MR held at 65
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here the solicitors [of the execution creditor] did put the endorsement on
                        the writ. If the endorsement were such as might have misled the
                        sheriff’s officer, and he acted on it, the question whether the
                        sheriff’s officer was in fact misled would be for the jury. But it was
                        proved in this case that the sheriff’s officer twice abstained from
                        acting on the endorsement and refused to levy. <em>The
                            endorsement therefore did not mislead him into acting. … [T]he
                            [creditors] were not liable by reason of the endorsement on the writ of
                            fi. fa., because the sheriff’s officer did not act upon
                            it</em> … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, no liability was attached to the execution creditor in
                        <em>Sparrow</em> because the bailiff in that case had
                    not in fact been misled. Stone J held at 79 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To shew, however, that the Sheriff was not misled, we have only to look at
                        the conduct of the Sheriff’s officer when putting the writ into
                        operation. He went in pursuance of that endorsement and seized goods at the
                        office of the debtor, but refrained from seizing elsewhere until he had
                        obtained further directions. It is clear, therefore, that the Sheriff was
                        not misled into seizing at the residence of the execution debtor by reason
                        of the direction on the writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     We shall now turn to the specific wrong of
                    excessive seizure by the bailiff. The issue to be addressed is when an execution
                    creditor is considered to have taken an active part in the actual execution so
                    as to identify himself with the bailiff’s excessive seizure. As stated
                    above at [24], in Singapore, the execution creditor or his representative is
                    required to identify the property to be seized by the bailiff. This is a crucial
                    step of the process in which the execution creditor has to take responsibility
                    in identifying only the appropriate amount of items owned by the judgment debtor
                    to be seized, and the execution creditor has thus assumed the risk of the
                    bailiff’s excessive seizure. <em>The bailiff who executes a
                        writ is doing so on behalf of the court and not as an agent of the execution
                        creditor. However, when the execution creditor takes an active part in the
                        actual execution by identifying the items to be seized, or assumes the
                        responsibility for identifying the property to be seized, the execution
                        creditor assumes the risk of excessive seizure, and is hence liable for any
                        excessive seizure.</em> Indeed, there are cogent reasons why an
                    execution creditor should be held liable for the seizure of a disproportionate
                    amount of property. If Mr Koh were correct it would mean that there would be a
                    legal black hole in relation to legal liability for excessive seizures. It seems
                    to us on the basis of the above discussion that the law has struck a sensible
                    balance in apportioning responsibility for excessive seizures to the execution
                    creditor by mandating that the execution creditor play an active part in the
                    actual execution by taking responsibility of identifying how much items are to
                    be seized.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Nevertheless, as stated above at [26] to [27],
                    any harshness is mitigated by the fact that an execution creditor will not be
                    liable for the bailiff’s excessive seizure where the execution creditor
                    exercised a reasonable and honest discretion in estimating what the goods will
                    realise at auction, so as to avoid an excessive seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The present facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     We are of the view that, considering the
                    totality of Eugene Lim’s involvement in the Second Respondent’s
                    seizure of goods as the First Respondent’s authorised representative, the
                    First Respondent is liable for the bailiff’s excessive seizure. It is
                    crucial that Eugene Lim’s presence at the warehouse be properly assessed
                    in the context of the established facts including the contemporaneous documents
                    pertaining to the seizure. Those documents unequivocally reveal the critical
                    significance of his role at the warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     There was first the Writ (see [5] above),
                    which instructed the bailiff to seize the Appellant’s property as was to
                    be identified by the First Respondent. There was then the Indemnity (see [8]
                    above), which acknowledged the extent of the debt, authorised Eugene Lim to
                    point out the Appellant’s assets to be seized on the First
                    Respondent’s behalf, and which indemnified the Second Respondent against
                    all claims arising from the execution. The signing of the indemnity signifies a
                    conscious assumption of risk. Most crucially, there was the inventory annexed to
                    Form 94 (see [10] above), which erroneously described the seized items as
                    “parts of timber” and Form 94 itself, which sets out the Second
                    Respondent’s wholly inaccurate and unjustifiable valuation of the seized
                    item at $15,000. By signing off on the inventory annexed to Form 94 and assuming
                    direct responsibility therein for “any wrongful seizure”, Eugene
                    Lim (on behalf of the First Respondent) must be taken to have also affirmed as
                    appropriate for the purposes of satisfying the judgment debt both the quantity
                    of the seized items and the valuation made by the Second Respondent in Form 94.
                    The significance of Eugene Lim’s endorsement of the same is better
                    appreciated when one considers the Second Respondent’s unqualified
                    reliance on Eugene Lim to ensure that the seizure was in order, which we find
                    that he must have been aware of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… Why didn’t you ask Eugene for
                            assistance in describing what had been seized so that you can record
                            that in the inventory instead?</span></p>

                            wrote is, er, right.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>So your understanding is that

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>---then whatever you have
                                written is right?</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In these circumstances, we are of the view
                    that Eugene Lim, being the representative of the First Respondent, has taken an
                    active part in the actual execution as to identify himself with the
                    bailiff’s excessive seizure. Therefore, the First Respondent is liable for
                    the bailiff’s excessive seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As stated above (at [26]–[27]), an
                    execution creditor will not be liable for a bailiff excessive seizure if the
                    execution creditor, when identifying the debtor’s items to be seized,
                    exercised a reasonable and honest discretion in estimating what the goods will
                    realise at auction, so as to avoid excessive seizure. Based on the evidence of
                    the Second Respondent, Eugene Lim pointed him to the Appellant’s machinery
                    in general at Bays A2 and A3, but was not by the Second Respondent’s side
                    when the actual seizure of the individual items was taking place so as to
                    identify the exact items to be seized. When the Second Respondent sought Eugene
                    Lim’s signature on the inventory annexed to Form 94, he signed the
                    inventory without checking the quantity or ascertaining the value of items
                    seized, nor did he correct the mistake in the inventory list. In these
                    circumstances, we are of the view that First Respondent did not exercise a
                    reasonable discretion in estimating what the goods would realise at auction when
                    he authorised how much of the judgment debtor’s property was to be seized
                    by the Second Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     For the reasons above, we allow the appeal
                    against the First Respondent. The First Respondent shall be liable to the
                    Appellant for the sum of $96,448.12 less $19,523.45 (this sum is the balance
                    sale proceeds which was refunded to the Appellant). Interest on this sum fixed
                    at 3% per annum from the date of the filing of these proceedings to the date of
                    this judgment of the due amount is to be paid to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The appeal against the Second Respondent is
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The Appellant shall be entitled to the costs
                    of these proceedings here and below as against the First Respondent. We direct
                    that, in the light of all the established facts and considering the significance
                    of the legal issues raised in these proceedings which had not been
                    authoritatively settled in the High Court earlier, these costs are to be taxed
                    on the High Court scale. Despite the Appellant not succeeding against the Second
                    Respondent, we direct that there be no costs as between them here and below. We
                    think it was reasonable in the circumstances for it to have initiated these
                    proceedings, considering the serious lapses attributable to the Second
                    Respondent and the unsettled legal position in relation to his legal
                    responsibility for same. The usual consequential orders are to
                follow.</p>
