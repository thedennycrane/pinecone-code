<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b><font size="4">
<p align="justify"></p></font>INTRODUCTION

<p></p></b></i>1.    The Plaintiff Lumbini Pte Ltd (‘Lumbini’) is a

company which used to be the sole registered proprietor of a business known as Bodhigaya

Book Shop (‘BBS’). The business registration of BBS was terminated on 21

November 1995 to facilitate incorporation of the Fourth Defendant Bodhigaya Book Shop Pte

Ltd (‘BBSPL’).<i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i>2.    On 21 September 1996, the First Defendant, Ms Toh Peng

Noi, who was at all material times a manager of BBS, withdrew two sums of $11,668.74 and

$11,967.47 amounting to $23,636.21 (‘the Deposits’) from a fixed deposit account

which BBS had with Lee Wah Bank Limited. The Deposits were withdrawn in cash and deposited

into a bank account of BBSPL.

<p xmlns="">3.    Lumbini’s first claim is for payment of the Deposits. This

claim is directed at Ms Toh and the other three Defendants as well.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    The second claim of Lumbini is for all other monies, assets and

properties of BBS which have been transferred to BBSPL. This claim is directed at BBSPL

and at the First to Third Defendants as well. </p>
<p xmlns="">5.    The third claim of Lumbini was for the accounting books and

records of BBS to be delivered up by Ms Toh and Mr Lau. However this claim was withdrawn

by Lumbini’s counsel Mr Chua Boon Thien during Closing Replies.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    Many causes of action were pleaded such as, money had and

received, breach of duty or breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, constructive trust

and/or conspiracy to injure Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.    BBSPL has brought Third Party proceedings against one Tan Soo Kiat

(‘Mr SK Tan’) and a firm controlled or managed by Mr SK Tan, i.e SK-SK Tan &amp;

Co (‘SK Tan &amp; Co’), for an indemnity or contribution towards such sum as

BBSPL may be liable to Lumbini. The basis of this Third Party claim is:<i><b>
<ol>
</ol></b></i></p><p align="justify" xmlns="">(a) Mr SK Tan was at all material times a director and company

  secretary of Lumbini and responsible for the administration, management and operation of

  Lumbini with the assistance of one Ms Wang Lee Jyu (‘Mary Wang’). Mr SK Tan had

  breached his duty to Lumbini.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(b) SK Tan &amp; Co provided corporate secretarial services as well as

  business management and consultancy services at all material times to BBS and then to

  BBSPL (until 30 September 1996) and had incorporated BBSPL. SK Tan &amp; Co handled the

  incorporation of BBSPL for the purpose of taking over BBS’s assets as a going

  concern. SK Tan &amp; Co had breached its duty to BBSPL.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    Furthermore, Mr Lau also brought Third Party proceedings against

Mr SK Tan and Mary Wang for an indemnity or contribution towards such sum as Mr Lau may be

liable to Lumbini for. The basis of this Third Party claim is breach of duty on the part

of Mr SK Tan who was one of the directors and also company secretary of Lumbini and breach

of duty on the part of Mary Wang as one of the directors of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    The initial action filed on 4 January 2000 as MC Suit No 600147

claimed only the Deposits. Subsequently it was amended to include the various claims I

have mentioned. The action was transferred to the District Court and subsequently to the

High Court.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    In my Judgment, ‘AEIC’ means affidavit of

evidence-in-chief and ‘NE’ means notes of evidence.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

ISSUES AND RESPECTIVE POSITIONS</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">11.    The crux of the case is whether there was an agreement by Lumbini

to transfer its business, including its assets and liabilities, to BBSPL and the terms

thereof.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    Lumbini’s position is that there was no such agreement as

cash payment had to be made in respect of the transfer and this had not yet been agreed

even though BBSPL was incorporated to take over the business of BBS as a going concern and

its incorporation was effective on 21 November 1995.</p>
<p xmlns="">13.    Lumbini’s main witness was Mr SK Tan who said that the

incorporation of BBSPL was merely a step towards the transfer. He claimed he was unaware,

until February 1997 that BBSPL was operating the business of BBS after BBSPL’s

incorporation.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    The Defendants’ position is that there was an agreement for

Lumbini to transfer BBS’s business to BBSPL and 20% of the equity in BBSPL would be

taken by Lumbini. The Defendants also say that Lumbini subsequently decided not to take

the 20% stake. Furthermore, Mr SK Tan expressly agreed to give the business of BBSPL for

free. The Defendants also take the position that Mr SK Tan subsequently agreed to transfer

the business for a $1 nominal consideration.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    Much reliance was placed by the Defendants on various documentary

evidence, for example, 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) A letter dated 23 March 1995 from Master Yuanqing which

  incorporates the minutes of a meeting of 22 March 1995</p>
<p align="justify">(b) A letter dated 28 March 1995 from one Master Guangchao</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The Memorandum &amp; Articles of BBSPL and documents signed by Mr

  SK Tan or Mary Wang in relation to the incorporation of BBSPL and the termination of BBS</p>
<p align="justify">(d) A memorandum dated 5 February 1996 from Mr SK Tan</p>
<p align="justify">(e) Resolutions drafted by Mr SK Tan in respect of the $1 nominal

  consideration</p>
<p align="justify">(f) Correspondence from Mr Lau in 1996.</p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

THE FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">16.    It is necessary to go into some detail of the background facts

and allegations which has led to this action.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Lumbini and its officers and advisors</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">17.    On or about 8 August 1988, Lumbini became the registered sole

proprietor of BBS. The business of BBS was to sell Buddhist publications and articles.

Lumbini also had other businesses which I shall elaborate on later.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    At all material times, the directors of Lumbini were: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Mr SK Tan</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Mary Wang </p>
<p align="justify">(c) Mr Lau (the Third Defendant).</p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Mary Wang</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">19.    Mary Wang was a director in name only and it is clear from her

evidence that she would comply with the instructions of Mr SK Tan without question.

Accordingly it is not material whether she was the personal secretary of Mr SK Tan in SK

Tan &amp; Co as alleged by the Defendants. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Mr SK Tan</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">20.    The Defendants say that Mr SK Tan was calling the shots in

Lumbini and much time was spent to establish or to deny this allegation. Having considered

the documentary and oral evidence, I am of the view that it is obvious that Mr SK Tan was

not calling the shots at Lumbini. True, as between Mr Lau and he, he took a more active

role in Lumbini, as well as in BBS, and as between Master Yuanqing and him, Master

Yuanqing was not a director of Lumbini. However, I find that he was much guided by both

Master Yuanqing and/or Master Guangchao and Buddhist believers like one Yeo Kwang Seng,

Billy Yang (brother of Yeo Kwang Seng) and Sudatta Eng. The fact that he had proposed

dividends to be paid in his letter dated 23 August 1996 must not be taken out of context.

This letter was written after material events in 1995 had occurred which I shall elaborate

on later.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    On the other hand, I also do not think that Mr SK Tan was as

uninvolved in the affairs of Lumbini or BBS as he wanted me to believe. For example, 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) There were minutes of directors’ meetings of Lumbini which

  recorded him as raising queries, although he said it was not really he who had raised them

  and his name was mentioned because he was a director. I do not accept this explanation.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Ms Toh had given evidence, which I accept, about how he would from

  time to time ask questions or make suggestions about Lumbini/BBS when she dropped by at

  his office. </p>
<p align="justify">(c) There is also a letter from BBS signed by Ms Toh to another company

  dated 2 October 1991 referring to Mr SK Tan as ‘our honorary business adviser’,

  a description which he did not object to then. </p>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Mr Lau</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">22.    Mr Lau (the Third Defendant) is the brother of Master Yuanqing

(the Second Defendant). He has a degree in accounting and had worked in the audit firm of

Chong Phua Chow &amp; Partners. Thereafter he worked in the Port of Singapore Authority

and, after that, he worked in United Overseas Bank Limited. His position in the bank at

the time of the trial was First Vice President of Special Loans Division and he was

handling delinquent loans.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    He first assisted BBS when Master Yuanqing sought his help in

July or August 1988 as the then manager one Tan Siew Siang apparently had difficulty in

reconciling BBS’s daily cash flow. Subsequently Master Guangchao formulated a

computer system to keep track of the daily cash flow and stocks for BBS. He also sought

advice from Mr Lau on an ad hoc basis regarding accounting aspects of the system.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    It was Master Guangchao who invited Mr Lau to attend a meeting of

Lumbini on 14 November 1988. It was at this meeting that Mr Lau was introduced to Mr SK

Tan and Mary Wang. Mr SK Tan then nominated Mr Lau to sit on the Executive Committee of

Lumbini. According to the minutes, Mr Lau and two others i.e Yeo Kheng Guan and D H Hong

were to sit on this Committee.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    At another meeting on 12 December 1988, Mr Lau declined to be on

the Executive Committee as he was holding a full time job. Mr SK Tan then invited him to

join the board of directors of Lumbini and, after persuasion by Master Guangchao and

Sudatta Eng, Mr Lau agreed. Mr SK Tan said he had no knowledge as to whether the Executive

Committee had met or whether it was functioning (NE 43). It seems to me that the idea of

the Executive Committee did not take off. There is no further mention about it in the

subsequent minutes of meetings of Lumbini. </p>
<p xmlns="">26.    Mr Lau said his role was mainly to give ad hoc advice on

accounting matters and to assist Ms Toh on the preparation of financial statements from

accounting records. He also answered questions from the external auditors of Lumbini. In

cross-examination, he added that he posted figures from the accounting records into the

ledger. I accept that his main role was to assist with the accounts and he was not

involved in the operations or financing aspect of BBS’s business.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Ms Toh</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">27.    As I have said, Ms Toh was at all material times the manager of

BBS. She was also the sole signatory of BBS’s fixed deposit account with Lee Wah Bank

Limited.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Two Religious Advisors</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">28.    Lumbini was guided in its affairs by two religious advisors. I

have already mentioned Master Yuanqing (the Second Defendant). The other was Soh Chee Kong

@ Seck Guang Chao (‘Master Guangchao’) whose name I have mentioned in para 15(b)

above. There were many variations of the English translation of the names of the two

religious advisors but I shall use the names Master Yuanqing and Master Guangchao only.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Master Yuanqing and Ms Toh, the manager, were the ones who were

managing the business of BBS at all material times. As an advisor, Master Yuanqing was

also in a position to influence the directors. Although he sought to confine his role to

managing the business of BBS and to giving advice only when it was sought, I find that his

role was not so confined and he did take an active role in advising on matters regarding

the future of BBS and Lumbini.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Contribution of $100,000</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">30.    Mr SK Tan got to know Master Yuanqing when he went through a

programme in 1987 at Bright Hill Temple in Singapore. The programme was a two-week course

for Buddhist believers to learn Buddhist teachings and precepts and to experience living

as a Buddhist monk. Master Yuanqing was one of Mr SK Tan’s religious teachers. It was

at the same programme that Mr SK Tan got to know Master Guangchao also.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    After the programme, Master Yuanqing continued to guide Mr SK Tan

on the precepts of Buddhism.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    Mr SK Tan’s evidence was that as their relationship

developed, Master Yuanqing informed Mr SK Tan in about early 1988 of his plan to assist

Buddhist believers to be financially independent and self-reliant by setting up Buddhist

enterprises. Master Yuanqing asked Mr SK Tan whether he was prepared to make a financial

contribution to which he agreed to contribute an equivalent sum of every dollar raised.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    In about the first quarter of 1988, Master Yuanqing introduced

one Yeo Kwang Seng to Mr SK Tan and said that Mr Yeo had agreed to contribute $50,000. Mr

SK Tan then agreed to contribute $50,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    There were then various meetings with Master Yuanqing, Mr SK Tan,

other Buddhist believers such as Yeo Kwang Seng, Billy Yang and Sudatta Eng. Apparently Mr

Lau also attended the meetings although he was not formally introduced to Mr SK Tan until

November 1988.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    According to Mr SK Tan, the various persons had the following

understanding: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) the contribution of $50,000 each from Mr Yeo and him would be used

  to set up a company and various businesses. Although Mr Yeo and he would leave the

  management of the companies and the businesses to the Buddhist believers, Mr Yeo and he

  would have the right to liquidate the companies and/or businesses and the proceeds would

  be divided into two parts; one part each for Mr Yeo and him to donate to a charity of

  their respective choices, if there was any problem or dispute,</p>
<p align="justify">(b) a ‘parent’ company would be set up to control the various

  businesses which would promote the Buddhist faith, such as the retail of Buddhist

  publications and articles, providing the services of funeral undertakers, conducting

  computer training and support and the business of floral arrangement, and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) these businesses would be managed by Buddhist believers and when

  they became established and/or independent, they would be ‘separated’ or

  independent from the ‘parent’ company i.e privatised. However the

  ‘parent’ company would retain some interest or shareholding in the new company

  and the remaining shares in the new company would be distributed among the employees of

  the business and volunteers who have helped in its business. Further, the new company

  would also be required to return the financial support (if any) which the business took

  from the ‘parent’ company.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">36.    With this understanding, Mr SK Tan said he was instructed by

Master Yuanqing to register and incorporate various businesses and companies between June

to December 1988 as follows: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) BBS on or about 6 June 1988. Mary Wang was its first proprietor.

  Thereafter when Lumbini was incorporated, it took over as the sole proprietor of BBS. As I

  have mentioned, the business of BBS was to sell Buddhist publications and articles.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Lumbini on or about 15 July 1988. Lumbini was to be the parent

  company for the various businesses.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Sarnath Publication (‘Sarnath’) on or about 16 August

  1988. Sarnath was to sell and distribute audio tapes and compact discs of recordings of

  sutras and lectures given by prominent monks.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Nalanda Professional Trading Centre (‘Nalanda’) on or

  about 17 October 1988. Nalanda was to provide and conduct computer training and support.</p>
<p align="justify">(e) For You Professional Services Information Centre, which was

  subsequently renamed and known as For You Information (‘FYI’), on or about 16

  December 1988. The main business of FYI was to publish monthly publications or newsletters

  to provide information to the Buddhist community.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">37.    After Lumbini was incorporated on or about 15 July 1988, Mr Yeo

and Mr SK Tan made their financial contributions and each of them owned one share in

Lumbini. These shares were held in the names of one Koh Chiou Eng (the wife of Mr SK Tan)

and Mary Wang respectively. </p>
<p xmlns="">38.    The $50,000 from Mr SK Tan was recorded as a loan by him to

Lumbini. The $50,000 from Yeo Kwang Seng was recorded as a loan from Mary Wang to Lumbini.

Yeo Kwang Seng said that he was a civil servant at the material time and civil servants

were not supposed to be doing business. Hence, Mary Wang’s name was used (NE 17).

However, no explanation was given as to why one of the shares in Lumbini had to be held in

trust for Mr SK Tan. </p>
<p xmlns="">39.    Mr SK Tan and Yeo Kwang Seng said that the $100,000 from them

were intended to be donations. However Mr SK Tan added that they were actually conditional

loans, subject to the alleged understanding stated in para 35(a) above. Master Yuanqing

and Mr Lau said that they were outright donations. Master Yuanqing said that the monies

were recorded as loans in Lumbini’s accounts because of tax reasons on the advice of

Mr SK Tan.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Corporatisation of FYI</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">40.    According to Mr SK Tan, in about July 1994, Sudatta Eng had told

him about Master Guangchao’s intention to set up another company to take over the

business of FYI so that those who had helped out in FYI’s business could have a stake

in the new company.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    A company Saddha Pte Ltd (‘Saddha’) was used for this

purpose. 20% of the shares in Saddha was held by Lumbini and the balance held by those who

had helped in the business of FYI. Mr SK Tan said he had thought that the decision to

corporatise FYI had been discussed with Master Yuanqing. As it turned out, Master

Yuanquing was unaware. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Sakyamuni Trading Pte Ltd</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">42.    In about the first quarter of 1995, Master Yuanqing asked Mr SK

Tan to incorporate another company to purchase premises for the business of BBS. This was

done and the company’s name was Sakyamuni Trading Pte Ltd (‘Sakyamuni’).</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Corporatisation of BBS</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">43.    On 22 March 1995, there was a meeting in Mr SK Tan’s office

between Master Yuanqing, Master Guangchao and various Buddhist believers.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.    According to Mr SK Tan, he did not attend the meeting. This was

disputed by the First to Third Defendants who took the position that he did attend the

meeting.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    It is not material to me whether Mr SK Tan did attend that

meeting because even if he did, he did not participate in that meeting as is evident from

the minutes of the meeting. Even Master Yuanqing admitted that Mr SK Tan did not say

anything at the meeting (NE 139).</p>
<p xmlns="">46.    Pursuant to that meeting, Master Yuanqing sent a letter dated 23

March 1995. It was addressed to all the three directors of Lumbini, i.e Mr SK Tan, Mr Lau

and Mary Wang. In that letter, Master Yuanqing stressed that the withdrawal of FYI from

the group was without notice to him. He alleged that this subjected Lumbini’s

structure, tenet and objectives to a crisis. He said that the other businesses may also be

acquired and cease to be part of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    The English translation of the minutes of the meeting, which was

included as part of the letter stated, inter alia:

<p xmlns="">48.    The letter ended with the following proposals: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘VIII. Proposals:</p>
<p align="justify">1. If the other companies of Lumbini intend to seek independence, their

  controlling power shall be vested in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) the current person in charge of respective companies; or</p>
<p align="justify">(2) the person who has achieved good results in managing such

    companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. <u>The method is similar to that of For You. Lumbini shall have 20%

  shareholding, and the person in charge or the person who has achieved good results in

  managing such company shall hold the remaining 80%.</u>’</p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">49.    Subsequent to this letter, Master Guangchao sent a letter dated

28 March 1995. It was addressed to six people i.e Master Yuanqing, Mr SK Tan, Mr Lau,

Billy Yang, Mary Wang and Yeo Kwang Seng. The English translation reads: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘I <u>agree with the proposal</u> by Master Yuanqing to let

  Bodhigaya Book Shop be independent and to vest its controlling power in the current

  person-in-charge of Bodhigaya Book Shop or the person who has achieved good results in

  managing Bodhigaya Book Shop.</p>
<p align="justify">With regards to the <u>distribution of equity interest</u>, Lumbini

  Private Limited <u>may hold 20% of its shares</u>, and the remaining 80% shall, upon due

  contemplation, be distributed among the promoter, the person-in-charge, and the person who

  has contributed to or has achieved good results in managing the Company. <u>The date of

  independence is to be decided by Master Yuanqing and S.K. Tan</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">I propose that, whether or not Lumbini Private Limited is to be

  dissolved shall be discussed and decided by its legal representatives Wang Lee Jyu and Koh

  Chiou Eng, its directors, and its advisors Master Guangchao and Yuanqing.<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">50.    Master Yuanqing tried to deny that in the meeting of 22 March

1995 and in his letter dated 23 March 1995 he had proposed that BBS be privatised and that

he was only suggesting that if other businesses wanted to seek independence, Lumbini was

to have a 20% share in the new company (NE 138 and 139). He also alleged that when he

subsequently made such a proposal, it was not because FYI had become privatised (NE 138).</p>
<p xmlns="">51.    I would first point out that the parties had used the word

‘privatised’ to mean the incorporation of a new company to take over a business

of Lumbini and Lumbini would not have a majority stake in the new company. I will continue

to use that expression to mean the same thing although in fact all the businesses of

Lumbini had all along been held privately.</p>
<p xmlns="">52.    Secondly, I do not accept Master Yuanqing’s evidence as

stated in para 50 above. He was very unhappy that FYI had been privatised without his

knowledge and he made his unhappiness known at the 22 March 1995 meeting and in his letter

dated 23 March 1995. In view of this development, he wanted BBS to be privatised and he

was to hold the majority stake in the new company. Although he did not want to say this

explicitly in his letter, this was clear to all the others.</p>
<p xmlns="">53.    I also find that although Master Guangchao’s letter dated 28

March 1995 did not specifically refer to Master Yuanqing’s letter dated 23 March

1995, it was in response thereto because: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) it refers to Master Yuanqing’s proposal, and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the reference to the deserving party who would hold 80% is in the

  same terms as set out in Master Yuanqing’s letter i.e the promoter, the

  person-in-charge, and the person who has contributed to or has achieved good results in

  managing the company.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">54.    Mr SK Tan said that as he did not attend the 22 March 1995

meeting, he learned about the proposal that BBS be independent from Mr Lau, Mr Yeo and

Billy Yang in April 1995. He alleged that he told them that to carry this proposal

through, a company had to be incorporated first and a cut-off date be set for the

valuation of BBS’s assets. This was to determine the price to be paid to Lumbini for

BBS’s assets. Mr SK Tan alleged that he also told Mr Lau to speak to Master Yuanqing

about this because BBS had used most of Lumbini’s funds and, at the very least, the

$100,000 put in by Mr Yeo and he should be paid to Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">55.    Mr SK Tan had also initially denied receiving the letter of

Master Yuanqing in his AEIC but I find that he admitted otherwise during cross-examination

(NE 47). I find that he did receive Master Yuanqing’s letter dated 23 March 1995.</p>
<p xmlns="">56.    As for Master Guangchao’s letter dated 28 March 1995, Mr SK

Tan made a foolish attempt during cross-examination to doubt its authenticity when he said

he was not sure about the signature thereon. He also said that the letter was not given to

him at the time even though he was one of the addressees (NE 78).</p>
<p xmlns="">57.    I do not accept Mr SK Tan’s evidence casting doubt on the

authenticity of Master Guangchao’s letter. It is part of the Agreed Bundle. Also,

Master Guangchao was not a witness and hence did not dispute its authenticity. I also do

not accept his evidence that that letter was not sent to him at the material time. If that

were so, he would have said so in his AEIC bearing in mind its materiality. I therefore

find that he did receive this letter in or about March 1995. </p>
<p xmlns="">58.    Accordingly, whether Mr SK Tan attended the 22 March 1995 meeting

or not, he knew about the privatisation of BBS from the two letters dated 23 and 28 March

1995. He did not object to the terms stated in Master Guangchao’s letter because he

was agreeable with the terms.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.    I also find that Mr SK Tan did not mention to Mr Lau a cut-off

date to value the assets of BBS for the price to be paid to Lumbini or that $100,000

should be paid. The question of making payment based on a valuation of the assets of BBS

is not mentioned in any of the documents in 1995 or 1996 except in one internal memo from

Mr SK Tan to his staff Jamilah dated 17 November 1995 which I shall deal with later. As

for the $100,000, it was not mentioned to any of the Defendants until April 1996 as I

shall elaborate on later. </p>
<p xmlns="">60.    As for Yeo Kwang Seng, he said in para 16 of his AEIC that while

there was in principle agreement, at the 22 March 1995 meeting, to Master Yuanqing’s

proposal to privatise BBS, there were outstanding issues to be resolved. He did not

elaborate in his AEIC as to what these outstanding issues were. In cross-examination, he

said they involved administration, procedures and financial matters and BBS had to pay

back capital to Lumbini (NE 23).</p>
<p xmlns="">61.    He also said in his AEIC that he had not seen the minutes of the

meeting included in Master Yuanqing’s letter dated 23 March 1995 until Mr SK Tan

showed the minutes to him in January 2001. He went on to say that the minutes did not

record accurately what had transpired at the meeting. However beyond a general statement

that some of the issues stated in the minutes were not in fact discussed, he did not

elaborate in his AEIC or in cross-examination as to what these issues were.</p>
<p xmlns="">62.    I am of the view that it is likely that Yeo Kwang Seng had seen

or was aware about Master Yuanqing’s letter dated 23 March 1995 even though he was

not one of the addressees. Master Guangchao was also not one of the addressees but he was

aware about it and indeed had responded to it.</p>
<p xmlns="">63.    What is more important is that Master Guangchao’s response

dated 28 March 1995 was addressed to six people including Mr SK Tan and Yeo Kwang Seng.

Yeo Kwang Seng did not deny receiving this letter. I find that he too had received it.

However, both his AEIC and Mr SK Tan’s AEIC made no mention about it. In my view,

they were hoping to avoid drawing attention to this letter. Furthermore, either Yeo Kwang

Seng had agreed with Master Guangchao, before Master Guangchao’s letter was sent,

that Lumbini would take a 20% stake (only) in the new company or he was agreeable after

receiving Master Guangchao’s letter. Hence, there was no objection from him at that

time.</p>
<p xmlns="">64.    In para 25.2 of Lumbini’s Closing Reply, it is argued that

it was clear from Master Guangchao’s letter that there were other outstanding issues

to be resolved. I do not agree.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.    As regards BBS, Master Guangchao had agreed that it was to be

independent and Lumbini would take a 20% stake (only) in the new company. As I have

mentioned, it was clear to all concerned that the 80% stake would go to Master Yuanqing.

The date of incorporation of the new company was to be decided by Master Yuanqing and Mr

SK Tan and this was in fact subsequently done.</p>
<p xmlns="">66.    There was only one outstanding issue and not ‘issues’

from his letter. This issue related to the dissolution of Lumbini which is separate from

the privatisation of BBS.</p>
<p xmlns="">67.    The second argument from para 25.2 of Lumbini’s Closing

Reply is that while no cash consideration is mentioned in Master Guangchao’s letter,

there is equally no mention that no cash consideration was required. In my view, such an

argument is overly simplistic and ignores the background leading to his letter. It is

clear to me that at that time, the privatisation of BBS was treated by all concerned to be

on the same basis as the privatisation of FYI, even though BBS had a larger and more

profitable business than FYI.</p>
<p xmlns="">68.    The third argument from para 25.2 of Lumbini’s Closing Reply

is that it is pertinent that Master Guangchao had subsequently agreed at a meeting of 31

March 1996 that $100,000 be paid to Lumbini. In my view, this did not necessarily mean

that that was his intention in March 1995. I will elaborate on the meeting of 31 March

1996 when I come to it later.</p>
<p xmlns="">69.    Mr SK Tan also alleged that in May 1995, he had explained to Ms

Toh and Master Yuanqing, when they attended in his office, that a company had to be

incorporated first and a cut-off date set for ‘closing of BBS’s assets’. He

also told Master Yuanqing to prepare a list of those who had helped in the business of BBS

and who would be given shares in the new company.</p>
<p xmlns="">70.    I am of the view that even if Mr SK Tan did say that there should

be a cut-off date for ‘closing of BBS’s assets’ that did not mean that a

cash payment of a significant sum was to be paid to Lumbini. As for the alleged list of

those who had helped in the business of BBS for the purpose of giving them shares in the

new company, I find that Mr SK Tan did not mention such a list. It was not mentioned in

the letter from Master Yuanqing dated 23 March 1995 nor in the letter from Master

Guangchao dated 28 March 1995. There was no reason for Mr SK Tan to suggest such a list.

Furthermore, Mr SK Tan’s own internal notes and the subsequent correspondence and

minutes in 1996 after the incorporation of BBSPL do not refer to such a list.</p>
<p xmlns="">71.    I find that, as at March 1995, there was an agreement that a new

company would take over the business of BBS. Lumbini would take a 20% stake in it and 80%

would go to Master Yuanqing (even though his name was not specifically mentioned), as he

was the one who had been in charge of BBS. </p>
<p xmlns="">72.    Ms Toh and Master Yuanqing in turn alleged that in about

September 1995, Mr SK Tan had told them that BBS would be given to them free as they were

the ones who had contributed the most to BBS’s business.</p>
<p xmlns="">73.    I am of the view that there was no such express agreement on Mr

SK Tan’s part. If there was, it would have been mentioned in the subsequent

correspondence from Master Yuanqing, Ms Toh or Mr Lau or their solicitors before action

was commenced. </p>
<p xmlns="">74.    On 9 September 1995, Mr SK Tan wrote down some notes. His notes

read:

<p xmlns="">75.    Mr Chua submitted that the first entry in this note for 30

September 1995 illustrated that the accounts were to be updated and this was for the

purpose of valuing a price to be paid to Lumbini for BBS. However, the entry was

equivocal. Furthermore, Mr SK Tan’s evidence did not touch upon this entry.</p>
<p xmlns="">76.    On the other hand, I note that the penultimate entry in this note

referred to Lumbini taking a 20% stake in the new company and Sakyamon (meaning Sakyamuni)

taking a 80% stake. This appeared consistent with the March 1995 agreement but I have to

say that there was very little evidence on this note. Also, although Mr SK Tan alleged

that this note was addressed to his assistant Jamilah, she did not give any evidence.</p>
<p xmlns="">77.    The next handwritten note of Mr SK Tan was dated 12 September

1995. However, as Mr SK Tan gave no evidence whatsoever on this note and it is unclear to

me what it means, I cannot give any weight to it.</p>
<p xmlns="">78.    On 19 September 1995, a Form 14 for the application for approval

and reservation of name for a company was filed. The proposed name was Bodhigaya Book Shop

Pte Ltd. Paragraph 11 of Form 14 stated that the intended company will take over the

business of BBS. The Form was signed by Mr SK Tan and filed by SK Tan &amp; Co. In para 12

of the Form, Mr SK Tan declared that he had the consent (to be produced) of the

proprietor/ partners of the business for its takeover by the intended company.</p>
<p xmlns="">79.    The papers for the incorporation of BBSPL were prepared by SK Tan

&amp; Co. Master Yuanqing and Ms Toh signed as subscribers to the Memorandum of BBSPL on

16 October 1995. Clause 3(a)(i) which is the first provision on the objects of BBSPL

states that it is to acquire and take over as a going concern the undertaking and all or

any of the assets of BBS.</p>
<p xmlns="">80.    Mr Lau said that when he read the Memorandum subsequently, he

took the reference to taking over BBS ‘as a going concern’ to mean that the

business of BBS would be taken over for free. That may be Mr Lau’s view but the

provision was silent as to whether cash consideration should be paid. In my view it

cannot, by itself, lead to the inference that the business of BBS would be taken over for

free.</p>
<p xmlns="">81.    On 1 November 1995, the Registry of Companies &amp; Businesses

(‘ROCB’) replied to the Form 14 application to say that the application was

approved subject to termination of the business firm and filing of a Form D. Form D was

signed by Mr SK Tan on 16 November 1995. He described his position as director of Lumbini.

Form D stated, ‘The above business [i.e BBS] has ceased to be in operation with

effect from 951121’ i.e 21 November 1995. </p>
<p xmlns="">82.    On 17 November 1995, i.e prior to the date of incorporation of

BBSPL, Mr SK Tan wrote another note. This note was specifically addressed to Jamilah. It

stated: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘Once Bodhigaya Bookshop Pte Ltd is set up, we must call a Lumbini

  meeting to sell, transfer all business under Bodhigaya Bookshop to Pte Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify">Also have to get a closing a/c for Bookshop before transfer, to

  establish amount to be paid by Pte Ltd to Lumbini.</p>
<p align="justify">Maybe we should draft a letter to Lau - Director of Lumbini, Ms Toh.<br/>

  I will inform Billy Yang and his brother. ’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">83.    In para 32(c) of his AEIC, Mr SK Tan highlighted the first two

paras of this note but not the third. Furthermore he did not elaborate on it in his AEIC

beyond highlighting the first two paras. On the other hand, the cross-examination on this

note was also brief (NE 64 to 66). It focussed on the absence of any mention of a list of

persons to be given shares and the note demonstrating that it was Mr SK Tan who was giving

instructions. The latter was with a view to establishing that he was the one calling the

shots. The cross-examination did not focus on what the substance of the note might

reflect.</p>
<p xmlns="">84.    At the end of the day, the brief evidence from Mr SK Tan

regarding this note did not assist me to establish various facts. For example: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) whether the note reflected a conversation between Yeo Kwang Seng

  and him or Master Yuanqing and him or it reflected his own thoughts,</p>
<p align="justify">(b) why there was no mention in this note of the 80/20 shareholding

  mentioned in the March 1995 agreement and reiterated in his note dated 9 September 1995

  i.e about two months earlier,</p>
<p align="justify">(c) whether he was anticipating that the amount to be established and

  to be ‘paid’ to Lumbini was actually to be paid in cash or in exchange for the

  20% stake,</p>
<p align="justify">(d) if in cash, whether this reflected a departure from what had been

  agreed and the 20% stake for Lumbini was to be given up or the cash payment was to be in

  addition to the 20% stake,</p>
<p align="justify">(e) whether, at the time this note was written, Mr SK Tan had

  overlooked the March 1995 agreement or it was his view that there was no agreement in

  March 1995,</p>
<p align="justify">(f) why he did not follow up to draft a letter to Mr Lau or Ms Toh

  about establishing the amount to be paid to Lumbini.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">85.    All I am able to ascertain is that the contents of this note was

not disclosed to any of the Defendants at the material time. Furthermore, Jamilah did not

give evidence for Lumbini for which I draw an adverse inference.</p>
<p xmlns="">86.    By a letter dated 20 November 1995 on Lumbini’s letterhead

to ROCB, Mary Wang stated: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘PROPOSED COMPANY<br/>
<u>- BODHIGAYA BOOKSHOP PTE LTD</u></p>
<p align="justify">We have no objection to the proposed incorporation of "BODHIGAYA

  BOOKSHOP PTE LTD".</p>
<p align="justify">The proposed company will acquire and take over all or any of the

  assets of BODHIGAYA BOOK SHOP.’</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">She signed the letter as director of Lumbini. The date of BBSPL’s

incorporation was 21 November 1995. The shareholders were Ms Toh and Master Yuanqing

holding one share each. They were also the two directors. Mr SK Tan was its company

secretary.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

After the incorporation of BBSPL</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">87.    In para 33 of his AEIC, Mr SK Tan said that after the

incorporation of BBSPL, he contacted, among others, Mr Lau and Yeo Kwang Seng separately

for their proposal on the cut-off date for the valuation of BBS’s assets and the

closing of BBS’s accounts. Mr Lau told him that June 1996 may be more appropriate.

Yeo Kwang Seng was more interested in the value of the net assets of BBS and Mr SK Tan

told him to check this from the audited accounts of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">88.    It is strange, to say the least, that if Mr SK Tan was

contemplating a cash payment and if he had mentioned this to Mr Lau and Yeo Kwang Seng, he

did not mention this to Master Yuanqing who was the initiator and main beneficiary of the

privatisation of BBS. I am of the view that he did not mention to Mr Lau any valuation of

BBS’s assets for the purpose of a cash payment. Had he done so, Mr Lau, who is Master

Yuanqing’s brother, would have informed Master Yuanqing who would have disagreed.</p>
<p xmlns="">89.    I also do not accept that Mr Lau had said that June 1996 was more

appropriate for the valuation of BBS’s assets or even in respect of the closing of

BBS’s accounts. As the minutes of a meeting on 31 March 1996 and correspondence after

the incorporation of BBSPL show, Mr Lau had not mentioned June 1996 as the appropriate

cut-off date for closing of accounts. On the contrary, he preferred 31 December 1995 as

the cut-off date. </p>
<p xmlns="">90.    It is not disputed that after the incorporation of BBSPL, BBSPL

in fact operated the business which was BBS’s. However, perhaps for its own

accounting purposes, it treated the start of its business as from 1 January 1996. As for

BBS’s accounting records, Ms Toh said she closed the books of BBS on 31 December 1995

while she opened another set for BBSPL from 1 January 1996. Mr Chua sought to gain some

mileage from the fact that the accounting records of BBS do not show a disposal of its

assets to BBSPL. On the other hand, there was no further accounting entries made in

BBS’s records from 1 January 1996. Mr Chua also submitted that the balance sheet of

BBSPL was not accurate because its accounts reflected the transfer to be effective on 1

January 1996 when in fact it was on 21 November 1995. He submitted that this was illegal

because s 201(3) of the Companies Act requires a company’s balance sheet to give a

true and fair view of the state of its affairs. In my view, s 201(3) is not relevant to

the issue before me.</p>
<p xmlns="">91.    What BBSPL did was simply to operate from the same shop that BBS

had been operating from. There was therefore no need to physically transfer the stocks in

the shop. However the name for the accounts for telephone and telefax lines was changed to

BBSPL’s name. The signboard for the shop was also changed to the name of BBSPL. This

was done in February or March 1996.</p>
<p xmlns="">92.    Ms Toh said that after the incorporation of BBSPL, she was

instructed by both Mr SK Tan and Master Yuanqing to settle the debts of BBS and to

transfer its assets to BBSPL. Her evidence was corroborated by Master Yuanqing. However,

this part of their case was not put to Mr SK Tan when he was cross-examined. I doubt if Mr

SK Tan had specifically given her such instructions which probably came from Master

Yuanqing only. Furthermore, even before the incorporation of BBSPL, Mr SK Tan was not

supervising her, as such, although he had asked questions and gave advice as and when she

dropped by his office and when there were meetings.</p>

5 February 1996 memorandum</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">93.    On 5 February 1996, Mr SK Tan sent a memorandum addressed to five

people i.e Master Yuanqing, Master Guangchao, Billy Yang, Yeo Kwang Seng and Mr Lau. It

said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘SUBJECT: DISPOSAL OF BODHIGAYA BOOKSHOP BY LUMBINI PTE LTD</p>
<p align="justify">Dear Sir</p>
<p align="justify">This is to inform that M/s Lumbini Pte Ltd had ceased to be a

  proprietor of Bodhigaya Book Shop with effect from 1st January, 1996.</p>
<p align="justify">I would appreciate very much if you can advise things or action to be

  done or taken on the transaction.</p>
<p align="justify">Looking forward to hear from you. ’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">94.    Mr SK Tan said that in his mind, the termination of the business

registration of BBS was to facilitate the incorporation of BBSPL. However the assets still

belonged to Lumbini who was the sole proprietor of BBS. In his mind, there must be proper

supporting documents to properly acquire title to BBS’s assets and the termination of

the business registration of BBS would not automatically transfer its assets. According to

Mr SK Tan, he was unaware, until February 1997, that BBSPL was in fact operating the

business of BBS immediately after BBSPL’s incorporation.</p>
<p xmlns="">95.    It was Mr SK Tan’s evidence that his memorandum was not to

confirm that Lumbini had ceased to own the assets of BBS but the business name of BBS. It

was his position that the request for advice on things or action to be done was to ask

about the price for the transfer of the business and the documents to be executed. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>

31 March 1996 meeting</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">96.    Subsequently, Mr SK Tan called a meeting on 31 March 1996 between

Master Guangchao, Yeo Kwang Seng, Sudatta Eng, one Tan Boon Seng and himself. He did not

include Ms Toh, Master Yuanqing or Mr Lau in the meeting. In cross-examination, he said

that this was because he felt that there was a conflict of interest on their part.</p>
<p xmlns="">97.    The minutes of the 31 March 1996 meeting, prepared by Mr SK Tan

himself stated: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘<u>BACKGROUND</u></p>
<p align="justify">Mr. S.K. Tan informed the meeting that the meeting was held to sort

  out the complications that arose or might be arising due to the conversion of the

  "Bodhigaya Bookshop" into a Private Limited Company.</p>
<p align="justify">First, when he (Mr. S.K. Tan) informed Mr. K.S. Yeo of the

  privatisation of the Bookshop, he advise Mr. K.S. Yeo:-</p>
<p align="justify">- To check with Mr. Lau Kim Koon who is in charged of the accounts of

  the Bookshop, and also a Director of Lumbini Pte Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify">- To consider the extraordinary contribution made by Ven. Yen Ching and

  Miss Toh.</p>
<p align="justify">- To give a rebate of at least 40% - 50% of the total asset in the

  event of a buy-out.</p>
<p align="justify">- <u>Not to forget the understanding</u> we (Mr. K.S. Yeo and Mr. S.K.

  Tan) on the distribution/donation of the balance fund in Lumbini Pte Ltd, i.e any fund in

  Lumbini Pte Ltd for donation, subject to the two advisers’ approval, each can only

  use 50% of the total fund.</p>
<p align="justify">Mr. S.K. Tan was pretty upset when he was questioned by Ven. Yen Ching

  [i.e Master Yuanqing] that Mr. S.K. Tan proposed a three-party sharing and certain portion

  was to be donated to project related to Cambodian unfortunates. Mr. S.K. Tan knows nothing

  on this point.</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">Before September 1995, Mr. S.K. Tan had checked with Ven. Yen Ching

  whether the Bookshop was profitable. On the positive side, it would be better to do the

  takeover as at 1 January 1995 rather than 31 December 1995. However, Mr. S.K. Tan was told

  that Mr. Lau Kim Koon preferred the changes be effective end of 1995 - 31 December 1995.</p>
<p align="justify">So far, apart from the businessname being terminated on 21 November

  1995 and the new establishment being incorporated on 21 November 1995, <u>there was no

  agreement</u>, no transaction, whatsoever being done to its assets and liabilities.

  However, presumably all transactions after 31 December 1995 should be under the new

  establishment without title.</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">The meeting responded by noting that the set-up of Lumbini Pte Ltd was

  to promote Buddhism and to assist Buddhists in their enterprises, and any fund in Lumbini

  Pte Ltd should be dealt with on the same basis.</p>
<u><p align="justify">Mr. S.K. Tan was unable to confirm who owns the new Company or the

  shareholders and their shareholdings</p></u>. At this juncture, a circular letter issued by

  the new set-up was tabled at the meeting. It was noted that:-

  <p align="justify">"this is a change of name only ……."</p>
<p align="justify">Business wise, it might be so, but legally it was a separate entity

  altogether and proper agreement must be executed to give legal rights to the new Company.</p>
<p align="justify">The meeting agreed that whatever done or to be done should be <u>in

  writing</u> and arrived at the following conclusions:-</p>
<p align="justify">- <u>The S$100,000.00 loan should be repaid</u> to Lumbini Pte Ltd.

  Terms of repayment could be worked out.</p>
<p align="justify">- Of the total assets - approx. S$200,000.00 subject to 1995 December

  audited accounts, the same be capitalised wherein <u>20% should be give to Lumbini Pte Ltd

  - similar to For You Information</u>. (Lumbini Pte Ltd would not wish to appoint

  representative directors to the Board of the new Company).</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<p align="justify">….</p>
<u><p align="justify">Without any commitment and responsibility</p></u>, Mr.S.K. Tan agreed to

  draft the minutes for approval before releasing to Ven. Yen Ching and Miss Toh and other

  interested and related parties.’<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]

</ol>
<p xmlns="">98.    Although the minutes stated that Mr SK Tan was unable to confirm

who the shareholders and their shareholdings in BBSPL were, it was SK Tan &amp; Co who had

prepared the incorporation papers for BBSPL. In para 36(b) of his AEIC, Mr SK Tan

explained that he was unable to confirm who the shareholders were because Master Yuanqing

had not given him a list of Buddhist believers who had been helping out in the business of

BBS and who would be given shares in BBSPL. I have stated above that I do not accept that

he had sought such a list from Master Yuanqing. In my view, Mr SK Tan had wanted to give

the impression that he knew less than what he actually knew because he knew trouble was

brewing and he did not want to be blamed. </p>

Mr Lau’s letter dated 15 May 1996</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">99.    A copy of the minutes of the 31 March 1996 meeting was sent to

each of the three Defendants with separate cover letters each dated 30 April 1996. It drew

a response from Mr Lau. His letter dated 15 May 1996 to Lumbini and for the attention of

Mr SK Tan said: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘Dear sirs,</p>
<b><p align="justify">SUBJECT: <u>CORPORATISATION OF BODHIGAYA BOOKSHOP</u></p>
</b><p align="justify">I refer to your letter dated 30 April 1996 on the above

  subject.</p>
<p align="justify">The conversion of "Bodhigaya Bookshop" from a sole-proprietor

  into a private limited company <u>has no complication</u>. Matters appear complex because

  parties who have not been involved in the affairs of the "Bookshop" at all for

  at least the last five years suddenly decided to intervene. When For You Information was

  taken out of Lumbini Pte Ltd in 1994 by the same group of people, I as a director and Ven.

  Seck Wan Chin [meaning Master Yuanqing] as advisor, were not informed at all. I would

  suggest that they now should concentrate on running For You well. I wish them all the

  best.</p>
<p align="justify">I communicated with K.S. Yeo twice. Once was at a meeting at Mr Billy

  Young’s office with you in about early April 1995. The other conversation was K.S.

  Yeo telephoned me one late night in March 1996. <u>In these communication, K.S. Yeo did

  not mention about the accounts</u>. Even if he has asked me for the 1995’s accounts,

  they were not finalised yet in March 1996. As for the past accounts, they are being kept

  at the office. Personally, I do not keep any of the accounts.</p>
<p align="justify">In the telephone conversation, K.S. Yeo enquired why "Bodhigaya

  Bookshop’s" assets were not distributed into three parts. I informed him that I

  was not aware that there was such an arrangement. I explained to him that the

  privatisation of the "Bookshop" will be on a going concern basis which <u>follows

  the same principle as that of For You Information</u> when it broke away from Lumbini. <u>On

  the same basis, Lumbini would take 20% equity participation</u> in the private limited

  company. I told him he could also check with you on this arrangement (as the night was

  getting late then).</p>
<p align="justify">The privatisation was originally scheduled on 30 September 95. It was

  delayed till 31 Dec 95 because the new company was only incorporated on 21 November 1995.

  It does make sense to have the accounts audited and finalised as at 31 December 95 for the

  takeover to be effective.</p>
<p align="justify">As far as I am aware the $100,000 was recorded as loan from the

  directors of Lumbini Pte Ltd to Lumbini itself. They had verbally indicated that the loan <u>would

  be treated as donation</u> to company for the good cause of Buddhism. On this basis, I

  agreed to volunteer as a director of the company for same good cause when invited.</p>
<p align="justify">For the sake of Buddhism, all parties should allow "Bodhigaya

  Bookshop" be continued to run on a going concern basis under the constitution of a

  private limited company. Let the people who have the experience and have contributed to

  the success of the Bookshop in the past, continue to (<i>sic</i>) carried on the business

  despite the change of constitution.</p>
<p align="justify">May I take this opportunity to put forward the further proposal of Ven.

  Seck Wan Chin:</p>
<p align="justify">(a) Since Nalanda is dormant and has been abandoned, and the

  "Bodhigaya Bookshop" has been overseeing the administrative functions, suggest

  that the firm be (<i>sic</i>) brought over for a consideration of $1 by "Bodhigaya

  Bookshop Pte Ltd".</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Sarnath Publication being also a dormant company be purchased by

  "Bodhigaya Bookshop Pte Ltd" for a consideration of $1.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Dormant Manjusri Ltd being a public company should not be

  transferred to Lumbini Pte Ltd. It should remain an independent company.</p>
<p align="justify">This is an open reply. Please circulate it to the parties concerned. I

  hope I have clarified matters.</p>
<p align="justify">Sg. Lau Kim Koon<br/>

  Director ’<br/>

  [Emphasis added.]</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In cross-examination, Mr Lau said that as far as he was concerned, the

conversion was ‘already a done deal’ (NE 203).</p>
<p xmlns="">100.    In Mr SK Tan’s AEIC at paras 38 to 40, he said he conveyed

the proposal to Master Guangchao, Yeo Kwang Seng and Billy Yang who were not agreeable to

it. He claimed that he told Master Yuanqing and Mr Lau separately of the rejection of

their proposal and they could consider making a proposal to buy the business of BBS based

on a discount and an interest-free instalment scheme, if the sum to be paid was still too

large. However, Master Yuanqing told him to keep out of the matter and BBSPL should not

have to pay for BBS’s assets just as Saddha had not paid for FYI’s assets.</p>
<p xmlns="">101.    Mr SK Tan’s AEIC did not elaborate as to which proposal he

was referring to. </p>
<p xmlns="">102.    As the proposed purchase of Nalanda and Sarnath at $1 each is a

non-issue, because no one has alleged that there was a concluded agreement to transfer or

sell either of them, I take it that he was referring to BBS. However, Mr Lau was not

making any proposal regarding BBS. Mr Lau was simply refuting the $100,000 which Yeo Kwang

Seng and/or Master Guangchao and/or certain Buddhist believers (‘the Dissenting

Group’) wanted for BBS. On the other hand, Mr SK Tan did not respond in writing to Mr

Lau’s letter to refute what Mr Lau was saying. I am of the view that this was because

he knew that Mr Lau was right in that the $100,000 was a donation and not a loan or a

conditional loan as Mr SK Tan had alleged and the agreement was that Lumbini would take a

20% stake in the new company. I am also of the view that Mr SK Tan did not revert orally

to Master Yuanqing or Mr Lau. In cross-examination, he admitted that he did not do

anything to clarify the position with Mr Lau after he received the letter (NE 104 and

105).</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Resolutions for $1 nominal consideration</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">103.    Subsequently, Mr SK Tan was instructed by Master Yuanqing to

prepare directors’ resolutions for BBSPL and Lumbini for BBSPL to purchase and take

over the assets and liabilities of BBS for $1. The resolutions were forwarded with a cover

letter dated 8 July 1996 from SK Tan &amp; Co addressed to BBSPL and Lumbini and for the

attention of Master Yuanqing and Mr Lau. The cover letter ended with this para: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">‘In addition, our Mr S K Tan (Tan Soo Kiat) wish to place on

  record that he has nothing to do with the transactions, ([<i>sic</i>] there is

  take-over-disposal of all the assets of the business, Bodhigaya Book Shop). He also does

  not wish to see any consequential liabilities to him or Lumbini Pte Ltd.’</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">104.    Mr SK Tan said he prepared the resolutions because of the

instruction of Master Yuanqing which he was obliged to comply with as SK Tan &amp; Co were

providing corporate secretarial services.</p>
<p xmlns="">105.    On 9 July 1996, Mr SK Tan sent a letter addressed to various

persons as follows:

</ol>
<p xmlns="">106.    Mr SK Tan said in cross-examination he had sent this letter

because some people had been told that he had agreed to the $1 consideration and about

documents which he had signed (NE 81).</p>
<p xmlns="">107.    In para 22 of his AEIC, he had also suggested that Saddha’s

taking over of FYI was different from that of BBSPL’s taking over of BBS because FYI

had not used any funds from Lumbini. As it turned out, the minutes of a board meeting of

Lumbini dated 13 March 1989 stated that $2,000 would be transferred to FYI as working

capital (NE 59 and 60). This suggested that FYI did receive some financial assistance from

Lumbini. In any event, while it is true that BBS used most of the $100,000, that was not a

point raised in March 1995 to distinguish between the two take-overs. </p>
<p xmlns="">108.    By a letter dated 8 August 1996, SK Tan &amp; Co wrote to BBSPL

and Lumbini again for the attention of Master Yuanqing and Mr Lau. The letter pointed out

that the directors’ resolution for Lumbini which had been prepared had still not been

signed by Mr Lau. It also advised that tax and related matters between ‘the old set

up and the subsequent disposal’ had to be sorted out and delay would affect the audit

of Lumbini, the holding of its Annual General Meeting and the filing of Annual Returns

which might result in summonses being issued to the directors of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">109.    On 19 August 1996, another reminder was sent, although this time

it was addressed to BBSPL only. The penultimate paragraph stated that, ‘We, SK Tan

and or SK-SK Tan &amp; Co disclaim all liabilities and responsibilities on the above

takeover and disposal and all matters related thereto.’</p>
<p xmlns="">110.    Master Yuanqing did not dispute that the resolutions were

prepared at his request. He said he had suggested the figure of $1 because he did not want

people to gossip if the business of BBS was given to BBSPL for free. However, I note that

this reason was not stated in his subsequent letter dated 20 August 1996 when he mentioned

the $1 consideration. Besides, the $1 would not avoid any gossip if the gossip was truly

his concern. I am of the view that Master Yuanqing’s explanation was not truthful.

The real reason for the $1 figure was to avoid any argument about the absence of

consideration.</p>
<p xmlns="">111.    I would add that in the meantime, Mr Lau had sent five letters

to Lumbini at the office or P O Box address of SK Tan &amp; Co requesting a

directors’ meeting of Lumbini to discuss the delay in the finalisation of the audited

accounts of Lumbini and also his own concern about summonses being issued to the directors

of Lumbini. His letters stretched from 13 August 1996 to 11 September 1996. Mr Lau had

also tried to contact Mr SK Tan on the telephone.</p>
<p xmlns="">112.    Mr Lau was unsuccessful in contacting Mr SK Tan or drawing a

positive response from him. While not responding to Mr Lau, Mr SK Tan instead wrote to the

auditors of Lumbini on 23 August 1996 to authorise them (a) to hold back the audit, (b) to

propose a dividend and (c) to state that the disposal of BBS was also subject to proper

advice.</p>
<p xmlns="">113.    This letter from Mr SK Tan came to Mr Lau’s attention and

on 23 August 1996, Mr Lau wrote the third of his five letters. In that letter, Mr Lau said

that he failed to understand why Mr SK Tan was raising the issue of the disposal of BBS.

He said Mr SK Tan ought to know that the disposal ‘which was completed some eight

months ago is a non issue’. </p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Events on and after 21 September 1996</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">114.    On 21 September 1996, the Deposits were withdrawn by Ms Toh from

BBS’s account with Lee Wah Bank Limited. I will elaborate on this below. </p>
<p xmlns="">115.    On 12 November 1996, CS Tan &amp; Co acting for Lumbini sent a

letter of demand to Mr Lau, Master Yuanqing and Ms Toh. The letter stated that: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) BBSPL was incorporated on 21 November 1995 for the purpose of

  taking over the business of BBS as a going concern and at a certain price,</p>
<p align="justify">(b) no steps had been taken so far to transfer the assets of BBS to

  BBSPL,</p>
<p align="justify">(c) the accounting records of BBS were in their possession and demanded

  the return thereof within 7 days.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">116.    By a letter dated 14 November 1996, CS Tan &amp; Co wrote to

Master Yuanqing to offer the stocks and assets of the shop for sale at $100,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">117.    On the same day, i.e 14 November 1996, Mary Wang and Koh Chiou

Eng signed a letter to the directors of Lumbini to request that an Extraordinary General

Meeting be held immediately to consider and approve a resolution to remove Mr Lau as a

director of Lumbini. According to Mr SK Tan, the reason for this was because Mr Lau had

refused to return accounting records of Lumbini. However, I find that Mr SK Tan’s

explanation was not truthful. The request to remove Mr Lau was made even before the grace

period of seven days given by CS Tan &amp; Co on 12 November 1996 had expired.</p>
<p xmlns="">118.    On 26 November 1996, Rajah &amp; Tann acting for Mr Lau, replied

to CS Tan &amp; Co to dispute that Lumbini remained the owner of the assets of BBS and to

assert an agreement for the transfer of the assets of BBS to BBSPL for $1.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Deposits </p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">119.    As I have mentioned, Ms Toh withdrew the Deposits on 21

September 1996. It is not disputed that Ms Toh had been advised by Mr Lau to do so. It was

the position of the Defendants that Mr Lau did so to finalise the accounts of BBSPL.</p>
<p xmlns="">120.    Master Yuanqing had said in para 40 of his AEIC that the

deposits were not transferred to BBSPL earlier because Mr SK Tan had informed him that

since BBSPL did not require any additional funds and interest was still accruing, there

was no need to close the deposits and transfer them to BBSPL then. This allegation was

‘corroborated’ by para 13 of Ms Toh’s AEIC but there was a difference. She

said that Mr SK Tan had spoken to both Master Yuanqing and her. In any event, there was no

elaboration as to whether the Deposits had matured only in September 1996 or had been

renewed from time to time until September 1996. If the former, it would have helped to

establish the allegation of Ms Toh and Master Yuanqing.</p>
<p xmlns="">121.    The allegation about what Mr SK Tan had allegedly said about the

Deposits was not put to Mr SK Tan during cross-examination. On the other hand, neither did

Mr Chua challenge Master Yuanqing or Ms Toh on this. It was left to Mr Wong Tze Roy, who

was acting for the Third Parties, to make a very limited challenge when he cross-examined

Master Yuanqing (NE 162) but no challenge of Ms Toh.</p>
<p xmlns="">122.    I am of the view that Ms Toh and Master Yuanqing have not

established the allegation about what Mr SK Tan had allegedly said in respect of the

Deposits. </p>
<p xmlns="">123.    Three years later, on 30 September 1999, Lumbini sent a letter

of demand to Ms Toh stating that they had received official confirmation from the bank

about the withdrawals of three deposits of which two were claimed by Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">124.    Interestingly enough, the letter did not say that this was the

first time that Lumbini had learned about the withdrawals. In para 54 of Mr SK Tan’s

AEIC, he asserted that he had to write to the bank directly as he did not have the

accounting records and bank statements of BBS and Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">125.    As it turned out, the accounting records and bank statements of

BBS and Lumbini were probably in the office and storeroom at Blk 1 Rochor Road #03-520

Rochor Centre, which is a different address from the shop which is at 149 Rochor Road

#03-06 Fu Lou Shou Complex. Mr SK Tan had caused the locks to the office and storeroom to

be changed in February 1997. Furthermore, bearing in mind his allegation that he had

learned in February 1997 that BBSPL was operating BBS’s business, he did not explain

why it took him more than two years from February 1997 to seek information from the bank

about 1996 deposits even assuming that such information was not in the office and

storeroom.</p>
<p xmlns="">126.    In his AEIC at paras 53 and 54, he implied that he was waiting

for the outcome of a police investigation as he had made a report to the police who only

reverted in February 1998 that they would not take any further action on the matter.

However he did not say that he post-phoned seeking any information from the bank until the

outcome of the police investigation. Even if it were true that he was waiting for the

outcome, there was still no explanation as to why it took him more than one year from

February 1998 to seek information from the bank.</p>
<p xmlns="">127.    I find that Mr SK Tan was reluctant to pursue any inquiry or

claim until around September 1999 and that this was because he knew that BBS’s

business had been transferred to the new company for a 20% stake in it. </p>
<p xmlns="">128.    It was submitted for Lumbini that by September 1996, Mr Lau knew

that there were issues arising about the transfer of BBS’s business to BBSPL and he

had shut his eyes to this when he told Ms Toh to transfer the Deposits. Accordingly, he

was in breach of his duty to Lumbini. I am of the view that whether Mr Lau was in breach

of his duty to Lumbini depends on my finding as to whether there was an agreement to

transfer BBS’s business and the terms thereof.</p>

Mr SK Tan’s knowledge in February 1997</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">129.    As I have mentioned, Mr SK Tan had alleged that he was unaware

that BBSPL had been operating the BBS business after BBSPL’s incorporation.</p>
<p xmlns="">130.    In his AEIC, he said that it was in February 1997 that he

learned of this because it was then that Ms Toh had received a note from the external

auditors of Lumbini regarding a stock-take and she had referred the external auditors to

him. In cross-examination, he added another reason i.e that Yeo Kwang Seng had told him

then that the name of the shop had been changed (NE 86) even though it had been changed

about a year earlier.</p>
<p xmlns="">131.    Mr SK Tan stressed that the assets of BBS could not be taken

over simply by the incorporation of BBSPL. There should have been proper supporting

documents like a formal agreement and the appropriate resolution passed. However he

admitted that he did not mention these requirements to the Defendants.</p>
<p xmlns="">132.    He said he had assumed that upon termination of the business

registration, BBS’s assets had gone back to Lumbini. Yet he also said he was not sure

until February 1997 whether BBSPL was doing business and he did not know who was operating

the shop from 21 November 1995 to February 1997. Neither did he attempt to find out. He

then said that he had assumed that BBS’s business had been continued under Lumbini

after 21 November 1995 and that Ms Toh and Mr Lau had been operating the business at the

shop for Lumbini. The reference to Mr Lau operating the business was probably an

inadvertent error and Mr SK Tan probably meant to refer to Master Yuanqing.</p>
<p xmlns="">133.    Mr Chua sought to support Mr SK Tan’s belief by showing

that there was some confusion as to when Ms Toh eased to be an employee of Lumbini. It is

true that she herself said that after 1995, she was still helping out with Nalanda and

Lumbini. However, the point is that there was no evidence to show that she was being paid

the same salary by Lumbini for managing the bookshop business after 1995. Mr Chua sought

to overcome this by pointing out that the bank account of BBS was still not closed then

but it was not the evidence of Mr SK Tan that he had thought that Lumbini was paying Ms

Toh through this account.</p>
<p xmlns="">134.    Mr SK Tan said that when he learned in February 1997 that BBSPL

was operating the business, he instructed Mary Wang to change the lock to the main door to

the office and storeroom in an attempt to regain possession of the stocks. Interestingly

enough, he did not make any attempt to regain possession of the shop. His reason was that

he did not know who the landlord of the shop was.</p>
<p xmlns="">135.    I do not accept Mr SK Tan’s evidence that he did not

realise that BBSPL was carrying on the business of BBS until February 1997. He was aware

of: 

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Master Yuanqing’s unhappiness regarding FYI and Saddha,</p>
<p align="justify">(b) what transpired at the meeting of 22 March 1995,</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Master Guangchao’s response dated 28 March 1995.</p>
</ol>
<p xmlns="">136.    Following from this, SK Tan &amp; Co had prepared various papers

for the incorporation of BBSPL with a view to taking over the business of BBS and the

termination of BBS’s registration immediately upon incorporation.</p>
<p xmlns="">137.    Secondly, the business of BBSPL was being carried out openly at

the shop at 149 Rochor Road #03-06 Fu Lu Shou Complex with a new signboard. It is

improbable that Yeo Kwang Seng, Master Guangchao and their supporters also failed to

notice this until February 1997. Indeed, no one else said that he was unaware until

February 1997 that BBSPL had been carrying on the business at the same shop since its

incorporation.</p>
<p xmlns="">138.    Thirdly, in Mr Lau’s letter dated 23 August 1996, he had

stated that Mr SK Tan ought to know that the disposal of BBS was completed some eight

months ago and was a non issue. Yet there was no response or denial or expression of

surprise by Mr SK Tan to this. By the date of this letter, Mr SK Tan must have known that

BBSPL was operating BBS’s business, if he had not known earlier.</p>
<p xmlns="">139.    Fourthly, when Mr SK Tan give instructions to Mary Wang to

change the lock to the main door of the office and storeroom in February 1997, no such

instruction was given in respect of the shop. I do not accept his evidence that this was

because be did not know who the landlord was as there is no evidence of his attempts to

obtain this information. Neither did he thereafter inform the Defendants of his alleged

discovery or ask them to stop operating the business or return the assets of BBS. I find

that the real reason why he had asked Mary Wang to change the lock to the main door of the

office and storeroom in February 1997 was because a dispute had arisen over BBS and he had

aligned himself against the Defendants by then. The reason for changing the lock was that

Mr Lau had not returned the accounting records of BBS to Lumbini for which Mr Lau was

removed as a director of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">140.    I will now say something more about the claim for the accounting

records even though it is withdrawn, as it touches upon credibility. As I have mentioned,

Mr Lau was removed as a director of Lumbini for his alleged failure to return such records

even though the request to remove him was made before the deadline given to him to return

the records had expired. Worse still, it transpired during the trial that there were, at

least, some accounting records in the office and storeroom, which premises had been seized

by Mr SK Tan through the change of the main lock. He admitted that he did not check

whether any of the accounting records were there. Furthermore, after the main lock to the

office and storeroom was changed, the records were stored in plastic bags and removed to a

warehouse but Mr SK Tan claimed that he had not checked the plastic bags as there were

‘many other boxes as well’ (NE 94). It was only at the stage of Closing Replies

that Mr Chua sensibly withdrew this claim but the damage to the credibility of Mr SK Tan

and Lumbini had been done.</p>

MY CONCLUSION </p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">141.    Master Yuanqing denied that the plan to set up Lumbini and

various businesses was his. He said it was Yeo Kwang Seng’s. However, it is not

material to me whose plan it was. The fact is that Lumbini was incorporated after BBS was

registered and thereafter various businesses were registered with Lumbini as the

proprietor thereof. This was done after discussions with the two Buddhist monks and

various Buddhist believers.</p>
<p xmlns="">142.    As for Mr SK Tan’s allegation that the original

understanding was that Mr Yeo and he had the right to liquidate any company or business

set up and divide the assets into two for donation to charities if there was any dispute,

I am aware that Master Yuanqing admitted this understanding when he agreed with para 9(a)

and (b) of Mr SK Tan’s AEIC (NE 153). On the other hand, if this allegation were

true, it would have been mentioned at the meeting of 22 March 1995 or Master

Guangchao’s letter of 28 March 1995. It was only mentioned after the incorporation of

BBSPL in a meeting of 31 March 1996 which none of the first three Defendants attended. In

any event, even if this allegation were true, Mr SK Tan and Yeo Kwang Seng are not the

plaintiffs in the action before me and this alleged original understanding is not one of

the causes of action before me. Also, Mr SK Tan and Yeo Kwang Seng had never sought to

liquidate BBS as such.</p>
<p xmlns="">143.    As for Mr SK Tan’s allegation that part of the original

understanding was also that a new company which took over a business would also be

required to return whatever financial support it received from the parent company, Master

Yuanqing did disagree with this allegation. I doubt that this allegation is true for the

same reasons I have mentioned in para 142 above. In any event, this alleged original

understanding is also not one of the causes of action before me. </p>
<p xmlns="">144.    In addition, there was no evidence that BBS was still owing

money to Lumbini. Mr Chua tried to overcome this by arguing that Lumbini could not

possibly owe BBS any monies since all the assets of BBS belonged to Lumbini. However, the

evidence showed that there was some accounting between Lumbini and BBS. Indeed, according

to figures which were relied on by the external auditors for the audit of Lumbini for

year-end 31 December 1995, Lumbini was owing money to BBS (NE 4).</p>
<p xmlns="">145.    The root of the problem was that the business of FYI had been

hived off to a separate company i.e Saddha of which, it will be recalled, Lumbini held

20%. This was done without the knowledge and consent of Master Yuanqing who became

aggrieved when he learned about it. That is why the minutes of the meeting of 22 March

1995 reflect this unhappiness and a rift between the two Buddhist monks. The minutes also

reflected the view of Master Guangchao, Huang Guojian (Sudatta Eng) and Yang Guangming

(Billy Yang) that the other businesses should be independent and the decision would lie

with the three directors of Lumbini.</p>
<p xmlns="">146.    Master Yuanqing also proposed, not in the meeting of 22 March

1995, but in his letter dated 23 March 1995, that the shareholding of any new company

taking over any existing business be split 20/80 between Lumbini and the person in charge

of the business or who had achieved good results for the business. In the context of BBS,

this meant himself.</p>
<p xmlns="">147.    As I have mentioned, Master Guangchao did respond to this

proposal by his letter dated 28 March 1995 and agree to it. There was no objection from

anyone else. Up to that time, there was no question of payment of any money by the new

company and Lumbini was only to take a 20% equity in it. In that response, Master

Guangchao had also said that the date of independence of BBS would be decided by Master

Yuanqing and Mr SK Tan.</p>
<p xmlns="">148.    All the documents up to and pertaining to the date of

incorporation of BBSPL, except one, are consistent with the position that no cash payment

would be required from the new company or Master Yuanqing.</p>
<p xmlns="">149.    The only exception is the internal note of Mr SK Tan dated 17

November 1995 to Jamilah. In the light of the points I have mentioned in para 84 above, I

do not give it much weight. In any event, as an internal note, it cannot change what had

already been agreed in March 1995.</p>
<p xmlns="">150.    Mr SK Tan’s memorandum dated 5 February 1996 reinforces my

view. This memorandum must be considered in its entirety and the second paragraph should

not be considered in isolation. In my view, Mr SK Tan was telling the addressees that he

had carried out the March 1995 agreement and he wanted to know what else remained to be

done. If he was really asking to be told about the price to be paid to Lumbini, he would

have stated this specifically. In addition, if this memorandum was merely to inform the

addressees that the business registration of BBS had been terminated, he would have used

the date of 21 November 1995 instead of 1 January 1996.</p>
<p xmlns="">151.    As regards Mr SK Tan’s point that there cannot be a

transfer of a business simply by incorporating another company to take over the business

and that there must be proper documentation, Mr SK Tan accepted that he had not mentioned

to the Defendants the need for proper documentation. It was submitted for Lumbini that Mr

Lau, as a senior bank officer with an accounting degree and a former auditor, should have

realised that BBS’s assets which were worth more than $200,000 (based on the 1995

accounts) could not have been given away free without a formal agreement or requisite

resolutions and without checking with Mr SK Tan.</p>
<p xmlns="">152.    I am of the view that BBS’s assets were not given for free.

Lumbini was to receive a 20% stake in the new company. Secondly, it must be borne in mind

that Mr Lau’s full-time job was with the bank. He had only agreed to help out with

the accounts by being a director in Lumbini, before he was removed. Given that Mr SK Tan

was actively helping to incorporate BBSPL and de-register BBS, there was no reason for Mr

Lau to suspect that something was amiss then or to ask Mr SK Tan any question. It was also

not illogical for him to assume that the transfer was a done deal.</p>
<p xmlns="">153.    As SK Tan &amp; Co were providing corporate secretarial

services, they should have looked into the question of a formal agreement and/or drafted

the appropriate resolution. In any event, even in the case of FYI, no formal agreement was

produced in evidence for the transfer of its business to Saddha. Also no resolution of

Lumbini approving that transfer was produced. Although Mr Chua drew my attention to a

Lumbini resolution to invest 20% in Saddha, there was no mention in that resolution about

the transfer of the FYI business to Saddha. Yet it is common ground that FYI’s

business has been transferred to Saddha.</p>
<p xmlns="">154.    In my view, the absence of formal documents may reflect poorly

on SK Tan &amp; Co but it does not indicate the absence of a binding agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">155.    I am also of the view that some time after the memorandum dated

5 February 1996, the Dissenting Group must have had second thoughts about BBSPL taking

over the business of BBS without any cash payment.</p>
<p xmlns="">156.    The Dissenting Group must have thought that it was not right for

Master Yuanqing to get the plum of the various businesses when it was Yeo Kwang Seng and

Mr SK Tan who had donated $100,000 and much of this sum had been used by BBS. They

probably did not realise that Lumbini had been receiving financial support from BBS and as

at 31 December 1995, Lumbini was owing money to BBS and not the other way around (see para

144 above). </p>
<p xmlns="">157.    That was why Yeo Kwang Seng telephoned Mr Lau one late night in

March 1996 to ask why BBS’s assets were not distributed three ways. The incident is

mentioned in the third and fourth paragraphs of Mr Lau’s letter dated 15 May 1996.</p>
<p xmlns="">158.    I do not accept Yeo Kwang Seng’s evidence in paras 20 to 22

of his AEIC that he did speak to Master Yuanqing in or about January 1996 about dividing

the assets of BBS three ways and then discussed it with Mr SK Tan. I find that the three

way split was raised by Mr Yeo in March 1996, and not January 1996, and was raised with Mr

Lau as a question to ask why BBS’s assets were not distributed three ways. It may

have been raised with Master Yuanqing later or he learned about it later from Mr Lau and

Master Yuanqing then took issue with Mr SK Tan about it, as reflected in the minutes of

the 31 March 1996 meeting. Interestingly enough, the minutes also stated that Mr SK Tan

knew nothing about a three way split when he was questioned about it by Master Yuanqing. I

find that Mr SK Tan knew nothing about it until questioned by Master Yuanqing because the

three way split was not part of the March 1995 agreement. </p>
<p xmlns="">159.    It was also Yeo Kwang Seng’s evidence in paras 22 and 23 of

his AEIC that in or about February 1996, Mr SK Tan had suggested that he look for third

party buyers or ask Ms Toh if she was interested in buying the assets at $100,000. As he

was not successful in looking for such buyers, he then spoke to Ms Toh in about March 1996

about buying BBS who declined. In cross-examination, he added that Mr SK Tan then

suggested that they should advertise in the papers for buyers (NE 30). On the other hand,

Ms Toh denied that Yeo Kwang Seng approached her to buy BBS (NE 175).</p>
<p xmlns="">160.    I am of the view that Yeo Kwang Seng’s evidence on this

point is not true. Prior to his alleged approach to Ms Toh, his alleged position was that

the net assets of BBS had to be ascertained and not that $100,000 should be paid. If he

had wanted $100,000 instead, he would have approached Master Yuanqing instead of Ms Toh

who was not one of the principal players. Secondly, there was no evidence to substantiate

his allegation that he had tried to find other buyers and no evidence to substantiate his

allegation about the advice to advertise in the papers.</p>
<p xmlns="">161.    Like Mr SK Tan, he must have known that it had been agreed that

Master Yuanqing would take over BBS through a corporate vehicle. In 1995, there was no

question of trying to sell it to a third party.</p>
<p xmlns="">162.    The meeting of 31 March 1996 was called by Mr SK Tan because he

knew trouble was brewing from the Dissenting Group. He excluded the First to Third

Defendants from the meeting because he wanted to hear the views of the Dissenting Group

first.</p>
<p xmlns="">163.    At that meeting, the Dissenting Group must have expressed their

unhappiness to him and he must have felt that he was getting the blame as he had

incorporated BBSPL to take over BBS. That is why he attempted to assure them that although

BBSPL had been incorporated on 21 November 1995, there was no formal agreement about

BBS’s assets and liabilities (see the minutes of 31 March 1996 cited in para 97

above).</p>
<p xmlns="">164.    It was at this meeting that the Dissenting Group said that the

$100,000 ‘loan’ should be re-paid to Lumbini. Although it is not expressly

stated in the minutes as to who should pay the $100,000, it is clear to me that the

intention then was for BBSPL to pay it since it had taken over BBS and it was not disputed

that BBS had used most of the $100,000.</p>
<p xmlns="">165.    The Dissenting Group also still wanted Lumbini to hold 20% of

the equity in BBSPL but this was a non-issue as Master Yuanqing was agreeable to it.

However, this stake was not actively pursued by Lumbini at the time of incorporation of

BBSPL or even after the 31 March 1996 meeting and Mr SK Tan did not elaborate why this was

so. Although Master Yuanqing said in his AEIC that Mr SK Tan had told him that Lumbini did

not want to invest in 20% of the new company, his evidence on the timing of this

conversation was not entirely consistent (see paras 36 and 44 of his AEIC). Besides, it

was not put to Mr SK Tan that he had specifically said that Lumbini did not want the 20%

stake and I am of the view that Mr SK Tan did not specifically say this.</p>
<p xmlns="">166.    I note that in the minutes of the 31 March 1996 meeting, it was

reiterated that Lumbini should be given 20% of the new company ‘similar to For You

Information’. This shows that the Dissenting Group were still approaching the

privatisation of BBS on the basis that it should be carried out on the same terms as FYI

i.e a 20% stake in BBSPL for Lumbini. The only difference was that they now wanted

$100,000 to be paid as well. Even at this stage, there was still no requirement for BBSPL

to make a payment based on the valuation of the assets of BBS. Indeed, had there been such

a requirement, it would have meant that Lumbini was getting the 20% stake for free.</p>
<p xmlns="">167.    When Mr SK Tan sent the minutes of this meeting to each of the

first three Defendants, Mr Lau responded on 15 May 1996 to state that there was no

complication. Lumbini was to take only a 20% equity stake in BBSPL and the $100,000 was a

donation. As Mr Lau said in cross-examination, to him the matter was already ‘a done

deal’ (NE 203). There was no written reply to Mr Lau’s letter. Neither did Mr SK

Tan call Mr Lau to clarify the position (NE 104 and 105). </p>
<p xmlns="">168.    It is common ground that subsequently, Master Yuanqing informed

Mr SK Tan to prepare directors’ resolutions for the disposal of the assets and

liabilities to BBSPL for $1 and on 8 July 1996, SK Tan &amp; Co forwarded these

resolutions with a cover letter.</p>
<p xmlns="">169.    Although para 10(f) of the Amended Defence asserts that the

transfer at $1 ‘was agreed by all concerned (i.e Tan Soo Kiat, Mary Wang and Koh

Chiou Eng)’, I find that this was not the case. The Defendants were trying to rely on

the preparation of the resolutions by Mr SK Tan and the absence of any objection by him

thereto as being tantamount to an agreement by him to the $1 consideration. In their

further and better particulars, they were relying on implied agreement from Mary Wang and

Koh Chiou Eng. However, they must fail on the point about the alleged agreement of $1

consideration because Master Yuanqing himself accepted that there was no such agreement

and the $1 consideration was only his proposal (NE 149). Mr Lau also accepted that there

was no agreement on the $1 consideration (NE 204).</p>
<p xmlns="">170.    I also find that Mr Lau did not sign the resolution for Lumbini

to dispose of BBS’s assets and liabilities for $1 and Master Yuanqing did not sign

the resolution for BBSPL to take over the assets and liabilities for $1, because each of

them knew that this $1 consideration had not been agreed to by the Dissenting Group.</p>
<p xmlns="">171.    I accept Mr SK Tan’s evidence that he had prepared the

resolution because Master Yuanqing had asked him to do so in his capacity as manager of SK

Tan &amp; Co. I also find that he did not raise any objection, in his capacity as director

of Lumbini, because he was hoping that the matter could be resolved with the Dissenting

Group on the basis of a $1 nominal consideration. That is also why he continued to inquire

about the signing of the resolutions.</p>
<p xmlns="">172.    I note that in his reminder dated 8 August 1996, he mentioned

that tax and other related matters between the old set up and the subsequent disposal be

sorted out (see para 108 above). In my view, this illustrated his true thoughts in that he

knew that the assets and liabilities of BBS had been disposed to BBSPL. If the disposal

was pending agreement on the purchase consideration, which agreement was still not

forthcoming, it would have been pre-mature to talk about tax and other related matters

arising from the disposal.</p>
<p xmlns="">173.    In this reminder, he had asserted that delay in sorting out such

matters would affect the audit of Lumbini, the holding of its AGM and the filing of annual

returns which might result in summonses being issued to directors of Lumbini. Yet he did

not respond to Mr Lau’s telephone calls or five letters on the same point. I find

that he did not respond because he knew that had a meeting been convened, Mr Lau would

have insisted that the accounts of Lumbini be prepared on the basis that BBS’s

business had been disposed of. </p>
<p xmlns="">174.    The truth of the matter was that Mr SK Tan found himself caught

between the Dissenting Group and the Defendants. He himself alluded to this in para 50 of

his AEIC. That is why he started to disclaim responsibility, see the minutes of 31 March

1996 meeting and his letters dated 8 July 1996 and 19 August 1996 (referred to in paras

97, 103 and 109 above).</p>
<p xmlns="">175.    I note also that Master Guangchao did not give evidence. The

reason given was that he was not in Singapore. I am of the view that that is not a valid

reason. He is a material witness. He attended the meeting of 22 March 1995. He responded

to Master Yuanqing’s letter dated 23 March 1995 by his own letter dated 28 March

1995. He attended the 31 March 1996 meeting. I draw an adverse inference against Lumbini

for his absence.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

SUMMARY</p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns="">176.    Although many aspects of the evidence for the Defendants were

unsatisfactory, many aspects of the evidence for Lumbini were also unsatisfactory. In

addition, the documentary evidence favours the Defendants and Lumbini had failed to call

Master Guangchao and Ms Jamilah as witnesses. </p>
<p xmlns="">177.    The Defendants have not pleaded estoppel. Had they done so, it

would have been another ground for my finding in favour of the Defendants.</p>
<p xmlns="">178.    In the circumstances, I find that in March 1995, Master

Guangchao, Yeo Kwang Seng, and the rest of the Dissenting Group, and Mr SK Tan had agreed

that a new company be incorporated to take over the business of BBS in exchange for a 20%

equity stake in the new company with 80% to Master Yuanqing or whoever he cared to share

the 80% with. </p>
<p xmlns="">179.    Accordingly, it was not just Mr SK Tan who had agreed.

Therefore, Lumbini’s allegation that any agreement by Mr SK Tan was under the undue

influence of Master Yuanqing must also fail.</p>
<p xmlns="">180.    The agreement was carried out with the assistance of SK Tan

&amp; Co and BBSPL was incorporated to take over and did take over the business of BBS

from 21 November 1995 except that, probably for accounting purposes, BBSPL was treated as

taking over from 1 January 1996. However, in 1996, after Mr SK Tan’s memorandum dated

5 February 1996, the Dissenting Group changed their minds and wanted $100,000 to be paid.

When Master Yuanqing did not agree to this and Mr Lau sent his responses to refute any

suggestion that $100,000 should be paid, Mr Lau was removed as a director of Lumbini

allegedly for failing to return accounting records of Lumbini. In the meantime, the

Deposits had been physically taken over by BBSPL on 21 September 1996.</p>
<p xmlns="">181.    Contrary to Mr SK Tan’s denial (in NE 97 and 102), this

action arises because of the $100,000. Although Mr SK Tan and Mary Wang became the

remaining directors of Lumbini, this action is driven by the Dissenting Group. However, as

Lumbini has no cause of action against the Defendants for the $100,000, it has instead

sought damages or an account of all its assets wrongfully transferred to BBSPL and profits

arising therefrom, although the prayer for an accounting was also dropped by its Counsel

in Closing Replies before me.</p>
<p xmlns="">182.    I dismiss Lumbini’s claims against all the Defendants and

the claims against the Third Parties. I will hear the parties on costs.</p>
