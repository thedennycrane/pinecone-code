He has remained as the registered proprietor of the Property from 11 December 1979. The Property is located beside a strip of land described as Lot No. MK17-02870X (the “Strip of Land”). This Strip of Land belongs to the defendant and is the subject of contention in this originating summons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff’s claim, in essence, is that he is the owner of the Strip of Land having adversely possessed it since 1979 (or in shorthand, acquired title by adverse possession).

The position was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Balwant Singh v Double L &amp; T Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 7 at [24] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Firstly, for land held under the common law system if the adverse possessor did not have 12 years of adverse possession as of 1 March 1994, he would now not be able to make a claim – see s 9(3) of the Limitation Act. Conversely, if he had the requisite 12 years, he could rely on s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA to preserve his possessory title. Secondly, for registered land held under the provisions of the repealed LTA, the adverse possessor could rely on ss 172(7) and 172(8) of the new LTA. Thirdly, for registered land held under the provisions of the new LTA, no adverse possession claims are now allowed unless s 172(7) or 172(8) of the new LTA applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Strip of Land was unregistered land, of which the plaintiff was in possession.

In <span class="font-italic">Wong Shing Chai</span>, the court cited <span class="font-italic">Tsang Foo Keung v Chu Jim Mi Jimmy </span>[2017] 3 HKC 527 at [26], for the proposition that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The person claiming adverse possession has the burden of proving both exclusive physical control and the requisite intention.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It is plain, however that the fences depicted in the two sets of photographs are different from one another. Counsel for the plaintiff accepted that the New Fence described in the plaintiff’s affidavits referred to a “chain-link” fence, which is also depicted in the first set of photographs. The fence in the second set of photographs, in contrast, is a solid, aluminium fence. The photographs therefore do not assist at all in the plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The plaintiff was also unable to produce any documentation or any planning approvals as proof of the construction works. Even disregarding the differences between the photographs, there is no evidence that the New Fence (or the “chain-link” fence) had been erected by the plaintiff in or around early 1980. The photograph is dated January 1984, as noted above at [14]. Taken at its highest, this would indicate that the plaintiff had constructed the New Fence by January 1984 and not before 1 March 1982.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The plaintiff’s next point on factual possession is that he had planted several rambutan trees on the Property at the same time of the construction works above at [13]. The plaintiff’s argument is that the rambutan trees he had planted in or around early 1980, are the same trees on the Property today and they had grown and extended their roots into the Strip of Land.

</div> In support of this argument, the plaintiff tendered two further sets of photographs of the rambutan trees, one set dated January 1984 and one set of the trees on the site today. These photographs were accompanied by expert evidence from an arborist, Mr Yap Chung Hoe Derek (“Mr Yap”). Based on his affidavit dated 6 April 2020 (“Mr Yap’s Report”), the key findings of Mr Yap were as follows:

The unequal distribution of surface roots could also be due to non-homogenous water distribution. Further, such an examination should not be based purely on surface roots and should take into account roots below soil level.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On its part, the defendant relied on the expert evidence of an arborist, Mr Goh Mia Chun (“Mr Goh”). Mr Goh produced two reports: the first dated 17 March 2020, and the second dated 21 April 2020 that was a reply to Mr Yap’s Report. The key findings from both of Mr Goh’s reports may be summarised as thus:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The branch architecture and the tree form of the trees in the two sets of photographs are “clearly different”.

The lack of resources for growth and obstacles in the soil constituted impediments to root structure and distribution.

In relation to the branch architecture and the tree form, I find that in totality, the evidence on this is equivocal at best. I will note, however, that this was largely because Mr Yap did not produce a follow-up report, leaving most of the points made in Mr Goh’s second report unrebutted. Additionally, the multitude of literature relied upon by Mr Goh also remains unrebutted by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On balance, however, I find that the points made by Mr Goh on root growth to be more persuasive. The photographs indicate a clear, and highly asymmetrical, growth pattern <span class="font-italic">away</span> from where the Inner Fence used to be. Further, in the report provided by the plaintiff’s own surveyor expert, Mr Quah Kee Soo (“Mr Quah”), it can be seen that the extent of tree roots are unevenly distributed on the side towards the Property and not the Strip of Land.

</div> While non-homogenous water distribution is a possible reason, there is no evidence to show that this was true. Given that both parties agree that the Inner Fence did indeed exist, and that the Strip of Land was previously a drainage area without soil, it is more likely that these were the causes of uneven root growth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Additionally, the pattern in which the plaintiff had planted the rambutan trees suggests that the Inner Fence might have existed at the time of planting. The defendant rightly points out that the trees on the Property appears to have been planted in a manner that was parallel to the boundary walls surrounding the Property and the Strip of Land, and generally an even distance of about half to one metre away from the boundary walls. The only deviations from this pattern are a jackfruit tree planted on the Strip of Land itself, and the rambutan trees. While the rambutan trees had been planted further away from the boundary walls when compared to the other trees, it was pointed out that they had maintained the distance of about half to one metre away from where <span class="font-italic">the Inner Fence used to be</span>. The plaintiff proffered no explanation as to why this was the case. It is likely that the Inner Fence still existed at the time when the rambutan trees were planted, and that prevented the plaintiff from planting closer to the boundary wall. For completeness, I note that the jackfruit tree, while planted extremely close to the boundary wall, was explained by Mr Goh to have been at most 15 years in age. This meant that it would have been planted at the earliest in 2005, by which time the plaintiff would have already removed the Inner Fence. This was unchallenged by the plaintiff at the hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In any event, it must be emphasised that the rambutan trees are on the Property and not within the Strip of Land. This was confirmed by Mr Quah in his report. The plaintiff has not provided any authority or any reason whatsoever as to how the mere growth of roots into a neighbouring piece of land suffices to establish factual possession. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Powell </span>at 471 (cited by <span class="font-italic">Lee Martin v Wama bte Buang</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 467 at [16]), the alleged possessor must have been “<span class="font-italic">dealing</span> with the land in question as an occupying owner might have been expected to” [emphasis added]. I cannot see how the fact that a tree, planted by the plaintiff within his property, and having some of its roots growing into the defendant’s land, can constitute adverse possession. In my view, to accept the plaintiff’s submission that would be to lower the threshold far below what is required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On the evidence before me, the plaintiff has failed to show that he had constructed the New Fence (and the accompanying works) or planted the rambutan trees before 1 March 1982. The plaintiff has therefore not satisfied the burden of showing that he was in possession of the Strip of Land for 12 continuous years prior to 1 March 1994.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Consequently, the defendant remains the owner of the Strip of Land and its counterclaim is allowed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 For the reasons given, I reject the plaintiff’s claim and allow the defendant’s counterclaim. The plaintiff is therefore also ordered to remove the fences and walls surrounding the Strip of Land.  Counsel are to file, within two weeks of this judgment, written submissions on the quantum of costs to be awarded in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">  Yap Peck Choon Patrick and Callie Kwong Yan Li (BR Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh SC and Tan Ruo Yu (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">Certified True Copy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">Private Secretary to Judge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">Supreme Court</span></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
