<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by ACC (“the
                    Applicant”) under O 53 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R5, 2006 Rev Ed) for an order quashing the determination issued by the
                    Comptroller of Income Tax (“the Respondent”) dated 6 February 2009
                    that withholding tax applied to payments made by the Applicant to its overseas
                    subsidiaries. Leave to apply was granted on 10 July 2009 pursuant to O 53
                    r 1 (see <em>ACC v CIT</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 273), which decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on
                    2 February 2010 (see <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v
                        ACC</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1189).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aircraft leasing arrangements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Applicant is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore which engages in the business of aircraft leasing together with its
                    subsidiaries, most of which are special purpose companies (referred to
                    collectively as “SPCs” and individually as an “SPC”)
                    incorporated in the Cayman Islands and are not “resident in
                    Singapore” within the meaning of s 2(1) of the Income Tax Act
                    (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“ITA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As is typical of most aircraft leasing
                    companies, each SPC owns only one aircraft and enters into separate loan
                    agreements with offshore banks to finance the purchase of its aircraft. Such a
                    “one company-one aircraft” business structure is a usual
                    requirement of the bank providing financing as it serves the purpose of
                    ring-fencing risks. The SPCs lease their aircraft to airline companies. These
                    leases may stipulate a “floating rate” rent or a “fixed
                    rate” rent. If the aircraft is leased on a “floating rate”
                    rent, the rental charged by the SPC fluctuates with the floating interest rate
                    charged by the offshore bank financing the purchase of the aircraft; the SPC
                    therefore will not be exposed to risks in the movement in interest
                rates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the case of “fixed rate” rent,
                    however, the rental that an SPC charges the airline is fixed while the interest
                    the SPC pays on the loan from the offshore bank fluctuates with the prevailing
                    interest rate charged by the bank. This exposes the SPC to potential risks in
                    the fluctuation in interest rates. To minimise such risk exposure, the SPCs
                    hedge the interest rate exposure on their floating interest rate loans by
                    entering into interest rate swap agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interest rate swap agreements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before a company can enter into a swap
                    arrangement with a bank, it is required to put in place an International Swaps
                    and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreement, which has been
                    described in the following terms in Graham Roberts, <em>Law
                        Relating to International Banking</em> (Woodhead Publishing Ltd, 1998)
                    at para 9.2.2:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ISDA agreement is a single Master Agreement, which the parties enter
                        into ideally when they agree their first swap. This master agreement is
                        intended to regulate the legal relationship between the parties; it is a
                        detailed document governing most of the aspects of the relationship.
                        Attached to the Master Agreement is a Schedule, in which the parties can
                        add, amend or vary the details of the Master Agreement. The detailed
                        economic features of each transaction separately are then recorded in a
                        separate document, the confirmation. In addition, ISDA has drafted a booklet
                        containing definitions of various economic terms, such as calculation of
                        floating and fixed amounts, etc. These definitions can be incorporated into
                        the confirmation, thereby keeping each confirmation relatively short.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Typically, a company would put in place ISDA agreements with several
                    banks so that it has a menu of banks to choose from.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       If each individual SPC were to enter into an
                    ISDA agreement with a bank, the bank would require the Applicant to provide a
                    guarantee for each ISDA agreement since the SPC would have a relatively weaker
                    balance sheet compared to its parent company. For commercial convenience, rather
                    than having to manage the administrative burden of each SPC’s entering
                    into several ISDA agreements with various banks and the Applicant’s
                    provision of guarantees for each ISDA agreement, the SPCs and the Applicant
                    decided that the Applicant would enter into swap arrangements with Singapore
                    banks or Singapore branches of foreign banks (referred to collectively as
                    “Onshore Banks” and individually as an “Onshore
                    Bank”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       An interest rate swap is essentially a
                    contractual swapping of anticipated cash flows. Each party to an interest rate
                    swap agreement is known in the industry as a “counter-party”. In
                        <em>Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough
                        Council</em> [1990] 2 QB 697 (“<em>Hazell</em>”), Woolf LJ explained the nature of interest
                    rate swaps in the following manner (at 739–740):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A swap is an agreement between two parties by which each agrees to pay the
                        other on a specified date or dates an amount calculated by reference to the
                        interest which would have accrued over a given period on the same <em>notional principal sum</em> assuming different rates of
                        interest are payable in each case. For example, one rate may be fixed at 10
                        per cent. and the other rate may be equivalent to the six-month London
                        Inter-Bank Offered Rate (‘LIBOR’) [<em>ie</em>, a floating interest rate]. If the LIBOR rate over the
                        period of the swap is higher than 10 per cent. then the party agreeing to
                        receive ‘interest’ in accordance with LIBOR will receive more
                        than the party entitled to receive the 10 per cent. <em>Normally neither party will in fact pay the sums which it has agreed to
                            pay over the period of the swap but instead will make a settlement on a
                            ‘net payment basis’ under which the party owing the greater
                            amount on any day simply pays the difference between the two amounts due
                            to the other</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Neither counter-party to a swap transaction
                    makes any loan to the other so as to give rise to an obligation on the part of
                    the other to pay interest. The quantum of periodic payments each counter-party
                    makes to another is computed as a product of a <em>notional</em> principal amount, an applicable rate and a time period,
                    expressed in a formula thus: Periodic payment = notional amount
                        × applicable rate × time period. In
                    practice, however, as noted by Woolf LJ in <em>Hazell</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), the amounts payable by the
                    counter-parties are set off against each other so that on each payment date only
                    the difference between the two amounts is paid. Depending on the relationship
                    between the fixed and floating interest rates over the whole period of the swap
                    agreement, the payments between counter-parties could flow either way. An
                    interest rate swap agreement of this nature is known in the industry as a
                    “plain vanilla” interest rate swap: see, <em>eg</em>, John C Hull, <em>Fundamentals of Futures
                        and Options Markets</em> (Pearson Prentice Hall, 6th Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Hull</em>”), at
                ch 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       From October 2006 onwards, the Applicant and
                    each SPC entered into a swap arrangement mirroring the swap agreements that the
                    Applicant has entered into with the Onshore Banks. Where the swap agreement
                    between the Applicant and an Onshore Bank indicated the Onshore Bank as the
                    floating rate payer and the Applicant as the fixed rate payer, the corresponding
                    swap agreement between the Applicant and the SPC would indicate the Applicant as
                    the floating rate payer and the SPC as the fixed rate payer. In this
                    back-to-back arrangement, the same fixed and floating rates are employed in both
                    sets of swap agreements. In this way, in a situation where the floating interest
                    rate is higher than the fixed interest rate, as between the Onshore Bank and the
                    Applicant, the net payment will be from the Onshore Bank to the Applicant and
                    flow through from the Applicant to the SPC. If the reverse situation
                    materialises, the net payment will be from the SPC to the Applicant and flow
                    through from the Applicant to the Onshore Bank. From this description, it can be
                    readily deduced that the Applicant acts as a middleman between the SPC and the
                    Onshore Bank with net payments flowing through it in either
                direction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As the net payments or receipts were amounts
                    due to or from the SPCs, these amounts were recorded in the Applicant’s
                    accounting books as “Amount owing to/by subsidiary” and were also
                    correspondingly recorded in the SPCs’ books.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s determination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In October 2008, the Applicant wrote to the
                    Respondent to confirm that withholding tax was not applicable to the payments
                    made by the Applicant to the SPCs for the period October 2006 to March 2008
                    (“the SPC Payments”). In a letter dated 6 February 2009, the
                    Respondent indicated its determination that based on s 12(6) read with
                    s 45 of the ITA, withholding tax applied to the SPC Payments (“the
                    Determination”). The same letter also stated that the Applicant was
                    required to account for the amount of tax that should have been withheld and
                    would be liable for a penalty for non-compliance with the withholding tax
                    requirement. Dissatisfied, the Applicant instituted these proceedings to obtain
                    a quashing order against the Determination. Meanwhile, the Applicant paid under
                    protest the amount of withholding tax, but not the penalties, determined by the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In its submissions, the Applicant sought to
                    show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     On a general level,
                            s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) of the ITA did not extend
                        to interest rate swap payments; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if interest rate swap payments did fall within
                            s 12(6)(<em>a</em>), on the facts of the case,
                        where the Applicant has acted on behalf of the SPCs in the swap transactions
                        with the Onshore Banks, the sums credited by the Applicant to the accounts
                        of the SPCs were not interest rate swap payments and did not fall within the
                        provisions of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent’s contention was that the
                    SPC Payments made by the Applicant to its SPCs were interest rate swap payments
                    that were caught by the current version of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) and fell within s 12(6)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the ITA in particular because the SPC Payments were
                    “any other payment”, made in connection with a loan or
                    indebtedness, which were borne by the Applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statutory provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The withholding tax requirement stems from
                    s 45(1) of the ITA which provides:</p>

                    fees, payments for the use of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial
                    knowledge or information, and rents or payments under agreement for the use of
                    movable property”. Thus, the words “any interest, commission, fee

                        s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) should be interpreted in the
                    light of the Minister’s explanation that the aim of the expanded
                    definition of source of income under s 12(6) was to include
                    “interest accruing from suppliers’ credit or deferred payments for
                    the sale of goods”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Deeming provision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Applicant submitted that as s 12(6)
                    is a <em>deeming</em> provision, it necessarily employs a
                    statutory fiction and should therefore be construed strictly. In <em>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Comber</em> (1986)
                    64 ALR 451, it was held that (<em>per</em>
                    Fisher J at 458):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... deeming provisions are required by their nature to be construed
                        strictly and only for the purpose for which they are resorted to (<em>Ex parte Walton</em> (1881) 17 Ch D 746
                        per James LJ at 756). It is improper ... to extend by implication the
                        express application of such a statutory fiction. It is even more improper so
                        to do if such an extension is unnecessary, the express provision being
                        capable by itself of sensible and rational application. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Applicant also referred to another maxim of revenue law which
                    states that the taxpayer is not to be taxed unless the taxing statute
                    unambiguously imposes the tax on him: see <em>Russell (Inspector
                        of Taxes) v Scott</em> [1948] 1 AC 422, <em>per</em> Lord Simonds at 433. In similar fashion, Lord Buckmaster
                    observed in <em>Greenwood v FL Smidth &amp; Company</em>
                    [1922] 1 AC 417 at 423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, I think, important to remember the rule, which the Courts ought to
                        obey, that, where it is desired to impose a new burden by way of taxation,
                        it is essential that this intention should be stated in plain terms. The
                        Courts cannot assent to the view that if a section in a taxing statute is of
                        doubtful and ambiguous meaning, it is possible out of that ambiguity to
                        extract a new and added obligation not formerly cast upon the
                        taxpayer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Respondent contended that the
                    Minister’s speech at the second reading of the 1977 Bill highlighted the
                    limits of the scope of the original version of s 12(6) which could not be
                    applied to a diverse array of payments from business activities involving
                    Singapore. Thus, it submitted, the intention of Parliament was to widen the
                    scope of the deemed source rule in s 12 of the ITA and that the
                    “interest accruing from suppliers’ credit or deferred payments for
                    the sale of goods” were just two examples of scenarios where the limited
                    original version of s 12(6) would not apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     While I agree with the Respondent that the
                    1977 amendments to s 12(6) were intended to widen the scope of the deemed
                    source rule in s 12, I am of the view that that widening should be
                    construed according to a purposive reading of the literal wording of
                    s 12(6). I note that in <em>ABB v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2010] 2 SLR 837, Chao Hick Tin JA held
                    (at [54]) that s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act applies to all
                    written law and “effectively displaces the common law principle that tax
                    statutes should be interpreted strictly in favour of the taxpayer”. I do
                    not understand Chao JA as holding that purposive interpretation mandates that
                    tax statutes must be read <em>widely in every case</em>.
                    Rather, he was laying down the principle that in construing tax legislation, the
                    court should accord paramount consideration to the purpose or object underlying
                    the statute instead of relying solely on common law principles of interpretation
                    such as the strict construction rule. As an application of the dictates of
                    s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act to tax legislative provisions, this must
                    be right. In that case, Chao JA cited the following passage in <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 183 (“<em>Low Kok
                    Heng</em>”) at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act requires the construction of
                        written law to promote the purpose or object underlying the statute. In
                        fact, it <em>mandates</em> that a construction promoting legislative purpose be
                        preferred over one that does not promote such purpose or object: see Brady
                        Coleman, ‘The Effect of Section 9A of the Interpretation Act on
                        Statutory Interpretation in Singapore’ [2000] Sing JLS 152 at 154.
                        Accordingly, any common law principle of interpretation, such as the plain
                        meaning rule and the strict construction rule, must yield to the purposive
                        interpretation approach stipulated by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation
                        Act. <em>All</em> written law (penal or otherwise) must be interpreted purposively.
                        Other common law principles come into play <em>only</em> when their application
                        coincides with the purpose underlying the written law in question, or
                        alternatively, when ambiguity in that written law persists even after an
                        attempt at purposive interpretation has been properly made. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, while the court should not have reference <em>exclusively</em> to the common law principle of strict construction
                    in favour of the taxpayer, that common law principle may be applied when such
                    application coincides with the purpose underlying the statutory provision in
                    question or when ambiguity persists even after purposive interpretation has been

            </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It was common ground between the parties that
                    the SPC Payments are not “commission”, “fee” or even
                    “interest”. With regard to the meaning of
                    “interest”, in <em>Chng Gim Huat v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 360, Yong Pung How CJ
                    observed (at [36]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The following guiding principles can be distilled from the above
                        authorities. Firstly, the label attached to the payment is not conclusive of
                        its true legal nature. Whether or not a particular payment constitutes
                        ‘interest’ depends on the substance of the transaction.
                        Nomenclature does not alter the character of the payment if it is not in
                        fact ‘interest’ and vice versa. Secondly, the essence of
                        ‘interest’ is compensation for the deprivation for the use or
                        delayed payment of money by another. Thirdly, there must be a principal sum
                        of money by reference to which the interest payment is to be ascertained,
                        which sum of money must be due to the person entitled to the
                        interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agree that the SPC Payments should not be construed as
                    “commission” or “fee” (as these terms are used in
                    common parlance) as they were not paid in consideration of any service rendered
                    by the SPCs to the Applicant. Properly construed, the SPC Payments were also not
                    “interest” under s 12(6)(<em>a</em>)
                    because (a) they were not intended to compensate the SPCs for the deprivation
                    for the use or delayed payment of money by the Applicant; and (b) there was no
                    principal sum of money which was owing to the SPCs, by reference to which the
                    SPC Payments were to be ascertained. Quite rightly, the Respondent dropped its
                    earlier insistence that the SPC Payments were
                “interest”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Therefore, the Respondent contended, but the
                    Applicant denied, that the SPC Payments were “any other payment”
                    that fell within the meaning of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>).
                    In its submissions, the Applicant relied on the <em>ejusdem
                        generis</em> principle in order to ascertain the meaning of
                    “any other payment” in the context of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>). In <em>Bennion on Statutory
                        Interpretation: A Code</em> (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Bennion</em>”), at p 1231, the
                        <em>ejusdem generis</em> principle is described as
                    such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Latin words <em>ejusdem generis</em> (of the same
                        kind or nature), have been attached to a principle of construction whereby
                        wide words associated in the text with more limited words are taken to be
                        restricted by implication to matters of the same limited character. The
                        principle may apply whatever the form of the association, but the most usual
                        form is a list or string of genus-describing terms followed by wider
                        residuary or sweeping-up words.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>ejusdem generis</em> principle stems from the
                        linguistic implication by which words having literally a wide meaning (when
                        taken in isolation) are treated as reduced in scope by the verbal context.
                        It may be regarded as an instance of ellipsis, or reliance on implication.
                        The principle is presumed to apply unless there is some contrary
                        indication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As was explained in <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above,
                    each of the preceding terms “interest”, “commission”
                    and “fee” are commonly understood to be payments made by the payor
                    to the payee <em>in consideration</em> of the forbearance
                    in collecting the principal sum loaned, or services or work performed, by the
                    payee. Applying the <em>ejusdem generis</em> principle, the
                    words “any other payment” should be construed as some form of
                    consideration accruing to the payee in return for some benefit conferred by the
                    payee to the payor, following the genus of the preceding terms. In order to
                    determine what kind of benefit is relevant here, one must ascertain the meaning
                    of the other requirements in s 12(6)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“In connection with any loan or indebtedness”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The expression “in connection
                    with” could describe a range of links, but the court must look closely at
                    the surrounding words and the context of the legislative scheme: see <em>Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc</em>
                    [2008] STC 476, <em>per</em> Arden LJ at
                    [18]. In the context of a statutory provision which deems to be derived from
                    Singapore payment borne by a person resident in Singapore in order that tax is
                    chargeable on such sums paid, it is even more important to construe the
                    provision carefully, having regard to the legislative purpose behind that
                    provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As an illustration, in the context of
                    impugning financial assistance in connection with the purchase of a
                    company’s shares under s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), Andrew Phang J in
                        <em>Wu Yang Construction Group Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co,
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 451 rejected a broad construction
                    of the words “in connection with”, observing that (at [69] and
                    [71]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    ... a broad reading of the phrase ‘in
                            connection with’ in s 76(1)(<em>a</em>)
                            of the Act (which I have rejected), whilst linguistically possible, is
                            (at best) an academic exercise. The provisions of the Act in general and
                                s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) thereof in particular
                            exist in order to promote (rather than stifle) commerce in a real world
                            setting. Whilst nice linguistic arguments have their proper place in a
                            stimulating intellectual discussion, they have, with respect, no place
                            whatsoever in a practical context, where they are both irrelevant and
                            apt to confuse rather than enlighten. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    ... I have, in fact already referred to the
                            fundamental importance of the concept of purpose in
                                s 76(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act. And the
                            importance of this concept hinges on the <em>mischief</em> that is sought to be avoided, as set out above.
                            That mischief does <em>not</em> include
                            transactions, the sole or primary purpose of which is to give effect to
                            the <em>bona fide</em> commercial interests of the
                            company <em>other than</em> in the giving of
                            financial assistance in order to assist in the purchase of the
                            company’s shares. If so, then the phrase ‘in connection
                            with’ must be given a meaning that is consistent with the context
                            and intention underlying s 76 of the Act itself. In the
                            circumstances, I would reject a broad reading of ‘in connection
                            with’ and hold that that phrase must be read consistently with the
                            phrase ‘for the purpose of’. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The original version of s 12(6) referred
                    only to income derived from <em>loans</em> where the
                        <em>interest</em> is borne by a person resident in
                    Singapore. The scope of payment caught under s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) has since been expanded not only in terms of the <em>type</em> of payment borne (<em>ie</em>,
                    not only “interest” but also “commission”,
                    “fee”, or “any other payment”) but also the reason
                    for that payment. The payment borne by the person resident in Singapore can be
                    in connection with not only a “loan”, but also with other forms of
                    “indebtedness”. Apart from a loan made to the person resident in
                    Singapore, such indebtedness could arise, for instance, through an extension of
                    credit or other forms of deferred payment such as overdue trade accounts, by a
                    non-resident supplier of goods or services to the taxpayer resident in
                    Singapore. If payment is borne by that person <em>in
                        consideration</em> for the benefit of such form of deferred payment,
                    such payment is “in connection with” that indebtedness. The
                    obligation to make payment <em>arises out of</em> the
                    indebtedness. That is the connection between the payment and the
                    indebtedness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It follows that the loan or indebtedness
                    referred to in s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) should not include
                    any loan or indebtedness owed by the non-resident payee to a third party. Such
                    unrelated loan or indebtedness does not give rise to the payment and the payor
                    should not have to withhold tax thereon on account of a dubious
                    “connection” between the payment and the loan or indebtedness.
                    Indeed, the resident payor might not even be aware of such loan or
                    indebtedness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether interest rate swap payments fall within
                s 12(6)(a)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As I have noted at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, in an interest rate swap agreement between two
                    counter-parties, there is no subsisting loan (or indebtedness) between them.
                    Instead, an interest rate swap agreement is an agreement between two
                    counter-parties to “exchange cash flows in the future”; the
                    agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in
                    which they are to be calculated (see <em>Hull</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, at p 153). Typically,
                    the quantum of the cash flows is calculated based on a <em>notional principal amount</em>, but it bears emphasising that no such
                    principal amount has been passed under a loan (or other indebtedness) from one
                    counter-party to the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Certainly, at the date stipulated for payment
                    or settlement, one counter-party has to pay the other counter-party, depending
                    on which direction the net cash flow is in. On that payment date, one
                    counter-party “owes” the other a net payment of cash flow under
                    the interest rate swap agreement. This is of course true of any payment of any
                    kind from one party to the other, but that does not mean that there is of
                    necessity any <em>subsisting</em> loan or indebtedness
                    between the paying party or the receiving party. Indeed, depending on how the
                    floating interest rate fluctuates, the net payment could be in either direction,
                        <em>ie</em>, from the fixed rate payer to the floating
                    rate payer or <em>vice versa</em>. At the point of entry
                    into the interest rate swap agreement, it cannot be ascertained which of the
                    counter-parties is “indebted” because it is not until the payment
                    or settlement date that the counter-parties can determine which direction the
                    net payment should be in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In my view, therefore, there being no loan or
                    indebtedness involved in an interest rate swap agreement, payment made pursuant
                    to such an agreement would <em>not</em> be “in
                    connection with any loan or indebtedness”. Interest rate swap payments
                    should, ordinarily, fall outside the meaning of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) of the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I should mention that one of the arguments
                    that the Applicant made to explain why interest rate swap payments are not
                    covered by s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) was that when the
                    amendments were introduced in 1977 to include payments for trade indebtedness,
                    interest rate swaps were not known even in developed financial centres since
                    they were first entered into in 1981. The Applicant argued, further, that had
                        s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) been intended to cover
                    interest rate swaps, Parliament would have inserted the words “interest
                    rate swaps” in s 12(6)(<em>a</em>) as it did in
                    the cases of ss 10(2A), 14J(6) and 43N(1)(<em>c</em>)
                    of the ITA. It is, however, a settled principle that a statutory provision
                    should be construed in a manner which will take into account new situations
                    which may arise and which were not within contemplation at the time of its
                    enactment: see <em>AAG v Estate of AAH, deceased</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR 769 at [30]. Thus, in so far as these arguments attempt
                    to side-step rather than engage in elucidating the words of
                        s 12(6)(<em>a</em>), they do not assist the
                    construction of that statutory provision. An attempt at applying
                    s 12(6) should be made not only in relation to facts in existence at the
                    time it came into force but also to circumstances which may surface in the
                    future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Treatment of the SPC Payments under s 12(6)(a)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Respondent contended that the SPC Payments
                    were payments borne by the Applicant in connection with the loans <em>between the SPCs and offshore banks</em>. It justified its
                    contention on the basis that Parliament had intended s 12(6) to be given a
                    wide interpretation so as to frustrate tax avoidance schemes which evolved with
                    the myriad ways that business can be conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     To my mind, interpreting the words “any
                    loan or indebtedness” in such a way as to include loan or indebtedness
                        <em>not</em> involving the resident taxpayer would be
                    stretching the meaning of the statutory provision far beyond the purpose
                    underlying it. In <em>Low Kok Heng</em> ([24] <em>supra</em>], V K Rajah JA cautioned that (at [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[m]ore importantly, it is crucial that statutory provisions are not
                        construed, in the name of a purposive approach, in a manner that goes
                        against all possible and reasonable interpretation of the express literal
                        wording of the provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As I have explained at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>–<a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above, it
                    would not be reasonable to require the resident taxpayer to withhold tax on
                    payments purportedly “in connection with” a loan or indebtedness
                    that did not give rise to the payment. The loan agreements between the
                    non-resident SPCs and the offshore banks simply do not concern the resident
                    taxpayer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Indeed, the SPC Payments were clearly not made
                    in consideration for the loan between the offshore banks and the SPCs. They were
                    payments made pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement between each SPC and
                    the Applicant, which agreement the offshore banks were not privy to. Under that
                    agreement, there was no subsisting loan or indebtedness owing from the Applicant
                    to the SPC. Therefore, the SPC Payments were not made in consideration for
                    “any loan or indebtedness” and are not caught under
                        s 12(6)(<em>a</em>). They should not be deemed to
                    be derived from Singapore under that provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     According to the Applicant, the interest rate
                    swap agreements between the Applicant and the Onshore Banks were entered into
                        <em>on behalf of</em> the SPCs. Consequently, the sums
                    received from and paid to the Onshore Banks under the swap agreement with the
                    Applicant were sums received or paid by the Applicant “on behalf
                    of” the SPCs. Therefore, the moneys received or paid by the Applicant
                    were due to or payable from the SPCs and consequently were <em>not</em> interest rate swap payments. In this sense, the Applicant
                    was in fact acting as <em>agent</em> for the SPCs in
                    entering into the interest rate swap agreements with the Onshore
                Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In my view, such a disingenuous argument does
                    not pass muster. On its own case, the Applicant itself entered into swap
                    agreements with the Onshore Banks and the SPCs entered into swap agreements with
                    the Applicant <em>mirroring</em> those swap agreements with
                    the Onshore Banks. If the Applicant was indeed the SPCs’ agent, there
                    would have been no need to enter into its own interest rate swaps with the SPCs.
                    As agent, it would have been its duty to simply pass on the money it received
                    from the Onshore Banks to its principals the SPCs, or to pass the money in the
                    other direction, depending on the net cash flow. Further, as the SPC Payments
                    were payments made pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements
                    between the Applicant and the SPCs, they clearly were interest rate swap
                    payments. The Applicant’s attempt to characterise the SPC Payments as
                    merely sums that “rightly belonged to those SPCs” was wholly
                    unnecessary. They “rightly belonged to those SPCs” in consequence
                    of the interest rate swap agreements between the Applicant and the SPCs, not
                    through any principal-agent relationship between the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wide interpretation widely accepted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Respondent made the further argument that
                    the wide interpretation of s 12(6) that it forwarded in these proceedings
                    has been accepted by tax advisors, practitioners and businesses. This was
                    disputed by the Applicant, which suggested that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42.    The reality, insofar as we can tell, is that where
                            counterparties feel that their transactions may be within the
                            Respondent’s wide interpretation, they may simply avoid Singapore
                            as the place of doing interest rate swap businesses as it does not make
                            economic sense to do so. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Owing to the connectivity amongst the major financial centres in
                    the world, it is easy to arrange any derivative transaction, including interest
                    rate swap transactions, with financial institutions all over the world,
                    bypassing Singapore in the process. This would inevitably occur when the
                    transactions do not fall within the scope of remission or exemption by the
                    Respondent as the relevant parties desirous of utilising interest rate swap
                    transactions to their benefit would enter into such transactions with banks or
                    other counterparties in other financial centres.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Quite apart from the commercial realities,
                    this further argument does not assist very much in the construction of
                        s 12(6)(<em>a</em>). In <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte Ltd</em> [1994]
                    2 SLR(R) 948, Yong Pung How CJ opined (at [35]) that the practice of
                    the Comptroller with regard to s 24 of the ITA “does not in any way
                    illuminate the question of whether this <em>should</em> be
                    the practice of the Comptroller” since practice is <em>not</em> law. Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury made similar observations
                    in <em>Maco Door and Window Hardware (UK) Ltd v Revenue and
                        Customs Commissioners</em> [2008] 1 WLR 1790 at [66]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the fact that, for a substantial period, the commissioners interpreted
                        a particular provision in a taxing statute in a certain way is normally of
                        limited assistance as to the provision’s meaning. The interpretation
                        of legislation is, of course, ultimately a matter for the judiciary, not the
                        executive. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To echo Lord Neuberger’s words of caution, one should be
                    watchful of invocations of current practice of the executive to justify an
                    interpretation of legislative obligations, in particular, under tax provisions.
                    It is the duty of the judiciary to ensure that taxpayers are taxed only under a
                    proper construction of the legislative provisions, not under the continuing
                    misapprehension of the same on the part of the executive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As part of its justification for its wide
                    interpretation of s 12(6)(<em>a</em>),
                    the Respondent pointed to the Income Tax (Exemption of Interest and Other
                    Payments for Economic and Technological Development) Notification 2000 (S
                    411/2000) (“the Notification”), which exempts from tax any
                    interest rate swap payment by a financial institution to a non-resident payee,
                    as an indication of response by the Ministry of Finance to feedback from
                    relevant industry players to continue to make Singapore an attractive and viable
                    business and financial hub. I do not think that the content of such subsidiary
                    legislation, made by the Minister pursuant to powers conferred under
                    s 13(4) of the ITA, can be taken to be a guide as to what Parliament
                    intended by the language used in the Act, particularly if the Notification
                    postdated the 1977 amendments by some 13 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Having regard to all the relevant
                    considerations, I find that the SPC Payments were not payments in connection
                    with any loan or indebtedness borne by the resident Applicant to the
                    non-resident SPCs. In consequence, the requirement to withhold tax under
                    s 45 does not apply to the SPC Payments. The application for an order to
                    quash the Determination is granted in terms. Costs for this application as well
                    as the costs in relation to the leave application are awarded in favour of the
                    Applicant.</p>
