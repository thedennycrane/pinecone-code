The plaintiff was not paid even though it had apparently presented compliant documents.  The defendant refused to make payment because it claims that there was fraud in the documents presented, in that certain bills of lading were no longer documents of title, but worthless pieces of paper.  The applications before me do not concern the merits of the claim and defence.  They are limited to the questions as to whether the court has jurisdiction over the defendant because it contends that it has not been properly served with the writ, and also whether, if there was proper service, the court should exercise its jurisdiction because it is claimed by the defendant that there is a more appropriate forum than Singapore, and also because there are foreign court proceedings and foreign criminal investigations, which the defendant says will have a bearing on the determination of the issues in this action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff, Sinopec International (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Sinopec SG”), is a Singapore-incorporated company in the business of trading oil, refined petroleum and petrochemical products.

However, it would appear that Westpac withheld its decision on whether to do so, at least until after BComm had determined that the presented documents were compliant.  As it turned out, Westpac did not negotiate the LCs, presumably because BComm Tokyo subsequently rejected the documents as being non-compliant (see [12] below).  In these circumstances, Westpac HK only acted as a “collecting bank” in transmitting and presenting the documents to BComm Tokyo on Sinopec SG’s behalf and as Sinopec SG’s agent (see <span class="font-italic">Jack </span>at para 7.2).

It is also the presentation at that bank that is the point of reference for determining the time at which the presentation of documents under the credit was made (<span class="font-italic">Grains </span>at [51]).  In this case, if the documents presented were compliant, it would have been the Presentation at Westpac HK (and not any subsequent receipt of documents by BComm Tokyo) that would have rendered BComm liable under the LCs.

These allegations rest largely on what it had been informed of by officers of the Shanghai PSB at a meeting on 24 September 2019 (“the 24 Sep Meeting”).

First, the witnesses which BComm has identified as necessary for its defence do not appear relevant, and there is no evidence as to where they are located, and whether they are unwilling to testify in Singapore.  Second, it identifies the governing law of the LCs as Singapore law.  But it says, even if it is Hong Kong law, as argued by BComm, that would not be a significant factor in favour of Hong Kong as the more appropriate forum, since both Singapore and Hong Kong law are similar in respect of the fraud defence to a claim under letters of credit.  Third, it argues that no weight should be given to the PRC Civil Proceedings in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis as they were commenced for strategic reasons by BComm, well after the Suit was started in Singapore.  In the alternative, a stay should nevertheless be refused even if a more appropriate forum than Singapore can be identified because Sinopec SG will be deprived of a legitimate juridical advantage if the dispute were tried in the PRC, given the fact that the Shanghai Court will only apply PRC law, and the scope of the fraud defence under PRC law is broader as compared to Singapore law.  It also points to substantial prejudice arising from delay and procedural differences if the dispute were tried in the PRC as reasons for refusing a stay.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 For the Amendment Application, BComm argues that its prayer for the CMS Application should be amended to take into account the PRC Civil Proceedings as it will allow the real controversy between parties to be determined.  Sinopec SG opposes the Amendment Application on grounds that the PRC Civil Proceedings had been commenced for strategic reasons, and also because of how late in time the application was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the event that I am minded to grant the Amendment Application, BComm argues that the CMS Application should be allowed so that it can adduce all relevant evidence it requires for its fraud defence on the basis of findings from the PRC Criminal Proceedings and the PRC Civil Proceedings; and the Singapore courts can also have the benefit of those findings to avoid traversing the very same grounds.  Sinopec SG argues that the CMS Application should not be granted because the PRC Criminal Proceedings do not appear relevant to the issues in dispute in the Suit, and also because doing so would render the Singapore proceedings otiose and result in a substantial delay in the resolution of the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 There are four main issues to be determined: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there has been effective service on BComm to found the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts over it; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the Suit should be stayed on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the Amendment Application should be allowed; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the CMS Application (either in its original form, or in the form of the amended prayers) should be allowed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether there was proper service to found the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At common law, all branches of a bank are regarded as emanations of that one bank, and so the head office of a bank and its various branches are regarded as a single legal entity (<span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</span> (Michael Bridge gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Benjamin</span>”) at para 23-026;  E P Ellinger, Eva Lomnicka and C V M Hare, <span class="font-italic">Ellinger’s Modern Banking Law </span>(Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2011) at p 711).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In support of this argument, BComm relies on the decision of the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum Ltd v State Oil Marketing Co of the Ministry of Oil, Republic of Iraq </span>[2018] AC 690 (“<span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum</span>”).  In that case, the court had to identify the <span class="font-italic">situs </span>of a debt due under a letter of credit that was issued by the London branch of a French bank (“Credit Agricole”) to determine if it had the requisite jurisdiction to make an attachment order in respect of that debt.  The court accepted that it followed from Art. 3 of the UCP 600 that, for the purposes of the letter of credit, the London branch of Credit Agricole was to be treated as a separate bank from Credit Agricole’s French headquarters, and accordingly, the place where the debt under the letter of credit was recoverable, and the <span class="font-italic">situs </span>of that debt, was England (at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my judgment, BComm and BComm Tokyo are to be regarded as a single legal entity for the purposes of service of process under our procedural rules.  Art. 3 of the UCP 600, which parties have contracted to apply to the contract under the LCs, does not have the effect of altering the rules as to service of process so that originating process in respect of any dispute arising from a letter of credit must be specifically served on the bank branch that issued the credit.  The purpose of Art. 3 is to allow branches of the same bank to be treated as separate banks so that they can each perform the respective functions required of the different banks involved in a letter of credit transaction as set out in Art. 2 of the UCP 600, notwithstanding that these branches will be regarded at general law as parts of a single legal entity (see James Byrne <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">UCP600: An Analytical Commentary </span>(Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice, 2001) (“<span class="font-italic">Byrne</span>”) at pp 240-241; <span class="font-italic">Benjamin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([49] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 23-026).  As the following extract from <span class="font-italic">Byrne </span>suggests, how bank branches are to be treated for the purposes of service of process in a particular jurisdiction is a question outside of the UCP 600 (at p 243): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the ‘branch’ [of a bank] in another country … was nominated in the [letter of credit] to advise the [letter of credit], its role would be that of an advisor. Whether the home office [of that bank] could be brought into court in that jurisdiction [or] was subject to its law … are all questions beyond the scope of UCP 600 and are answered under the relevant legal regimes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 While the court in <span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum </span>found that a bank branch which issued a letter of credit constitutes a separate entity, I find that case distinguishable as it involved a different context from the present case.  In <span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum</span>, the court was concerned with identifying the <span class="font-italic">situs </span>of the debt under the said letter of credit.  To do so, the court had to consider where<span class="font-italic"> </span>that debt was recoverable.  It will appear that the court only applied Art. 3 and found the London branch of Credit Agricole to be a “separate bank” from its French headquarters because it had been of the view that the debt due under that letter of credit was only recoverable at the London branch, where the applicant for the letter of credit had maintained its accounts with Credit Agricole (see <span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum </span>at [31]).  The court therefore applied Art. 3 and regarded bank branches as separate entities <span class="font-italic">only</span> for the limited purpose of identifying the <span class="font-italic">situs </span>of a debt due under a letter of credit.  I do not read <span class="font-italic">Taurus Petroleum</span> as laying down a statement of general principle that bank branches involved in a letter of credit of transaction were to be regarded as separate entities for all purposes by virtue of Art. 3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Since BComm and BComm Tokyo are one and the same legal entity, I find that the effective service of the Writ on BComm, by service on BComm SG, suffices to establish the court’s jurisdiction over BComm as the defendant in the Suit.  I therefore dismiss the Declaration Application.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In coming to this conclusion, I note that the same result was reached by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in <span class="font-italic">LG Electronics Hong Kong Ltd v Bank of Taiwan </span>[2001] HKEC 2098, which involved somewhat similar facts.  In that case, the plaintiff was a beneficiary under a letter of credit issued by the Panchiao, Taiwan, branch of the Bank of Taiwan (“BOT”).   After the plaintiff’s presentation of documents was rejected, it commenced proceedings against BOT in Hong Kong to recover payment.  The writ of summons simply identified BOT as the defendant, and provided the address of its place of business in Hong Kong at which service may be effected (at [3] and [21]).  The court accepted that there had been effective service of originating process on BOT by virtue of service on BOT’s place of business in Hong Kong (at [14] and [17]).  BOT had argued that the defendant in the writ was BOT’s Hong Kong branch, which was in turn a separate legal entity from BOT’s Panchiao branch.  As such, BOT contended that the court had no jurisdiction because BOT’s Panchiao branch, which issued the credit, had not been named in the writ.  Like BComm in this case, BOT also relied on Art. 2 of <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 500</span> (“UCP 500”), which provided, in similar terms to Art. 3 of the UCP 600, that branches of a bank in different countries are considered separate banks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The court rejected BOT’s arguments - in particular, the argument that Art. 2 of the UCP 500 had the effect of rendering BOT’s Panchiao branch a separate legal entity (at [19] and [23]).  It held that the defendant identified in the writ was simply BOT, and not BOT’s Hong Kong branch (at [21]).  Bank branches were only to be treated as separate entities in their dealings with each other and other banks in a letter of credit transaction, but not for other purposes.  Hence, there was no need to identify BOT’s Panchiao branch as a defendant in the writ, because BOT Panchiao and BOT were simply one and the same entity (at [22]).  Since BOT was a registered foreign company under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap 32) (“the Ordinance”) (at [3]), service of process on BOT’s place of business in Hong Kong constituted effective service on BOT pursuant to provisions in the Ordinance that were similar in terms to s 376(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Companies Act (at [21] and [23]).  Accordingly, the court’s jurisdiction over BOT was properly founded.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Suit should be stayed on grounds of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">conveniens</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span>”) at [12] endorsed the test articulated by the UK House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd </span>[1987] AC 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>”) as governing an application for a stay of proceedings on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test comprises two stages.  The first stage of the test considers whether there is some other available forum which is more appropriate for the case to be tried, and if the court concludes that there is a more appropriate forum, a stay will ordinarily be granted (“Stage One”), unless the court finds at the second stage of the test that there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted (“Stage Two”) (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw </span>at [14]; <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili, </span><span class="font-italic">Bidzina and others v Credit Suisse Trust Ltd </span>[2020] 2 SLR 638 (“<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span>”) at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 At Stage One, the legal burden is on the applicant for the stay to show that there is another forum which is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” than Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>at [82]).  At this stage, the court considers the connecting factors that link the dispute with the competing jurisdictions, which include (<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>at [82]; <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania</span> <span class="font-italic">v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span>”) at [71]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the connections to relevant events and transactions; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the applicable law to the dispute; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the existence of proceedings elsewhere (<span class="font-italic">lis</span><span class="font-italic"> alibi pendens</span>); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the “shape of the litigation”, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the manner in which the claim and the defence have been pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 However, to successfully obtain a stay, it is not enough for the applicant to merely show that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">not </span>the natural forum (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [53]), <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by relying on a host of connecting factors pointing away from Singapore but which are dispersed amongst several jurisdictions and hence incapable of pointing towards any particular jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum (see <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span><span class="font-italic"> v Holdrich Investment Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4]).  This is because Singapore can only be <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> if the connecting factors pointing away from Singapore identify a distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore, and not merely if those connections outweigh those which point to Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Siemens AG </span>at [4]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 When engaging in the inquiry under Stage One, the court can and should attribute differing weight to each connecting factor depending on the particular nature of the dispute (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([58] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]), and more weight can be ascribed to those connecting factors corresponding to incidences that are likely to be material to the fair determination of the dispute (<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]; <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra </span>[2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Salgaocar</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [54]).  Since the search is for connections that have the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute, it is the quality of the connecting factors (rather than the mere quantity of factors) that is crucial in this analysis (<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]).  In this vein, the court will also weigh the connecting factors with reference to the likely issues, and connections which have little or no bearing on the adjudication of the issues in dispute between the parties will generally carry little weight (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Perwira</span><span class="font-italic"> Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd v Soon Peng Yam and others </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 768 at [21]; <span class="font-italic">Yeoh Poh San and another v Won </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Wan </span>[2002] SGHC 196 at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At Stage Two, in considering whether a stay should be refused, the main consideration is whether substantial justice can be obtained in the foreign <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>natural forum, and the plaintiff must establish with cogent evidence that it will be denied substantial justice if the case is not heard in the forum (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]).

It was argued that the contract between ABC and the beneficiary was governed by Singapore law as the place of presentation of documents and place of payment was Singapore.  The Court of Appeal rejected that argument.  First, documents were presented in Singapore only for the purpose of forwarding to ABC’s branch in Dalian, the PRC, as RBC neither had the authority to pay the beneficiary nor bind ABC by virtue of its acceptance of presented documents in Singapore, and so any presentation and acceptance of documents only took place in the PRC (at [26]).  Second, the letter of credit had also provided for payment to be made from ABC’s branch in Dalian (at [27]).  The court therefore found that it was PRC law with which the contract under the letter of credit had the closest and most real connection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 <span class="font-italic">Marconi </span>concerned a letter of credit issued by an Indonesian bank (“Hastin Bank”) that was advised to the beneficiary by an English bank (“SCB London”) (at [10]).  Another Indonesian bank (“Panin Bank”) acted as a confirming bank (at [11]).  While the credit did not expressly state so, the English Court of Appeal found that it was a credit available by negotiation, and that Hastin Bank, Panin Bank and the beneficiary had all contemplated that the credit was to be operated in favour of the beneficiary through SCB London as the negotiating bank (at [21]).  As things transpired, SCB London did not act as a negotiating bank, but merely a collecting bank in checking and forwarding the documents presented by the beneficiary to Panin Bank (at [12] and [54]).  Both Hastin Bank and Panin Bank rejected the documents as a non-compliant presentation (at [13]).  Hastin Bank subsequently became insolvent, and the beneficiary commenced proceedings against Panin Bank in the English courts.  An issue arose as to the governing law of the contract between the beneficiary and Panin Bank (as confirming bank) under the letter of credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The English Court of Appeal found that it was English law with which the contract between Panin Bank and the beneficiary had the closest connection because, since the credit was available by negotiation at SCB London, the contemplated place for presentation of documents and payment was England (at [64]-[66]).  The English Court of Appeal also endorsed the reasoning of the trial judge that it did not matter that SCB London did not actually act as a negotiating bank because it was the <span class="font-italic">availability</span> of SCB London as a negotiating bank that gave rise to the closeness of connection with England (at [54]).  In this vein, the court added that the proper approach in identifying the governing law of the contract under the letter of credit is to look at how the contract was intended by its terms to operate at the time it was made, rather than to look at what in fact occurred (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The governing law of the LCs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In this case, Field 41D of the LCs provided that they were “available with <span class="font-italic">any</span> bank by negotiation” [emphasis added].  Sinopec SG could therefore choose to present its documents and obtain payment at any bank of its choice, which would have been authorised by the terms of the LCs to give value for drafts drawn by Sinopec SG on BComm against compliant documents.  In the event, Westpac HK acted as the advising bank and communicated the terms of the LCs to Sinopec SG.  Sinopec SG also made the Presentation at Westpac HK, which then transmitted the documents on to BComm Tokyo (see [6] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Sinopec SG argues that the fact that the LCs were available with any bank by negotiation meant that Singapore law is the governing law of the LCs, because it could have gone to any bank in Singapore to negotiate the LCs.

</div>  However, BComm argues that this ignores the fact that Sinopec SG had made the Presentation at Westpac HK, and consequently, its likely expectation was that it would be paid through Westpac HK had the Presentation been deemed compliant.  As such, according to BComm, the place where Sinopec SG was to be paid, and the place where documents were to be presented, and checked before such payment was made, was Hong Kong.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In the case of a freely negotiable credit, since the beneficiary is free to present documents and obtain payment at any bank of its choice, the place of actual presentation of documents and payment is at the beneficiary’s choosing.  However, that cannot mean that the place, and the corresponding system of law, with which the contract under the letter of credit has its closest connection will depend on <span class="font-italic">where </span>the beneficiary eventually decides to negotiate its documents.  Contracts are incapable of existing in a legal vacuum and are made by reference to some system of law which defines the obligations assumed by the parties and prescribes remedies enforceable in a court of justice for failure to perform any of these obligations (<span class="font-italic">Amin Rasheed Shipping Corporation v Kuwait Insurance Co </span>[1984] 1 AC 50 at 65).  The contract between the issuing bank and a beneficiary under a letter of credit is formed and the issuing bank becomes irrevocably bound to honour the credit when the credit is communicated to the beneficiary (<span class="font-italic">Sinotani</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([67] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24]; <span class="font-italic">Jack</span> ([6] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 5.3).  The place and the corresponding system of law that is most closely connected must therefore also be determined at that time, and not subsequently when the beneficiary presents documents pursuant to the terms of the credit.  For example, in <span class="font-italic">Marconi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([67] above), it did not matter that SCB London did not eventually negotiate the credit and merely acted as a collecting bank - given the designation of SCB London under the terms of the credit as the negotiating bank, it had been in the <span class="font-italic">anticipation</span> of the parties at the time when the contract was made that the beneficiary would present documents to, and be paid by, SCB London in England, and that sufficed to render English law most closely connected to the credit (at [55] and [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my judgment, in the case of a freely negotiable credit (like the LCs) where the beneficiary may present documents and obtain payment at any bank of its choice, the system of law with which the contract between the issuing bank and the beneficiary has its closest connection is that of the place where parties had <span class="font-italic">contemplated </span>that documents would be presented and payment made, at the time when the terms of the letter of credit were communicated to the beneficiary.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In this case, Sinopec SG is a Singapore-incorporated company and conducts business operations out of Singapore.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Zhao’s 1st Affidavit at para 14. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  The commercial purpose of a letter of credit is to provide the beneficiary with the right to receive payment against compliant documents in a particular country, usually that in which it carries on business (<span class="font-italic">Marconi </span>at [62]).  Therefore, the ordinary expectation of parties at the time when the terms of the LCs were communicated to Sinopec SG was that Sinopec SG would have negotiated documents and sought to obtain payment in Singapore, the place at which it carries on business.  It would have been in the contemplation of the parties at the material time that the place of presentation of documents and payment under the LCs was Singapore.  I am therefore inclined to the view that Singapore law is the governing law of the contract between Sinopec SG and BComm under the LCs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The fact that the terms of the LCs had been communicated by Westpac HK to Sinopec SG is not inconsistent with the view that I have expressed earlier.  An advising bank which communicates the terms of a letter of credit to the beneficiary does not undertake any obligation to the beneficiary unless it adds its confirmation to the credit (see Art. 9(a) of the UCP 600).  It does not appear that Westpac HK, which acted as the advising bank, had added its confirmation to the LCs, nor does it appear that Westpac HK had been invited by BComm to do so.  In my view, the circumstances in which the LCs had been communicated therefore do not necessarily convey the impression that Hong Kong had been contemplated by parties as the place for presentation of the documents or for payment.  In any event, for the purposes of the Stay Application, I do not have to come to a firm conclusion at this stage of the proceedings as to what the governing law of the LCs are.  It suffices to state that I am not persuaded that Hong Kong had been in parties’ contemplation at the time the contract under the LCs was formed as the place where documents were to be presented, and where payment was to be made, and so Hong Kong law is unlikely to be the governing law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Given my tentative view that the governing law of the contract between BComm and Sinopec SG is Singapore law, this connecting factor does not identify an alternate jurisdiction for the purposes of Stage One.  However, even if the governing law were Hong Kong law and so identifies Hong Kong as an alternate jurisdiction, this does not change the overall result in so far as this connecting factor is concerned under Stage One.  This is because both parties are in agreement that, whether it is Hong Kong law or Singapore law that is the governing law, there is no substantive difference in the legal principles that will apply to the dispute at hand.  In any event, there is no evidence placed before me as to how Hong Kong law would differ from Singapore law in so far as the fraud defence to a claim under letters of credit is concerned.  This is unsurprising given that both Singapore and Hong Kong are leading centres of business and commerce, and they also share a similar common law legal tradition.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 This has some consequences as to the weight to be attributed to the governing law as a connecting factor, even if the governing law of the LCs were Hong Kong law.  The governing law of a transaction is regarded as a relevant connecting factor in a dispute governed by foreign law because the foreign forum will be more adept at applying its own laws than a court of another system of law, and so litigation in that foreign forum produces cost and resource savings (<span class="font-italic">CIMB</span> <span class="font-italic">Bank </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 (“<span class="font-italic">CIMB</span>”) at [63]).  In this case, given the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I can proceed on the basis that Hong Kong law is no different from Singapore law as to the relevant legal principles that would apply (see <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Chem Orchid</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 2 SLR 1020<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [159]).  That being so, I can only conclude that the Singapore courts would not face any difficulty in applying Hong Kong law to resolve the dispute between the parties.  Litigating the dispute in Hong Kong will therefore not produce any cost or resource savings and the reasons ordinarily justifying the treatment of governing law as a connecting factor do not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Furthermore, as will be explained in more detail in the course of this judgment, given the nature of the defence which BComm says it intends to rely on in refusing to honour the LCs, it does not appear to me that the present case would raise any novel issues of law about the fraud defence to a claim under letters of credit.  In situations like these, little weight is usually given to the governing law as a connecting factor, as the following extract from <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006), approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CIMB</span> at [61], explains: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the legal issues are straightforward, or if the competing fora have domestic laws which are substantially similar, the identity of the governing law will be a factor of rather little significance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Therefore, even if the governing law of the LCs were Hong Kong law and so constitute a connecting factor in favour of Hong Kong, I find that little to no weight may be accorded to that factor at Stage One.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Personal connections of the witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Connections relating to witnesses encompass two distinct factors: (a) the convenience in having the case decided in the forum where the witnesses are ordinarily resident (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the locations of the witnesses); and (b) the compellability of those witnesses (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([61] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [63]).  Where the main disputes in the action revolve around questions of fact, these factors take on greater significance because there would be savings of time and resources if the trial is held in the forum in which witnesses reside and where they are clearly compellable to testify (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([58] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 To appreciate the significance of this connecting factor, the court must consider what evidence would likely be needed in relation to the claims made in the action before the forum (<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>([59] above) at [85]).  The court will focus on the issues that are in dispute, and what evidence is needed in respect of those issues.  In this regard, the focus is not on the evidence the plaintiff requires to establish its allegations, but on the potential prejudice to the defendant in running its defence if evidence from particular witnesses is unavailable (<span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>at [86]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 A defendant who argues that the presence of witnesses in a foreign jurisdiction renders it the more appropriate forum should at least show that the evidence from those foreign witnesses is <span class="font-italic">arguably</span> relevant to its defence - it is not permitted to simply assert, without substantiation, that it requires foreign witnesses (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [67]).  However, it is also not required to demonstrate exactly how the testimony of those witnesses will be used and whether it is material to its defence because the court should not, at this interlocutory stage, predetermine the witnesses that the parties should call (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The physical locations of witnesses are generally of less significance in present times given the ease of travel and the option of giving evidence from a foreign jurisdiction by video-link.  Indeed, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which will result in witnesses increasingly having to give evidence by video-link due to travel and other restrictions, their place of residence or physical locations will generally be less important (<span class="font-italic">Bunge SA</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Shrikant Bhasi and other appeals </span>[2020] 2 SLR 1223 (“<span class="font-italic">Bunge</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 However, since a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify physically in a Singapore court or via video-link (see O 38 r 18(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”)), the compellability of a foreign witness remains relevant, and it is a factor that points towards the jurisdiction in which that witness ordinarily resides as the more appropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>([61] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]).  The compellability of a witness to testify if the dispute was heard in the foreign jurisdiction in which he resides is a matter of foreign law and can be addressed by way of expert evidence (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [72]-[73]).  Nevertheless, the absence of evidence of such foreign law should not be seen as reducing the weight associated to this connecting factor in an appropriate case because it remains the case that a foreign witness is more likely to testify if the dispute were heard in the foreign court where that witness is resident, than if it were heard in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [74]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Since the attendance of witnesses related to the parties can usually be secured even if they are not compellable to testify, the issue of compellability of witnesses should be focused on third-party witnesses over whom the parties to the dispute have no control and whom the parties may not be able to persuade to give evidence voluntarily in the absence of their compellability (<span class="font-italic">Salgaocar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([62] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73]; <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([59] above) at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 There is, in general, no disagreement between the parties as to the legal principles set out above in relation to the personal connections of the witnesses.  There is, however, one significant point of contention relating to the compellability of witnesses.  That is whether the defendant seeking a stay of proceedings must <span class="font-italic">first show that a witness is unwilling to testify in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>before the compellability of that witness can be a relevant consideration for the purposes of identifying a connecting factor for Stage One.  Sinopec SG argues that there is such a requirement.  It relies on <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([84] above), where the Court of Appeal had stated: “the issue of compellability only arises if there is some indication that the relevant witness is unwilling to testify” (at [50]).  BComm submits that there is no such requirement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 First, my review of the case law in Singapore prior to <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span> shows that compellability only becomes irrelevant when there is evidence that a witness, ordinarily residing in a foreign jurisdiction, is willing to come forward and testify in Singapore.  In the absence of such evidence, a witness will not be taken to be willing to testify outside of his jurisdiction of residence, and so the compellability of a witness ordinarily points towards the jurisdiction in which he resides as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([61] above), the Court of Appeal found that the fact that particular witnesses were compellable only in Indonesia but not Singapore pointed to Indonesia as the natural forum.  The court accepted that the compellability of the Indonesian witnesses was in issue and presented a relevant connecting factor even though it does not appear that there had been any suggestion that those witnesses were <span class="font-italic">unwilling </span>to testify in Singapore.  It appeared to be sufficient that those witnesses were located <span class="font-italic">outside </span>of Singapore and in Indonesia, even if there had been no evidence that they were unwilling to come forward to testify in Singapore - in fact, the court had found that those witnesses were <span class="font-italic">more likely</span> to testify in Indonesia, even if they were not strictly compellable under Indonesian law (at [71]-[74]).  Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([59] above), the Court of Appeal explained that, where there is a high likelihood of there being relevant witnesses who are non-compellable in Singapore, that would in principle be a factor pointing away from Singapore as the appropriate forum, <span class="font-italic">even if such witnesses have not actually been identified</span> (at [94]).  If the relevant witnesses have not been identified, then <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>it could not have been possible for the defendant seeking a stay of proceedings to show that these witnesses are unwilling to testify in Singapore.  Therefore, emphasis was placed by the court on the compellability of a witness to testify in Singapore, and not the unwillingness of a witness to testify in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Therefore, the approach taken by our courts is that it will ordinarily proceed on the basis that compellability <span class="font-italic">is in issue</span>, unless shown otherwise by evidence of the <span class="font-italic">willingness</span> of a foreign witness to testify in Singapore.  However, the approach advocated by Sinopec SG proceeds on the opposite premise – that compellability is <span class="font-italic">not in issue</span>, unless shown otherwise by evidence of the <span class="font-italic">unwillingness </span>of a foreign witness to testify in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, I think that there may be practical difficulties if a defendant seeking a stay of proceedings is required to demonstrate, at an early stage of the proceedings, that the witnesses which it intends to call<span class="font-italic"> </span>are unwilling to testify in Singapore.  A defendant is not required to establish the materiality of any of its potential witnesses at this stage; it suffices that these witnesses are at least arguably relevant to its defence (see [83] above).  As such, there is usually no certainty that any such witnesses will be called for the trial.  I think it may be too much to expect of a defendant if it is required to obtain some confirmation from each and every such potential witness, who may be dispersed across different jurisdictions, stating that they are unwilling to come forward and testify in Singapore, at a time when its defence has not even been filed and all the disputed issues may not even be clear.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Third, the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([84] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>must be seen in the context of the particular facts in that case.  In that case, the High Court had dismissed an application by the defendant for a stay of the Singapore proceedings in favour of India: see <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd and another v State Bank of India and others </span>[2019] SGHC 292 (“<span class="font-italic">Grains</span>”) at [195]-[207].  On appeal, the defendant argued that the dispute had strong connections to India (which pointed to India as being the more appropriate forum) because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, some critical witnesses who were resident in India were not compellable as far as the Singapore proceedings were concerned (at [46]).  These witnesses included one Ms Jadhav, who was an employee in the second plaintiff’s group of companies.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It was the defendant’s own case that Ms Jadhav would <span class="font-italic">more likely</span> testify if the claim were heard in India (at [50]).  In my view, it was implicit in this argument that Ms Jadhav would, at the very least, have been<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">willing </span>to testify in Singapore, although <span class="font-italic">less </span><span class="font-italic">likely</span> than if proceedings were in India.  Where a witness is willing to testify in Singapore, then the issue of compellability becomes irrelevant (see [88]-[90] above).  Hence, the Court of Appeal did not have to deal with any issue of compellability of Ms Jadhav given that it appeared that she was willing to testify for the Singapore proceedings.  That explains the Court of Appeal’s comment (as set out at [87] above) about no issue of compellability arising because there was no evidence of the witness being unwilling to testify.  Further, given that Ms Jadhav was in the employ of the second plaintiff’s group of companies and that her testimony was directly relevant to a key issue of fact (see <span class="font-italic">Grains </span>at [48]-[54] and [200]), it would be most unlikely that the second plaintiff would not procure her as a witness to the proceedings in Singapore, given that, otherwise, adverse inferences might be drawn.  Notably, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bunge</span> also added that “considerations of witness … compellability must be specific to both the prevailing external situation and a party’s own case” (at [50]).  In my view, this is a recognition that the relevance of the issue of witness compellability differs from one case to another.  As such, I do not think that the Court of Appeal intended to lay down a universal requirement that a defendant must first show that particular witnesses are unwilling to testify <span class="font-italic">before</span> their compellability can be said to be an issue for the purposes of Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 With these legal considerations out of the way, I move now to consider the issues in dispute, the arguably relevant witnesses in relation to those issues, and their personal connections.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) BComm’s defence to non-payment under the LCs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I begin by considering the nature of BComm’s defence to the claim under the LCs.  In the Suit, Sinopec SG claims in its capacity as a beneficiary of the LCs against BComm as an issuer of the letter of credit.  The autonomous nature of documentary credits means that the bank’s payment obligation under the letter of credit is treated as being independent of the underlying transaction in respect of which the credit was issued, as well as the performance of that transaction.  However, BComm’s payment obligation under the LCs is not absolute and it may avail itself of a defence to Sinopec SG’s claim on the basis of recognised exceptions to the autonomous nature of letters of credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The scope of such defences will differ depending on the system of law which governs the LCs (which, as I noted earlier, contain no provision for governing law: at [5]).  Under Singapore law (as well as English law), one established exception to the autonomy principle that justifies a bank’s refusal to honour a letter of credit is where the beneficiary, for the purpose of drawing on the credit, fraudulently presents to the bank documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that, to his knowledge, are untrue (<span class="font-italic">United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada </span>[1983] 1 AC 168 (“<span class="font-italic">U</span><span class="font-italic">nited City Merchants</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 183).  An allegation that there had been fraud in the underlying sale contracts in respect of which the letter of credit had been issued does not justify the issuing bank’s refusal to honour its payment obligations (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Brody, White and Co Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Chemet Handel Trading (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 146 at [22]); the scope of the fraud exception is limited to fraud <span class="font-italic">in the presentation of documents</span> under the credit and <span class="font-italic">not</span> that in the underlying transaction itself.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Given the narrow compass of the fraud exception, BComm recognises that it will not suffice to only contend that the Cargo had been the subject of the Alleged Prior Contracts, or that Sinopec SG was seeking to re-sell to SIH under the Sale Contracts goods that it had previously sold to the Zhong Tuo Group entities under the Alleged Prior Contracts.  That can only show fraud in the Sale Contracts and no more than that.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Instead, BComm has maintained that its defence to the claim under the LCs falls squarely within the scope of the fraud exception as set out in <span class="font-italic">United City Merchants</span> because there has been fraud in the presentation of the documents for payment under the LCs.  It argues, relying on <span class="font-italic">The Yue You 902 and another matter</span> [2020] 3 SLR 573 (“<span class="font-italic">The Yue You</span>”), that the Discharge had rendered the BLs “spent” because the Cargo had been released to persons entitled to delivery under the bills of lading.  According to counsel for BComm, that had been the case here because, pursuant to the Discharge, the Cargo had been released to the Zhong Tuo Group entities, which had been entitled to take delivery of the Cargo under the Alleged Prior Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 BComm also argues that, while the Discharge had only taken place against the LOIs (and not presentation of the BLs), that would nonetheless have rendered the BLs spent.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  In <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Yue You</span>, the court accepted that a bill of lading will only become “spent” if cargo was delivered to a person <span class="font-italic">entitled </span>to delivery under the bill (at [65] and [74]).  Without deciding the issue, the court expressed preference for the view that a bill of lading would also become spent even if delivery to a person entitled to delivery of the cargo had only taken place against a letter of indemnity without surrender of the bill of lading, because whether a bill becomes spent depends on whether delivery had been made to the right person (at [69]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 According to BComm, the fact that the BLs as presented were already spent meant that, despite their apparent conformity with the terms of the LCs, they were no longer effective documents of title.  A bill of lading functions as a document of title enabling the consignee to take delivery of the goods or dispose of them by transfer of the bill of lading (see <span class="font-italic">The Star Quest and other matters </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1280 at [17]).  It therefore carries with it the implied representation that it is an effective document of title.  In the present case, given that the BLs were already spent, this representation was untrue.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Further, that the BLs were spent was something which Sinopec SG would have known about.  This is because Sinopec SG knew that the Cargo had been the subject of the Alleged Prior Contracts between itself and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities, that the Zhong Tuo Group entities were entitled to delivery of the Cargo under those contracts, and that the Discharge to them had taken place pursuant to those contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 BComm thus argues that Sinopec SG, by presenting the spent BLs, was knowingly making a misrepresentation to BComm that the BLs were effective documents of title to the Cargo.  As such, there was fraud in the presentation of documents that fell within the scope of the fraud exception to the autonomy principle.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Supplemental Submissions dated 3 Aug 2021 (“DSS”) at para 10. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  BComm relies on the following extract from <span class="font-italic">U</span><span class="font-italic">nited City Merchants </span>([96] above) in support of this argument (at 187E): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… if [the beneficiary] presented documents with knowledge that this apparent conformity with the terms and conditions of the credit was due to the fact that the documents told a lie, the seller/beneficiary would himself be a party to the misrepresentation made to the confirming bank by the lie in the documents and the case would come within the fraud exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I have set out BComm’s arguments above so that I can proceed to then consider the witnesses it will require to make out its defence of fraud.  I have refrained from expressing any view on the merits of its arguments since the court is not required to express a view on whether there is a viable defence to the claim as part of the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> analysis (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Rainbow Joy </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 719 at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Is the testimony of the required witnesses arguably relevant to BComm’s fraud defence?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 BComm’s fraud defence turns on the legal effect of the BLs at the time of the Presentation - they must have been spent at that time so that the Presentation would have entailed Sinopec SG making a misrepresentation to BComm.  To establish that the BLs were spent, BComm must show that the Zhong Tuo Group entities had been entitled to delivery of the Cargo under the BLs at the time of the Discharge.  Although the BLs have identified the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities as the “notify party”, that <span class="font-italic">per se </span>did not mean that they were entitled to receive the Cargo (see also Richard Aikens, Richard Lord and Michael Bools, <span class="font-italic">Bills of Lading</span> (Informa, 2nd Ed, 2015) at para 3.124, which explains that the notify party is neither a party to the contract of carriage nor a person entitled to possession of the goods).  To succeed in its defence, BComm must therefore prove that the Alleged Prior Contracts exist so that the Zhong Tuo Group entities would have been contractually entitled to delivery of the Cargo.  For this, it will require evidence as to whether there had been any pre-existing contractual relationship between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities relating to the Cargo at the time of the Discharge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I now turn to each of the different witnesses, categorised by the organisation to which they belong, and consider if it is likely that the facts within their personal knowledge, and the testimony which they can give, are arguably relevant in relation to the issue of whether the Alleged Prior Contracts exist.

</div>
</div>  However, it is unclear to me how such evidence will be relevant in establishing BComm’s fraud defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 First, as a matter of principle, whether BComm may avail itself of any defences to non-payment under the LCs must be independent of the reason why SIH had entered into the Sale Contracts.  Whether SIH had agreed to act as a credit facilitator would arguably be relevant to the question of whether it had a claim against Sinopec SG for not having good title to the goods that it purportedly sold under the Sale Contracts.  However, because of the autonomous nature of letters of credit, disputes between buyer and seller arising from the underlying sales contract cannot affect the issuing bank’s separate payment obligation in the corresponding letter of credit.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Second, what appears critical to BComm’s fraud defence is whether the BLs were spent and had ceased to be effective documents of title at the time of the Presentation.  That is dependent on whether there had been any contractual relationship between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities relating to the Cargo at the time of the Discharge, and pursuant to which the Discharge might have taken place.  Since SIH is neither a party to the Alleged Prior Contracts, nor does it appear to have been involved in any dealings relating to the Cargo prior to the date of the Sale Contracts, the SIH Witnesses cannot shed light on whether the Alleged Prior Contracts exist.  They can only testify as to SIH’s own dealings with Sinopec SG, and whether they believed that Sinopec SG had good title to the Cargo sold under the Sale Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Quite apart from the relevance of their evidence to the critical issue in dispute, BComm faces another serious problem in showing the personal connections of the SIH Witnesses to any particular jurisdiction.  Despite the claimed importance of the SIH Witnesses to its defence, BComm has not put forward in its affidavits any evidence to suggest where these witnesses are located.

However, this is met with the response by opposing counsel that, regardless of where the SIH Witnesses are actually located, they are effectively compellable to testify in the PRC because PRC nationals are unlikely to defy any order by the courts of their home country to give witness testimony.

</div>  I am sceptical of the factual premise of this submission by BComm’s counsel.  I find it rather speculative.  But, even if it were correct, it did not mean that the SIH Witnesses are compellable to testify in the PRC, if they are presently resident outside of the PRC.  It only means that they are <span class="font-italic">willing </span>to do so if any legal proceedings were to take place in the PRC.  In the absence of clear evidence as to where the SIH Witnesses are exactly located, I find that the compellability of these witnesses cannot present a connecting factor in favour of any particular jurisdiction for the purposes of Stage One. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I also observe that BComm’s arguments (in respect of the alleged connecting factors presented by the SIH Witnesses) appear to suggest that it did not matter, for the purposes of the analysis at Stage One, whether the SIH Witnesses were located in Japan or PRC, so long as they were located outside of Singapore, as that would point towards either Japan and/or the PRC as the more appropriate forum than Singapore to try the dispute.  That approach raises difficulties.  Under Stage One, BComm must identify<span class="font-italic"> </span>a jurisdiction that is a distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the connections pointing toward that <span class="font-italic">particular </span>jurisdiction must overwhelm those that point towards Singapore (see [61] above).  The fact that BComm is unable to point to the particular jurisdiction in which the SIH Witnesses are located means that it is unable to identify the jurisdiction in which these witnesses are compellable to testify and which connections may overwhelm those in favour of Singapore, and so it has failed to identify any jurisdiction as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The SIC Witnesses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The evidence which BComm says each of the SIC Witnesses may provide differ, and so I will consider them separately. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 BComm submits that Chen Xin Yan can give evidence of the attempts which SIH made to locate the Cargo after it learnt of HKZT’s financial difficulties.

</div>  I am not satisfied that that makes him a relevant witness.  The fact that Xia Sen gave instructions about SIH acting as a credit facilitator goes towards the issue of what were the Sale Contracts for, and the reasons for which SIH had entered into the Sale Contracts.  However, as I have stated earlier, that issue is not relevant to BComm’s fraud defence (see [107] above).  Moreover, since China Jinshan does not appear to have been involved in the chain transaction as described by Sinopec SG, the fact that Xia Sen had given such instructions cannot <span class="font-italic">per se </span>be reflective of any possible contractual arrangements that may have been made between Sinopec SG and the recipient of the Cargo.  Indeed, Xia Sen could also have given such instructions for a multitude of reasons - for example, by virtue of the Zhong Tuo Group entities being the end receivers of the Cargo under separate arrangements entered into <span class="font-italic">after</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the Discharge.  It was for BComm to show that he likely gave such instructions because he had been privy to the contractual arrangements between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities <span class="font-italic">at the time of the Discharge</span> before his evidence may be arguably relevant on the issue of whether the Alleged Prior Contracts exist.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) The Zhong Tuo Group Witnesses </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I am not satisfied that Lv Qing Qing is able to provide relevant evidence for BComm’s fraud defence.  According to BComm, the relevance of Lv Qing Qing’s evidence lies in the fact that she had confirmed with SIH in July 2019 that the Cargo had indeed been released to the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities in May and June 2019.

This is especially the case here since, on BComm’s evidence, the Zhong Tuo Group comprises entities established in both the PRC <span class="font-italic">and </span>in Hong Kong, and any such “employees and/or officers” may well be located in either jurisdiction at any one time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Peng Xiang</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Peng Xiang had signed on the LOI issued by Shanghai Jinshan for the discharge of the shipment of the Cargo on board the <span class="font-italic">Korea Victory</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [12] above).

Therefore, according to Sinopec SG, it was that - and not some other contractual relationship between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities relating to the Cargo - which justified Sinopec SG releasing the Cargo then.  Given this, I would expect that the Sinopec Jiangsu Witnesses would therefore be able to testify as to whether that had actually been the case, since this contention is being challenged by BComm.  If no such arrangement had been in place, the evidence of these witnesses may shed light on the actual basis on which Sinopec SG had released the Cargo to the Zhong Tuo Group entities in May and June 2019.

While I accept that Art. 72 of the PRC CPL renders a witness within the PRC compellable to testify in aid of civil proceedings within the PRC, and that Art. 73(4) of the PRC CPL provides for alternative mechanisms through which such a compellable witness may testify, if he is not able to testify physically in court, there is nothing on the face of these provisions indicating that they are capable of application in the context of foreign civil proceedings outside of the PRC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Even if the Treaty on Judicial Assistance<span class="font-italic"> </span>and the Hague Convention<span class="font-italic"> </span>contemplate the application of domestic law and compulsory measures thereunder to witnesses within the PRC required for the purposes of civil proceedings in Singapore (by virtue of the Treaty and Convention Articles), in my view, that is altogether different from saying that such witnesses are compellable for the purposes of civil proceedings in Singapore <span class="font-italic">as a matter of PRC </span><span class="font-italic">law</span>.

As such, these mechanisms are facilitative rather than mandatory in nature.  Indeed, both parties’ experts also appear to be in common ground on this point (see [148] and [152] above).  Where the request is not acceded to, then the witness cannot be compelled to testify, notwithstanding the Treaty and Convention Articles and any compulsory measures existing under the PRC CPL.  Accordingly, I do not accept Sinopec SG’s submission that connecting factors in favour of the PRC arising from witnesses, compellable in or available within the PRC, should be given no weight for the purposes of Stage One.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Availability of evidence  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 BComm says that any documentary evidence obtained in the course of the PRC Criminal Investigations will be relevant evidence for the purposes of establishing its fraud defence.

It is also notable that, of the nine individuals which BComm identifies as having been detained as subjects of the PRC Criminal Investigations, none of them are officers and/or employees of Sinopec SG.

</div> but there is no suggestion that these “crimes” pertain to those which are the subject of the PRC Criminal Investigations.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In these circumstances, I find it speculative for BComm to submit that the PRC Criminal Investigations will yield evidence that is relevant to the conduct of Sinopec SG which BComm complains of, and so constitute a source of relevant evidence for BComm’s fraud defence.  In my judgment, BComm has failed to discharge its legal burden to demonstrate why the availability of evidence arising from the PRC Criminal Investigations should constitute a connecting factor in favour of the PRC for the purposes of Stage One. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In any event, I find that the availability of documentary evidence within the PRC does not constitute a connecting factor in favour of the PRC for the purposes of Stage One.  It is not clear to me why documentary evidence relating to the Alleged Prior Contracts, which may possibly be gathered in the course of the PRC Criminal Investigations, will be more comprehensive or complete than those which are in the possession of Sinopec SG (which is said to be a party to the Alleged Prior Contracts).  It was also not explained to me why such documentary evidence cannot be obtained from Sinopec SG through the usual discovery process in the Suit.  All that BComm can complain of is that any such documentary evidence that may be obtained in the course of the PRC Criminal Investigations might constitute an <span class="font-italic">alternative</span> source of the relevant documentary evidence.  It is therefore not the case that documentary evidence relating to the Alleged Prior Contracts can <span class="font-italic">only</span> be easily obtained if proceedings take place within the PRC, which must be the case if the location of such evidence is to present a connecting factor for the purposes of Stage One (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([59] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Even if any of those documents in the possession, custody or power of Sinopec SG are located in the PRC, that should not matter so long as the original documents can be sent to Singapore.  Copies of such documents can also be sent easily to Singapore though electronic means.  As the Court of Appeal has stated in <span class="font-italic">John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 at [40], the location of documentary evidence generally does not present a weighty connecting factor for the purposes of Stage One as it is easily transportable between jurisdictions in this digital age (see also <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>at [98]).  Moreover, since most communications nowadays are made via electronic means (which also appears to be the case for the present dispute), the transportability of documents evidencing such communications from the PRC or any other jurisdiction to Singapore should not pose any real problems.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 I can accept that, if the relevant documents are no longer in the possession of the parties and presently in the hands of the authorities responsible for the conduct of the PRC Criminal Investigations, then the issue of the location of the key documents might be a relevant connecting factor because such documents can only be easily obtained in proceedings in the PRC (from the relevant investigative authorities) but not Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>at [98]).  However, there has been no allegation by BComm that Sinopec SG is not in possession of the relevant documents any longer because they have been seized, or that Sinopec SG would not even have copies of such documents.  In the event, any such allegation would probably not stand up to scrutiny because, given the prevalence of electronic communications and documents, the court must proceed on the basis that copies of such communications and documents would have been stored electronically, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in the email servers of the company, and thus remain accessible. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Overlapping PRC proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Where the forum defendant commences proceedings against the forum plaintiff in a foreign jurisdiction, the fact of such parallel or overlapping foreign proceedings is accorded legal significance by reference to the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>(<span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28]-[29]) and it features as one of the factors in determining if it is appropriate for a Singapore court to hear the dispute, or if there is a more appropriate forum elsewhere (<span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Where relevant, the weight to be accorded to this connecting factor will depend on the circumstances, including the degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced, and the degree of overlap of issues and the parties (<span class="font-italic">Virsagi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]).

Put bluntly, BComm is seeking a negative declaration or a converse of the reliefs which Sinopec SG is praying for against BComm in the Suit.  As the court in <span class="font-italic">Mizuho</span><span class="font-italic"> Corporate Bank Ltd v Cho Hung Bank </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 67 observed, claims for negative declarations should be viewed with great caution in situations involving conflicts of jurisdictions as it is a sign of an improper attempt by parties at forum shopping in apprehension of proceedings that might be commenced against them (at [13]).

</div>
</div>  It is immaterial whether Sinopec SG had indeed been so advised - the characterisation of overlapping proceedings (whether they were commenced for strategic reasons) is dependent on the reasons for which they have been commenced by the plaintiff and not what the corresponding defendant (in this case, Sinopec SG) had been advised not to do.  In my judgment, therefore, the PRC Civil Proceedings should be accorded no weight in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 In <span class="font-italic">Trisuyo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([166] above), the defendants in proceedings before the Singapore courts commenced proceedings against the Singapore plaintiffs and other parties in the Indonesian courts, within one to two months after the Singapore proceedings were filed.  The Court of Appeal held that the Indonesian actions were to be accorded no weight in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis, because they had been commenced by the defendants <span class="font-italic">themselves </span>after the Singapore actions started, and sought what was essentially the converse of what the plaintiffs in the Singapore proceedings were seeking.  The Court of Appeal was of the view that this was nothing more than an attempt to “manufacture a set of concurrent proceedings” (at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Pinder</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([166] above), the appellant, who was the executor of the last will of the testator and had been granted probate by the Singapore courts, filed proceedings in Singapore seeking a determination of whether the testator died domiciled in Singapore.  The respondent opposed those proceedings and commenced proceedings in the English courts for a declaration that the testator was domiciled in England and Wales <span class="font-italic">after </span>originating process of the Singapore proceedings had been served on her (at [33]).  In the High Court, VK Rajah J (as he then was) accorded the English proceedings no weight as it was plain that it had been commenced for the sole purpose of demonstrating a competing jurisdiction elsewhere (at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 For completeness, I would add that, given my earlier conclusion that it is speculative to assert that the PRC Criminal Investigations will yield relevant evidence for BComm’s fraud defence (see [160] above), the potential availability of evidence from the PRC Criminal Investigations for use in the PRC Civil Proceedings by virtue of the PRC Investigation Order (see [24] above) does not alter my conclusion on the irrelevance of the PRC Civil Proceedings in the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Stage One</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 On a consideration of all the relevant connecting factors, I am not satisfied that BComm has shown that any of the Alternative Fora is a distinctly “more appropriate forum” than Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 BComm says that this is a “China-centric” dispute and therefore the PRC is a more appropriate forum than Singapore.  I do not agree.  In relation to the letters of credit, it must be borne in mind that the applicant for the letters of credit is a Japanese-incorporated company (SIH), the issuing bank is the Tokyo branch of an international bank (BComm), and the beneficiary is a Singapore-incorporated company (Sinopec SG).  Not only that, my examination of the relevant connecting factors concerning the actual dispute between Sinopec SG and BComm (which, by reason of the autonomy principle, is quite separate from any dispute under the Sale Contracts) shows that the connections with the PRC are actually few and far between.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 To recapitulate, of the plethora of witnesses which BComm says it intends to call in support of its fraud defence, the only witnesses whose evidence is arguably relevant to the real issues in contention, and who BComm has shown to be located within the PRC, and therefore present a relevant connecting factor to the PRC, are the Sinopec Jiangsu Witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 As I have already indicated, the Sinopec Jiangsu Witnesses will be able to provide relevant evidence as to the basis on which Sinopec SG was instructed to discharge the Cargo to the Zhong Tuo Group entities, and such evidence may shed light on whether it existed at that time a direct contractual relationship between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities relating to the Cargo.  However, such evidence can also be obtained from Sinopec SG in the Suit through the process of discovery, interrogatories, and eventually cross-examination.  As such, I would not regard this connecting factor to the PRC as carrying that much weight. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 For completeness, there are no relevant connections at Stage One which point to Japan.  BComm has put forth the <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> that the SIH Witnesses are located in Japan, but as I have said, that is not sufficient to identify the jurisdiction in which those witnesses are located and compellable to testify for the purpose of establishing personal connections at Stage One.  In any event, as already explained, I also do not find that the evidence of the SIH Witnesses is arguably relevant for the purposes of BComm’s fraud defence, and so their personal connections (if any) will not be relevant for the purposes of Stage One.  It follows that BComm has not shown that Japan is a distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As for Hong Kong, the only relevant connection at Stage One which points to that jurisdiction is the fact that the LCs might <span class="font-italic">arguably</span> be governed by Hong Kong law, although the more likely position, as I have already explained at [75] above, is that the LCs are governed by Singapore law.  However, since no evidence has been placed before me to show that Hong Kong law on the fraud exception to the autonomy principle is any different from Singapore law, this governing law factor is given little or no weight at Stage One.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Further, while BComm has submitted that Chen Zeng Chun, an officer of the Zhong Tuo Group, can provide evidence on the Alleged Prior Contracts between Sinopec SG and the respective Zhong Tuo Group entities, BComm has not shown that he is presently resident in Hong Kong.  I therefore find that BComm has not shown that Hong Kong is a distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 BComm’s case, taken at its highest, may suggest that there are only a few connections between the dispute and Singapore.  However, the fact that the connections between the dispute and Singapore are weak does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>establish that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>.  It bears reiteration that BComm must show that a distinctly more appropriate forum exists elsewhere, and it cannot discharge its burden under Stage One by merely showing that Singapore is not the natural forum (see [61] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 After a consideration of all the relevant connecting factors, I find that BComm has not discharged its legal burden under Stage One and no stay of proceedings can be granted.  Given my conclusion on Stage One, it is not necessary for me to proceed further and consider Stage Two of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I thus express no opinion on Stage Two, even though I acknowledge that counsel for Sinopec SG did make a rather interesting argument that Sinopec SG would suffer a juridical disadvantage, and consequently be denied substantial justice, if it were forced to litigate the dispute with BComm in the PRC.  This is because it is common ground that the Shanghai Court would apply PRC law to determine if Sinopec SG would be entitled to claim payment under the LCs, and it appears that PRC law provides a more generous fraud defence against claims under letters of credit as compared to the common law.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Notes of Arguments, 5 Aug, p 5 lines 15-27; Wu Yunfeng’s Expert Opinion dated 27 May 2021 in 2nd Affidavit of Wu Yunfeng (“Wu’s 2nd Report”) at para 29.4.1.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>  In other words, it would be easier, as a matter of law, for BComm to resist Sinopec SG’s claim for payment, in proceedings in the courts of the PRC.  However, as this point on PRC law was not dealt with comprehensively by both parties’ PRC law experts, and since I have already found against BComm on Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, I will refrain from expressing any view on the merits of this argument. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Should SUM 1899 be allowed? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 O 20 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court confers upon the court a general power to allow amendments to be made to any document in the proceedings on the application of any party to the proceedings.  It states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings and either of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 It is trite that the guiding principle is that such amendments should be allowed if they would enable “the real question and/or issue in controversy between the parties” to be determined (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<span class="font-italic">Review Publishing</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [113]) and serve the ends of justice (<span class="font-italic">Wright Norman</span><span class="font-italic"> v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 640<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23]).  An amendment can also be allowed “at any stage of the proceedings” (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing </span>at [112]).  All the relevant circumstances of the case should be considered in deciding whether or not to allow an amendment, and delay in bringing the application for leave to amend <span class="font-italic">per se </span>does not constitute prejudice to the other party (see <span class="font-italic">Review Publishing </span>at [114]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In my judgment, SUM 1899 should be allowed and I grant BComm leave to amend its prayers for the CMS Application to take into account the PRC Civil Proceedings.  My earlier finding that those proceedings were likely commenced by BComm for strategic reasons only meant that the PRC Civil Proceedings were to be accorded no weight under Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>analysis.  It did not mean that it is of no relevance in the court’s determination of whether there should be a limited stay of the Suit pending the conclusion of <span class="font-italic">all </span>the developments in the PRC which BComm says are relevant to the dispute between the parties.  Since these developments have now widened to include the PRC Civil Proceedings, allowing the amendment to take into account those proceedings for the purposes of the CMS Application will enable the real question in controversy between the parties to be determined, and serve the ends of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I accept counsel for Sinopec SG’s point that there had been significant delay in the bringing of SUM 1899.  It was filed only on 23 April 2021, more than four months after the PRC Civil Proceedings were commenced on 1 December 2020.  However, that delay did not result in any irremediable prejudice to Sinopec SG, since the adjournment of the hearing date for SUM 4431 (after SUM 1899 was brought) meant that Sinopec SG was given time to consider BComm’s position on the PRC Civil Proceedings in advance of the hearing of SUM 4431.  As such, save for wasted costs, Sinopec SG was ultimately not placed in any worse position than it would have been had the prayers for the CMS Application been amended at an earlier time (see also, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure Vol I</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Cavinder Bull SC gen ed)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 20/8/13).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether a case management stay of the Suit in terms of the amended prayer should be granted? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The court may grant a limited stay of the Singapore proceedings pending the conclusion of proceedings elsewhere either by an exercise of its powers under s 18(2) of the SCJA read with para 9 of the First Schedule of the same statute, or pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob </span><span class="font-italic">Agam and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Agam</span>”) at [32]).  The grant of a limited stay of proceedings is a discretionary exercise of the court’s case management powers and does not require the application of the principles of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>(<span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span><span class="font-italic"> v Chan Fatt Cheung and others </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1192<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [47]).  This discretion is available when there is a multiplicity of proceedings, and the court is entitled to consider all the circumstances of the case in exercising its discretion, with a view towards ensuring the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Agam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35]).  A non-exhaustive list of factors which the court may consider has been identified in case law as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Agam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) which proceeding was commenced first;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the termination of one proceeding is likely to have a material effect on the other;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the public interest; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the undesirability of two courts competing to see which of them determines common facts first;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) consideration of circumstances relating to witnesses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) whether work done on pleadings, particulars, discovery, interrogatories and preparation might be wasted;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) the undesirability of substantial waste of time and effort if it becomes a common practice to bring actions in two courts involving substantially the same issues;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) how far advanced the proceedings are in each court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the law should strive against permitting multiplicity of proceedings in relation to similar issues; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) generally balancing the advantages and disadvantages to each party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 BComm argues that a limited stay should be granted until after the conclusion of the PRC Criminal Proceedings so that a Singapore court hearing the Suit can have the benefit of findings arising from those proceedings, and so avoid having to traverse those same grounds and the consequent waste of work.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 I am unable to agree.  As I have explained earlier, the relevance of the PRC Criminal Investigations to BComm’s fraud defence has not been established.  As such, I am not satisfied that any findings arising from the PRC Criminal Proceedings (as a culmination of the PRC Criminal Investigations) will be of assistance to a Singapore court in the Suit.  More importantly, in determining if BComm’s fraud defence is made out as a matter of Singapore law, the issue which a Singapore court must determine is whether Sinopec SG had acted fraudulently in seeking to obtain payment under the LCs.  Yet, none of Sinopec SG’s officers and/or employees are subjects of the PRC Criminal Investigations; neither has BComm suggested that those investigations or proceedings would cover the conduct of Sinopec SG (see [158]-[159] above).  In the absence of a clear and direct association between the PRC Criminal Investigations and Sinopec SG, it is not apparent to me why findings from the PRC Criminal Proceedings will pertain to the conduct of Sinopec SG and whether it had acted fraudulently in seeking to obtain payment under the LCs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In any event, even if the PRC Criminal Investigations were relevant, any findings from the PRC Criminal Proceedings cannot constitute relevant evidence for the purposes of the Suit.  Any such finding would merely be an expression of an opinion by the investigators and/or the relevant finders of fact in the PRC Criminal Proceedings, and these would not constitute primary evidence of the issues in dispute in the Suit.  Instead, what is relevant will be the underlying evidence relied upon by the investigators and/or finders of fact in arriving at their respective conclusions.  I do not see why such evidence will not be available to a Singapore court through the usual course of discovery, interrogatories and cross-examination of witnesses here.  With such direct evidence of the parties in the form of witness testimony, evidence of their communications and other documentary evidence, a Singapore court will be equally well placed to come to its own findings on the issues in dispute.  Therefore, BComm has not satisfied the court that it should exercise its case management powers to grant a limited stay pending the conclusion of the PRC Criminal Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As for the PRC Civil Proceedings, I find that the CMS Application for a limited stay on the ground of those proceedings is motivated by the extraneous purpose of stifling the Suit.  As I have already noted, the relief sought in the PRC Civil Proceedings is in the nature of a negative declaration of the very reliefs which Sinopec SG seeks in the Suit.  There is a complete overlap between both sets of proceedings (see [168] above).  This means that, if the Suit is stayed pending the determination of the PRC Civil Proceedings, it would effectively be rendered otiose once the PRC Civil Proceedings are concluded.  Both parties would likely be barred by the principles of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and/or issue estoppel from proceeding with the Suit in Singapore.  In other words, the probable consequence of granting the limited stay sought by BComm is that it will in substance be a permanent one (see <span class="font-italic">Agam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 It is of some significance that, if a limited stay pending the conclusion of the PRC Civil Proceedings were granted, it would result in BComm obtaining the very outcome that it had sought, but failed to obtain, in the Stay Application.  Sinopec SG’s right to proceed in the Singapore courts would be practically extinguished even though BComm has not shown that there is a distinctly more appropriate forum than Singapore.  A case management stay is a mechanism meant to <span class="font-italic">preserve</span> the plaintiff’s right to prosecute its claim in Singapore, while minimising the risk of conflicting decisions by allowing the Singapore court to have the benefit of the findings of the foreign court (<span class="font-italic">Agam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]).  The realities associated with the present case are such that the grant of a case management stay would not be appropriate.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 I therefore find no reason for the court to exercise its case management powers to grant a limited stay pending the conclusion of the PRC Civil Proceedings.  I am not persuaded that doing so would be conducive for the fair and efficient resolution of the dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In light of the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the Declaration Application and the Stay Application. While I granted the Amendment Application so that the CMS Application took into account both the PRC Criminal Proceedings and<span class="font-italic"> </span>the PRC Civil Proceedings, I dismissed the CMS Application on its merits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 I will deal separately with the issue of costs.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Toh Kian Sing SC, Lin Yong'en Nathanael, Wu Junneng and Marcus Chiang Mun Leong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Khoo Boo Teck Randolph, Liu Chenghan Aloysius and Chan Jian Da (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
