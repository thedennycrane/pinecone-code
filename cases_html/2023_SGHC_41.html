After the Victim had sounded the horn at him for doing so, the Appellant had wound down his car window and gestured at the Victim to follow him. After stopping, the Appellant opened his car boot, before choking the Victim with one hand. The Appellant pushed the Victim against the Victim’s car with his other hand, causing the Victim to fall to the ground.

</div> The Appellant was able to describe that he had accidentally swerved into the adjacent lane while driving on 1 February 2020 at about 5.20am and was scolded with vulgarities by a driver of a white car. That driver continued to chase his motor vehicle despite his apologies, until the Appellant decided to stop his motor vehicle outside the roundabout near Hillview Community Centre. The Appellant claimed that the other driver walked towards him in an aggressive manner, asking for a fight and holding something shiny on his hands. The Appellant specifically mentioned that he remembered punching the other driver twice “towards the face”. Both parties fell on the floor and scuffled. The Appellant said he suffered injuries to his left forearm, neck, and right foot. The other driver then took out a piece of paper showing that he had a pending police case.  The driver apparently told him not to report the incident. The Appellant then returned to his car and drove off, despite the Victim kicking and punching his car as he left.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Following investigations, the Appellant was served with one charge for causing hurt to the Victim.

The DJ found the Appellant guilty and convicted him of the charge.

(b) If so, was he the assailant or the victim?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The DJ answered the first question in the affirmative. There was no doubt that the Victim was one of the drivers in the CCTV footage. He had asked PW2 to call the police, and his identity had also been established by the police subsequently. The other driver had to be the Appellant, for several reasons. First, PW2 had identified the Appellant in court as the driver who had driven off.

</div> The inability of the Defence to cross-examine the deceased Victim thus did not in and of itself render the admission of the Victim’s statement prejudicial. The DJ also rejected the Defence’s submission that the Victim’s statement was unreliable because his pending criminal cases gave him an incentive to lie and cover up his evidence of assault.

</div>
</div> In my judgment, there is no reason to disturb the DJ’s finding that the Appellant was a conniving and deceitful witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having established the Appellant’s identity from the CCTV footage, it follows that the Appellant’s alternative explanation for the Victim’s injuries (<span class="font-italic">i.e</span> that he fell) should be rightly disbelieved. As a corollary, it is similarly unnecessary to consider the relative reliability of the Victim’s statement given the weight of the other objective evidence against the Appellant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant was not acting in self-defence or private defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I also do not accept the Appellant’s argument that he acted in self-defence or was exercising the right of private defence. As a side note, such an argument does not even technically fall within the scope of the Appellant’s own submissions. As mentioned earlier at [25], the Appellant’s stated basis for setting aside his conviction is that it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had <span class="font-italic">caused hurt</span> to the Victim. A defence of self-defence, or private defence, is commonly taxonomized in criminal legal theory as a defence of justification. This is because it involves an attempt to justify the act of what would otherwise be an offence. Raising the defence of self-defence is thus a distinct question that is antecedent to, and contingent on, a finding that the Appellant had in fact caused hurt to the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Notwithstanding this legal inaccuracy, I briefly explain why I reject this argument. There is no evidence that the Appellant was threatened by the Victim holding a “shiny object”. The CCTV footage does not show either driver using an implement throughout the altercation. Neither did the Appellant offer any evidence of the “shiny object” that the Victim purportedly was holding. In fact, it was the Appellant who was seen in the footage about to arm himself with an item from the boot of his car to confront the Victim, before changing his mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Neither is there any evidence that the Victim had attacked the Appellant first. This was at odds with the CCTV footage, and with the Appellant’s lack of medical treatment. The Appellant was not even able to give a coherent description of his own injuries in oral testimony without contradicting his own statement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Counsel for the Appellant sensibly retracted this point in oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Lim Yee Hua</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21], Chan Seng Onn J defined road rage as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared use of our roads. The litmus test for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply for a particular offence of violence is thus whether the violence originates from differences arising through common road use. In other words, the harsh deterrent sanctions for road rage incidents only apply when road users engage in violence specifically over disputes that arise from the shared use of our roads. It follows that where incidents of violence happen to break out on the roads, but the cause of the violence has no nexus to the parties’ shared use of the roads, the road rage deterrent sentencing policy should not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is clear that this was a case of road rage violence. The Appellant does not dispute that the context of the altercation between him and the Victim arose from his swerving of his car across lanes on the BKE. There was thus reason to conclude that the facts disclosed violence perpetrated by road users as a result of perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of shared use of the roads. Even if the Victim had, as the Appellant claimed, walked towards him shouting vulgarities, this would not have justified the use of violence, nor changed the fact that the nexus of the violence was shared road use. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Having found that this was a road rage case, the Appellant’s sentence should be calibrated not only in accordance with the usual considerations of harm and culpability under the framework in <span class="font-italic">Low Song</span><span class="font-italic"> Chye</span>, but also with due regard given to the deterrent sentencing policy underlying the sentencing of road rage offenders: <span class="font-italic">Lim Yee Hua </span>at [26].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The harm caused by the Appellant was low, but not insignificant. The contusions on the Victim’s face show that a vulnerable part of his body had been targeted. This places the present case within Band 1. Three caveats are necessary to the indicative sentencing range of up to four weeks stated in <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Song Chye </span>at [77]. First, I agree with the DJ and the Prosecution that the upper end of the indicative imprisonment range should be extrapolated up by a factor of 1.5 from four to six weeks. This was to reflect the increase in the maximum prescribed sentence for a s 323 Penal Code offence from two to three years’ imprisonment since that decision. Second, this indicative sentencing range applies to first-time offenders who pleaded guilty. Neither of these considerations applies to the Appellant. Third, if adjustments are necessary after assessment of the Appellant’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors, this may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range: <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye </span>at [78(b)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The culpability of the Appellant was by no means low, given the persistence of the assault. The Appellant hit and kicked the Victim even after he fell to the ground and continued his assault despite the Victim’s attempts to disengage. The whole sequence of the assault lasted more than 40 seconds, which I agree with the DJ is fairly lengthy by any reasonable standard. Throughout this time, there is no evidence that the Victim made any attempt to retaliate during the one-sided assault. This was less a fight between two drivers, and more a vicious assault on a hapless victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I do not accept the Appellant’s submission that mitigating weight should be given because the Victim had contributed to the commission of the offence. The manner in which the dispute started was attributable to both parties. It is at best a neutral factor. Not only was the Appellant’s bad driving a catalyst for the dispute, but the CCTV footage showed that the Victim had in fact stopped in front of the Appellant’s car boot when approaching him. It was the Appellant who then chose to advance towards the Victim before the altercation turned physical. I thus do not see a reason to attribute any less aggressive behaviour to the Appellant when compared to the Victim. The Victim’s actions of hitting and kicking the Appellant’s car are irrelevant to this determination, as they occurred <span class="font-italic">after </span>the assault in an attempt to stop the Appellant from fleeing the scene.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s fleeing from the scene </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, the DJ in fact erred in not sufficiently taking into account the post-offence conduct of the Appellant in fleeing the scene in his motor vehicle despite the Victim’s protests and PW2’s attempt to block his exit. I consider the present case much more aggravated than ordinary circumstances where offenders flee from the scene of a crime on foot. There are several reasons for this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, the use of a motor vehicle allows offenders to flee the scene of the crime much more quickly, increasing the likelihood of evading responding police officers. This diminishes the ability of the police to obtain contemporaneous evidence and statements. The effect such behaviour has in obstructing justice is apparent from the Appellant’s own arguments on appeal. The Appellant contends that the Victim had not identified the Appellant as the one who assaulted him. This is precisely the problem. The most appropriate time for the Victim to have identified the Appellant would have been at the scene when the police arrived. He had no opportunity to do so because the Appellant had already fled the scene by that time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, it is difficult (if not dangerous) for others to prevent a motor vehicle from leaving the scene of a crime. Indeed, the Victim and PW2 driver tried various means to stop the Appellant from fleeing but to no avail. PW2 also testified that he was afraid of trying to stop the Appellant because he was worried about the damage that the Appellant’s motor vehicle would cause to his taxi.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Such forms of escape are also particularly difficult for the police to stop, even if they were at the scene, without causing significant public disruption. This feeling of imperviousness is likely to embolden offenders to think they can flee the scene of an offence without consequences. There is thus public interest in deterring such attempted evasion of law enforcement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Third, an offender who drives away from the scene of the offence is more likely to drive recklessly in an attempt to get away. This increases the risk of further accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Fourth, the tracking of offenders who flee on a motor vehicle is likely to require the use of significant police resources. In this case, it was fortunate that the Victim had the presence of mind to note the Appellant’s motor vehicle licence plate number and inform PW2 of it. Had he not done so, a substantial amount of time would have to be spent on police investigations to ascertain the identity of the assailant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The importance of these considerations is echoed in s 84(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (“RTA”), which requires the driver of a motor vehicle to stop the vehicle after an accident resulting in damage or injury to any person, vehicle, or structure. While this legislation involves a separate category of offences (hit-and-run accidents) for which different considerations will apply, the underlying rationale of deterring drivers from fleeing the scene is apposite. In this vein, the Minister for Home Affairs observed during the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1996 (Act 11 of 1996) that hit-and-run accidents were an urgent problem because, among other concerns, fleeing from the scene of the accident is an irresponsible act, and it is difficult to trace such culprits in such cases (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (27 February 1996) vol 65 at cols 718–719). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 These concerns were raised in the context of escaping responsibility for accidents committed out of negligence or recklessness. I do not think they should apply with any less force to deliberate acts of violence by road users arising from shared use of the roads, who then escape in their motor vehicles leaving their victims behind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, I should emphasise that the act of driving away from the scene of the offence will not necessarily be an aggravating factor in every road-rage case. This is a case-specific determination. That having been said, I highlight three factors that are relevant in making this assessment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The first is the severity of the victim’s injuries and the likely availability of medical attention. The greater the victim’s injuries, the more likely it is that fleeing the scene should be viewed as aggravating, especially if the offence is committed in a secluded location with little chance that the victim would receive prompt medical attention. Such considerations are reflected in sentences for offences under s 84(8) and 84(9) of the RTA, with enhanced penalties for drivers involved in accidents where death or serious injury is caused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The second factor is the extent to which the offender’s decision to flee was a deliberate attempt to evade enforcement, rather than merely motivated by fear or confusion: see for example <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 240 at [39] in the context of s 84(3) of the RTA. An example of a circumstance from which the former may be inferred is where the offender insists on driving away despite protestations or physical restraint by bystanders. Conversely, the latter may be inferred if an offender drives off to a police station, rental car company, or taxi company to make a report of the incident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The third factor is the extent to which an enhanced sentence would be necessary to deter an offender from committing such an offence in future. This would more likely be the case where an offender has a history of irresponsible road usage or non-compliance with law enforcement, and less likely for first-time offenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the present case, the second and third factors are engaged which point towards an uplift in the Appellant’s sentence to take into account his fleeing from the scene. There is evidence to show that the Appellant intentionally fled the scene to avoid identification. Throughout the one-sided assault, the Appellant’s behaviour was aggressive, until he took the opportunity to return to his car and drive off. There is no evidence that the Appellant acted in a state of fear or confusion. Moreover, the Appellant deliberately drove past PW2’s taxi, which was positioned in an attempt to block him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As for the third factor, I find that specific deterrence is a key consideration given the Appellant’s past record. The Appellant has a long history of non-compliance with traffic regulations. In 2012, the Appellant had, without reasonable excuse, failed to provide his breath specimen under s 69(4) of the RTA, after he was detected smelling strongly of alcohol while driving. He acted aggressively and had to be subdued during arrest. Shortly after, he failed to provide his blood specimen under s 69(5) of the RTA by refusing to sign on the warning form. In addition, the accused has numerous compounded offences for speeding in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2020, which are relevant factors in sentencing: <span class="font-italic">Teo Seng Tiong v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2021] 2 SLR 642 at [103]. The Appellant also faces a further three charges under s 64(1), s 84(1), and s 84(2) of the RTA, to which he intends to claim trial (although I do not give any weight to the presence of these charges).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It can be seen from these offences that they have one factor in common: being emboldened while behind the wheel of a motorised container of metal weighing more than a thousand kilograms. Specific deterrence is thus a foremost consideration in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Indeed, specific deterrence is all the more necessary in light of the lack of remorse shown by the Appellant. Far from acknowledging his guilt after being caught by the CCTV footage, the Appellant has instead tried to paint the Victim as a liar. The Appellant fabricated a version of events where the Victim assaulted him instead. His portrayal of the Victim went against all the objective evidence and the independent testimony of eyewitnesses. In this regard, I note that the DJ was generous to the Appellant in that he decided that the “utterly shameless and deceitful manner in which the accused (the Appellant) had conducted his defence” should not be a distinct aggravating factor. Nevertheless, the DJ was of the view that the Appellant “was and continues to be devoid of remorse”.

</div>
</div>
</div> I agree. Such conduct does fortify my belief that he has shown no remorse, thereby necessitating a deterrent sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For these reasons, I am of the view that the Appellant’s act of fleeing the scene is an aggravating factor which warrants an uplift in the sentence imposed by the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comparison with precedents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The factors I have mentioned also distinguish the present case from the cases of <span class="font-italic">Shi Ka Yee</span> and <span class="font-italic">Oon</span><span class="font-italic"> Joo Seng</span>, for which a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed in those cases. In <span class="font-italic">Shi Ka Yee</span>, while the harm caused was more severe, the nature of the Appellant’s attacks was far more persistent. The same was true of <span class="font-italic">Oon</span><span class="font-italic"> Joo Seng</span>. Moreover, the accused in <span class="font-italic">Shi Ka Yee</span> was untraced, while the accused in <span class="font-italic">Oon</span><span class="font-italic"> Joo Seng </span>had unrelated and dated antecedents. In addition to his string of offences under the RTA, the Appellant was traced for a related offence of affray, albeit in 2004. In view of the Appellant’s conviction and composition history, deterrence is a far more prominent sentencing consideration in the present case and an uplift from the four months is merited. I also consider that having regard to all the circumstances, the present case merits a higher sentence than those in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Zhenyang </span>[2018] SGHC 209 (5 weeks’ imprisonment) and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Fatahurhman bin Bakar </span>[2019] SGHC 232 (4 weeks’ imprisonment), seeing as both accused persons were untraced, and there was no indication that they had intentionally fled the scene.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I agree with the DJ that there are no relevant mitigating factors. Neither does the Appellant raise any in his submissions on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In the circumstances, I find that the DJ did not give sufficient weight to the Appellant’s fleeing from the scene, and to the Appellant’s relevant antecedents. An uplift from the sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment is thus necessary to take this into account. Having regard to all the circumstances of this case, a sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment is appropriate, and I so order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Disqualification order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In addition to a term of imprisonment, I also consider whether an order of disqualification should be imposed. The power to do so stems from s 42 of the RTA, which provides that upon conviction for an offence under the RTA or any other written law, the court may impose a disqualification order if (i) at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender was the driver of a motor vehicle on a road, (ii) the person against whom the offence was committed was the driver of another vehicle on the road, (iii) the court is satisfied that the commission of the offence arose from a dispute between the offender and that other person over the use of the road, and (iv) having regard to the circumstances under which the offence was committed and the behaviour of the offender, the court is of the opinion that it is undesirable for the offender to continue to be allowed to drive a motor vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The first three requirements are not in issue. Having regard to the Appellant’s behaviour post-offence and his chequered history of non-compliance with traffic regulations, it is undesirable for the Appellant to continue to be allowed to drive a motor vehicle indefinitely. As explained above, both general and specific deterrence are predominant sentencing considerations. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I am of the view that a disqualification order of nine months is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I am cognisant that the Appellant is awaiting trial on other driving-related offences. While these may result in further disqualification orders if he is convicted, I do not see that as a basis not to impose a disqualification order based on the facts and circumstances of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, I take the opportunity to reiterate the position of this court in <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Ngak Eng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] SGHC 254 at [131] that accused persons who contemplate filing appeals against their sentences should bear in mind that the court will consider enhancing sentence(s) in cases of plainly unmeritorious appeals, even in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  I thus dismiss the appeal against conviction and sentence. I set aside the sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment and impose a sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment. I further order that the Appellant be disqualified from holding a driving licence for a period of nine months to take effect from the date of his release from prison.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Sarbrinder Singh S/O Naranjan Singh and Tay Yu E (Sanders Law LLC) </span><div style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"><br/></div><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">for the </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">appellant;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Tin Shu Min <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers)</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> for the respondent.</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
