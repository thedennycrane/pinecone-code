<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”) in <em>Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd
                        Yusop</em> [2014] SGHC 125 (“the Judgment”). The accused
                    (“the Respondent”) had claimed trial to the following charge of
                    trafficking in methamphetamine (which we will hereinafter refer to by its street
                    name “Ice”) under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, MOHAMMAD FARID BIN MOHD YUSOP,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on 10 March 2011, at about 5.30 a.m., in the vicinity of the
                        traffic junction of Lavender Street and Bendemeer Road, Singapore, inside
                        vehicle SGH3547U, did traffic in a controlled drug specified as a
                        “Class A drug” in the First Schedule to the Misuse of
                        Drugs Act (Cap 185,2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), to wit, by
                        having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, two packets of
                        crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain <em>not less than 386.7 grams of methamphetamine</em>,
                        without any authorisation under the Act or the regulations made thereunder,
                        and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(l)(a) read with
                        s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Act, and further upon your
                        conviction under s 5(1) of the Act, you may alternatively be liable to
                        be punished under s 33B of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties, the Judge accepted the defence of the Respondent
                    and amended the capital charge to one of possessing 249.99g of Ice for the
                    purpose of trafficking. He convicted the Respondent on the amended charge and
                    sentenced him to 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Prosecution appealed against the decision of the Judge and the appeal came
                    before us on 16 October 2014. After hearing the parties, we dismissed the
                    appeal. Before setting out the detailed grounds of our decision, we would like
                    to briefly highlight three general observations at the outset which merit some
                    attention in this appeal, and which we will elaborate upon towards the end of
                    this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first observation pertains to the issue as to whether the court should
                    draw an adverse inference in situations where a party had elected not to call a
                    witness who might have been instrumental in his case, despite the witness being
                    available. In this appeal, this arose as the Respondent had chosen not to call
                    the person who supplied him the drugs, and the Prosecution argued that by
                    choosing not to do so, this cast a “real doubt” on the
                    Respondent’s evidence with regard to one crucial aspect of the
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second observation relates to the need for the courts to be particularly
                    discerning towards <em>manufactured</em> defences and to
                    guard against them. This appeal concerned certain presumptions that arose and
                    which the Respondent had the legal burden of rebutting on a balance of
                    probabilities. In such situations, there is a general concern that, through
                    carefully rehearsed statements, an accused person might attempt to manufacture a
                    defence specifically tailored to rebut such legal presumptions. In this regard,
                    we had certain reservations as to the veracity of the Respondent’s defence
                    mounted in the court below, which the Judge accepted and thereby found that
                    these presumptions had been rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       However, despite these reservations, we nevertheless dismissed the appeal.
                    This leads us to our third observation, which, although trite, bears repeating
                    – that it must be shown that a trial judge’s determination was
                        <em>plainly wrong</em> or <em>plainly
                        against the weight of the evidence</em> before appellate intervention
                    is warranted. This appeal neatly illustrated this principle – while there
                    were certain gaps in the Respondent’s defence, especially given the fact
                    that there was no objective or corroborating evidence from another party in
                    support of the Respondent’s defence, we were not satisfied that the Judge
                    was <em>plainly wrong</em> in his findings and therefore
                    dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As already mentioned, we will return to elaborate on these three observations
                    later, but first set out our detailed grounds for dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Following the successful conclusion of an operation led by Senior Station
                    Inspector Heng Chin Kok (“SSI Heng”), the Respondent, a
                    30-year-old male Singaporean, was arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau
                    (“CNB”) officers at about 5.30am in the vicinity of the traffic
                    junction of Lavender Street and Bendemeer Road inside vehicle SGH3547U
                    (“the Car”). After the Respondent was arrested, the Car was
                    searched by Senior Station Inspector Ng Tze Chiang Tony (“SSI Tony
                    Ng”), and the following items were found on the front passenger’s
                    seat:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     one plastic bag which was tied up and contained a packet of crystalline
                        substance (“A1”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     one black and grey chequered plastic bag which was untied and contained a
                        packet of crystalline substance (“A2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The crystalline substance in A1 and A2 contained Ice, and the net weight of
                    Ice in A1 and A2 was found to be 386.7g altogether. SSI Heng then recorded
                    a contemporaneous statement from the Respondent who was sitting in the rear
                    passenger’s seat of the Car at about 6.00am.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The cautioned statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the same day at about 6.30pm, a cautioned statement was taken from the
                    Respondent (“the Cautioned Statement”), which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If I had knew that the amount of ICE that I was going to collect this
                        morning was 500 grams, I would not have collected the ICE. Before
                        today, I used to collect ICE below the weight of 250 grams. I really do
                        not know why the ICE amount today was 500 grams which is more than
                        usual. The reason for me not dealing with ICE more than 250 grams is
                        that I knew it would be death sentence if I am caught.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The four long statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Four long statements were subsequently recorded from the Respondent. In these
                    statements, the Respondent related when he had started to get involved in
                    trafficking Ice, and his version of what had happened on the day of his
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the Respondent, he started dealing in Ice since the start of
                    2010. He would receive his supplies from a Malay man known as
                    “Bapak”, and then weigh and re-pack the Ice into mini-packets to
                    sell for a profit. In early 2011, Bapak asked the Respondent to deliver Ice to
                    various other customers for him, and offered the Respondent $500 for each
                    delivery job. The Respondent took up the offer and made his first delivery for
                    Bapak sometime in January 2011. On that occasion, he drove his car under the
                    overhead pedestrian bridge at Kranji MRT station, where a Malaysian Indian man
                    later arrived and placed a packet of Ice into the Respondent’s car through
                    his front passenger’s window. They did not speak. The Respondent then
                    drove off to deliver the packet of Ice to Bapak’s friend. The $500, which
                    he was promised for making the delivery, was then duly deducted from what the
                    Respondent owed Bapak for the Respondent’s personal supply of Ice which he
                    had bought from Bapak.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent later made two more deliveries of Ice for Bapak – one
                    around the end of January 2011 and the other sometime in February 2011. On both
                    occasions, the Respondent followed essentially the same <em>modus
                        operandi</em> that was used on the first delivery as described above.
                    The Respondent stated that he handled 125g of Ice on his first and second
                    deliveries, and 250g of Ice on his third delivery. It appears that the
                    Respondent was referring to the <em>gross</em> weight of
                    the Ice (<em>ie</em>, the total weight including
                    impurities) rather than the <em>net</em> weight (<em>ie</em>, the weight of the pure drug as determined after
                    scientific analysis). The Respondent himself had said that 250g was the weight
                    “before you analyse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Respondent was instructed to make what would be his fourth delivery job
                    for Bapak on 10 March 2011. He was told, early that morning at about
                    4.00am, to proceed to Kranji MRT station to collect the Ice. The Respondent
                    complied, and, as on previous occasions, stopped his car under the overhead
                    pedestrian bridge. A Malaysian Indian man approached his car and placed two
                    plastic bags on his front passenger’s seat, after which the Respondent
                    drove off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Respondent stated that, while he did not open the plastic bags to check
                    the contents, he knew that they contained Ice. He did not know the exact weight
                    of the Ice but assumed that it was less than 250g. As the Respondent was
                    driving, he received a call from Bapak who instructed him to bring the Ice to
                    Woodlands for delivery to its intended recipient. Shortly after this call,
                    however, he found his car being “sandwiched” by the CNB officers
                    at the junction of Lavender Street and Bendemeer Road. This eventually led to
                    his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the court below, the Prosecution relied on the presumptions under
                    ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the Act to prove that the Respondent had in his
                    possession the two plastic bags containing Ice (<em>viz</em>, A1 and A2) and that he knew that the contents therein were
                    Ice. It was also clear that the Respondent was trafficking in Ice since he had
                    admitted that he was on the way to deliver the drugs to one of Bapak’s
                    customers. The Respondent’s defence was that he did not intend to traffic
                    in the <em>quantity</em> of Ice that was in fact found on
                    him, <em>viz</em>, 386.7g, but only in a lesser quantity of
                    up to 250g. This particular defence was crucial as any quantity beyond 250g
                    would have attracted the death penalty. In support of this particular defence,
                    the Respondent claimed that he had an agreement with Bapak not to deliver more
                    than 250g of Ice. Given this agreement and that there was nothing suspicious
                    about that delivery that should have caused the Respondent to suspect that he
                    would be given more than 250g of Ice, the Defence submitted that the Respondent
                        <em>did not know</em> and that it was not reasonable
                    for him to expect that the weight of Ice passed to him would be more than
                    250g.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The primary issue before the Judge was therefore whether the
                    Respondent’s defence (<em>ie</em>, that he <em>did not know</em> the weight of Ice in his possession was
                    more than 250g) should be accepted. The Judge approached this by considering,
                    first, whether there was an agreement between the Respondent and Bapak, and
                    secondly, whether there were any circumstances which would have caused the
                    Respondent to suspect that there was more than 250g of Ice in the
                    packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge made the following findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     On a balance of probabilities, there was an agreement between the
                        Respondent and Bapak that the Respondent would not be required to deliver
                        more than 250g of Ice for each delivery job. In particular, the Respondent
                        had satisfactorily outlined his defence in his statements. Although this was
                        not done in detail, the absence of elaboration was not a proper basis to
                        draw an adverse inference against him as there was no need for the
                        Respondent to have minutely detailed his defence in his statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent could not be said to have been wilfully blind as there was
                        no reason for the Respondent to have suspected that he had been given more
                        than 250g of Ice for the fourth delivery. In particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Although there was an increase in the weight from the first and second
                            delivery (125g of Ice) to the third delivery (250g of Ice), the weight
                            of Ice for the third delivery was still within the 250g limit. This
                            alone was not a persuasive reason to find that the Respondent must have
                            then suspected that there was an increasing trend in the weight of Ice
                            being delivered, and that he must have at least suspected that Bapak
                            would have increased the weight of Ice for the fourth delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Although he had received two plastic bags of Ice, it was not
                            reasonable to expect the Respondent to have been able to guess the
                            weight of the Ice merely from the size or number of plastic bags. The
                            difference between 386.7g and 250g of Ice was not so significant that
                            there would be a discernible physical difference between the plastic
                            bags. We would note at this juncture that the Judge, with respect, had
                            erred in using the net weight of the Ice (386.7g). In such a context,
                            the appropriate comparator is the gross weight of the drug (which was
                            nearly 500g), as it is impossible to determine the net content of pure
                            Ice through a visual inspection, although nothing really turned on
                            this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judge therefore accepted the Respondent’s defence that he did not
                    know that the weight of Ice in his possession was more than 250g. Accordingly,
                    he amended the charge to one of possessing 249.99g of Ice for the purpose of
                    trafficking and convicted the Respondent on that amended charge instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Prosecution appealed against the entirety of the Judgment, raising two
                    broad issues on appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the Judge had erred in finding that there was an agreement between
                        the Respondent and Bapak that the weight of Ice for each delivery would not
                        exceed 250g; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the Judge had erred in finding that the Respondent’s conduct
                        did not amount to wilful blindness inasmuch as he did not know that the
                        weight of Ice in his possession was more than 250g.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After considering the submissions of the Prosecution, we were not satisfied
                    that the findings of the Judge were plainly wrong or plainly against the weight
                    of the evidence. We first elaborate on the two issues raised in this appeal,
                    before returning to the three general observations alluded to at the outset of
                    the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The agreement with Bapak</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first finding of fact which was appealed against was the Judge’s
                    finding that there was an agreement between Bapak and the Respondent that the
                    weight of Ice for each delivery would not exceed 250g. What was apparent to us
                    was that the only evidence supporting this agreement was the Respondent’s
                    own evidence in both his oral testimony as well as his statements. It was
                    therefore pertinent to examine the consistency of the Respondent’s
                    evidence and the Judge’s reliance on this to ascertain whether the
                    Judge’s findings in this regard were plainly wrong or plainly against the
                    weight of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Prosecution raised a number of challenges against the Respondent’s
                    evidence regarding this agreement, arguing that the evidence could not support
                    the Judge’s findings. This included the following arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     although the Respondent might have alluded to such an agreement in the
                        Cautioned Statement, the agreement was not mentioned at all in his long
                        statements. This had to be considered against the evidence of the
                        investigating officer, Deputy Superintendent Tan Seow Keong
                        (“DSP Tan”), who had testified that he had recorded
                        everything which the Respondent had mentioned;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     the fact the Respondent had mentioned the agreement in the Cautioned
                        Statement but failed to mention this in his long statements demonstrated
                        that there was an inconsistency in his position. His credibility had to be
                        considered in the light of this inconsistency; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Respondent’s credibility was put into serious doubt because he
                        had made several allegations for the first time during cross-examination and
                        these allegations were never put to the relevant Prosecution witnesses when
                        they took the witness stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Prosecution also took issue with the fact that the Respondent had
                        chosen not to call Bapak as a witness. We will return to address this point
                        later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As can be seen, one of the key planks of the Prosecution’s argument on
                    appeal was that there was no record of any agreement in the Respondent’s
                    long statements. While this was true to some extent, this evidence, however, had
                    to be considered in the light of the three points below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     First, it was important to understand the significance of the absence of any
                    agreement being mentioned in the long statements against the backdrop of how the
                    long statements were recorded. When this issue was raised, the Judge noted (see
                    the Judgment at [33]) that DSP Tan had admitted during cross-examination
                    that the Respondent had mentioned an agreement, but that this might not have
                    been written down when DSP Tan recorded the long statements. In this
                    appeal, the Prosecution pointed out that, during re-examination, DSP Tan
                    actually explained that he might have misunderstood the question during
                    cross-examination, and that the Respondent might not have explicitly mentioned
                    an agreement during the recording of his statements. The Prosecution therefore
                    contended that the Judge had erred in relying on this lapse to reason why the
                    Respondent had not mentioned any agreement in his long statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Whilst that was true, what was important to note was that, when questioned by
                    the Judge as to why he seemed to have an idea of this agreement, DSP Tan
                    went on further to state as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, Your Honour, I, erm, to answer the question,
                                it’s---it’s---<em>it’s an
                                impression that I got from, er, the accused that---there---he will
                                not transaction more than, er, 255</em> [<em>sic</em>] gram <em>of Ice and
                            above</em>. Er, but on the fact that whether he has an agreement
                            with “Bapak”, er, that one I’m not so sure. Er,
                            because if---if the accused has mention this to me earlier on, during
                            the statement recording, I would have recorded it down.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The important point to note in the context of the present appeal was that
                    whether there was an agreement between Bapak and the Respondent was only
                        <em>indicative</em> of the <em>mens
                        rea</em> of the Respondent –
                    <em>even if</em> the Respondent was under the <em>misimpression</em> that he would only be delivering less than
                    250g of Ice because of an agreement (which may or may not have existed), this
                    was still indicative of what the Respondent’s state of knowledge was. In
                    this regard, it was significant that DSP Tan had observed that, whilst the
                    Respondent may not have explicitly mentioned an agreement, the Respondent
                        <em>did</em> give an <em>impression</em> that he would only be delivering less than 250g of
                    Ice. This lent credibility to the Respondent’s assertion that he did not
                    know he was carrying more than 250g of Ice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Secondly, we also noted that the Respondent had, in a number of his
                    statements, mentioned that the weight of the Ice in his possession was 250g.
                    When the packets of Ice were first retrieved from the Car, SSI Tony Ng had
                    asked the Respondent what the packets contained, and how heavy they weighed. The
                    Respondent, albeit after some hesitation, stated that it was
                    “250g” of Ice. This was corroborated by the evidence of another
                    CNB officer present, Woman Senior Staff Sergeant Jenny Woo. The second time the
                    Respondent mentioned the weight of Ice was, as observed by the Judge, in the
                    Respondent’s Cautioned Statement, where the Respondent mentioned that he
                    “used to collect ICE below the weight of 250 grams”. Finally,
                    in his long statement dated 23 March 2011, the Respondent had also
                    mentioned that he did not “know the exact weight of Ice”, but had
                    assumed “that the total weight was 250 grams”. Apart from the
                    lack of details in his long statements, there was therefore really no inherent
                    contradiction between his statements and his defence. Looked at as a whole, this
                    lent further credibility to the Respondent’s assertion of such an
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Thirdly, we could also find no fault with the Judge’s reasoning that it
                    would be odd that the Respondent would only be paid $500 for every single
                    delivery of Ice, regardless of the weight. The impression from the notes of
                    evidence as well as his statements suggested to us that the Respondent was of
                    reasonable intellect and was proficient in English. The Prosecution had also
                    alluded to this and, in their closing submissions in the trial below,
                    characterised the Respondent as “an intelligent and enterprising
                    person”. In a commercial bargain, it would be reasonable to think that
                    the Respondent would not have agreed to be paid a flat rate of $500 for every
                    single delivery of Ice, regardless of the weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Respondent was wilfully blind</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second finding of fact which was appealed against was the Judge’s
                    finding that the Respondent was not wilfully blind, inasmuch as he did not know
                    or had little reason to suspect that the weight of Ice in his possession was
                    more than 250g. The Prosecution relied on three facts to argue that the
                    Respondent should be found to have been wilfully blind. First, it was submitted
                    that the Respondent had knowledge that there were two plastic bags instead of
                    one, unlike in the previous three deliveries. He should therefore have at least
                    suspected that there was a greater quantity of Ice in his possession. Secondly,
                    the Respondent had conceded that he could not trust Bapak generally and,
                    therefore, he would already have had his suspicions as to whether the weight of
                    Ice in his possession exceeded 250g (despite the alleged agreement with Bapak).
                    Thirdly, the Respondent could have easily checked whether the weight of Ice in
                    his possession was more than 250g, and, by choosing not to do so, was really
                    turning a blind eye to the actual facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In support of this argument, the Prosecution submitted that the facts of this
                    appeal were similar to those in the decision of this court in <em>Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<em>Dinesh Pillai</em>”). In <em>Dinesh
                        Pillai</em>, the accused was paid to deliver “food”
                    wrapped in brown packets to Singapore. During the third of such deliveries, the
                    accused was detained at Woodlands Immigration Checkpoint, and diamorphine was
                    found inside the brown packet. In dismissing his appeal, this court found that
                    the accused had failed to prove that he did not know that the brown packet in
                    his possession contained a controlled drug. It was observed (at [17]) that the
                    accused “did not believe” that the brown packet contained food,
                    suspected that they contained something illegal, and had ample time and
                    opportunity to check. By not doing so, the accused therefore (see [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… failed to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption on a balance of
                        probabilities because he turned a blind eye to what the Brown Packet
                        contained despite suspecting that it contained something illegal. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Prosecution submitted that essentially the same factors were present
                        in this appeal – basically, a certain suspicion on the part of the
                        Respondent and his subsequent failure to check.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We were not persuaded by this argument. In our judgment, the appeal before us
                    was different from <em>Dinesh Pillai</em> in the following
                    manner. First, although the Respondent might have had <em>some</em> sort of suspicion on his part, we agreed with the Judge
                    that such a suspicion was “not firmly grounded on specific facts but
                    arose simply by virtue of the risky venture which he undertook” (see the
                    Judgment at [43]). Even if the Respondent had suspected that Bapak <em>might</em> have increased the weight of the Ice to be
                    delivered, it was significant that in his previous three deliveries, the weight
                    of the Ice was 250g or less, in accordance with his alleged agreement with
                    Bapak. The Respondent had followed a similar, if not the same, <em>modus operandi</em> as he did in his previous delivery jobs,
                    where he had driven to a point where he would wait to be passed the drugs, and
                    then delivered the drugs to the instructed destination. There was therefore
                    nothing out of the ordinary such as to arouse his suspicion which was (in turn)
                    sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness. Secondly, it must also be
                    remembered that in this case, unlike <em>Dinesh
                    Pillai</em>, it could not be said that the Respondent could have easily
                    ascertained the weight of the Ice in his possession. In fact, during his
                    previous deliveries, it was only after he had received the drugs and returned
                    would he then weigh the Ice passed to him. That was how he had known that the
                    weight of the Ice in his previous deliveries was less than 250g in gross
                    weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the trial below, the burden was on the Respondent to “prove on a
                    balance of probabilities that he did not know or could not reasonably be
                    expected to have known” (see <em>Dinesh Pillai</em>
                    at [21]) that the weight of Ice was above 250g. In the Judge’s view, which
                    we agreed with, he had successfully discharged this burden of proof. In this
                    regard, we found the decision of this court in <em>Khor Soon Lee
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“<em>Khor Soon Lee</em>”) helpful. To briefly summarise, in
                        <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>, the accused was a drug courier
                    who had had agreed to transport Erimin, Ketamine, Ice and Ecstasy into
                    Singapore. However, on the day of his arrest, he was found to be in possession
                    of <em>diamorphine</em> instead (a charge which attracted
                    the death penalty). He was convicted for trafficking in diamorphine, and
                    appealed to this court, arguing that he did not know that the drugs in his
                    possession were diamorphine. The appeal was allowed, and two facts were
                    significant in this particular regard. First, this court noted (at [23]) that
                    the accused had sought assurances from his supplier that he would not be
                    trafficking in diamorphine as he was afraid of the death penalty. Second, it was
                    also significant that, on numerous previous occasions, he had only trafficked in
                    Erimin, Ketamine, Ice, Ecstasy, but not diamorphine. Having this in mind, the
                    court was therefore satisfied that the accused was “at most, either
                    negligent or reckless in not checking the package, but <em>not</em> wilfully blind” (at [28]). Given our observations
                    above, we likewise found that the Respondent could not be said to be wilfully
                    blind simply because he did not check the weight of the Ice in the packets. To
                    this end, we would also affirm the Judge’s findings that the sight of two
                    plastic bags would not be significant enough to cause the Respondent to suspect
                    that the weight of Ice in his possession was more than 250g (notwithstanding the
                    Judge’s error in using the net weight of the Ice instead of the gross
                    weight, as he should have done (see above at [18(b)(ii)])).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the substantive appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     For the reasons set out above, we were of the view that the Judge’s
                    findings were not plainly against the weight of the evidence. His findings were
                    reasoned and supported by the evidence, and, thus, the threshold for appellate
                    intervention had not been crossed. We therefore dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Notwithstanding the fact that we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the
                    Judge’s decision that the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act had
                    been rebutted on the evidence before him, we think that it is timely to render
                    some general observations on certain specific issues – some of which arose
                    during the course of oral submissions before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The failure to call Bapak as a witness </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     One specific – and related – issue that arose in the present
                    appeal and which might have a potentially broader application beyond this case
                    related to whether the courts should draw an adverse inference in situations
                    where the accused person claims that somebody had given him the drugs concerned
                    and that person is in fact available to be called as a witness during his trial.
                    In this appeal, that potential witness (who was <em>not</em>, in fact, called) was Bapak. The Prosecution had relied on
                    this fact in challenging both the Judge’s findings of fact, arguing that
                    by choosing not to do so, this cast a “real doubt” on the
                    Respondent’s evidence that there had been an agreement between the
                    Respondent and Bapak that the weight of Ice for each delivery would not exceed
                    250g.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     When faced with this particular issue, the Respondent’s counsel,
                    Mr Amolat Singh (“Mr Singh”), in his characteristically
                    candid style (which has now become a sterling hallmark all criminal
                    practitioners would do well to emulate) did not seek to avoid the issue, but
                    instead, dealt with it head-on. Put simply, his point was that the choice of
                    whether or not to call a witness (such as Bapak) is <em>a
                        tactical decision which lies within the purview of the defence</em>.
                    In this particular case, for example, Mr Singh stated that Bapak was not
                    called as a witness because it was felt that his evidence would not be of
                    assistance or might even be prejudicial to the Respondent. Bapak, Mr Singh
                    submitted, would (in order to assist and corroborate the Respondent’s
                    case) have to give evidence <em>which might implicate him in an
                        offence under the Act as well</em>. In our view, this point is
                    well-taken. Indeed, it was possible that Bapak might, instead, have attempted to
                    implicate the Respondent. Whilst it is true that he could then have been treated
                    as a hostile witness, it would, in the general scheme of things, not only not
                    have advanced the Respondent’s case but might also have <em>prejudiced</em> it instead. Put simply, the Respondent might have
                    been in no better a position or might even have been in a <em>worse</em> position had he chosen to call Bapak as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It is true that, in <em>Khor Soon Lee</em>, we expressed
                    the view (at [32]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [W]here there are at least two co-accused who have been charged in
                        relation to the same transaction, the Prosecution should endeavour, if
                        … it proposes to release one of the co-accused, to inform counsel for
                        the other co-accused as expeditiously as possible. Likewise, counsel for the
                            <em>other</em> co-accused should also act with
                        equal expedition in determining whether the evidence of the co-accused (to
                        be released) is necessary for his or her client’s defence. If deemed
                        necessary, counsel ought to make the necessary applications to secure the
                        co-accused’s attendance at the trial of his or her client. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The present appeal is different from that in <em>Khor Soon
                        Lee</em> in so far as Bapak was not a co-accused together with the
                    Respondent. However, there is, in principle, no reason why the Prosecution
                    should not have made Bapak available as a witness. In fact, the Prosecution
                    confirmed that it <em>did</em> indeed make Bapak available
                    to the defence to be called as a witness, although, it was submitted, there was
                    no <em>duty</em> on the part of <em>the
                        Prosecution</em> to call Bapak as a witness. This last-mentioned point
                    is well-taken and brings us back to the issue as to whether or not, faced with
                    the choice of calling Bapak as a witness, an adverse inference ought to be drawn
                    against the Respondent (pursuant to s 116, Illustration (<em>g</em>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (“s 116(g)”)) as he had chosen <em>not</em> to call Bapak as a witness. And this in turn brings us back
                    to the submission by Mr Singh (above at [37]). We think that his submission
                    is generally a persuasive one, especially when we take into account the relevant
                    case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     An oft-cited decision (see, for example, Dr V Kesava Rao, <em>Sir John Woodroffe &amp; Syed Amir Ali’s Law of
                        Evidence</em> (LexisNexis, 18th ed, 2009) vol 3 at
                    p 4947) is the Calcutta decision of <em>In the Matter of the
                        Petition of Dhunno Kazi and another; The Empress v Dhunno Kazi and
                        another</em> (1881) ILR 8 Cal 121 (“<em>Kazi</em>”), where Wilson J, in delivering the
                    judgment of the court, observed as follows (at 124–125):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only legitimate object of a prosecution is to secure not a conviction,
                        but that justice be done. The prosecutor is not therefore free to choose how
                        much evidence he will bring before the Court. He is bound to produce all the
                        evidence in his favour directly bearing upon the charge. It is <em>primâ facie</em> his duty, accordingly, to call witnesses
                        who prove their connection with the transactions in question, and also must
                        be able to give important information. The only thing that can relieve the
                        prosecutor from calling such witnesses is the reasonable belief that, if
                        called, they would not speak the truth. If such witnesses are not called
                        without sufficient reason being shown (and the mere fact of their being
                        summoned for the defence seems to us by no means necessarily a sufficient
                        reason), the Court may properly draw an inference adverse to the
                        prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>There is </em>
<b><em>no
                            corresponding inference against the accused. He is merely on the
                            defensive, and owes no duty to any one but himself. He is at liberty, as
                            to the whole or any part of the case against him, to rely on the
                            witnesses of the case for the prosecution, or to call witnesses, or to
                            meet the charge in any other way he chooses; and no inference
                            unfavourable to him can properly be drawn, because he takes one course
                            rather than another.</em></b> In the present case, these
                        considerations apply with peculiar force. If the witnesses referred to by
                        the learned Judge are thought by the prosecution to be trustworthy men, the
                        prosecution was bound to call them. If they are thought not to be so, it
                        seems to us specially unreasonable to reproach the accused with not calling
                        them.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Indeed, <em>Kazi</em> was itself cited in the Federation
                    of Malaya Court of Appeal decision of <em>Goh Ah Yew v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1949] MLJ 150 (“<em>Goh Ah
                        Yew</em>”), where Spenser-Wilkinson J, delivering the
                    judgment of the court, observed thus (at 153):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before finally disposing of this appeal, however, there are various points
                        which were raised in the course of the argument at the trial (some of which
                        were mentioned before us) upon which we feel that we ought to express an
                        opinion. In the course of a long address to the Assessors the Deputy Public
                        Prosecutor who conducted the trial in the Court below put forward various
                        propositions of law which were quite untenable. In the first place, he
                        invited the Assessors to draw an inference against the appellant by reason
                        of his failure to call a certain witness who was present in Court and
                        available. He relied upon paragraph (g) of section 114 of the
                        Evidence Enactment [<em>ie</em>, s 116(g)] as
                        showing that a presumption arose that the evidence of this witness would not
                        have corroborated that of the appellant. <b><em>No such

                            There is no duty upon an accused to call any evidence. He is at liberty
                            to offer evidence or not as he thinks proper and no inference
                            unfavourable to him can be drawn because he adopts one course rather
                            than the other. </em></b><em>Emperor v. Dhunno

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The principle in <em>Goh Ah Yew</em>, as set out in the
                    preceding paragraph, has also since been applied in numerous decisions in both

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    In my opinion, the respondent’s failure to call Natasha to the
                            stand should have resulted in an adverse inference being drawn against
                            her under illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act. I do
                            not mean to suggest that a defendant’s failure to call a material
                            witness will always result in an adverse inference being drawn against
                            him. Illustration (g) to s 116 provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced
                        would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As apparent from the wording of the provision, it allows, but does not
                        compel, the court to draw adverse inferences even if available evidence is
                        not produced in court. In fact, the general rule is that the burden lies on
                        the Prosecution to prove its case and no adverse inference can be drawn
                        against the Defence if it chooses not to call any witness: see <em>Goh Ah Yew v PP</em> [1949] 1 MLJ 150 and <em>Abu Bakar v R</em> [1963] 1 MLJ 288. <b><em>There is however an important qualification to this general

                            calling such a witness is the only way to rebut the Prosecution’s
                            case, illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act then
                            allows the court to draw an adverse inference against the defendant:

                            is based on the commonsense notion that if the only way for the Defence

                            then her failure to do so naturally raises the inference that even that
                            witness’s evidence will be unfavourable to her.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    This was exactly the case in the present appeal. The circumstantial
                            evidence adduced by the Prosecution was strong enough to amount to a
                            complete case against the respondent. The respondent had no other
                            available means of rebutting the Prosecution’s strong
                            circumstantial evidence against her except through calling Natasha to
                            the stand. Yet she failed to do so without good reasons. Natasha was
                            clearly an available witness. In fact, she was in court during the trial
                            hearing. In such circumstances, the judge should have drawn an adverse
                            inference against the respondent under illustration (g) to
                            s 116 of the Evidence Act that Natasha’s evidence would be
                            unfavourable to her.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Most importantly, we note the following observations by Yong Pung How CJ
                    in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Mohamed
                        Abdullah s/o Abdul Razak v Public Prosecutor</em> [2000]
                    1 SLR(R) 922 (“<em>Mohamed
                    Abdullah</em>”) (at [41]–[44]) (a decision that was, not
                    surprisingly, also relied upon by Mr Singh):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    What effect should be attributed by the court to the appellant’s
                            failure to call material witnesses? In criminal matters, it is well
                            established that where the Prosecution fails to call a material and
                            essential witness, the court has the discretion to draw an adverse
                            presumption against it under s 116 illus (<em>g</em>) of the EA. In deciding whether it is appropriate to
                            draw such an adverse presumption against the Prosecution, all the
                            circumstances of the case will be considered, to see whether its failure
                            to call that material witness left a gap in its case, or whether such
                            failure constituted withholding of evidence from the court. <b><em>In contrast, due to the allocation of the burden of proof
                                in criminal matters, great caution should be exercised</em></b>
                            when applying s 116 illus (<em>g</em>) EA
                            to <b><em>the defence’s failure to call a material
                                witness</em></b>. Whereas the Prosecution has the burden to prove
                            its case beyond reasonable doubt, the defendant has no such burden to
                            prove his innocence. Instead, all that he has to do, is to cast a
                            reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. Even if the defendant
                            has failed to call a material witness, and there are gaps in his
                            defence, the court must still consider whether he has nevertheless
                            succeeded in casting a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case.
                            In the Malaysian cases of <em>Illian v Public
                                Prosecutor</em> [1988] 1 MLJ 421 and <em>Tan Foo Su v Public Prosecutor</em> [1967] 2 MLJ 19, it
                            was held that the failure of the Defence to call a witness should not be
                            made subject to adverse comment by the court, and that s 114
                            illus (g) of the Malaysian Evidence Act (<em>in pari
                                materia</em> with Singapore’s s 116
                                illus (<em>g</em>) EA) should not be
                            invoked against the accused person.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    Therefore, it is clear that s 116 illus (<em>g</em>) of the EA <b><em>does not apply with the
                                same vigour to the Defence as to the Prosecution. Otherwise, it
                                would be tantamount to placing a duty on the Defence to call every
                                material witness, and to prove the defendant’s innocence. When
                                faced with a situation where the Defence has failed to call a
                                material witness, the court should bear in mind that such failure on
                                the part of the Defence does not add anything to the
                                Prosecution’s case, in that it does not operate to raise any
                                presumption which would help the Prosecution to prove its case
                                beyond reasonable doubt when it has otherwise failed to do so.
                                Instead, the Defence’s failure to call a material witness will
                                only affect its own ability to cast a reasonable doubt on the
                                Prosecution’s case.</em></b> Section 116
                                illus (<em>g</em>) of the EA does not
                            change this fundamental principle. In every case, the court will ask, in
                            view of all the facts and evidence before it, whether the Defence has
                            succeeded in casting a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case
                            despite its failure to call a material witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    In <em>Choo Chang Teik v Public Prosecutor</em>
                            [1991] 3 MLJ 423, the Supreme Court of Malaysia distinguished the
                            previous cases of <em>Illian v Public
                                Prosecutor</em> and <em>Tan Foo Su v Public
                                Prosecutor</em>, and drew an adverse inference against the
                            accused under s 114 illus (g) of the Malaysian Evidence Act.
                            Mohamed Yusoff SCJ, delivering the judgment of the court, stated
                            that where the Prosecution had made out a complete case against the
                            accused person, and had adduced rebuttal evidence against the
                            accused’s evidence, and the case disclosed that there was evidence
                            that could be produced by the accused to negate the charge against him,
                            then the natural conclusion flowing from the accused’s failure to
                            offer such evidence was that the evidence, if produced, instead of
                            rebutting would sustain the charge. In my view, this was really another
                            way of saying that the Defence had failed to cast a reasonable doubt on
                            the Prosecution’s case. Section 114 illus (g) of the
                            Malaysian Evidence Act was simply used by the Malaysian Supreme Court to
                            draw the “natural conclusion”, from the facts of that
                            case, which ordinary prudence required them to draw.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    
              <b><em>Thus, when the Singapore court is faced with a
                                situation where the Prosecution has made out a complete case against
                                the defendant, or has adduced rebuttal evidence against the Defence,
                                and the case discloses that the Defence has failed to call a
                                material witness</em></b>, s 116 illus (<em>g</em>) of the EA <b><em>merely allows
                                the court, where appropriate, to draw the natural conclusion that

                                been unfavourable to the defendant. If such a natural conclusion can
                                indeed be drawn, then it would go towards the court’s
                                consideration of whether the Defence has cast a reasonable doubt on
                                the Prosecution’s case. However, in deciding whether it is
                                appropriate to draw this conclusion, all the facts and circumstances
                                of the case will be considered. For example, if the witness could
                                not be located despite reasonable efforts, no such “natural
                                conclusion” can be drawn.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The last paragraph in the quotation above is noteworthy and ought to be
                        read with Yong CJ’s subsequent observations in <em>Nurashikin</em> as to what constitutes an important qualification
                        to the general rule (see above at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At this juncture, it is important to note that the principle laid down by Yong
                    CJ in <em>Mohamed Abdullah</em> (as quoted in the preceding
                    paragraph) is clear law in the Singapore context and has been cited in numerous
                    decisions since (see, to take but a small sampling of only some of the latest
                    decisions, the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Nurashikin</em> at [24], as well as the Singapore District Court
                    decisions of <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Jaya d/o Gopal</em> [2007] SGDC 189 at [80]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Bijabahadur Rai s/o Shree

                        NYH</em> [2014] SGDC 432).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, as the facts of each case can vary so vastly, we hesitate to lay down
                    a blanket rule that an adverse inference can <em>never</em>
                    be drawn against an accused person even in a context where the failure to call a
                    material witness was primarily motivated by the concern that it would be in that
                    witness’s self-interest to give evidence that is prejudicial to the
                    defence. That having been said, the drawing of an adverse inference by the court
                    in a fact situation such as the present would likely, in the nature of things
                    and given the general tenor of the case law cited above, to be extremely rare
                    and would stem in all probability from an exceptional fact situation, if at all.
                    We pause to note that this is the case, even taking into account
                    Yong CJ’s observations in <em>Nurashikin</em>
                    (quoted above at [43]) – having regard to what would be the usual fact
                    situation in cases such as the present (as to which, see above at [39]). Of
                    course, our remarks should not be understood to mean that an accused person has
                    no general duty in all situations to call defence witnesses. There are, for
                    example, presumptions in the Act which make it incumbent on the accused to
                    “prove” facts in order to rebut the presumptions on a balance of
                    probabilities. In situations where the presumptions apply, an adverse inference
                    could well be drawn against the accused for his failure to call a material
                    witness who is available. Suffice it to state that, on the facts of the present
                    case, it was not, in our view, appropriate to draw an adverse inference against
                    the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Manufactured defences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Our second observation pertained specifically to the defence raised by the
                    Respondent, <em>ie</em>, that he did not know the <em>weight</em> of the Ice in his possession. This was an issue
                    which was encapsulated in the following observations by this court in <em>Khor Soon Lee</em> (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a result of our finding above, and given the <em>particular factual matrix</em> set out above, it would also
                        follow that the Appellant has succeeded in rebutting, on a balance of
                        probabilities, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act.
                        It bears emphasising that each case will, of course, depend on its own
                        precise facts. The facts of the present appeal, it might be observed, are
                        rather unusual: in particular, the consistent pattern of conduct referred to
                        above (which centred on dealing in drugs which did <em>not</em> involve the death penalty) was admitted by the
                        Prosecution, and, further, the testimony of a significant witness (Tony) was
                        not available (for which we have therefore assumed that such testimony, if
                        given, would have buttressed the Appellant’s case). In the
                        circumstances, a strong cautionary note ought to be sounded. Given the
                        finely balanced set of facts in the present appeal, nothing in this case
                        sets a precedent for future cases (which ought, in any event, to turn on
                        their own particular facts). Still less will future courts countenance
                        accused persons seeking to “manufacture defences” in order to
                        effect a similar fact pattern. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Put simply, the concern is that accused persons may attempt to
                        “<em>manufacture defences</em>”,
                    particularly through carefully rehearsed statements (both written and/or oral)
                    which are intended to rebut the presumptions under the Act, thus enabling the
                    accused person concerned to escape capital punishment as mandated under the
                    relevant provisions of the Act. That is why this court was at pains to emphasise
                    “the finely balanced set of facts” in <em>Khor Soon
                        Lee</em> which were also described as being “rather
                    unusual” (see <em>Khor Soon Lee</em> at [29],
                    reproduced in the preceding paragraph). Indeed, in <em>Khor Soon
                        Lee</em>, there was (as alluded to above at [33]) a consistent pattern
                    of conduct centring on the dealing in drugs which did not involve the death
                    penalty. In addition, this consistent pattern of conduct was admitted by the
                    Prosecution. It should be further noted that the court in that case assumed that
                    the testimony of a significant witness (who was not available) would have been
                    in the accused person’s favour. The danger of abuse is clear: accused
                    persons might henceforth (as alluded to at the outset of this paragraph)
                    rehearse contrived statements intended to pull the proverbial wool over the eyes
                    of the judge in the trial court by claiming that <em>they
                        thought</em> that they were dealing in a drug which did <em>not</em> involve the death penalty. Indeed, in the present
                    case, there was yet another <em>variation</em> on this
                    particular theme inasmuch as the Respondent claimed that there was a consistent
                    pattern of dealing in a drug which did potentially involve the death penalty,
                    but which weight carried during each dealing or transaction was carefully
                    calibrated so as not to be of a weight which attracted the death penalty upon
                    conviction. We must admit that we had some difficulty with this particular
                    argument, at least when it was viewed at first blush.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     However (and this brings us to the next and important point), much depends, in
                    the final analysis, on an assessment of the credibility of the accused person
                    (see also the decision of this court in <em>Tan Kiam Peng v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [131]) and,
                    consistent with established legal principles as well as common sense, the
                    appellate court would be very reluctant to interfere with the findings in this
                    regard by the trial judge (which are, in effect, findings of fact). This does
                    not, of course, mean that the appellate court can never interfere with a trial
                    judge’s findings of fact – particularly if they are, having regard
                    to all the facts (including oral <em>as well as</em>
                    documentary evidence) and circumstances of the case, plainly against the weight
                    of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Returning to the facts of this case, as already mentioned above, we were of
                    the view that the Judge had assessed the credibility of the Respondent in some
                    detail and we did not see any ground to interfere with his findings and
                    decision. That having been said, we do want to re-emphasise the fact that, in
                    assessing the credibility of accused persons in the context of the application
                    of the presumptions found in the Act, trial judges should be extremely wary of
                    carefully rehearsed defences which have been manufactured with a view to
                    escaping the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable law on appellate intervention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     This leads us to our final point, which is that despite our reservations, we
                    dismissed the appeal because the threshold for appellate intervention had not
                    been crossed. This appeal was primarily against the findings of fact made by the
                    Judge, and in this regard, it bears repeating the principles governing appellate
                    intervention <em>vis-à-vis</em> findings of fact by a trial
                    judge. This court, in <em>Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and

                    3 SLR 562 (at [37]), cited with approval the following passage in its
                    earlier decision of <em>Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix
                        Leasing Singapore Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The appellate court’s power of review with respect to finding[s]
                        of facts is limited because the trial judge is generally better placed to
                        assess the veracity and credibility of witnesses, especially where oral
                        evidence is concerned (<em>Seah Ting Soon v Indonesian
                            Tractors Co Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [22]).
                        However, this rule is not immutable. <em>Where it can be
                            established that the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or
                            against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court can and should
                            overturn any such finding</em> (see <em>Alagappa
                            Subramanian v Chidambaram s/o Alagappa</em> [2003] SGCA
                        20 at [13] and <em>Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v
                            PP</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [34]-[36]). Furthermore, where
                        a particular finding of fact is not based on the veracity or credibility of
                        the witness, but instead, is based on an inference drawn from the facts or
                        the evaluation of primary facts, the appellate court is in as good a
                        position as the trial judge to undertake that exercise (<em>Tan Chin Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                        3 SLR(R) 307 at [54] and <em>Ho Soo Fong v Standard
                            Chartered Bank</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 181 at [20]). In so
                        doing, the appellate court will evaluate the cogency of the evidence given
                        by the witnesses by testing it against inherent probabilities or against
                        uncontroverted facts (<em>Peh Eng Leng v Pek Eng
                            Leong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 939 at [22]). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As alluded to in the passage above, we have now come to recognise a difference
                    between findings of fact based on the veracity or credibility of witnesses and
                    inferences of fact. Going one step further, it has also been accepted by this
                    court (see <em>Thorben Langvad Linneberg v Leong Mei
                        Kuen</em> [2013] 1 SLR 207 at [13], affirming the decision of the
                    Singapore High Court in <em>Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi
                        Able</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 61) that an appellate court is in as
                    good a position as a trial judge to assess a witness’s credibility if his
                    assessment is based on inferences drawn from:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     the internal consistency in the content of the witness’s testimony;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     the external consistency between the content of the witness’s
                        evidence and the extrinsic evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In view of the principles set out above, when faced with an appeal against a
                    judge’s findings of fact, an appellate court should first seek to discern
                    whether the finding of fact appealed against is one based on the credibility of
                    the witness, or an inference of fact based on objective evidence. In the latter
                    scenario, an appellate court should look at the objective evidence before the
                    court and then question whether the trial judge’s assessment was <em>plainly against the weight of the objective evidence</em>. In
                    the former scenario, the appellate court should assess whether the trial
                    judge’s findings on the credibility of the witness, and hence any
                    acceptance of that particular witness’s evidence, are <em>plainly wrong</em>. This can be done by examining the internal and
                    external consistency of the witness’s evidence as mentioned in the two
                    categories above.</p>
