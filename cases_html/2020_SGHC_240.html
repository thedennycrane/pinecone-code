In the Suit, ST alleges that RAS is in arrears of commissions which are payable to ST under a contract (“the Contract”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 3 June 2020, RAS took out Summons 2181 of 2020 (“SUM 2181”) to stay the Suit under O 12 r 7 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), on the basis that the Contract contained the following exclusive jurisdiction clause (“the EJC”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales in relation to the Agreement and any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Assistant Registrar (“AR”) applied the principles in <span class="font-italic">Vinmar Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1271 (“<span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>”), which he summarised as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that there is a “good arguable case” that an EJC governs the dispute. To establish a “good arguable case”, the applicant needs to have “the better of the argument, on the evidence before the court, that the [jurisdiction] agreement exists and applies to the dispute” (<span class="font-italic">Vinmar </span>at [41] and [45]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the EJC applies, the next question is whether there is strong cause to refuse a stay of proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Vinmar </span>at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The AR dismissed SUM 2181 as he was unable to conclude that there was a good arguable case that the EJC governed the Suit. This was because RAS had “hedg[ed] its position” as to whether the EJC applied. In particular, RAS’ sole director, Mr Goel Adesh Kumar, had stated on affidavit that the EJC would be an applicable term of the Contract “if indeed such an agreement [was] found to be established at law”. Mr Goel had also questioned whether ST was a party to the Contract (and, consequently, whether it had locus standi to bring the claim). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In RA 145, RAS appealed the AR’s decision. After hearing the parties, I agreed with the AR’s reasoning and dismissed RAS’ appeal on the basis that RAS had not discharged its burden of showing that the EJC applied. RAS then filed this application for leave to appeal against my decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The principles regarding leave to appeal are well-settled. There are at least three grounds on which RAS can obtain leave to appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Kuan Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 862 at [15] and [16]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appeal involves a question of general principle decided for the first time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appeal involves a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Counsel for RAS, Mr Kyle Yew, contended that my decision in RA 145 involved a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of error as I did not consider and apply the decision in the High Court case of <span class="font-italic">PT Selecta Bestama v Sin Huat </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Marine Transportation Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 729 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Selecta</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In <span class="font-italic">PT Selecta</span>, Steven Chong J (as he then was) held (at [40] and [41]) that the applicability of an EJC would differ depending on which of the following two categories the case fell within: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If the parties are in dispute as to the existence or validity of the agreement containing the EJC (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, due to fraud or misrepresentation), the dispute would still be determined in accordance with the EJC as if the contract was valid (“Category 1”). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) By contrast, if there was clearly no concluded contract at all, such as where the parties were <span class="font-italic">ad idem</span> that there was no contract, or where the other party was defrauded into thinking the contract was of a wholly different nature giving rise to the plea of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span>, the EJC would no longer be applicable (“Category 2”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Mr Yew argued that the present case falls within Category 1 above and that RAS ought to be able to rely on the EJC notwithstanding that it also intends to challenge the validity of the Contract in the Suit. By contrast, counsel for ST, Mr Han Wah Teng, argued that the present case falls within Category 2 above and that the EJC ought not to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Having considered the parties’ arguments in detail, I am of the view that there may be some ambiguity as to whether the present case falls into Category 1 or Category 2 of <span class="font-italic">PT Selecta</span>. On one hand, this is not a case where there is “clearly no concluded contract at all”. It should be noted that on ST’s own case, the Contract exists and is binding on the parties. On the other hand, this is not a case where RAS is disputing the existence or validity of the agreement on the basis that contract is not validly constituted, <span class="font-italic">eg </span>due to fraud or misrepresentation. Instead, RAS is disputing whether ST is a party to the Contract.  This appears to be a situation that was not expressly considered in <span class="font-italic">PT Selecta</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the premises, I am of the view that an appeal of RA 145 would involve a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal (in this case, the Court of Appeal) would be to the public advantage. I therefore grant leave to appeal, with costs to be reserved. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">     - Sgd -<br/>Choo Han Teck <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kyle Yew Chang Mao and Vanathi Eliora Ray (Joseph Lopez LLP) for the applicant;<br/>Han Wah Teng (CTLC Law Corporation) for respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
