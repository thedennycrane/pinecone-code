Services Pte Ltd (“ATOES”) and SSH Corporation Ltd (“SSH”) (collectively “the Companies”) against the Putative Defendants for “breaches of fiduciary and directors’ duties” owed to the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief background of the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff is a 44.65% shareholder of KS Distribution, which is a joint venture company set up by the Plaintiff and another company known as KS Energy Ltd (“KS Energy”). Both the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants are, in among other capacities, KS Energy’s nominee directors in KS Distribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 According to the Plaintiff, ATOES and SSH are companies which are effectively wholly owned by KS Distribution. It has also been alleged by the Plaintiff in its supporting affidavit filed under OS 788/2016 that (a) both the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants are the <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> directors of ATOES, (b) the 1st Putative Defendant is a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director of SSH, and (c) the 2nd Putative Defendant is a director of SSH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Very broadly as can be gleaned from its supporting affidavit filed under OS 788/2016, the Plaintiff appears to be contending, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that KS Distribution, ATOES and SSH have, under the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants’ management and control, been entering into undeclared and illegitimate “related party transactions” with entities related to the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants. In this regard, the Plaintiff alleges that its contentions are backed by a public accountant’s preliminary report issued on 15 July 2016 (“KordaMentha Preliminary Report”) and which “reveals numerous breaches of fiduciary duties” by the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In OS 788/2016, the Plaintiff thus seeks, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, leave to commence an action against the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants under section 216A of the Act, the material parts of which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Derivative or representative actions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">216A.</span>—(1) In this section and section 216B —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“complainant” means —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) any member of a company;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the Minister, in the case of a declared company under Part IX; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) any other person who, in the discretion of the Court, is a proper person to make an application under this section.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to subsection (3), a complainant may apply to the Court for leave to bring an action or arbitration in the name and on behalf of the company or intervene in an action or arbitration to which the company is a party for the purpose of prosecuting, defending or discontinuing the action or arbitration on behalf of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) No action or arbitration may be brought and no intervention in an action or arbitration may be made under subsection (2) unless the Court is satisfied that —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the complainant has given 14 days’ notice to the directors of the company of his intention to apply to the Court under subsection (2) if the directors of the company do not bring, diligently prosecute or defend or discontinue the action or arbitration;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) the complainant is acting in good faith; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) it appears to be prima facie in the interests of the company that the action or arbitration be brought, prosecuted, defended or discontinued.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 For completeness, it should be mentioned that, as at the date of this judgment, OS 788/2016 is still pending fixing before a High Court Judge for determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments in the Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As mentioned earlier, the Application before me relates to the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants seeking leave to intervene in OS 788/2016. In their affidavits filed in support of the Application, the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants argue, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that they “should be given a timeous opportunity to respond to the Plaintiff’s allegations” against them, and that denying them an opportunity to respond to those allegations at this juncture would be unfair and prejudicial to them. In particular, they highlighted that the intended purpose of their intervention at this stage of the proceedings is so that they could adduce evidence in OS 788/2016 to demonstrate the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that many of the Plaintiff’s allegations against the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants, including allegations arising from the KordaMentha Preliminary Report, are baseless and unsustainable;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that it is plainly not in the interest of KS Distribution, ATOES and SSH to commence the Plaintiff’s intended action against the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants, not least because OS 788/2016 has prayed, among other things, for an order that the Companies “pay the legal fees and disbursements incurred by the Plaintiff in connection with the [proposed actions] on an indemnity basis” ; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the Plaintiff’s application in OS 788/2016 is not taken out in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In submissions, counsel for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants put forth several legal arguments which may be broadly summarised into the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Application is taken out pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) where the applicable test, as elucidated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council </span>[2016] 1 SLR 915 (“<span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span>”), is that of (i) the question or issue between one of the parties and the proposed intervener must be linked, factually or otherwise, to the relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter, and (ii) it would be “just and convenient” to permit an intervention;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there is a preponderance of past High Court decisions demonstrating the readiness of the High Court in allowing putative defendants to intervene or appear in applications taken out pursuant to section 216A of the Act. Several decisions of High Court Judges were cited by counsel in this regard: see <span class="font-italic">Chan Tong Fan and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Chiam Heng Luan Realty Pte Ltd (Chiam Toon Tau and another, non-parties) </span>[2013] SGHC 192 at [17], <span class="font-italic">Chan Tong Fan v Sloan Court Hotel Pte Ltd (</span><span class="font-italic">Chiam Toon Tau and another, non-parties) </span>[2013] SGHC 193 at [9], <span class="font-italic">Tak</span><span class="font-italic"> Chuen v Eden Aesthetics Pte Ltd and another (Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and another, non-parties) </span>[2010] 2 SLR 667 at [8], <span class="font-italic">Law Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Eng and Another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd (Lau Chin Hu and others, applicants) </span>[2009] SGHC 223 at [6], and <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Hian Chor v Steel Forming &amp; Rolling Specialists Pte Ltd and another </span>[2012] SGHC 10 at [11].  (At this juncture, I should also mention that counsel also cited the cases of <span class="font-italic">Fong </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2011] 3 SLR 980, <span class="font-italic">Kwee</span><span class="font-italic"> Lee Fung Ivon v Gordon Lim Clinic Pte Ltd and another </span>[2013] SGHC 65, <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Eder v Wee Kim Chwee and others </span>[2014] 2 SLR 56, <span class="font-italic">Wong Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Vui Willie v Li Qingyun and another </span>[2015] 1 SLR 696 and <span class="font-italic">Yeo Sing San v </span><span class="font-italic">Sanmugam Murali and another </span>[2016] SGHC 14 for support in this regard. However, these latter cases do not, in my view, give much mileage to counsel because in all those cases, the directors in question were right from the outset already joined by the plaintiffs as co-defendants with the companies involved when applications under section 216A of the Act were taken out); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) although an Assistant Registrar (“AR”) is not bound by decisions of High Court Judges, an AR should not depart from such decisions unless there are strong and compelling reasons for the AR to do so; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) in any event, this court should alternatively allow the Application under O 92 r 4 of the ROC in the exercise of its inherent powers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On the other hand, the key legal arguments advanced by counsel for the Plaintiff can be broadly summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the proper test to be applied in respect of O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC is that of whether the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants are  “necessary” or “proper” parties to the proceedings in OS 788/2016, as supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 and the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon v Tan Swat Ping and others </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 881;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the framework and rationale underpinning section 216A of the Act would be undermined if the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants were to be allowed to intervene at the leave stage and make the hearing of OS 788/2016 a rehearsal of their arguments in opposition to the proposed substantive derivative action;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the string of High Court decisions relied upon by the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants do not demonstrate any reasoning or grounds as to why leave allowing putative defendants to intervene or appear in applications taken out pursuant to section 216A of the Act were granted in those instances. There is therefore no <span class="font-italic">ratio </span><span class="font-italic">decidendi</span> of any past High Court judgments which compels this court to grant leave allowing the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants to intervene in OS 788/2016. In any case, as a matter of principle, an AR is not bound by decisions of High Court Judges; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) in any event, this court should not allow the Application on the alternative basis of O 92 r 4 of the ROC given that the touchstone of “need” has not been met on the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Primary issues of law to be determined in the Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Given the parties’ legal arguments above, the primary issues of law for determination in the Application are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What precedential status, if any, should be accorded by an AR to decisions of High Court Judges in respect of a matter to be determined by the AR? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) What is the appropriate test to be applied under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I will address these issues of law in the paragraphs that follow before applying the principles arrived at to the facts of the Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Precedential status to be accorded by an AR to decisions of High Court Judges</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On this first issue, a recent decision comes to mind. In <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chun v Sng Jin Chye and another </span>[2016] SGHCR 4 at [10]-[11] (“<span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chun</span>”), an AR essentially made two observations in the course of his decision as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) ARs are not bound by decisions of High Court Judges<span class="font-italic"> </span>given that the doctrine of horizontal <span class="font-italic">stare </span><span class="font-italic">decisis </span>does not prevail in Singapore and given that O 32 r 9 of the ROC confers on ARs the same powers and jurisdiction that a Judge in chambers can exercise; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) even if ARs are generally considered to be bound by decisions of High Court Judges, an AR is not bound to follow a decision of a High Court Judge where another conflicting decision of another High Court Judge exists.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 For the record, I should mention that counsel for the Plaintiff as well as counsel for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants have before me expressed no qualms with the correctness of these observations – particularly the first – made in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chin</span> (see [9(c)] and [10(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 With the greatest of respect, this court is unable to agree with the first observation as a matter of principle. First, while it is true that the doctrine of horizontal <span class="font-italic">stare </span><span class="font-italic">decisis</span> does not prevail in Singapore, this proposition was articulated only in the context of decisions made by High Court <span class="font-italic">Judges</span> (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Shadrake Alan </span>[2010] SGHC 327 at [4], cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chin </span>at [11]). Nothing in the case authorities cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chin </span>at [11] dealt specifically with the proper treatment to be given by <span class="font-italic">ARs</span> to decisions made by High Court Judges. Indeed, the only other case authority cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chin </span>at [11] (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Chee Soon Juan </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 650 at [12]) was concerned with a wholly distinct question, namely whether an AR sitting in chambers is equivalent to being a “court” in reference to which contempt <span class="font-italic">in facie curi</span><span class="font-italic">ae</span> proceedings can be taken out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Second, an important distinction must be drawn between powers, authority and jurisdiction of ARs on the one hand, and the principle of judicial hierarchy that ARs ought to abide by in the discharge of their judicial functions on the other hand. The legislative authorities cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Yat Chin </span>at [11] (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, section 62 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and O 32 r 9 of the ROC) deal eminently with the former. With regard to the latter, the High Court’s decision of <span class="font-italic">Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 685 (“<span class="font-italic">Herbs and </span><span class="font-italic">Spices</span>”) is instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In <span class="font-italic">Herbs and Spices</span>, the High Court had to deal with the question of judicial hierarchy between district judges and deputy registrars at the District Court. Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) in resolving the question made the following pertinent remarks in his decision (at [11]-[12]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">11 The nature of the jurisdiction of the district judge in hearing appeals from the registrar under O 55 is not the same as that in an appeal from the District Court to the High Court or from the High Court to the Court of Appeal. <span class="font-italic">Order 55 merely gives effect to the internal organisation of judicial work whereby the Senior District Judge in permitting the registrar to exercise the jurisdiction and powers of the District Court reserves to the district judges the power to hear “appeals” from the registrar.</span> <span class="font-italic">It is, in substance, a form of confirmatory jurisdiction.</span> In theory, the Senior District Judge has allowed the jurisdiction and powers of the District Court to be exercised in two stages, one at the level of the registrar and the other at the level of the district judge. Section 69 of Cap 321 read with O 55 appears to permit this bifurcation. In principle, there is nothing wrong with this scheme so long as it is not treated as two separate and distinct jurisdictions. This means that there can be an appeal from the registrar direct to the High Court (as in O 14 r 12) or from the registrar to the district judge (as in O 55) and then to the High Court. Both arrangements are consistent with the principle that the jurisdiction and powers of the District Court are the same whether they are exercised by the district judge or the registrar as a substitute for the district judge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 <span class="font-italic">The situation in O 55 is analogous to “appeals” from the decisions of the Registrar of the High Court to the judge-in-chambers.</span> <span class="font-italic">In such appeals, the judge-in-chambers is not exercising “appellate” jurisdiction in the same sense when it [he] hears appeals from the District Court.</span> <span class="font-italic">This view is consistent with the rule that an appeal from the Registrar of the High Court to the judge-in-chambers is by way of an actual rehearing of the application and the judge treats the matter afresh as though it came before him the first time, and the practice of allowing fresh affidavit evidence in such appeals</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The key fundamental proposition that can be drawn from <span class="font-italic">Herbs and Spices</span> is this: High Court Judges enjoy in substance a “confirmatory jurisdiction” over the Registrar of the High Court and, by extension, ARs. The corollary to this is ARs, whilst as a matter of “internal organisation of judicial work” are conferred with powers, authority and jurisdiction to carry out certain judicial functions on behalf of High Court Judges, are necessarily obliged in the discharge of such functions not to overreach the very premise upon which such powers, authority and jurisdiction are derived. In a functional and hierarchically organised judicial system such as ours, a judicial officer such as an AR simply has no option in his or her administration of justice to freely disregard judicial precedents established by those to whose functions he or she is juridically ancillary. That, in my view, is and remains to be a rule of judicial hierarchy that is of key fundamental importance to our system at the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 That is, however, not to say that there are absolutely no permissible exceptions to the rule just described above. In a rare situation, for example, where conflicting decisions of High Court Judges exist, it would in my opinion stand to good reason that an AR may not find himself or herself necessarily bound to follow any one or another decision which is in conflict. Another rare but conceivable situation, just for illustration purposes, could be where a decision of a High Court Judge, although not having been expressly overruled, is directly and patently contradicted by an existing decision of the Court of Appeal, to such extent that the only irresistible conclusion to be drawn by the AR is that the decision of the High Court Judge cannot be considered to be the prevailing law of the land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 At risk of stating the obvious, it would also follow from the foregoing analysis that ARs are not bound by decisions of fellow ARs, given that ARs are not juridical ancillaries of each other. Neither should anything in the foregoing analysis be taken to mean that judicial decisions of ARs may thus be freely disregarded by litigants and counsel, or tribunals and any other court that are obliged to follow decisions emanating from the High Court. In my opinion, a judicial decision of an AR, unless and until overruled by a High Court Judge (or any person qualified under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) to discharge the functions of a High Court Judge), must certainly stand as a good and binding decision of the High Court. Otherwise, the clear legislative premise upon which ARs are conferred the powers, authority and jurisdiction to carry out certain judicial functions on behalf of High Court Judges would be gravely undermined. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate test under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I come now to the second issue of law in the Application. For completeness, O 15 r 6(2) of the ROC is reproduced herein below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties (O. 15, r. 6)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>—(1) […]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to the provisions of this Rule, at any stage of the proceedings in any cause or matter, the Court may, on such terms as it thinks just and either of its own motion or on application —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) order any person who has been improperly or unnecessarily made a party or who has for any reason ceased to be a proper or necessary party, to cease to be a party; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) order any of the following persons to be added as a party, namely:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is <span class="font-italic">necessary</span> to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">  (ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be <span class="font-italic">just and convenient</span> to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my judgment, I fail to see how the Plaintiff’s contention that the test to be applied under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC is that of whether the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants are  “necessary” or “proper” parties to the proceedings in OS 788/2016 (see [10(a)] above) is supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony</span>, two solicitors had sought leave to intervene in a court application taken out by a complainant who was dissatisfied with a decision of the Council of the Law Society that no case existed for an investigation to be taken out under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) by a Disciplinary Committee against the two solicitors. In reversing the High Court’s decision allowing the intervention, the Court of Appeal held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that O 15 rr 6(2)(b)(i) and (ii) were inapplicable. Nowhere in the dispositive paragraphs of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in this regard (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [17]-[19]) did the Court of Appeal suggest that the express term “just and convenient” found in O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) should be given any stricter or more onerous meaning than what a plain and ordinary reading would suggest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is further noted that the Plaintiff has also cited the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon v Tan Swat Ping and others </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 881 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon</span>”) to support the same argument that the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants must be shown to be “necessary” or “proper” parties to the proceedings in OS 788/2016 before leave to intervene may be granted pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon</span>, the High Court had to deal with a question relating to O 15 r 6(2)(a) which arose from a striking out application. To put it simply, the 2nd to 5th defendants in that case had argued, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the plaintiff’s claim against them ought to be struck out entirely for the reason that they were in the circumstances of the case neither “necessary” nor “proper” parties under O 15 r 6(2)(a) of the ROC. Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in his decision made the following useful observations (at [49]-[51]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 In my view, having regard to the objects of O 15 r 6, r 6(2)(a):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) should be construed in the light of r 6(2)(b) especially since the terms “proper” and “necessary” are not defined and the two provisions stand metaphorically on either side of the one door in the sense that one governs entry into the proceedings, while the other governs exit; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) should not be construed in a way that treats the words “proper” and “necessary” as two disjunctive concepts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Elaborating on the first point, <span class="font-italic">the terms “proper” and “necessary” are not defined.</span> However, the overall scheme of O 15 r 6 is to enable the court in its discretion to make such order as would ensure that parties who are necessary or proper<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">(presumably even if they are not strictly necessary)</span> are before it. Rule 6(2)(b) identifies the parties who could be ordered to be added as parties and it seems reasonable to infer that such parties at least would fall within the ambit of those <span class="font-italic">considered</span> necessary or proper to be parties to the action. <span class="font-italic">I note that r 6(2)(b) is itself broken into two limbs. The first limb repeats the terms of the former r 6(2)(b) but the second limb, </span>ie<span class="font-italic">, r 6(2)(b)(ii) has been held in </span>Tetra Molectric Limited v Japan Imports Limited<span class="font-italic"> [1976] RPC 541 at 544 to have widened the court’s discretion to join parties to an action “to a great extent”</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 <span class="font-italic">It would seem logical in my view to hold that a party who could be joined including under the wider r 6(2)(b)(ii) should be </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">considered</span><span class="font-italic"> a “necessary” or “proper” party to the action </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">and hence not liable to an order of cessation under r 6(2)(a)</span><span class="font-italic">. A broad correspondence between the scope and ambit of r 6(2)(a) on the one hand and r 6(2)(b) on the other is to be expected since otherwise, one would encounter a situation of an unwilling party being joined under the latter rule and then applying to be released under the former. The notion that the Rule should be </span><span class="font-italic">construed in a way that conjures the image of a revolving door spinning somewhat out of control is not one to which I am drawn</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[all emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 At [53] and [58], His Honour further held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that “[i]t is plain that an applicant seeking to have a party joined needs only to come within any one of the categories identified in r 6(2)(b) to warrant invoking the court’s consideration […] [i]t would be illogical to hold for instance that a party joined as a proper party could apply to be released on the ground that he was not a necessary party for some reason”, and that “the court’s power under O 15 r 6(2) <span class="font-italic">to bring and keep</span> the appropriate parties before it is broad indeed” (emphasis in original).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Evidently, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon</span> clearly espoused the proposition that the question of whether to allow the joining of a party under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC is a matter for the court’s discretion, which is a relatively wide and broad one. And once a party has come within the category of O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, once the party has been determined to qualify as “any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter”), such party should thereby be joined and be <span class="font-italic">considered</span> – for the purposes of O 15 r 6(2)(a) – to be a “necessary” or “proper” party to the proceedings, so much so that he or she could not later be simply removed from the same proceedings on the ground that he or she was not a necessary party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 This reading of <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon </span>is consistent with the primary case authority relied upon by the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants, namely <span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC </span>(see [9(a)] above). In <span class="font-italic">AG v AHPETC</span>, the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) had sought to be joined as a party to proceedings relating to an ongoing dispute relating to certain management affairs of the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council. In granting HDB’s application pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC, the Court of Appeal held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the following (at [39]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 As mentioned earlier, the HDB also relied on the inherent powers of the court in seeking to be joined as a party. However, there is no need for us to consider whether the court’s inherent powers should be invoked because we consider that the HDB can be joined as a party under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC. <span class="font-italic">An applicant relying on that provision would have to first establish that the question or issue between one of the parties and the proposed new party is linked, factually or otherwise, to the relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng-Eu Judy v RSP Investments (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 525 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng-Eu Judy</span>”) at [13]). As to this, it is difficult to argue otherwise. The claims arise out of the same set of facts and the reliefs sought by the new party, the HDB, against AHPETC are substantially the same as those sought by the MND. <span class="font-italic">However, that is not the end of the matter because this is subject to the overriding consideration that it must be “just and convenient” to order a joinder</span> (<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng-Eu Judy</span> at [13]). This requires the court to take into account the interests of the existing parties to the action (<span class="font-italic">Chan Kern </span><span class="font-italic">Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 85 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Kern </span><span class="font-italic">Miang</span>”) at [24]) as well as that of the party to be joined (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yow </span><span class="font-italic">Kon v Tan Swat Ping </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 881 at [44(a)]; <span class="font-italic">Alliance Entertainment Singapore Pte Ltd v Sim Kay Teck </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 869 at [67]). The lateness of the application would go towards the assessment of whether it is “just and convenient” to order a joinder (<span class="font-italic">Chan Kern </span><span class="font-italic">Miang </span>at [23]-[29]). [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In sum, I am satisfied on the authorities considered above that the appropriate test to be applied for the purposes of O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) is that put forth by counsel for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants, namely (i) the question or issue between one of the parties and the proposed intervener must be linked, factually or otherwise, to the relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter, and (ii) it would be “just and convenient” to permit an intervention (see also [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of principles to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As mentioned earlier, counsel for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants rely on several past decisions of High Court Judges in support of the Application (see [9(b)] above). In this regard, counsel for the Plaintiff’s response is, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that these decisions do not evince any reasoning or grounds for allowing the putative defendants to intervene in those cases, and accordingly there is effectively no <span class="font-italic">ratio </span><span class="font-italic">decidendi</span> to compel this court to necessarily determine the Application in favour of the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants (see [10(c)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The fact of the matter as I see it is as an AR sitting in chambers is that the High Court decisions cited by counsel for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants clearly demonstrate that leave allowing putative defendants to intervene or appear in applications taken out pursuant to section 216A of the Act has been readily granted by High Court Judges in no less than five reported decisions. That, to me, is a material and overwhelming factor which I cannot simply ignore in my determination of this Application. Accordingly, and in line with my analysis at [13]-[20] above, I find that the preponderance of the consistent and undisturbed precedents cited to me is sufficient to compel me to follow in the present Application what would ordinarily have been done as a matter of course by a High Court Judge if such an application for intervention were to be taken out before him or her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Even if for some reason I am mistaken in holding the view that the High Court decisions cited to me in this regard are binding enough for me to grant the Application, I would have in any event arrived independently at the same result having regard to the appropriate test under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) which I have analysed at [21]-[29] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 First, the questions or issues between the Plaintiff and the Putative Defendants are clearly and directly linked to the relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter under OS 788/2016. In OS 788/2016, the Plaintiff is seeking leave to commence statutory derivative action against the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants on personal allegations which are denied by the Putative Defendants – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>“breaches of fiduciary and directors’ duties” owed to KS Distribution, ATOES and SSH (see [2]-[5] and [8] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, it is not objectionable under the framework of section 216A of the Act for putative defendants to be allowed to resist leave applications on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, grounds relating to the legal merits of the underlying claims in the proposed statutory derivative action. As provided by section 216A(3) of the Act (see [6] above), no statutory derivative action may be brought unless the court is satisfied, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the complainant is acting in good faith; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it appears to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the interests of the company that the action be brought or prosecuted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With regard to the first limb above, the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants have clearly indicated their intention to contend that the Plaintiff’s application in OS 788/2016 is not taken out in good faith (see [8(c)] above). With regard to the second limb above, it is apposite to note that the Court of Appeal has clarified in its decision in <span class="font-italic">Ang</span><span class="font-italic"> Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor </span>[2013] 2 SLR 340 at [58] that “[t]here is a natural affinity between the interests of the company in prosecuting a statutory derivative action and the <span class="font-italic">legal merits of that action</span>, in that it cannot conceivably be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> within the interests of the company to bring an action which is wholly without any <span class="font-italic">legitimate or arguable basis</span>” (emphasis added). In the present case, the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants have also expressed their intention to challenge the personal allegations made against them as well as the costs relief sought by the Plaintiff in OS 788/2016 (see [8(a)]-[8(b)] above). These are clearly in my opinion matters what fall within the remit of considerations that the court could and would take into account in deciding the Plaintiff’s application in OS 788/2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Third and finally, it is worth mentioning that KS Distribution, ATOES and SSH have attended the hearing of the Application before me via their own independent set of solicitors, and their solicitors have put on record, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Companies’ position that the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants, as opposed to the Companies as separate legal entities, “are the ones best placed to deal with the personal allegations” raised by the Plaintiff in OS 788/2016. Considering the relatively wide and broad discretion that the court could exercise under O 15 r 6(2)(b)(ii) of the ROC (see [27] above), and having regard to the combination of all the factors mentioned above, I am of the view that it would be “just and convenient” to allow the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants to intervene in OS 788/2016 for the purposes which they have expressed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For all the foregoing reasons which I consider to be sufficiently dispositive of the Application, the following orders prayed for are made:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) leave be granted for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants to intervene in OS 788/2016; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants shall be at liberty to file affidavits in relation to OS 788/2016 and appear and be heard through counsel at the hearing of OS 788/2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As for the timelines relating to the filing of the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants’ affidavits in OS 788/2016, as well as the appointed date for the hearing of OS 788/2016, the parties are to seek the appropriate directions from the AR at the next available pre-trial conference scheduled for the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Colin Seow <br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi <span class="font-italic">SC</span>, Kelvin Koh and Niklas Wong (TSMP Law Corporation) for the Plaintiff;<br/>Mahesh Rai and Jeremy Yeap (Drew and Napier LLC) for the 1st and 2nd Putative Defendants.<br/>Bryan Tan (Advocatus Law LLP) for the Companies.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
