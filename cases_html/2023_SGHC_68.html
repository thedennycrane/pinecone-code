</div>
</div> This action therefore proceeded to trial against only the three defendants who are now named in its title. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In <span class="font-italic">KPN</span>, I held that the presumption of a resulting trust arose over the Shares in favour of the first defendant because the first defendant: (a) paid the direct consideration for the Shares; and (b) undertook and discharged the contractual obligation which had causative force in vesting the Shares in the second defendant (<span class="font-italic">KPN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [84]–[92] and [122]–[124]). I found further that this presumption stood unrebutted because there was no objective intention that anyone other than the first defendant was to have any part of the beneficial interest in the Shares (<span class="font-italic">KPN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [93]–[118]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 As a result, I held that the first defendant was the sole beneficial owner of all of the Shares. The 2015 Trust Deed was nothing more than an imperfect gift which equity would not assist the plaintiff to perfect, the plaintiff being a volunteer (<span class="font-italic">KPN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [118]). I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s action in its entirety.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Each of the defendants now seeks an order that its costs of and incidental to this action be paid by the plaintiff. Having considered the oral and written submissions from the parties on costs, I now make my orders as to costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The event</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 I begin by considering the first defendant’s claim for costs against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The starting point in exercising the discretion to award costs is ascertaining the event (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd and another</span> [2022] 5 SLR 525 (“<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>”) at [27]). The event is the outcome of the litigation overall<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[28]). If a court is minded to make any order for costs at all, its discretion ought ordinarily to be exercised to order that costs follow the event (O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court 2014”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The event in this action is undoubtedly against the plaintiff and undoubtedly in favour of the first defendant (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [28]–[29]). The first defendant is therefore <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> entitled to an order that the plaintiff pay the first defendant’s costs of and incidental to this action (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Further, the event in this action is entirely against the plaintiff and entirely in favour of the first defendant. There are therefore no grounds for ordering that the first defendant be deprived of any part of his costs, let alone for ordering the first defendant to pay any part of the plaintiff’s costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The only two questions to be determined on the first defendant’s claim for his costs are: (a) whether the first defendant’s costs should be assessed on the standard basis or the indemnity basis; and (b) the quantum of those costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Standard or indemnity basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The first defendant submits that his costs should be assessed on the indemnity basis for four reasons. First, the plaintiff commenced this action in bad faith and with an improper purpose.

</div> Although the first defendant does not elaborate on the nature of the improper purpose, I take it as a submission that the plaintiff commenced the action and advanced his claims – including both the unsustainable claims (see [4] above) <span class="font-italic">and</span> the claim on the 2015 Trust Deed – with no genuine belief that he had a plausible claim on the facts or on the law but for the improper purpose of creating a bargaining chip to secure an advantage in continued negotiations with the first defendant for the compensation the plaintiff was to receive for his contributions to the third defendant’s business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I do not accept the first defendant’s submission. All of the first defendant’s costs of and incidental to this action can be put into one of two categories: (a) the costs of and incidental to the unsustainable claims; and (b) the costs of and incidental to the claim on the 2015 Trust Deed.

</div> Those costs were sought and assessed on the standard basis. These costs were a deemed indemnity to the first defendant and Mr Gluck for each of their costs of and incidental to defending the unsustainable claims. In <span class="font-italic">Then </span><span class="font-italic">Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits </span>[2014] 1 SLR 245 at [197], I explained the indemnity principle which underlies the court’s discretion to award costs and explained, in that context, the concept of a deemed indemnity as opposed to an actual indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Having awarded the first defendant a deemed indemnity for the costs of and incidental to the unsustainable claims, I consider that it would be wrong in principle for me now to enhance the basis of assessment for the first defendant’s deemed indemnity for those costs from the standard basis to the indemnity basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 It is true that I found all of the claims that the plaintiff originally pleaded to be unsustainable, with the exception only of the claim on the 2015 Trust Deed. But when I struck out the unsustainable claims, the first defendant could have then invited me to assess the first defendant’s costs of and incidental to the unsustainable claims on the indemnity basis on the grounds that that those claims were <span class="font-italic">so</span> unsustainable that they warranted the inference that the first defendant now invites me to draw (see [16] above). He did not do so then. I consider it too late for him to do so now.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 There is, of course, no rule of law which precludes the first defendant from inviting me now to enhance the basis on which I assessed his costs of and incidental to the unsustainable claims. My interlocutory award of costs in favour of the first defendant creates no <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel of any sort which now binds the first defendant and the plaintiff, or which now constrains my discretion on costs. But I consider it wrong in principle to revisit this issue, at least in the absence of changed circumstances. And I do not consider the fact that the first defendant has succeeded entirely in this action as a relevant change of circumstances. That is because the outcome of the striking out application was, in and of itself, an event for the purposes of an award of costs. The event in this litigation overall is an entirely separate and independent event. It is a circumstance of no relevance to the event which gave rise to the earlier award of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The costs of the claim on the 2015 Trust Deed</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I now turn to the second category of the first defendant’s costs of this action (see [17] above): the costs of and incidental to the claim on the 2015 Trust Deed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Even if I were to assume, in favour of the first defendant, that the plaintiff advanced the unsustainable claims in bad faith and for an improper purpose, I do not consider that to be a proper basis from which to draw the inference that the plaintiff advanced his claim <span class="font-italic">on the 2015 Trust Deed</span> in bad faith and for an improper purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is certainly true that the abject failure of all but one claim in the plaintiff’s elaborate case to survive a striking out application could justify the inference that the first defendant invites me to draw (see [16] above) about the only claim which did survive. It is also true that that single claim is a fairly narrow and technical claim on the 2015 Trust Deed. But that claim cannot on its face be stigmatised as tenuous or contrived. It is an objectively sustainable claim, both on the facts and on the law. That is the very reason I did not strike it out and allowed it to continue to trial. I do not consider that it would be correct in principle for me to draw – from the nature or the failure of this claim – the inference that the first defendant invites me to draw about the plaintiff’s motive in bringing his claim on the 2015 Trust Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Before I leave this point, I should make clear that none of what I have said about the nature of the plaintiff’s unsustainable claims or my decision to strike them out is intended as any criticism of the plaintiff’s solicitors. I am satisfied that they conducted themselves at all times in accordance with their instructions and, more importantly, with their professional duties both under written law and at common law, in advancing his many claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Case constantly evolving</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The second reason the first defendant advances for his costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis is that the plaintiff’s case was constantly evolving.

It is not uncommon for a party to amend its pleadings before trial. It is also not uncommon for a party to do so multiple times. The fact that the plaintiff made four rounds of amendments is not a factor which is enough, either in itself or taken with the other factors that the plaintiff advances, to warrant an order that the first defendant’s costs of and incidental to this action be assessed on the indemnity basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Stop notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The third reason the first defendant advances for his costs to be assessed on the indemnity basis is that the plaintiff behaved dishonestly, abusively and improperly when he applied to have the court issue a stop notice to prevent the third defendant from registering any transfer of the Shares and from paying any dividends on the Shares while this action was pending.

The first defendant therefore invites me to exercise my discretion to fix costs without regard to Appendix G, in the particular circumstances of this case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Courts should not depart from Appendix G too readily</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I decline to exercise my discretion to depart from Appendix G. I must of course accept that Appendix G is only a guideline. Its title expressly describes it as a guideline. Its body expressly provides that it is merely “intended to provide a general indication on the quantum and methodology of party and party costs awards” in the Supreme Court. It expressly reiterates that the “fundamental governing principle is that the precise amount of costs awarded remains at the discretion of the Court” and that the court “may depart from the Costs Guidelines depending on the particular circumstances of each case”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having said that, I consider that the three salutary purposes that Appendix G serves would be undermined if the courts were, when awarding costs, to depart too readily from its guidelines. In the analysis which follows, I use the term “litigation” in the general sense to cover both an originating process or an appeal and an interlocutory application within an originating process or an appeal, all within the classes covered by Appendix G.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The first, and most valuable, purpose that Appendix G serves is to assist the court at the conclusion of litigation in fixing the quantum of costs that the paying party must pay to the receiving party. Appendix G enables the courts to achieve a degree of consistency in fixing this deemed indemnity, thereby ensuring that like cases are treated alike when it comes to the award of costs, in so far as that is possible in a matter that is ultimately within the discretion of the court. By making it easier in this way for the court to award fixed costs, Appendix G also allows litigants to avoid the time and expense of taxation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second purpose that Appendix G serves is perhaps less obvious but equally valuable. It serves this purpose even before litigation is commenced and continues to serve it all the while litigation is pending. Appendix G allows solicitors to advise clients with a degree of certainty what their likely costs exposure or costs recovery will be in the litigation as between party and party, however the litigation may ultimately be resolved, whether by adjudication, by compromise or by capitulation. In this way, Appendix G sets litigants’ expectations as to costs, both on the downside and the upside, and both at the outset of litigation and as litigation continues. These expectations form a critical part of the continuous cost-benefit analysis which every litigant must bear in mind. Defeating these expectations too readily is undesirable from the litigant’s perspective.  This is of particular importance to litigants who are individuals, as they are typically more risk averse in litigation than commercial parties. In that sense, upholding the expectations as to costs set by Appendix G also has implications for access to justice (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals </span>[2015] 1 SLR 496 at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Defeating litigants’ expectations as to costs too readily is also undesirable from the systemic perspective. No system of civil justice has the resources to resolve by adjudication all of the litigation that is initiated before it. Encouraging litigants to resolve their litigation otherwise than by adjudication is therefore an essential aspect of any system of civil justice. But litigants bargain towards a resolution of their litigation in the shadow of the law, both substantive and procedural. Upholding expectations set by Appendix G provides the degree of certainty necessary on the issue of costs for litigants to bargain with confidence towards a resolution of their litigation otherwise than by adjudication.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The third purpose that Appendix G serves is to set a marker for legal fees as between solicitor and client, however faint that marker might be. It is true that paragraph 3 of Appendix G expressly provides that nothing in Appendix G is intended to guide or influence the charging of fees payable to a solicitor by his own client. That must undoubtedly be the case. Fees as between solicitor and client are a matter of contract. This is subject, obviously and always, to the legal and ethical constraints found in the Legal Profession Act 1996 (2020 Rev Ed), in its subordinate legislation and in the written law and the common law of legal professional ethics. This is also subject to the Supreme Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Syn Kok Kay </span>[2023] SGHC 7 at [21]–[24]). Subject to these constraints, and in particular to the very important constraint imposed by r 17(7) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015, there is nothing to prevent a client from agreeing by contract to pay his solicitor a fee which is 30% above the guidelines in Appendix G or 300% above those guidelines. There is nevertheless a clear connection between the guidelines in Appendix G and the fees agreed between solicitor and client. Appendix G is a guideline for fixing the quantum of the policy-based deemed indemnity which the receiving party can recover against the fees it has agreed to pay its own solicitor. Appendix G therefore lays down a marker of reasonableness – a marker which is deliberate, even if it is deliberately indirect and deliberately diffident – for the contractual bargains on fees that solicitors as a class reach with clients as a class.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Each of these three purposes is undermined if the courts, having set expectations as to party and party costs <span class="font-italic">ex ante</span> through the publication of Appendix G, defeats those expectations <span class="font-italic">ex post</span> by departing from its guidelines too readily.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) This is not an appropriate case to depart from Appendix G</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Bearing the foregoing analysis in mind, I do not consider that this is an appropriate case to depart from Appendix G. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, the grounds which the first defendant advances in support of his submission that I should exercise my discretion to depart from Appendix G in the particular circumstances of this case are the very same grounds he advances in support of his submission that I should assess his costs on the indemnity basis. It is undoubtedly true that my discretion to assess costs, even on the standard basis, allows me to take into account the conduct of the parties. But I have already explained why I do not accept that the grounds on which the first defendant relies are a valid basis on which to assess his costs on the indemnity basis. For those same reasons, I do not accept that those grounds are a valid basis on which to depart from Appendix G when assessing his costs on the standard basis. In short, the grounds on which he relies have already been taken into account in my previous awards of fixed costs and are either not sufficiently related to his conduct in relation to the single claim which went to trial in this action or arose in separate proceedings for which the first defendant retains a separate right of recourse in those proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, it appears to me that the basis for a departure from Appendix G must be, broadly speaking, related primarily to the inherent factual or legal complexity of the litigation itself and the inadequacy of the guidelines in Appendix G, in all the circumstances of the case, to yield a figure as a deemed indemnity that is an appropriate marker for the fee that a reasonable litigant in the receiving party’s position would reasonably have agreed to pay his own solicitor. That is quite different from the basis on which an award of indemnity costs is, broadly speaking, made. That basis is related primarily to the unreasonable conduct of the paying party in the litigation. The particular circumstances of a case justifying a departure from the guidelines in Appendix G can, no doubt, include the conduct of the paying party in the litigation. But it appears to me that it will be rare for a paying party’s conduct in the litigation not to warrant a departure from the general rule that costs are to follow the event (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [40]–[51]), or not to warrant an award of indemnity costs but nevertheless to warrant a departure from the guidelines in Appendix G.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Third, the first defendant does not submit that there is any feature related to the factual or legal complexity of this litigation that takes it beyond the general run of equity and trusts cases catered for by the guidelines for this class of case in Appendix G. In so far as litigation involving equity and trusts is more factually and legally complex than litigation in other areas of law, Appendix G has already taken that into account in setting the guidelines for pre-trial, trial and post-trial work in this class of case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I therefore turn to consider what quantum of costs the first defendant should be awarded on the standard basis upon an application of the guidelines in Appendix G for an equity and trusts case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Application of Appendix G</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The plaintiff submits that the first defendant should be awarded costs of $245,000 under Appendix G, calculated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $80,000 for pre-trial costs. The plaintiff arrives at this figure by taking as his starting point the figure of $90,000 which the first defendant has claimed in his costs schedule and discounting it by $10,000.

Given that I awarded Mr Gluck $20,000 as his costs of this action upon the discontinuance, the plaintiff’s case is that half of this award of costs should be attributed to pre-trial work done for the first defendant up to that point.

Implicit in the first element is the condition precedent that it was the receiving party himself – and not a third party – who has actually incurred the item of costs.

</div> Third, Mr Baldock’s fee is reasonable in amount.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The first defendant incurred Mr Baldock’s fee</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I accept that the first defendant has incurred Mr Baldock’s fee. It must, of course, be true that a receiving party who has not incurred a liability for an item of costs cannot recover that item from a paying party. But if an item of costs has, on its face, been incurred by a third party – in the sense that it is a third party and not the receiving party who has actually paid or who is under a contractual obligation to pay that item of costs – that is not the end of the analysis. That item may still be treated as having been incurred by the receiving party for the purposes of costs recovery as between party and party if the receiving party can show either that: (a) the receiving party has in fact reimbursed the third party who incurred that item of costs; or (b) the receiving party is either under an obligation or is prepared to undertake an obligation, contractual or otherwise, to reimburse the third party for that item of costs. In both cases, of course, the receiving party must act or have acted reasonably.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Of course, it is also possible for a receiving party who has, on its face, incurred a liability to a supplier of goods or services for an item of costs <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be entitled to recover that sum as a disbursement from a paying party, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> because the supplier has released the receiving party from all or part of the liability. I need say no more about that situation simply because it does not arise in the case before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In this case, Mr Baldock’s fee was invoiced to the third defendant, not to the first defendant. In a letter to the court dated 20 February 2023, the first defendant’s solicitors assert as a fact, on instructions, that the first defendant has in fact borne Mr Baldock’s fee.

</div> But this assertion and the first defendant’s instructions are not evidence. Furthermore, this assertion is entirely unsupported. The first defendant has produced no evidence, documentary or otherwise, showing that the first defendant has paid Mr Baldock his fee or has either reimbursed or undertaken to reimburse the third defendant for paying Mr Baldock’s fee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This evidential gap is not, however, fatal to the first defendant’s claim. Even if I were to assume in the plaintiff’s favour that it was the third defendant who entered into the contract with Mr Baldock under which he issued his invoice and that it is the third defendant who has incurred Mr Baldock’s fee, I am satisfied that the first defendant is under an obligation to reimburse the third defendant for Mr Baldock’s fee. That is because the plaintiff made no claim whatsoever against the third defendant in this action, both before and after I struck out the unsustainable claims. The third defendant therefore never had any exposure whatsoever in this action. It is for that reason that the third defendant did not participate substantively in this action and did not appear at trial. Its position was simply that it would abide by any order the court may make in respect of the Shares, subject to being heard on costs.

I therefore asked counsel for the first defendant in the course of oral submissions whether the first defendant was prepared to give a formal undertaking to the court that, upon recovering a sum referable to Mr Baldock’s fee from the plaintiff under an order for costs in this action and if the first defendant has not by that time already done one or the other of the following, the first defendant will either pay that sum to Mr Baldock against his fee or to the third defendant by way of reimbursement for having paid Mr Baldock his fee, whichever may be applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Following the hearing, the first defendant has given the undertaking I sought.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The rule that a witness giving evidence under subpoena is entitled to be reimbursed only for his costs of attendance is not a rule which applies to limit the recovery of an item of costs as between party and party. The rule merely serves to give a witness who is required by a subpoena to attend trial and give evidence a legal excuse for failing to comply with the subpoena.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The rule which applies to the recovery of an item of costs as between party and party is the usual rule: it is recoverable if it was reasonably incurred and is reasonable in amount. That is precisely the principle which Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) applied in <span class="font-italic">Mero Asia Pacific</span>. That case stands for the proposition that a receiving party who pays or agrees to pay a sum equal to the opportunity cost incurred by a witness of fact called by the receiving party in giving evidence may in principle recover that sum from a paying party under an order for costs. Of course, the receiving party must also establish that that opportunity cost is one which the <span class="font-italic">receiving party</span> has incurred (see [66] and [70] above) and is not merely one which the <span class="font-italic">witness</span> has incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I also do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that a witness giving evidence voluntarily should be in no better position than a witness giving evidence under a subpoena. A witness under subpoena is subject to a statutory obligation to give evidence. As such, the witness has no basis to bargain with the receiving party as to the conditions, financial or otherwise, on which he will give the evidence. He is bound by law to give evidence upon a tender of the expenses of attendance in order to do so. His opportunity cost of attending as a witness will not be the subject matter of a contract which can then be an item of costs to be recovered as between party and party. In contrast, a witness who gives evidence voluntarily is under no obligation whatsoever to give evidence. He therefore has every opportunity to bargain with the receiving party as to the conditions, financial and otherwise, on which he will give evidence. If the receiving party enters into a contract with the witness to compensate him for his opportunity cost of giving evidence and acts reasonably by doing so, the sum payable under the contract will be recoverable in principle from the paying party as an item of costs as between party and party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Of course, it is also possible for a witness under subpoena to have an opportunity to bargain as to the conditions on which he will give evidence and to have a degree of bargaining power in doing so. That could happen, for example, if the witness can give evidence on a critical issue of fact and is in fact giving evidence voluntarily but cannot be seen to be doing so for one or other reason. Even in that case, therefore, if the receiving party enters into a contract with the witness and acts reasonably by doing so, the sum payable under the contract will be recoverable in principle from the paying party as an item of costs as between party and party. That is so no matter what the procedural rules may say about the circumstances in which that witness could have been excused from liability for failing to comply with the subpoena.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Mr Baldock is a professional. His fee-earning time is money. I am therefore satisfied that he suffered an opportunity cost by having to set aside fee-earning time to give evidence at trial and that his invoice reflects that opportunity cost. I also consider it reasonable for the first defendant to have incurred Mr Baldock’s fee either by reimbursing the third defendant for it or by undertaking now to reimburse the third defendant for it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I therefore accept that the first defendant can recover Mr Baldock’s fee in principle as between party and party. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The first defendant has failed to prove that Mr Baldock’s fee is reasonable in amount</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I accept the plaintiff’s submission hat the first defendant has failed to discharge his burden of proving that Mr Baldock’s fee is reasonable in amount. As I am assessing the first defendant’s costs on the standard basis, he bears the burden of proving that Mr Baldock’s fee is reasonable in amount. But the first defendant has not provided me with any material by which to assess the reasonableness of Mr Baldock’s fee. The only evidence before me is Mr Baldock’s invoice. His invoice contains no narrative. It simply invoices the third defendant £55,000 for “[a]ll attendances in relation to claim HC/S 663/2020”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 No question arises as to who incurred both of Mr Jordan’s fees, as his firm invoiced the first defendant personally for the fees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Preparing affidavits of evidence in chief</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I do not accept the plaintiff’s objection to the first of Mr Jordan’s fees: the work done in connection with preparing affidavits of evidence in chief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 As authority for his objection, the plaintiff relies on the English case of <span class="font-italic">Meretz Investments NV and another v ACP Ltd and others</span> [2007] EWHC 2635 (Ch). That case arose from a property transaction which turned into litigation. The defendants succeeded at trial. They were represented by the same firm of solicitors in both the transaction and in the litigation. A conveyancing partner in that firm, one Mr Hawkins, was a material witness of fact for the defence at trial. The defendants sought to recover as between party and party the time cost incurred by Mr Hawkins under three heads: (a) assistance and general preparation of the defendants’ case as a solicitor; (b) producing his witness statement; and (c) time reasonably spent at court and travelling to and from court to give evidence (at [19] and [38]). Warren J held that Mr Hawkins’ time cost under heads (a) and (c) were in principle recoverable. As for head (b), Warren J held (at [39]) that the opportunity cost which an ordinary witness of fact suffers in producing for a party’s lawyers the material for them to draft his own witness statement, including the time the witness spends being interviewed or being proofed by the lawyers, is not in principle recoverable as between party and party. The same principle applies, he held, even if the witness is a solicitor and even if the solicitor drafts his own witness statement (at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In my view, this principle is too broadly stated to be of universal application. When costs are awarded as between party and party, the only principle of universal application is reasonableness. Whether it was reasonable for a receiving party to incur a particular disbursement is a fact-sensitive inquiry. Whether a disbursement of this type is recoverable in principle will depend on the circumstances in which the witness suffered the opportunity cost, the nature of the opportunity cost and the circumstances in which the party accepted an obligation to compensate the witness for the opportunity cost. In theory at least, where the witness happens to be a solicitor, there may in fact be a significant saving of costs in having the solicitor (rather than the lawyers in the litigation team) prepare the first draft of his own witness statement or affidavit of evidence in chief. That course would have the added, albeit incidental, benefit of ensuring that the evidence is expressed in the witness’s own words. That is the ideal but is rarely the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On the facts of this case, I accept that it was reasonable for Mr Jordan to prepare his own affidavit of evidence in chief. I therefore hold that the first defendant is entitled in principle to recover the first of Mr Jordan’s two fees from the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Attendance at trial</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As in Mr Baldock’s case, I do not accept the plaintiff’s objection to the second of Mr Jordan’s two fees: for attendance in relation to the trial. I reject this objection for the reasons I have already given when rejecting this objection to Mr Baldock’s fee: the objection is not well-founded in law (see [78]–[81] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff, quite rightly, does not submit that Mr Jordan’s second fee was unreasonably incurred. He was a material witness of fact (<span class="font-italic">KPN</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [14], [96]–[105] and [108]). I also accept that Mr Jordan, like Mr Baldock, is a professional. His fee-earning time is equally money. I am therefore satisfied that Mr Jordan suffered an opportunity cost by having to set aside fee-earning time to give evidence at trial. I am also satisfied that his invoice for his second fee reflects that opportunity cost. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I therefore hold that the first defendant is entitled in principle to recover the second of Mr Jordan’s two fees from the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The first defendant has failed to prove that Mr Jordan’s fees are reasonable in amount</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As with Mr Baldock, the first defendant bears the burden of proving that Mr Jordan’s fees are reasonable in amount.

They simply invoice the first defendant for “[p]rofessional charges in acting for and advising [the first defendant] on the above matter as detailed in the attached diary narrative”.

</div> The diary narrative attached to the invoices have not been made available to me. No doubt, that is because they contain material subject to legal professional privilege. It appears that Mr Jordan has charged his fees as time cost. But as with Mr Baldock, I do not know how much time Mr Jordan spent. I do not know what work he spent that time on. I do not know what hourly rate he has applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The first defendant has therefore failed to discharge his burden of proving that Mr Jordan’s fees are reasonable in amount. It would be wholly disproportionate, however, to disallow Mr Jordan’s fee in its entirety, particularly given my finding about that Mr Jordan was a material witness (see [97] above) and that it was reasonable for the first defendant to have incurred his fees (see [92]–[98] above). Instead, I prefer to assess what is a reasonable amount for Mr Jordan’s fees on a broad-brush approach. On that broad-brush approach, I allow only two-third of Mr Jordan’s fees <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $26,816 as the sum recoverable for that fee as between party and party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I therefore hold that the first defendant is entitled to recover from the plaintiff the sum of $26,816 as a deemed indemnity for Mr Jordan’s fees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The first defendant’s travel expenses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The first defendant claims $21,348 for his travel expenses to and from Singapore for the trial of this action.

Although the trial of this action took only 7½ days of court time, those 7½ days were spread over almost two calendar weeks from 4 May 2022 to 17 May 2022. The first defendant was not only a witness but also a litigant, and indeed the only substantive defendant. He was therefore entitled to attend the entire trial. Having said that, he was under no obligation to put his life on hold for almost two weeks in order to do so. After all, the first defendant did not choose to litigate and moreover did not choose to litigate in Singapore, halfway around the world from his home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Further, to the extent that the first defendant returned to his home in London from 5 to 15 May 2022, he avoided the cost of hotel accommodation in Singapore for those ten days. The first defendant thereby avoided a disbursement that I would estimate at about $5,700, being hotel accommodation in Singapore at $570 per night for the ten nights he was in London. This is the all-in rate, including all charges and taxes, which the first defendant paid per night for accommodation at the Fullerton Hotel when he was in Singapore during trial.

</div> I take that to be an objection that the fee was not reasonably incurred <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was incurred purely for Mr Gluck’s own comfort and convenience and was not reasonably necessary for Mr Gluck to give evidence at the trial of this action.

I am satisfied that the first defendant is under an obligation in equity to reimburse MG Sugars Lanka (Private) Limited for, or to indemnify it against, Mr Gluck’s travel expenses.

Mr Gluck’s travel expenses are therefore recoverable in principle, subject to this undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I now turn to address the first defendant’s specific claim for the fee of $7,229. I accept the plaintiff’s submission that this fee is not recoverable as between party and party. The first defendant has failed to discharge his burden of showing that this fee was reasonably incurred. If Mr Gluck initially planned to return to London on 14 May 2022, the fact that his evidence extended to 13 May 2022 does not on its face necessitate changing the date of travel. Mr Gluck was released as a witness at around 12 noon on 13 May 2022. The first defendant does not suggest, let alone produce any evidence, that Mr Gluck did not have sufficient time after he was released as a witness to catch his originally scheduled flight on 14 May 2022. Further, the first defendant offers no explanation as to how upgrading his class of travel was reasonably necessary for him to give evidence at the trial of this action. I am therefore not satisfied that this fee of $7,229 was reasonably incurred. This fee is irrecoverable as between party and party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I therefore hold that the first defendant is entitled to recover Mr Gluck’s travel expenses from the plaintiff, albeit limited to the sum of $9,944, on the first defendant’s formal undertaking to the court that, upon recovering a sum of $9,944 from the plaintiff under an order for costs in this action and if the first defendant has not by that time already done one or the other of the following, the first defendant will either pay a sum of $9,944 to TravelDesk or reimburse MG Sugars Lanka (Private) Ltd for having paid a sum of $9,944 to TravelDesk, whichever may be applicable.

</div> That is a serious allegation, especially for a professional trustee. Quite reasonably, the second defendant felt compelled to seek legal representation from the outset, to file a defence and to participate in the action. Even after I struck out the unsustainable claims in December 2020, the plaintiff insisted on retaining the paragraph in his statement of claim which pleaded that the second defendant had acted in breach of trust.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> But that does not alter my analysis for three reasons. First, the plaintiff’s approach meant that an allegation that the second defendant had acted in breach of trust remained on the record in the pleadings throughout this action. Second, the second defendant is a professional trustee, against whom this is an especially serious allegation even if it does not or cannot lead to a finding that she acted in breach of trust. Finally, it was open to the plaintiff at any time to withdraw his indication and to invite me to make a finding against the second defendant that she had acted in breach of trust as pleaded. I therefore do not consider it correct to say that the second defendant was a purely nominal party to this action, either when the plaintiff commenced this action or after December 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I am therefore satisfied that the second defendant acted reasonably in incurring legal costs of and incidental to defending this action. That is true even though she allowed the first defendant to take the lead in resisting the plaintiff’s claim throughout this litigation. That was a very reasonable and sensible approach on the part of the second defendant and her legal representatives to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. To that extent, and given the outcome of the litigation, the benefit of the second defendant’s reasonable and sensible approach has enured to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The second defendant is entitled to recover the costs which she has reasonably incurred from someone. The question is whom. As in the case of the first defendant, the second defendant’s costs should follow the event (see [10] above). The plaintiff’s claim alleged expressly that the second defendant had acted in breach of trust. The plaintiff has failed entirely in establishing that allegation. Under the general rule, therefore, it is the plaintiff who should pay the second defendant’s costs (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [39]). There is no basis on which to depart from the general rule.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The award of costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Two questions arise in awarding the second defendant her costs: (a) whether those costs should be assessed on the standard basis or the indemnity basis; and (b) in what quantum those costs should be assessed. For the reasons which follow (see [130]–[150] below), I find: (a) that the plaintiff is liable to pay costs to the second defendant on the indemnity basis; and (b) that those costs should be assessed in the gross sum of $80,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Standard basis or indemnity basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 To support her claim for costs on the indemnity basis, the second defendant relies on a letter of indemnity issued by the plaintiff and which the second defendant claims she is entitled to enforce against him. The second defendant relies on the letter of indemnity in two ways. The first way is as a contract. She invites me, in effect, to vindicate her contractual right by awarding her a monetary indemnity for the costs she has incurred of and incidental to defending this action. In the alternative, the second defendant invites me to rely on the existence of the indemnity as a factor in the exercise of my discretion to order that her costs be assessed on the indemnity basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In order to take the letter of indemnity into account as a factor in the exercise of my discretion, I must form a view as to whether the second defendant indeed has a contractual right to recover her costs of and incidental to this action under the letter of indemnity. For the reasons which follow (see [132]–[145] below), I accept: (a) that the plaintiff owes the second defendant a contractual obligation to indemnify her against legal costs she incurs in the course of providing services to the third defendant as a shareholder and as a director of the third defendant; and (b) that the legal costs she has incurred of and incidental to this action come within the scope of the indemnity. I make these findings not for the purpose of adjudicating on the parties’ substantive contractual rights under the letter of indemnity, and therefore binding them by adjudication, but merely to establish that it is legitimate for me to take the letter of indemnity into account in the exercise of my procedural discretion to award costs (<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific Group Ltd v Credit Agricole (Suisse) SA (Yeh Mao-Yuen, third party</span>) [2015] 4 SLR 1019 (“<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific</span>”) at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The plaintiff is obliged to indemnify the second defendant</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The letter of indemnity on which the second defendant relies is dated 23 July 2015 (<span class="font-italic">KPN </span>at [25]).

Clause 1 obliges the plaintiff to indemnify the second defendant against legal costs she incurs by reason of accepting appointment as a director and shareholder of the third defendant in the course of her employment by Infinitus Law Corporation. That is an undoubted benefit conferred on the second defendant. On this branch of my analysis, I am assuming that the second defendant is not a party to the indemnity and that the plaintiff therefore owes this contractual obligation only to Infinitus Law Corporation and not to the second defendant. But that is the very situation which the C(RTP)A was enacted to address. Further, there is nothing in the indemnity, on its proper construction, which indicates expressly or impliedly that the parties to the indemnity did not intend cl 1 to be enforceable by an employee of Infinitus Law Corporation within the meaning of s 2(2) of the C(RTP)A. The second defendant therefore has a direct right of action against the plaintiff to enforce cl 1 of the indemnity under the C(RTP)A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Finally, if I am wrong on both my first and second reasons, it appears to me that the indemnity is a unilateral contract under which the plaintiff, together with the first defendant and Mr Gluck, undertook to indemnify, amongst others, employees of Infinitus Law Corporation who provide services as a director and shareholder of the third defendant (<span class="font-italic">Alrich</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 340 at [41]). The second defendant is an employee of Infinitus Law Corporation. She undoubtedly provided those services with the indemnity in mind. The plaintiff is thereby bound to the terms of the indemnity directly as against the second defendant. She has a contract with the plaintiff and can therefore enforce it directly against the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The plaintiff submits that the indemnity no longer binds him as a contract because the consideration, or a part of the consideration, for the indemnity was the continuing validity of the 2015 Trust Deed. I decided in <span class="font-italic">KPN</span> that the 2015 Trust Deed was intended to be merely a stop-gap measure and was therefore not evidence of a donative intent which would rebut the presumption of resulting trust over the Shares arising in favour of the first defendant (at [93]–[112]). I also found that although the 2015 Trust Deed was an express statement in writing that the second defendant intended to hold the Shares on trust for the plaintiff, this amounted to an imperfect gift (<span class="font-italic">KPN </span>at [113]–[118]). Thus, the plaintiff submits that there has either been a failure of consideration or that the letter of indemnity is void for common mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I do not accept either of the plaintiff’s submissions. A failure of consideration is not a vitiating factor in the law of contract. It is an unjust factor in the law of unjust enrichment (<span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [132]). Common mistake, on the other hand, is a vitiating factor in the law of contract (<span class="font-italic">TQ v TR </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 at [97]). Moreover, the common mistake must be sufficiently important or fundamental for it to vitiate a contract (<span class="font-italic">Chwee</span><span class="font-italic"> Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 502 at [34]). However, I do not accept that there was any common mistake here sufficiently fundamental to render the letter of indemnity void. Even if the validity of the 2015 Trust Deed was a matter of fundamental importance to the parties, the fact remains it was not the subject-matter of the letter of indemnity. The subject matter of the letter of indemnity was the plaintiff’s obligation to indemnify “ILC” for providing services as a shareholder and director of the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The fact that the plaintiff is described as one of the “Beneficiaries” giving the second defendant the indemnity does not alter my analysis. There is no reference to the 2015 Trust Deed in cl 1 of the letter of indemnity or indeed in any provision of the letter of indemnity which has contractual effect. The only reference to the 2015 Trust Deed is in the background material set out in the recitals. That is not sufficient for me to conclude on any basis available in law that the letter of indemnity no longer binds the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff does owe the second defendant a contractual obligation under the letter of indemnity to indemnify her against the legal costs she incurs in this litigation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The costs of this action are within the scope of the indemnity</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I also accept that the legal costs which the second defendant has incurred of and incidental to defending this action are within the scope of the letter of indemnity. The plaintiff named the second defendant as a party in this action because it was his case that she was an express trustee for him under and by reason of the 2015 Trust Deed. She executed the 2015 Trust Deed in the course of her employment by Infinitus Law Corporation and as a consequence of her status as the third defendant’s sole subscribing shareholder (<span class="font-italic">KPN</span> at [8]–[9] and [21]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The second defendant is entitled to indemnity costs</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that: (a) the letter of indemnity obliges the plaintiff to indemnify the second defendant for losses she suffers within the scope of the indemnity; and (b) that the second defendant’s costs of this action come within its scope. I therefore accept that the letter of indemnity is a factor that I can legitimately take into account in the exercise of my procedural discretion to award costs to the second defendant (<span class="font-italic">Telemedia Pacific </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Taking this factor into account, and as a matter of discretion and not as a matter of law, I am prepared to assess the second defendant’s costs of and incidental to defending this action on the indemnity basis. Neither the second defendant nor the plaintiff has addressed me on whether the effect of enforcing a contractual right to be indemnified for legal costs yields an outcome which is substantially the same as assessing costs as between party and party on the indemnity basis. There is, in fact, a difference between the two (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Abani</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Pte Ltd v BNP Paribas and another appeal </span>[2014] 3 SLR 909 at [93]). I need not discuss that further, as the second defendant and the plaintiff are content to proceed on the basis that these two measures are equivalent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Nevertheless, it must be the case conceptually that an award of the costs of and incidental to litigation is but a subset of the costs recoverable on a contractual indemnity against claims and costs. Having chosen to seek and secure an award for her costs of this action on the indemnity basis rather than to commence a separate action on the indemnity, I consider it appropriate to condition my decision to assess the second defendant’s costs on the indemnity basis on her accepting this award of costs in full and final discharge of the plaintiff’s obligations to her under the letter of indemnity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I therefore hold that the plaintiff is liable to pay the second defendant’s costs on the indemnity basis if, and only if, the second defendant and Infinitus Law Corporation each give a formal undertaking to the court that both the second defendant and Messrs Infinitus Law Corporation will not seek to recover from the plaintiff any further sums in respect of their respective costs of or incidental to this action in contract under the letter of indemnity. The plaintiff can hardly complain about this. It operates to his advantage in that the award of indemnity costs coupled with this undertaking terminates his potential liability under the letter of indemnity for the second defendant’s costs of and incidental to this action. That liability may well go beyond the quantum of an award of costs in my discretion assessed on the indemnity basis (see [145] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quantum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The second defendant claims an indemnity in the sum of $140,957 broken down as follows:

</div> I take that figure as a reasonable proxy for the first defendant’s solicitor and client costs. In my estimation, the legal costs that the second defendant incurred in this action between July 2020 and December 2020 amounts at best to 10% of the legal costs that the first defendant incurred over the full 30 months that this litigation took to conclude, including the 7½ day trial and the oral closing submissions. I also accept the plaintiff’s submission, which counsel for the second defendant herself accepted in oral submissions, that the legal costs incurred by the second defendant after December 2020, including the costs associated with keeping track of the progress of this action and making her submissions on costs, were <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I therefore fix the quantum of costs which the plaintiff must pay to the second defendant assessed on the indemnity basis at $80,000 including disbursements. Against this sum, the second defendant accepts that she must give credit to the plaintiff for $38,010 comprising the following sums awarded against the plaintiff and to the second defendant as fixed costs in interlocutory proceedings:

The principle remains that a receiving party is entitled to recover a reasonable amount for costs reasonably incurred of and incidental to the action.
