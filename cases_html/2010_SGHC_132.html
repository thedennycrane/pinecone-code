<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Accused pleaded guilty and was convicted of
                    the following four charges:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     2<sup>nd</sup> charge
                        – attempted aggravated rape under section 375(3)(a)(i) read with

                        (“Penal Code”), for attempting to penetrate with his penis the
                        vagina of one, without her consent, and in order to commit the offence,
                        voluntarily caused hurt to the said one. The prescribed punishment for this
                        offence is imprisonment for a term of between 8 and 10 years, and caning of
                        not less than 12 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     4<sup>th</sup> charge – aggravated
                        sexual assault by penetration under section 376(4)(a)(i) of the Penal Code,
                        for penetrating with his finger the vagina of one, without her consent, and
                        in order to commit the offence, voluntarily caused hurt to the said one. The
                        prescribed punishment for this offence is imprisonment for a term of between
                        8 and 20 years and caning of not less than 12 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     6<sup>th</sup> charge
                        – aggravated rape under section 375(3)(a)(i) of the Penal Code, for
                        penetrating with his penis the vagina of one, without her consent, and in
                        order to commit the offence, voluntarily caused hurt to the said one. The
                        prescribed punishment for this offence is imprisonment for a term of between
                        8 and 20 years, and caning of not less than 12 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     7<sup>th</sup> charge
                        – housebreaking by night under section 457 of the Penal Code, by
                        entering into the premises which were in the possession of one, in order to
                        commit theft on items which were in the possession of the said one, and
                        which offence was committed between 7 pm and 7 am. The prescribed punishment
                        for this offence is imprisonment for a term of between 2 and 14
                        years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Accused also consented to the following
                    three charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of
                    sentencing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Charge
                        – theft in dwelling under section 380 of the Penal
                    Code;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     3<sup>rd</sup> Charge – aggravated outrage of
                        modesty under section 354A of the Penal Code;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     5<sup>th</sup> Charge –
                        attempted aggravated rape under section 375(3)(a)(i) read with section 511
                        of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the end of the hearing, I sentenced the
                    Accused to a total term of imprisonment of 25 years and 24 strokes of the cane.
                    The Accused has appealed against the sentence imposed on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Accused is a male Malay Singaporean and is
                    27 years old. He used to be in a relationship with the Victim’s daughter,
                    R, sometime in 2000 and they remained in contact after their break-up. The
                    Victim is a 48 year old female Malay Singaporean and she resides in a HDB flat
                    (“the Flat”) with R. The Accused knew that only the Victim and R
                    reside in the Flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Sometime in November 2008, the Accused went to
                    the Flat to visit R. While at the Flat, the Accused saw a bunch of keys to the
                    Flat on the TV cabinet and decided to steal them. He did so when R went to the
                    kitchen to get him a drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 3 April 2009, the Accused discovered
                    through corresponding with R by text messages that she was not at home and that
                    she would return home late. As he was in need of money, the Accused conceived a
                    plan to break into and steal from the Flat using the stolen keys. He thus packed
                    into his haversack an orange T-shirt and cloth gloves for concealing his face
                    and his fingerprints respectively, and masking tape for tying up whoever was at
                    home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 4 April 2009, at about 1am, the Victim
                    went to sleep in her bedroom after locking the metal gate and wooden door of the
                    Flat. Shortly after, the Accused entered the Flat using the stolen keys after
                    concealing his face and head with the orange T-shirt. After checking R’s
                    bedroom to confirm that she was not at home, the Accused went into the
                    Victim’s bedroom and switched on the light. The Accused climbed onto the
                    Victim and covered her mouth with masking tape just as she was waking up. He
                    told her to shut up and tied her hands and arms tightly together using masking
                    tape, and dragged the Victim to one corner of the bed. The Accused then tied the
                    Victim’s arms to the bedpost over her head so that her head hung over the
                    edge of the bed. The Accused further covered the Victim’s eyes and face
                    with masking tape, and her face with a piece of cloth or T-shirt that he found
                    in the Flat to prevent her from identifying him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After the Victim was immobilised, the Accused
                    removed her pants and panties, lifted her legs and tried to penetrate her vagina
                    with his penis. He attempted to do so several times, but was unsuccessful as he
                    was unable to sustain an erection. As the Victim was menstruating, the Accused
                    had to use tissue paper to clean her up after each attempt at penetration.
                    During this time, the Victim informed the Accused that she needed to go to the
                    toilet when the masking tape on her mouth came loose but he simply ignored her
                    plea.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the 4<sup>th</sup> charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At about 4 am, R returned to the Flat. At around
                    that time, she sent a text message to the Accused. Realising that R was home,
                    the Accused remained quiet in the Victim’s bedroom so that she would not
                    know that he was at the Flat. After R had gone into her bedroom, the Accused
                    took a hair band and pushed part of it into the Victim’s mouth to prevent
                    her from screaming. He then went to the kitchen to get water as he was thirsty.
                    When he went back to the Victim’s bedroom, he used a cloth to cover the
                    gap under the bedroom door to avoid being detected by R.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Accused then fondled and sucked the
                    nipples of the Victim. At about 5.30am, the Accused inserted two of his fingers
                    into the Victim’s vagina. All this while, the Victim remained gagged and
                    her arms and hands were bound tightly together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the 6<sup>th</sup> charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Following this, the Accused again
                    unsuccessfully tried to penetrate the Victim’s vagina several times with
                    his penis. Thereafter the Victim informed the Accused once more that she needed
                    to go to the toilet but he ignored her and even tightened the masking tape on
                    her mouth. As a result, the Victim passed motion and urinated on the bed, while
                    still bound to her bed. The Accused then cleaned the Victim up with tissue paper
                    before attempting to insert his penis into her vagina again. This time round, he
                    succeeded. He moved his penis in and out of her vagina several times before
                    ejaculating on her stomach. The Accused then used tissue paper to wipe away his
                    semen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts relating to the 7<sup>th</sup> charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After finally successfully raping the Victim,
                    the Accused packed the tissue paper, bottle of water, masking tape, T-shirt and
                    gloves into his haversack to avoid being traced to his crimes. He then left the
                    Flat at about 7 am with the Victim’s mobile phone and cash of about $100
                    which he had found previously while ransacking the Victim’s room and her
                    wallet. He did not release the Victim when he left.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The aftermath of the events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After the Accused arrived at his home, he
                    re-packed the tissue paper, bottle of water, masking tape, T-shirt and gloves
                    into a plastic bag which he disposed of in a rubbish bin at the ground floor of
                    his block of flats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Victim managed to remove the masking tape
                    on her mouth and hands, and to untie herself from the bedpost at about 8 am. She
                    then telephoned her sister for help. The Victim’s sister and
                    brother-in-law arrived at the Flat shortly thereafter to find the Victim crying
                    and her arms still bound. They untied her and called the police. After the
                    attack, the Accused sent R several text messages to ask if the police had
                    discovered any evidence about the attack and to notify him if any such evidence
                    was found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Medical Examinations on Victim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 4 April 2009, the Victim was medically
                    examined at the National University Hospital by one Dr James W S Lee.
                    She complained of pains over her hands from having been bound up and cramps in
                    her thighs. Dr Lee found a superficial glaze over the Victim’s left
                    cheek from the masking tape that was applied over the face as well as linear
                    abrasions, areas of skin peeling and blistering over the dorsum aspects of both
                    the Victim’s arms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">HSA Reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The HSA laboratory test revealed that the
                    Accused’s DNA was discovered in the external and internal vaginal swabs,
                    as well as the anal swab, taken from the Victim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> His DNA was also found
                    on the bra, blouse and pants which the Victim wore on the night of the
                        offences.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions on sentence by the DPP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The prosecution submitted that the Accused had
                    callously violated the sanctity of the Victim’s body and home,
                    immobilising her for an extended period of about six hours during which he
                    treated her as his personal sex slave. It thus strongly urged the court to
                    impose the harshest sentence which would adequately reflect society’s
                    condemnation of the Accused’s depraved actions as well as to send out a
                    message of general deterrence. I agree. The various aggravating factors clearly
                    necessitated a long custodial sentence. Before going into the detailed reasons
                    for my decision, I shall first set out briefly the relevant sentencing
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing Principles</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offence of aggravated rape</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Court of Appeal in <em>Chia
                        Kim Heng Frederick v PP</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 has
                    determined that the starting point in sentencing adult offenders for rape
                    committed without aggravating or mitigating factors is ten years’
                    imprisonment in a contested case, in addition to six strokes of the cane. In
                        <em>PP v NF</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 849
                        (“<em>PP v NF”</em>), V K
                    Rajah J (as he then was) considered <em>R v William
                        Christopher Millberry</em> [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 31
                        (“<em>Millberry</em>”) and adopted the
                    four broad categories of rape. He stated at [20] that the second category of
                    rapes includes cases where there is repeated rape in the course of one attack
                    (including cases where the same victim has been both vaginally and anally
                    raped). Rajah J was of the view that the appropriate starting point for
                    category 2 rapes is 15 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane (see
                    [36]). This position has since been adopted by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em> [2008]
                    1 SLR(R) 601 (“<em>Mohammed
                    Liton</em>”) at [96].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In this case, although the Accused has been
                    charged for only one count of aggravated rape under section 357(3)(a)(i) of the
                    Penal Code, the Prosecution rightly pointed out that this was not for want of
                        trying.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The evidence shows clearly that the
                    Accused had repeatedly tried to rape the Victim, but had failed only because he
                    was unable to sustain an erection.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given the repeated sexual assaults on the
                    Victim, this case clearly falls within a Category 2 rape where the starting
                    point for the term of imprisonment is 15 years and 12 strokes of the
                    cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In determining the appropriate punishment to
                    be imposed, the court has to bear in mind the various aggravating and mitigating
                    factors present in each individual case. In <em>PP v
                        NF</em>, Rajah J cited (at [55]) <em>Millberry</em> where the English Court of Appeal identified a list of
                    nine aggravating factors that are often present in rape offences:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     the use of violence over and above
                        the force necessary to commit the rape;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     use of a weapon to frighten or injure the
                        victim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        offence was planned;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     an especially serious or physical or mental effect on the victim;
                        this would include, for example, a rape resulting in pregnancy, or in
                        transmission of a life-threatening or serious disease;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     further degradation of the victim,
                        e.g. by forced oral sex or urination on the victim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_f"></a>(f)     the offender has broken into or
                        otherwise gained access to the place where the victim is
                    living;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_g"></a>(g)     the
                        presence of children when the offence is committed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_h"></a>(h)     the covert use of a drug to overcome
                        the victim’s resistance and/or obliterate his or her memory to the
                        offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_i"></a>(i)     a
                        history of sexual assaults or violence by the offender against the
                        victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Regina v
                        Roberts</em> [1982] 1 WLR 133 (“<em>Roberts</em>”) (cited in <em>Mohammed
                        Liton</em> at [93]), the English Court of Appeal further considered
                    the many aggravating factors and stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Some of the features which may aggravate the crime are as follows. Where a
                        gun or knife or some other weapon has been used to frighten or injure the
                        victim. Where the victim sustains serious injury, whether that is mental or
                        physical. Where violence is used over and above the violence necessarily
                        involved in the act itself. Where there are threats of a brutal kind. Where
                        the victim has been subjected to further sexual indignities or perversions.
                        Where the victim is very young or elderly. Where the offender is in a
                        position of trust. Where the offender has intruded into the victim’s
                        home. Where the victim has been deprived of her liberty for a period of
                        time. Where the rape, or succession of rapes, is carried out by a group of
                        men. Where the offender has committed a series of rapes on different women,
                        or indeed on the same woman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As will be seen in the subsequent paragraphs,
                    some of the aggravating features listed in <em>Millbery</em> and <em>Roberts</em> were clearly
                    present in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offence of aggravated sexual assault by penetration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I note at this point that the offence of
                    sexual assault by penetration under section 376 of the Penal Code only came into
                    effect on 1 February 2008. Hence, there are not many cases involving
                    convictions under this provision. In <em>PP v Robiul Bhoreshuddin
                        Mondal</em> [2010] SGHC 10, the offender was convicted of,
                    amongst other offences, 4 counts of aggravated rape charges and one count of
                    aggravated sexual assault by penetration under section 376(4)(a)(ii) of the
                    Penal Code for sexually penetrating the victim’s vagina with his finger.
                    For the charge of aggravated sexual assault by penetration, the offender was
                    sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the
                cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Similarly, in <em>PP v Bala
                        Kuppusamy</em> [2009] SGHC 97, the offender was convicted
                    of, <em>inter alia</em>, four charges of aggravated sexual
                    assault under section 376(4) of the Penal Code. He had forced two of his
                    victims to perform fellatio on him and had also inserted his finger into their
                    vaginas. He was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the
                    cane for each act of fellatio performed on him and 10 years’ imprisonment
                    and 14 strokes of the cane for each offence of digital penetration. In <em>PP v AEY</em> [2010] SGHC 3, a case involving an 8
                    year old victim, the offender was convicted under section 376(2)(a) for
                    penetrating, with his finger, the vagina of the victim. Woo Bih Li J
                    sentenced the offender to 12 years’ imprisonment and 14 strokes of the
                    cane. This term was ordered to run consecutively with the other charge of
                    forcibly penetrating the victim’s mouth with his penis, an offence for
                    which the offender was also sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and 14
                    strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     These cases thus show a general sentencing
                    norm of about 10 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the
                    offence of aggravated sexual assault by digital penetration under section 376 of
                    the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Offence of housebreaking by night in order to commit theft</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As for the 7<sup>th</sup>
                    Charge, <em>viz</em>, housebreaking by night in order to
                    commit theft, the prescribed term of imprisonment is a minimum of 2 years and
                    not more than 14 years and the offender shall also be liable to a fine. In
                        <em>PP v Chen Jianhua</em> [2008] SGDC 383,
                    the offender was charged with and convicted of 10 counts of housebreaking in
                    order to commit theft by night under section 457 of the Penal Code. The learned
                    District Judge stated at [6(a)] that the benchmark for cases involving
                    housebreaking and theft of residential property is 30 months imprisonment term.
                    He also cited <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate
                        Courts</em>, LexisNexis (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2001) at p
                    502 which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for housebreaking, the statutory minimum (in some instances) and
                        maximum sentences are a reflection of the extreme seriousness with which
                        Parliament, and hence the courts, will regard the offence of housebreaking.
                        The courts generally apply the principle of deterrence in sentencing in
                        order to discourage such offences. Despite the basic seriousness with which
                        housebreaking is regarded, not all housebreaking can be placed on the same
                        level of seriousness. For an adult offender, the length of custody would be
                        determined by how high or low on the scale of severity the offence falls.
                            <em>The factors which would determine where the offence
                            falls on the scale of severity are: the method of entry (for example,
                            putting a hand through a window which the offender has opened to take a
                            radio is a far cry from forcible entry)</em>; <em>the degree of sophisticated planning and organisation engaged in;
                            whether the offender was part of a group; the time of break-in (night as
                            opposed to day time); the type of premises (residential as opposed to
                            non-residential); whether the offence was accompanied by acts of wanton
                            vandalism or by force or violence; whether the occupier was present; the
                            effect on the occupier; whether the offence was directed at the elderly,
                            the disabled and the sick; the value of property taken; the number of
                            offences committed; and the antecedents of the offender… As
                            regards the time of the commission of the offence, the Code prescribes a
                            higher punishment for housebreaking committed at night (between 7pm and
                            before 7am). Whilst no distinction is drawn in the punishment prescribed
                            for housebreaking committed in a dwelling house and those in commercial
                            and industrial premises, for sentencing purposes, however, housebreaking
                            of dwelling houses is viewed more seriously than housebreaking of
                            commercial and industrial premises…</em> (emphasis
                        added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The learned District Judge further stated at
                    [8(d)] that another aggravating feature was that the offences were committed in
                    the early hours of the morning where the victims would be asleep and most
                    vulnerable. After considering the other circumstances of the case, he sentenced
                    the offender to 30 months’ imprisonment on each charge and with 3 charges
                    to run consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having set out the general sentencing
                    principles for the relevant offences, I now turn to the aggravating and
                    mitigating factors which I took into account when deciding the appropriate
                    sentences to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sexual offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Accused arrived at the Flat at about 1 am
                    on the day of the attack and thereafter subjected the Victim to utter
                    humiliation for six long hours. During this period, the Victim was immobilised
                    as a result of having her hands and arms bound tightly together using masking
                    tape. She was also placed in an awkward and highly uncomfortable position where
                    her arms were tied to the bedpost over her head so that her head hung over the
                    bed. As stated in <em>Roberts</em> at 135, the aggravating
                    features of a crime include the intrusion by the offender of the victim’s
                    home and the deprivation of a victim’s liberty for a period of time. The
                    breach of the sanctity of the Victim’s home for such a prolonged period
                    clearly constituted an aggravating factor (see <em>PP v Akbar
                        Late Md Hossain Howlader</em> [2004] SGHC 128 where the
                    offender trespassed into the victim’s home and intruded into her privacy
                    at [86]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Further, the Accused had repeatedly ignored
                    the Victim’s plea to use the toilet. The Victim had first informed the
                    Accused of her need to use the toilet shortly after he arrived at around 1 am.
                    Yet, instead of allowing her to do so, the Accused simply ignored her and
                    continued his repeated attempts to rape her. About four hours later, when the
                    masking tape on the Victim’s mouth came loose, she repeated her plea.
                    Again, the Accused simply tightened the masking tape on her mouth to prevent her
                    from making any noise. Unable to control her urges any longer, the Victim had no
                    choice but to suffer the humiliation of urinating and defecating on her own bed.
                    It bears reminding that the Victim was menstruating and that after each (failed)
                    attempt of penetrating her vagina with his penis, the Accused had to clean up
                    the Victim with tissue paper. Such scant respect for the basic dignity of the
                    Victim clearly constituted an aggravating factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I also considered the considerable injuries
                    suffered by the Victim. Throughout the attack, the Accused was indifferent to
                    the Victim’s pain and suffering. He bound the Victim tightly to her
                    bedpost for more than 6 hours as a result of which she suffered from pains and
                    cramps in her thighs and even pushed a hair band into her mouth to prevent her
                    from shouting when he needed to get water from the kitchen. During the medical
                    examination after the attack on 4 April 2009, the Victim was found to have
                    sustained linear abrasions, as well as areas of skin peeling and blistering over
                    the dorsum aspects of her arms and had a glaze over her left
                cheek.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Finally, I took into account the Charges which
                    the Accused had consented to be taken into consideration for the purposes of
                    sentencing. In <em>PP v UI</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 500, the Court of Appeal stated the following at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 178(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code does not
                        mandate that, where TIC offences are present, the court must increase the
                        sentence which would normally have been imposed for the offences proceeded
                        with in the absence of TIC offences. But, if there are TIC offences to be
                        taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which
                        the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would
                        be increased (see Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis,
                            2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2003), at p 77). This is
                        commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in
                        question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance
                        admitted that he committed those offences. This would <em>a
                            fortiori</em> be the case where the TIC offences and the offense
                        proceeded with are similar in nature (eg, if both sets of offences consist
                        of sexual offences against the same victim). As Tay Yong Kwang J stated
                        in <em>Navaseelan Balasingam v PP</em> [2007]
                        1 SLR(R) 767 at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">While it may be said that by admitting the charges taken into
                            consideration, the [offender] had saved [the] court time and the
                            Prosecution the trouble of proving [those charges], the counterbalancing
                            effect of having admitted such charges would be that <em>the [offender] had committed many more similar offences and that
                                fact must aggravate the charges proceeded with</em>. The
                            benefit to the [offender] would be his immunity from being charged or
                            tried for the offences taken into consideration… and he would
                            therefore not have to face further punishment in respect of those
                            offences. (emphasis added in original)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Housebreaking by night in order to commit theft</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     With regard to the charge of housebreaking by
                    night, I took into account the fact that the Accused had taken advantage of his
                    prior access to the Flat by virtue of his continuing friendship with R. The
                    Accused made use of his opportunity to steal the keys to the Flat and on the day
                    of the incident, he found out that the Victim would be alone at home and that R
                    would return home late. He then embarked on a plan to break into the Flat to
                    commit theft, taking extra care to conceal his identity by using a T-shirt to
                    cover his face and cloth gloves to conceal his fingerprints. The offence was
                    clearly premeditated and not one committed on impulse. This constituted another
                    aggravating factor (see <em>PP v Tan Fook Sum</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 1022 at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Another aggravating feature was that the
                    offence was committed in residential premises and at a time where the Victim was
                    alone in the Flat and was likely to be asleep. She was thus in a vulnerable
                    position. The circumstances thus merited a substantial custodial sentence to
                    reflect the severity of his actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In this case, the only mitigating factor was
                    that the Accused pleaded guilty to the charges preferred against him. However,
                    it is clear law that a plea of guilt does not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> entitle an offender to a discount in his sentence. As
                    stated in <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 653 at [77], a plea of guilt can be taken into consideration
                    in mitigation when it is motivated by genuine remorse, contriteness or regret
                    and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of justice. This position has
                    been affirmed in <em>PP v UI</em> at [71] where the Court
                    of Appeal stated that whether an early plea of guilt is to be given any
                    mitigating value depends on whether it is indicative of genuine remorse, as
                    assessed based on a holistic overview of the continuum of relevant
                    circumstances. The court should also carefully examine the conduct of the
                    offender after the commission of the offence in order to determine whether the
                    offender is genuinely contrite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As stated by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then
                    was) in <em>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP</em> [1990]
                    2 SLR(R) 361 at [13]-[14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the appellant surrendered himself to the CAD, it is significant
                        to note that this event occurred at a time when he really had no other
                        choice. He had no choice because the Council of Law Society had taken over
                        the clients’ account of his firm and it was only a question of time
                        before his misdeeds came to light. This is in stark contrast to the defence
                        he put forward in respect of the claim for $235,000 at a time when he
                        misdeeds remained secret and safe with him. Similarly, the plea of guilty
                        was not made in a case where the Prosecution might have any trouble in
                        proving the charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In making these comments, I do not dissent from the principle applied by
                        the Senior District Judge that the voluntary surrender by an offender and a
                        plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in
                        mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept
                        punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the
                        weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case.
                            <em>I do not see any mitigation value in a robber
                            surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of
                            escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself
                            in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up</em>.
                        (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In this case, the Accused pleaded guilty.
                    However, he did not surrender himself immediately after the attack and had tried
                    to dispose of the evidence which would incriminate him. He also sent R multiple
                    text messages to ask if the police had discovered any evidence about the attack
                    and asked to be notified of any such evidence. Rather than showing any
                    contriteness, the actions of the Accused merely reflected a fear of being
                    exposed for his guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Accused was finally arrested following
                    police investigations. Traces of his DNA were found in the external and internal
                    vaginal swabs, as well as the anal swab, of the Victim, and on the bra, blouse
                    and pants which the Victim wore on the night of the attack. The evidence
                    establishing his guilt was thus overwhelming. Faced with such a situation, the
                    Accused effectively had no choice but to plead guilty. Accordingly, although I
                    did allow some discount in the sentence for saving the court’s time and
                    not making the Victim testify and relive the horror of that night had there been
                    a trial, however I did not give any further substantial mitigating value to his
                    plea of guilt on account of his remorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentences imposed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     After considering all the circumstances of the
                    case and the charges which the Accused had consented to be taken into
                    consideration for the purposes of sentencing, I imposed the following sentences
                    on him:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Charge – imprisonment for a term of nine years and caning with
                        fourteen strokes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     4<sup>th</sup> Charge – imprisonment for a term
                        of ten years and caning with twelve strokes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     6<sup>th</sup> Charge –
                        imprisonment for a term of fifteen years and caning with fifteen
                        strokes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     7<sup>th</sup> Charge – imprisonment for a term
                        of three years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The terms of imprisonment for the
                        4<sup>th</sup> Charge and 6<sup>th</sup>
                    Charge were ordered to run consecutively and the terms of imprisonment passed on
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge and the 7<sup>th</sup>
                    Charge were to run concurrently to the terms of imprisonment passed on the
                        4<sup>th</sup> Charge and the 6<sup>th</sup>
                    Charge. Accordingly, the total sentence passed was imprisonment for a term of 25
                    years with effect from 23 April 2009 and caning with 24
                strokes.</p>
