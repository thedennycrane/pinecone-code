<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       “A falling out of thieves” is an
                    apt description of this case. For 6 weeks I heard the evidence unfold: of
                    non-existent employees (euphemistically called “Proxies”)
                    comprising real persons complete with identity card numbers and Central
                    Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts, of utilising these falsified
                    local employees to mislead the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) into
                    allotting higher foreign worker entitlements, of levying
                    “commissions” on foreign workers from China, of fictitious
                    invoices to build up a track record of “profit” for possible
                    listing, of withdrawals of large sums of money from another euphemistically
                    styled “Salary Accruals” account which enabled the directors not
                    only to withdraw large sums of money as reimbursement of non-existent
                    “expenses” but also to evade tax, of fictitious payments to
                    non-existent subcontractors, of questionable loans (some of which were in the
                    hundreds of thousands) to the company, and also of other loans which were made
                    on one day and withdrawn or repaid on the next. And it is now my unenviable task
                    to decide who, between the two protagonists, I am to believe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The protagonists are Mr Lim Leong Huat,
                    (“Lim”), who is the Plaintiff and Mr Neo Kok Eng,
                    (“Neo”), who is the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in
                    this suit. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant is Chip Hup Hup Kee
                    Construction Pte Ltd, (“CHKC”), a company owned by Neo. Lim is
                    suing CHKC for the recovery of loans made to it over a period from 2003 to 2006,
                    as well as cost of funds (“COF”) compensation for expenses Lim
                    incurred in obtaining the funds to loan to CHKC. Lim also claims against CHKC
                    and Neo for conspiring to injure him by depriving him of payment of the monies
                    Lim had advanced to CHKC. In response, CHKC has brought a very large
                    counterclaim against Lim, his wife, Mdm Tan Siew Lim,
                    (“Mdm Tan”) and AZ Associates Pte Ltd, (“AZ”),
                    a construction company owned by Lim which was closely associated with CHKC. In
                    its counterclaim, CHKC has accused Lim of misappropriating its cheques,
                    wrongfully manipulating its accounts, overpaying salaries without authority, and
                    unlawfully retaining profits from certain construction projects. CHKC has also
                    added Mdm Tan and AZ to the counterclaim because some of the monies it
                    alleges Lim misappropriated or unlawfully retained were being held by
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The following facts, from [3]–[5], are not
                    really in contention. Neo is about 51 years of age and was educated up to
                    Secondary Four in the Chinese stream. His father started the family business in
                    timber in the 1950s. Neo, (the second youngest son), and his three brothers
                    helped their father in the timber business. In 1982, the family company, Chip
                    Hup Timber Pte Ltd (“CH Timber”) was incorporated to take over the
                    business. In October 1983, Neo and his brother Neo Kok Ching
                    (“Ching”) incorporated Chip Hup Hup Kee Trading Pte Ltd, which was
                    subsequently renamed CHKC, to venture into the construction business. In July
                    1989, Neo and two of his brothers incorporated Chip Hup Holding Pte Ltd
                    (“CHH”). By then, Neo’s father had retired, leaving the
                    family business to his 4 sons. In July 1989, Neo also incorporated Chippel
                    Overseas Supplies Pte Ltd (“COS”) to trade in building materials.
                    A few years after Neo’s father passed away in January 1993, two of his
                    brothers left the family business and transferred their interests to Neo.
                    According to Neo, his brother Ching also wanted to leave and concentrate on his
                    own business, but since Neo needed at least 2 shareholders and directors, Ching
                    stayed on for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Lim comes from Malaysia, is about 46 years of
                    age and holds a Masters of Science in Construction Technology. Lim has always
                    worked in the construction industry. After he graduated, he worked for about 1
                    year in Kuala Lumpur. He then came down to Singapore and worked for a few months
                    in Uni Consultants before joining Heng Mah Construction Ltd (“Heng
                    Mah”). In the 4 years that he was at Heng Mah, Lim did well. He first
                    joined them as a site engineer. He said he was very serious about his work and
                    totally committed to it. Within 9 months of joining, his boss noticed this and
                    promoted him to project manager and about a year later he was promoted to
                    general manager of Heng Mah. Heng Mah at that time was one of about 30 G8
                    contractors in Singapore, <em>i.e</em>. they could tender
                    for building projects of unlimited value. Heng Mah also held a G7 rating for
                    civil engineering projects, <em>i.e</em>. they could tender
                    up to $50 million for civil engineering projects. Heng Mah did project work as a
                    main contractor, whereas CHKC mostly did work as a subcontractor of the main
                    contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Neo said he met Lim around 1994. Prior to Lim
                    joining CHKC, Neo was doing smaller scale civil engineering projects, mainly
                    building roads, culverts and drainage works. Neo had plans to go into
                    construction on a larger scale. As he said, he managed to secure a project for a
                    lecture hall for the National Technological University around August 1994 and
                    later a project from the Housing Development Board for 608 units. Neo needed
                    someone to manage such projects. Although this was not seriously in contention,
                    insofar as it is, I find that Neo sought Lim out in or around August 1994 having
                    heard of his good work at Heng Mah. Neo promised Lim at least equal or better
                    terms of employment than Lim then had at Heng Mah. Lim was given a Letter of
                    Appointment as General Manager of CHKC in November 1994 with a salary of $7,000
                    a month which would be reviewed annually. As Lim received a bonus of $200,000
                    from Heng Mah for the years 1991–1993, Neo also gave Lim the same bonus at
                    CHKC as well as an E-class Mercedes car (Lim opted for a second hand Mercedes
                    car). Neo gave Lim a free hand to and Lim built up a team in CHKC recruiting
                    some of his ex-colleagues at Heng Mah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Before me, Neo downplayed Lim’s role in
                    CHKC, saying he was a mere employee whom he could easily replace. However, it is
                    obvious, and I so find, that Lim was good at his job. In 1994, CHKC’s
                    revenue was only $6.6 million and it made a loss of about $730,000. In 1995, the
                    revenue had almost doubled to $12.7 million and it made a profit of $728,000. In
                    1996, the revenue shot up more than fourfold to $59.1 million and CHKC made a
                    profit of $1.85 million. In 1995, the revenue was $59.5 million and the profit
                    was $1.12 million. I find that it was due to Lim’s ability that CHKC
                    managed to take on its many projects and increase its revenues so dramatically.
                    In time to come, Lim was given the title Projects Director and then Executive
                    Director although he was never formally appointed a director of CHKC. Lim did
                    not hold any shares in CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The secret to CHKC’s ability to carry out
                    its work and churn out its revenue was its ability to source cheap but skilled
                    labour from China. (AZ, which was owned and managed by Lim and did work in
                    connection with CHKC, similarly relied on Chinese workers). At the height of
                    their project activity, there were about 1,500 workers from China on CHKC and
                    AZ’s records and over 1,000 workers from 1999 to most of 2002.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Neo claims that at the peak of
                    construction activity around 1999, CHKC and AZ had 1,800 foreign
                        workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Neo had a contact called Wu Xue Feng
                    (“Wu”) who worked in a company in China called the Beijing
                    Residential Development Company (“BRDC”). Wu was Neo’s
                    source for skilled Chinese labour. In 1995, BRDC set up Zhu-Zhong Construction
                    Singapore Pte Ltd, (“ZZC”) with Wu as its director. These Chinese
                    workers had their own supervisors and foremen who were also fellow Chinese
                    nationals. I find that Neo and Wu worked closely together in deploying these
                    skilled workers from China, who came at a comparatively low price, for
                    CHKC’s projects. I also find, having heard all the evidence, that Neo kept
                    tight and close personal control over this Chinese labour element of the
                    business and Lim was not involved to any appreciable degree in this aspect of
                    the business. Neo dealt directly with Wu, without consulting Lim, and later with
                    Wu’s deputy here, Zhang Guilin (“Zhang”). I accept
                    Zhang’s evidence on this score. Lim’s involvement was mainly on the
                    operational or projects side where it was more a question of labour requirements
                    for the projects. It is not disputed that there were regular Monday meetings at
                    CHKC throughout the relevant periods chaired by Neo with Lim representing the
                    operational side and projects and representatives from ZZC representing the
                    Chinese labour element.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It will be noticed that although the revenue of
                    CHKC shot up dramatically after Lim came on board, its profits continued to
                    remain at very low levels. Strangely, in the year 2000, when there was a $6
                    million drop in revenue, the profits went up to their highest level and
                    similarly for 2001, although the revenue dropped a further $7 million, the
                    profits did not correspondingly drop:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">Three things should be noted, and I so find, from this pattern of
                    revenue and profit/loss:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The reason for the low profits in
                        spite of the large jumps in revenue is that Neo and Lim started to implement
                        various nefarious schemes enabling them to siphon out large sums of money
                        from CHKC. Hence the profits were always at an artificially low
                        level.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     There is
                        also a reason for the spike in profits in 2000 and 2001. There was an idea
                        to carry out a listing. There was accordingly a reorganisation of the
                        ‘Chip Hup’ companies in July 1998. CHH became the holding
                        company, CHKC, CH Timber, COS and Chippel Construction Pte Ltd
                        (“CCPL”) became its wholly owned subsidiaries; (CCPL was owned
                        by Neo and incorporated after Lim joined CHKC). There was also a need to
                        establish a track record of profitability to qualify for listing, hence not
                        only the spike in profits, but as I will deal with later, fictitious
                        invoices were also generated to raise the apparent level of
                    profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The reason
                        for the huge loss of $20 million in 2006 was due to CHKC’s accounts
                        having to be corrected after many of Neo’s and Lim’s nefarious
                        schemes had come out of the shadows and into the light (see [123]
                        below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lim and Neo’s cosy relationship of about 12
                    years came to an end in late October 2006 when they had a big quarrel.
                    Differing versions were given by Neo and Lim. Lim claimed that from 2003 to
                    2006, CHKC was facing cash flow problems due to the downturn in the construction
                    industry and that he had been lending large sums of money to CHKC to tide it
                    over. When Lim discussed repayment of these loans, Neo kept procrastinating and
                    finally refused to make repayment and this led to a heated quarrel in the last
                    week of October 2006. Neo claimed that unbeknown to him, Lim had been
                    misappropriating Neo’s and CHKC’s money causing it to have cash flow
                    problems and Lim got greedy and started to press Neo in 2005 to sell
                    CHKC’s property at 270 Jalan Besar, Singapore, which Neo was reluctant to
                    do because of its redevelopment potential. Neo became suspicious when Lim
                    suggested in August 2006 that the property be sold to his brother-in-law
                    and Lim agreed to absorb the $1 million difference between Neo’s selling
                    price of $13.5 million and his brother-in-law’s buying price of $12.5
                    million. When Neo’s reluctance to sell stretched into October 2006, and
                    Neo’s selling price had moved up to $17 million, Lim put the proverbial
                    straw on Neo’s back by pressing for repayment of his loans at the end
                    of October 2006. What is clear was that they fell out over money. This led
                    to Lim’s suspension and then dismissal at the end of November 2006. Lim
                    sued CHKC on 21 November 2006 for the return of the balance of his loans
                    amounting to $7,205,000. Neo was later added as the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. As noted above, CHKC responded
                    with a massive initial counterclaim, amounting to some $55 million, against Lim.
                    Mdm Tan and AZ were also brought in as parties to the counterclaim. There
                    then ensued a period of trench warfare where interlocutory proceedings were
                    taken out and bitterly fought at every stage. There were related proceedings
                    launched in 2007 and 2008, including a criminal prosecution (see [19] below) and
                    Suit No 241 of 2007, a related action, which was fixed for hearing before
                    me to follow upon the trial of this action. Some of the numerous hard-fought
                    interlocutory applications ended up in the Court of Appeal. Finally, the Court
                    of Appeal told the parties to stop their interlocutory skirmishes, noting, I am
                    told by counsel, that there have been strange goings-on in CHKC, both sides
                    appear to have “been naughty” and have something to answer for,
                    and ordered the parties to proceed with the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before I go further, both counsel for Lim
                    (Mr Khoo) and Neo (Ms Lim) had said, more than once, that at the end
                    of the day, it is a question for the court to decide whom to believe. On many of
                    the important issues that have to be decided, the alleged agreements or
                    discussions or decisions only took place between Lim and Neo and no one else was
                    present. Lim and Neo’s versions are often poles apart. For example:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim said Neo came up with and
                        implemented the “Proxies” system and “Salary
                        Accruals” accounts in CHKC (see [109]–[111] below) even before
                        Lim joined CHKC in 1994.Neo on the other hand maintained that the
                        “Proxies” system was created by Lim and that Neo never knew of
                        the “Salary Accruals” account or ledger until after he sacked
                        Lim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     It is
                        common ground that AZ was set up in 1997 and was owned by Lim. Neo said Lim
                        advised him to set up another entity so that if anything happened in CHKC,
                            <em>i.e</em>. be it regulatory issues or too many
                        accidents involving workmen, there would be another company, not connected
                        to Neo, with a track record of construction work with its own
                        ‘foreign’ employees, who could take over CHKC’s project;
                        Neo said that he agreed to the setting up of AZ and to the assigning of some
                        projects to AZ provided CHKC would be put in the same position as if there
                        had been no such assignment, since they were only ‘notional
                        assignments’ for a specific purpose and AZ would not profit from the
                        projects. Lim on the other hand said that around 1997 he wanted to leave
                        CHKC to set up his own construction company, however, Neo asked him not to
                        do so and, <em>inter alia</em>, offered to let him set
                        up AZ and to assign some of CHKC’s projects to it so that Lim could
                        carry out ‘work’ in AZ and continue to work in CHKC; Lim alleged
                        that 11 projects were thus assigned to AZ;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neo alleged that his personal cheques totalling
                        $5,404,241.06 and CHKC’s cheques totalling $2,080,000 were
                        misappropriated by Lim; Lim denied this, and alleged that they were given to
                        him to settle fictitious invoices issued by CHKC to AZ for works purportedly
                        done by CHKC for AZ when no such works were in fact done; Lim alleged that
                        these fictitious invoices were issued by CHKC to inflate its profits, and
                        therefore CHH’s profits, to enable the latter to be
                    listed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Insofar as the other witnesses were concerned, they
                    were mainly corroborative. None of them were present when the important schemes
                    and issues, including the foregoing, were discussed or decided upon by Neo and
                    Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On Lim’s side, in addition to his giving
                    evidence, 27 other witnesses were lined up to give evidence. On Neo’s
                    side, there was Neo himself and 19 other witnesses. Some of these witnesses were
                    subpoenaed as they refused to give an affidavit. I am indebted to both counsel
                    who very sensibly assessed which witnesses were really necessary and which were
                    not, thereby eliminating from each side a large number of witnesses whose
                    evidence would have been peripheral. For those who had filed AEICs but were not
                    cross-examined, their statements were admitted in accordance with the agreement
                    made between the solicitors. By very sensible and co-operative discussions,
                    assessment and time-management decisions, counsel managed to finish the mass of
                    evidence in 6 weeks of hearing. I am also indebted to counsel who assisted me
                    greatly in understanding the evidence by drawing up numerous charts collating
                    and containing the key information, including the contentions, and the source
                    documents. They were also very useful during cross-examination. I should also
                    mention I asked counsel about an issue that often arises during trials of this
                    nature, where the documents are voluminous and evidence ranges over a wide area
                    – the treatment of evidence in the bundles admitted without formal proof
                    but without necessarily agreeing to their contents but which are not touched
                    upon by either side. Counsel agreed with me that if documents are in the agreed
                    bundles, <em>i.e</em>. they are admitted without formal
                    proof, but the contents are not necessarily agreed to and subject to challenge
                    or comment, and if neither side cross-examines on the contents of that document
                    or challenges the same in submissions or comments thereon, then if I found it
                    relevant, I was entitled to consider and take the contents of that document into
                    account, decide what weight to place on the same and to draw my own conclusions,
                    bearing in mind however that it had not been tested in cross-examination or
                    otherwise been the subject of some debate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As noted, on many of the crucial issues, there
                    were only two people involved in discussion or decision making, Neo and Lim.
                    Consequently, many of the witnesses were peripheral or corroborative rather than
                    crucial. The witnesses of some note on Lim’s side were:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My findings on facts generally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Both Lim and Neo were cross-examined for
                    approximately 9 days each. In general, except for specific issues which I shall
                    refer to under those separate issues, having heard the witnesses and considered
                    the evidence, where there is a conflict of evidence as between Lim and Neo, I
                    generally prefer and accept that of Lim’s over Neo’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Neo’s case is that after he hired Lim,
                    he left the entire running of CHKC to Lim. He even left the running of the
                    accounts department to Lim. He did not know what was really going in CHKC, what
                    was happening on the ground and he only retained the big picture. Neo said he
                    was busy with his other businesses. He trusted Lim completely. Whatever he was
                    asked to sign cheques or documents, so long as Lim approved it or signed on the
                    voucher, he would just sign without asking questions. He would not check. He
                    treated Lim like his younger brother. Neo said he and his wife even bought Lim
                    his favourite durians and brought it to his house. Such was the level of his
                    trust in and bond with Lim. After their big quarrel in October 2006, Neo
                    then said he was surprised that “a mere salaried employee” could
                    have amassed sums in excess of $7 million to “lend” to CHKC and
                    after he dismissed Lim, he formed an investigation team to look into the
                    accounts and affairs of CHKC and was shocked to find Lim had misappropriated
                    monies well in excess of $40 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Under cross-examination Neo was often
                    combative and evasive, resorting to his main theme –
                    <em>i.e</em>. that he trusted Lim and left the entire
                    running of CHKC to Lim, he did not know what was going on – instead of
                    answering the question. Even on straightforward questions he would feign a
                    misunderstanding, give an irrelevant answer or revert to this main theme until I
                    intervened and repeated the question; it was only then that Neo would answer or
                    attempt to answer the question. Neo would also anticipate counsel’s
                    questions. I found Neo not forthright in his answers. Neo was often caught out
                    by inconsistencies in his evidence before me and his earlier evidence given to a
                    number of judges, both in the Subordinate and High Courts, as well as in the
                    numerous affidavits he had affirmed in these and other related proceedings. When
                    he was caught out, he would twist and turn, telling one untruth after another,
                    without compunction and without remembering what his original answer was or what
                    he said in an earlier affidavit or evidence he had given earlier in other
                    related proceedings. Neo could change his evidence at a drop of a hat. When he
                    was cornered in cross-examination, especially on a similar or related subject,
                    surprising admissions emerge, <em>e.g</em>. during his
                    cross-examination, after repeatedly and strenuously denying any profit sharing
                    arrangement with Lim, this occurred:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

                            therefore you wanted to bring him into the company; isn’t that

                            you was so great, <em>you were prepared to share profits
                                with him</em> and to allow him to run the company alongside
                            Chip Hup Hup Kee because you were concerned about Mr Lim Leong Huat
                            no longer remaining in your company, agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Before me Neo insisted Lim told him not to override the accounting
                    system Lim had put in place and Neo faithfully followed Lim’s
                        instructions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Yet in a related case, DAC
                    15743/08 (which involved a criminal charge against LLC arising from police
                    reports filed against him by CHKC), Neo gave the following evidence:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... Based on what you have just told us, regarding
                            the groceries and all that, did you, as the big boss of Chip Hup Hup Kee
                            give instructions to your staff, like [Aileen] Khoo, to override any
                            existing company procedure? …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">When confronted with this contradictory evidence, Neo first
                    disagreed it was contradictory. Then he claimed: “I gave the wrong
                    answer” and later said he “misunderstood.” In fact at the
                    top of the transcript page referred to above, the learned District Judge in DAC
                    15743/08 had said to Neo: “[Counsel] is asking X and you are answering Y.
                    I am writing down the answers, it does not look very good for you. Do you
                    understand?” An example of Neo’s refusal to answer simple questions
                    can be seen in this exchange:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">I set out this exchange also because it was not just a question of
                    semantics. Neo’s case and Aileen’s evidence in support was that Lim
                    had a stranglehold on the accounts department and any information there.
                    Lim’s instructions to the accounts staff was that if Neo queried anything
                    about the accounts, the accounts staff were not to answer Neo without checking
                    with Lim first. Yet there was evidence to show that Neo could give instructions
                    to, and get information or documents directly from the accounts department.
                    Before me, Juliet admitted that there were times when Neo made grocery
                    reimbursement claims and although he did not submit bills amounting to the sum
                    he drew out, the accounts department would make payment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lim on the other hand was more forthright.
                    When it came to difficult questions, he would answer them. When faced with
                    something he had said earlier which was untrue, he would accept the same and
                    apologise. At times his answers were convoluted and difficult to accept, but he
                    did not become as combative and evasive as Neo often did. Having said that, Lim
                    is no angel either, he knew full well that he and Neo were up to their necks in
                    various schemes in CHKC which were clearly wrong and illegal, but his only
                    saving grace was that he apologised each time it came up without being too
                    evasive or telling blatant lies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I also weighed what Neo or Lim told me against
                    whatever reliable documentary, objective or contemporaneous evidence there is as
                    well as the evidence as a whole. Given the history of this dispute, it is not
                    surprising that I did not accept the evidence of either Neo or Lim wholesale.
                    Because of reasons I shall come to, neither can I accept the evidence of the
                    witnesses of each side without carefully considering not only what they are
                    saying, but to ask whether their evidence is consistent, truthful, reliable and
                    whether they display or have any motive for coming forward and taking sides. It
                    would be naïve to think that in a den of thieves, those lower down the pecking
                    order, and who see what was going on, would not succumb to temptation to dip
                    their hands in the till as well nor can I ignore the probability that loyal
                    lieutenants were rewarded with a share of the bounty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18-p2_19"></a>19     This bruising war between Neo and
                        Lim has a longer history than most actions today. Since Lim’s summary
                        dismissal in November 2006, there have been numerous related suits and
                        actions, including a criminal prosecution against LLC referred to above at
                        [16]. There are already a number of judgments rendered in these related
                        actions as well as the numerous applications in this action. It is clear to
                        me, and I so find, having heard and considered the evidence, that Neo first
                        tried to get witnesses to testify against Lim, and if they refused or
                        decided to give evidence for Lim, he went after them if it was at all
                        possible, with a vengeance. This can be seen when Neo first approached Yeow
                        on 1 February 2007 to testify on his side against Lim; Yeow taped their
                        conversation and the transcript clearly shows this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You said you did not take the money. You did not take the money, Right, I
                        know you did not take it. You do not have the guts to take the money, You
                        are just the scapegoat. I can let you speak, I can let you, I can help you,
                        I can do not pursue this. I have the magnanimity. … You stand on my
                        side, you can testify against him, I will forget about it. Otherwise when
                        this goes on, you must explain things. Be it to the court, or anyone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The following are some of the related proceedings initiated by
                    Neo:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neo sued Yeow in Suit No 136 of
                        2007 (and related Suit No 137 of 2007) for damages for conversion in
                        relation to 3 cheques, moneys had and received and ancillary reliefs;
                        although judgment was entered against Yeow at first instance, on appeal, the
                        Court of Appeal agreed that the wrong party was suing as Plaintiff and the
                        judgment was set aside; a subsequent action by CHKC against Yeow in Suit
                        No 4717 of 2009 and Originating Summons No 804 of 2009 was
                        dismissed by Andrew Ang J on 17 March 2010 as being
                        time-barred;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Neo caused CHKC to lodge a police report against LLC, who also worked in
                        CHKC. LLC was charged in DAC 15743/08 and after a trial, (the transcript of
                        which was referred to in the present action to show up Neo and his
                        witnesses’ false testimony), LLC was acquitted;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neo caused CHKC to sue Jean in Suit
                        No 142 of 2007; Jean gave evidence on behalf of Lim in this action;
                        this action is yet to be heard;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Neo caused CHKC to sue LLC in Suit No 165 of 2007
                        for misappropriation of 7 cash cheques, an account for CHKC’s plant
                        and machinery entrusted to him, an account for monies received for the
                        disposal of CHKC’s plant and machinery, failure to account for the
                        sale of scrap material and failure to exercise reasonable care and diligence
                        in the maintenance of CHKC’s warehouse; this action was dismissed with
                        costs by Kan Ting Chiu J on 5 February 2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_e"></a>(e)     Neo lodged a police report
                        in February 2007, alleging misappropriation of CHKC and his money. Lim
                        was investigated for criminal breaches of trust as a director; on
                        28 October 2008, the police wrote to Lim stating: “…in
                        consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the police have
                        decided not to take action against [him]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Neo also caused Mdm Tan to be sued personally in the counterclaim. Where
                    available, the notes of evidence in some of these proceedings and the affidavits
                    of the numerous interlocutory proceedings were used in cross-examination of Neo
                    and Lim and I found some of these references helpful in assessing the probity of
                    the witnesses in this action. As noted above, Neo’s evidence in this
                    action was very adversely affected by what he had said or deposed to in these
                    earlier proceedings, earlier affidavits and interlocutory applications. I shall
                    refer to them in more detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the reasons set out in this judgment, I
                    reject Neo’s evidence that he left everything to Lim, did not know what
                    was happening in CHKC and only found out a lot of alleged wrong-doing after he
                    summarily dismissed Lim and formed a ‘task force’ to piece together
                    what was going on in CHKC and AZ. All these three aspects are completely untrue.
                    The following findings and facts can be conveniently made here.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     His claim that he did not know about
                        the Salary Accruals after drawing millions of dollars out of that account
                        defies belief, and I find that he not only knew about the Salary Accruals,
                        he together with Lim were instrumental in setting it up.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Throughout this period, from the time
                        he recruited Lim, through the growth of the company, right up to the time he
                        summarily dismissed Lim, Neo was <em>the only one</em>
                        with the authority to sign cheques in CHKC. Despite claiming that he was so
                        busy with his other businesses, he <em>never</em>
                        allowed anyone else to sign cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     When asked the inevitable question, if he trusted Lim so
                        much, left Lim in total control of and to run CHKC, including total control
                        of the accounts department, so much so that he had to ask Lim if he wanted
                        to draw out any money, and if he was so busy with his other businesses, why
                        did he not allow Lim to be a cheque signatory? His rather pathetic response
                        was: “I would… if he requested. …since he didn’t
                        make the request I would take it that it is not necessary.” (see [61]
                        below). The look Neo had on his face when forced to give that rather feeble
                        excuse said it all, he had been hoisted on his own
                    petard.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     It has been
                        noted that around the end of October 2006, Neo and Lim had a big quarrel.
                        Just before this, Neo said in his AEIC that Lim produced a print-out showing
                        a cash flow deficit of $483,000 for CHKC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Neo’s
                        evidence was that he looked at it and pointed out an entry for payment of
                        $36,143.51 to a company called Khoon Engineering and protested that the
                        print-out was wrong because CHKC had made payment to Khoon Engineering two
                        days earlier. To remember a payment of only $36,143.51, out of a whole list
                        of 25 items, when it was made and to which entity is, by any measure, quite
                        remarkable for a man who says he did not know what was going on and that he
                        signed cheques blindly. More than that, when Neo went on in an almost
                        uncontrolled outburst in recounting their big quarrel, he unwittingly showed
                        he knew a lot of details in relation to the cash flow and operations –
                        Neo could say that an entity called Welltech had a joint venture with CHKC
                        and that project was subcontracted to another company called Qing Dao; and
                        that Khoon Engineering was a subcontractor for that project and there had
                        been a payment of some $360,000 to $370,000, and therefore the payment to
                        Khoon Engineering should come out of that payment that was in relation to
                        Qing Dao and should not affect CHKC’s cash flow.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     I find that Neo was an experienced and
                        savvy businessman. He had previous experience in the family and other
                        businesses well before 1994. I find that he was careful with money and hence
                        no one else was allowed to sign cheques in CHKC. I find that someone like
                        Neo did not sign cash cheques or cheques with large sums and no payee
                        inserted without him knowing what they were for.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_f"></a>(f)     Similarly, Neo said that he trusted
                        Lim so much, yet he considered Lim ‘a mere employee’ whom he
                        could replace quite easily. Neo cannot have his cake and eat it. Lim was
                        either very capable or he was not and easily replaceable. If he was the
                        latter, then I find it hard to understand why Neo would trust Lim so much
                        and leave the running of CHKC and its accounts completely to Lim. The
                        objective evidence shows that Lim was a very capable person when it came to
                        construction work and running construction projects. There is clear enough
                        evidence that Lim’s successor, hired by Neo, was nowhere as capable
                        and I find that on the evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_f-p3_i"></a>(i)       CHKC’s subcontract
                            with Chip Eng Seng Contractors (1988) Pte Ltd on the large Duxton Plain

                            Sands Integrated Resort project was terminated as a result of
                            CHKC’s inability to perform and poor quality work: see the
                            affidavit of Kim Jong Min dated 3 June 2008 in Suit 379 of 2008
                            where Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Co Ltd sued
                        CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the course of his evidence, Neo said he
                    found it shocking that a “mere employee” could find so much money
                    to lend CHKC. Before me, Neo claimed that Lim was easily replaceable, did not
                    help CHKC become profitable because Lim had no connections, did not bring in the
                    business and played a small part in the growth of CHKC. Neo said it was the
                    Chinese workers who earned the money for CHKC. These claims, like his claim of
                    not knowing what was going on in CHKC, were nothing but an act for the purposes
                    of this action. Neo forgot what he told Lai Siu Chiu J in Suit No 136
                    of 2007 on 11 March 2009. The transcript there reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">I have found that Lim enabled CHKC to dramatically increase its
                    revenues once he came on board. The figures at [8] above speak for themselves.
                    Would Lim continue to work for Neo if his only remuneration was some $7,000 a
                    month, $200,000 bonus a year and some expenses and perks, like provision of a
                    car? It is obvious that Lim’s only reward for his good work was money. Lim
                    was never offered any and did not hold a single share in CHKC or Neo’s
                    related companies. Even when Neo was thinking of re-structuring his companies
                    for a listing, no question of giving Lim a share in the companies
                arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At this juncture, I set out one of the main
                    schemes of manipulation that was carried out in CHKC. To mislead the MOM on the
                    number of CHKC’s local employees, CHKC made up a large list of apparent
                    local employees which were euphemistically called “Proxies” in
                    CHKC. They were not real employees. They never came to CHKC’s office and
                    did not do any work whatsoever for CHKC. These Proxies were relatives or close
                    friends of Neo, Lim and some of their employees. There was even a form generated
                    in CHKC to set out the relevant details of these Proxies and this included their
                    proper names, NRIC numbers, addresses and who ‘introduced’ them to
                    the Proxy list. CHKC faithfully paid the employer’s and employees’
                    portion of the CPF contributions of these Proxies every month to the CPF. But
                    they were not otherwise paid any salary. The Proxies went along because they had
                    extra contributions to their CPF accounts for free. This inflated employee list
                    enabled CHKC to obtain a higher quota of foreign workers from MOM. The
                    “notional salaries” which would have been paid, had these Proxies
                    been real employees, less the CPF contributions were then credited into a Salary
                    Accruals account or ledger. Neo, and later, Lim, drew out millions of dollars
                    from this Salary Accruals account on the basis that they had personally paid
                    these ‘employees’ their salaries and were seeking reimbursement from
                    CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I find that CHKC was able to leverage off this
                    cheaper Chinese labour thereby making large profits from their project work and
                    enabled Neo and Lim, through diverse ways and means, to siphon off a significant
                    portion of these profits through, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    Salary Accruals and other “expenses” without having to account for
                    these sums as profits and therefore evade tax. There is sufficient evidence, and
                    I so find, that Neo contributed a large number of names for this
                    “Proxy” list. His own witness, Juliet, said clearly, not once but
                    twice, that Neo contributed a large number of the Proxies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It is quite incredible for Neo to claim
                    he did not know that this was going on. Anyone, even with only a modicum of
                    arithmetical ability, will know that such large profits in the Salary Accruals
                    available for distribution and the low profits each year in the accounts just do
                    not add up. Neo says it was Lim who dreamt up this scheme and Lim says it was
                    Neo because when he joined CHKC it was already in place. I will deal more with
                    the “Proxies” and Salary Accruals systems below at
                    [121]–[128].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I also make the following findings. About 3
                    years or so after Lim joined CHKC, in or around 1996 or 1997, Lim wanted to
                    leave and set up his own business. It will be recalled from [8] above, that
                    CHKC’s revenue leapt from $6.6 million in 1994 to $59.5 million in 1997
                    and to $78.8 million in 1998; (it is noteworthy that in Neo’s Opening
                    Statement, he recounted that between 1997 to 2006, CHKC was engaged in about 60
                    construction projects with a total contract value of $543 million). I accept
                    that to entice Lim to stay, Neo offered Lim a profit sharing deal as Lim has
                    alleged. Neo also allowed Lim to set up AZ as Lim’s own vehicle to work on
                    some projects and allowed Lim to draw out money from CHKC, like Neo was, through
                    various channels. I reject Neo’s version that he allowed AZ to be set up
                    provided it routed all its profits back to CHKC as if no assignment had taken
                    place. Between the two of them, CHKC was the cash cow generating huge sums of
                    money which were available tax free. It would be totally in keeping with
                    Neo’s character to ensure Lim also had a share of the spoils, not only to
                    keep him working for Neo, but also because neither could have a hold or tell on
                    the other as they were both in the same boat as far as the authorities were
                    concerned. I therefore find that Lim had the means to lend money to CHKC when it
                    required money. When Mdm Tan was under cross-examination I asked her to
                    show me her CDP Statements. She did so and I was satisfied she had the means to
                    make loans to CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I also find that around 2003, CHKC started
                    facing cash flow and financial difficulties. This coincided with a downturn in
                    the construction industry. Lim put forward an accounting expert, Mr Aw Eng
                    Hai, whose evidence was, in the event, not pivotal. But Mr Aw produced a
                    chart which convincingly showed that from about May 2003 onwards, the amount of
                    CHKC’s cheques which had not been presented for payment, increased
                        dramatically.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> CHKC
                    had a system of issuing cheques but not releasing them to payees until there
                    were sufficient funds to honour those cheques. This increase in cheques not
                    presented shows it was taking longer for these cheques to be paid.
                    Mr Aw’s evidence was largely unshaken by cross examination. In fact
                    Neo accepted this was a valid indication of a cash flow problem in an earlier
                        affidavit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> CHKC’s
                    own witnesses, Wendy Loh Chen Yi, Aileen, and one Raymond Lee, also testified
                    that CHKC did not pay any more substantial bonuses from 2002 to 2003 and they
                    instead received red packets of a few hundred dollars. I now turn to deal with
                    the individual claims and counterclaims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Claims and Counterclaims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s claim</p>

                        by Lim to CHKC over the period 2003–2006 to alleviate CHKC’s
                        cash flow problems; and</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Lim has an alternative claim for $6,405,000 in
                    respect of dishonoured cheques issued by CHKC to secure his advances to it. Lim
                    also claims, as against CHKC and Neo, damages for conspiring to injure and
                    defraud him by inducing CHKC to breach its obligations to (i) repay the sum of
                    $7,205,000 to Lim and (ii) pay Lim the COF compensation.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Having listed the various claims and
                    counterclaims, I now proceed to review the evidence and set out my findings on
                    each claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lim’s claim for $7,205,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Lim’s case is that CHKC was experiencing
                    financial difficulties starting from 2002 due to the general downturn in the
                    construction industry. Thus, from about July 2003 to September 2006, at
                    Neo’s request, Lim advanced various interest free loans ranging from
                    $25,000 to $500,000 to CHKC. These loans were made mostly through cheques
                    although a cash sum of $100,000 was provided in one instance. For each loan made
                    to CHKC, Neo (on behalf of CHKC) would personally sign a cheque for the
                    corresponding amount and give it to Lim to hold as security for
                    repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     By September 2006, the total value of
                    Lim’s loans to CHKC amounted to $7,635,000, of which $430,000 was
                    subsequently repaid, leaving a balance of $7,205,000. When Lim subsequently
                    demanded the return of all outstanding monies during their big quarrel in
                    October 2006, Neo refused. Lim was subsequently suspended from employment by
                    CHKC on 9 November 2006. On 15 November 2006, Lim presented some of
                    the cheques CHKC had given him as security for payment, but all the cheques were
                    dishonoured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     CHKC did not dispute that Lim had lent the sum
                    of $7,205,000 to it. CHKC accepted that $7,635,000 had been credited to its
                    account by Lim and CHKC made repayment of $430,000. But CHKC argued that it was
                    entitled to treat the $7,205,000 as part restitution of monies which Lim had
                    misappropriated from it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Further, CHKC’s case is
                    that if Lim had not misappropriated the sums set out at [28] above, there would
                    have been no cash flow problems and CHKC would not have had to borrow any money
                    from Lim. CHKC’s defence against Lim’s claim for $7,205,000 is
                    therefore dependent solely on its counterclaim against Lim. In the event that
                    CHKC does not succeed in proving Lim misappropriated those sums of money set out
                    in its counterclaim, it would be liable to repay the $7,205,000 to Lim as CHKC
                    admits the existence of the debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lim’s claim for COF compensation</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Lim’s case is that by 30 September
                    2004, he had advanced about $5.93m in loans to CHKC, of which $3.75m was
                    outstanding. At a meeting between Lim and Neo on 30 September 2004, Neo
                    informed Lim that CHKC would be unable to repay the outstanding loans for the
                    immediate future. Lim and Neo (on behalf of CHKC) then orally agreed that Lim
                    should be compensated for the cost of procuring the funds to loan to CHKC. Under
                    the terms of this oral agreement, CHKC would pay to Lim the sum of $16,800 per
                    month starting from 1 October 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The figure of $16,800 per month was arrived at
                    through the following method:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     The average sum advanced by Lim to
                        CHKC in the form of loans for the period August 2003 – September 2004
                        was computed to be $4.84m, being the average of $5.93m and
                    $3.75m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lim and Neo
                        then estimated the value of individual loans made to CHKC within this
                        14-month period and calculated the monthly COF compensation for that
                        individual loan based on the corresponding estimated interest rates for that
                        period. This is illustrated in the following table:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The monthly sums of $16,800, $4,800, $4,375
                    and $6,751 were paid to Lim through regularly issued cash cheques. The one-off
                    payments from November 2005 to June 2006 described in [38] above were also made
                    to Lim through cash cheques of $10,000 each. All these payments were not
                    recorded in CHKC’s accounts as payments to Lim, but were instead disguised
                    through the issuance of payment vouchers as payments to entirely fictitious
                    subcontractors named “Khor Ah Teck”, “Liu Bi Yu”,
                    “Shi Chun Bing” and “Peng Chao”. Lim’s
                    explanation was that CHKC’s accounts did not reflect the existence of the
                    loans made by Lim to CHKC, because the cheques issued by CHKC as security for
                    the loans were already treated in CHKC’s accounts as being already paid to
                        Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lim alleged that CHKC suddenly ceased paying
                    the monthly COF compensation from September 2006. Lim therefore claims the sums
                    of $16,800, $4,800, $4,375 and $6,751 per month from October 2006 until CHKC
                    repays the principal loan of $7,205,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     CHKC’s position on this issue was one of
                    bare denial. It denied that any oral agreement ever existed between Lim and Neo
                    for CHKC to pay COF compensation. In fact, CHKC is also counterclaiming against
                    Lim for the sum of $747,536 being the value of cash payments made to fictitious
                    subcontractors, but were allegedly misappropriated by Lim. CHKC’s case is
                    that Lim is belatedly raising the COF compensation claim as a fabricated defence
                    against CHKC’s counterclaim of $747,536 for payments made to fictitious
                    subcontractors. This counterclaim of $747,536 forms part of CHKC’s
                    counterclaim of $2,300,416 against Lim as described in [28(c)]
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Having considered the evidence, I find that
                    Lim has not proved an oral agreement between him and CHKC for the latter to pay
                    COF compensation as alleged and pleaded by Lim. My reasons are as follows.
                    First, I find Lim’s entire story behind the computation of the initial COF
                    compensation sum of $16,800 to be unnecessarily convoluted. Lim had stated
                    during cross-examination that he had obtained the funds to lend to CHKC from
                    various sources <em>e.g</em>. relatives, Mdm Tan, and
                    bank overdrafts. Lim thus estimated the interest rate for his COF compensation
                    based on his source of funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> For example, he would arrive at 2% for
                    loans from relatives, 3% for loans from Mdm Tan (based on her bank
                    mortgage), and 5.75% for the overdraft facilities. However, Lim also admitted
                    during cross-examination that all these monies had been mixed up in his bank
                        account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> All his loans to CHKC were
                    made in the form of cheques drawn on his bank account. In these circumstances, I
                    find it very artificial for Lim to estimate the loans he made for various
                    periods from August 2003 to September 2004 and assign an interest rate
                    to each period. It is noteworthy that one of Lim’s brothers-in-law,
                    Mr Poh Geok Seng, who lent Lim $400,000 for one or two months said he did
                    not charge any interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Secondly, there were inconsistencies in
                    Lim’s own evidence. Based on the table of estimated loans provided at
                    [36(b)] above, Lim had allegedly lent the sum of $1m to CHKC by August 2003
                    at a rate of 5.75%. However, Lim’s own AEIC shows that the total value of
                    cheques he had drawn in CHKC’s favour at the end of August 2003 was
                    $430,000, of which $130,000 had been repaid by mid-August.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> When Lim was pressed
                    on this point during cross-examination, his answer was that the figure of $1m
                    was an estimate,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> which I find to be
                    quite circular and evasive. Lim further testified in cross-examination that the
                    table of estimated loans had been typed out by Aileen,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> but this point was never
                    disclosed in his AEIC, nor was it put to Aileen when she was
                    cross-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Finally, Lim had only given details for
                    computing the initial COF compensation of $16,800. When CHKC’s counsel
                    asked him during cross-examination as to how he arrived at the additional
                    monthly sums of $4,800, $4,375 and $6,751, Lim could only say that he and Neo
                    arrived at those sums by basing each additional loan he made on an estimated
                    flat rate of about 5.75%.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> However, I note that when Lim lent
                    CHKC $1,185,000 from July 2005 to August 2005, the additional COF compensation
                    was calculated to be $4,375. Yet, when he subsequently lent CHKC $1,165,000 from
                    August 2005 to October 2005, for a substantially similar amount of money, the
                    additional COF compensation was calculated to be $6,751. Lim explained in
                    cross-examination that the additional monthly sums took into consideration
                    monies which CHKC had already repaid to him, but he was unable to recall how
                    much he was repaid.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> I find it very odd that Lim
                    could give so many details on calculating the initial COF compensation of
                    $16,800 but not have any figures when it came to computing the other monthly
                    sums. I also find it odd that Lim arrived at the figure of $16,800 by rounding
                    down from $16,837.50 “for convenience”, and yet he did not round
                    down the additional COF sums of $4,375 and $6,751 when they were agreed
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Taking all the above factors into account, it
                    is my view that the scheme for computing the various COF sums was contrived and
                    designed, with the benefit of hindsight, to match the sums of $16,800, $4,800,
                    $4,375 and $6,751 being paid by CHKC to the fictitious subcontractors on a
                    regular basis. Reviewing Lim’s formula to calculate the sum of $16,800,
                    for example, gave me a strong feeling that this figure of $16,800 was first
                    arrived at, and that someone had worked backwards to construct a formula which
                    would bring in the other sums he had lent to CHKC from August 2003 –
                    September 2004. This would explain why Lim’s method of computation was so
                    artificial and convoluted. I therefore do not accept that Lim has discharged his
                    burden of proof in proving that there was an oral agreement as alleged by him in
                    his pleadings for CHKC to pay COF compensation until his loans to CHKC were
                    repaid. However, like some of the issues in this trial, I had to deal with
                    half-truths told by each side. I find that there were some interest payments
                    made to Lim for some of the funds he raised, especially from third parties. CHKC
                    did pay Lim various sums as “interest” on his loans; it is just
                    that Lim has not proved, on a balance of probabilities, the amounts he is
                    claiming. I accept the evidence of Lim’s brother-in-law, Dr Wong Wei
                    Khiang, who came across as a witness of truth and who came through
                    cross-examination unscathed, that when his initial interest-free loan turned
                    into a longer term loan, Lim agreed to pay him interest at the same rate that
                    Standard Chartered Bank would have given Dr Wong <em>i.e</em>. 2% per annum. However Dr Wong’s loan was a
                    modest $200,000. He was paid interest of $4,000 per annum from around the third
                    quarter of 2003. He has not received any interest from 2007 to date and his
                    principal has also not been repaid to date. CHKC’s Manual Cashbook also
                    disclosed that there were 5 entries amounting to $23,150 in 2005 in 2005, in
                    Aileen’s handwriting, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">This contradicts Aileen’s evidence in chief at [84(g)] and is
                    one of many instances of inconsistencies, (especially as it was in her own
                    handwriting), which led me to reject Aileen’s evidence as being totally
                    unreliable. For the avoidance of doubt, I also find that Neo did sign those
                    repetitive cheques, like the $16,800, knowingly, see eg, the Manual Cashbook, 3
                    EAB 11 at p.8572, where there is a similar entry carrying the description:
                    “Cash Lim Leong Huat … $16,800”. Neo, as already noted
                    above, is not someone who signs cheques without knowing what they are for. I
                    accept and find that there were some interest payments made to Lim by CHKC, and
                    that it was agreed to by Neo, but Lim has not proved what these sums were.
                    Lim’s legal team only identified the 5 payments of $4,800 and $4,375 from
                    June to September 2005 set out in “PWB-49” with Mr Khoo
                    saying “… we have identified at least five examples of
                    that.” Given the thoroughness of the legal teams, I doubt if there are
                    others. I have not found any other similar entries in 3 EAB 11 (the Manual
                    Cashbook) These payments were therefore not as regular and over as long a period
                    as Lim has alleged. And the burden of proof is on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Accordingly, this does not mean that
                    CHKC’s counterclaim of $747,536 against Lim for the return of monies
                    already paid to him (but recorded as payments to fictitious subcontractors) is
                    automatically made out. I will deal with this issue along with the rest of
                    CHKC’s counterclaims in more detail below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHKC’s counterclaim for misappropriated cheques</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>

                    2003, Lim had represented to Neo that CHKC was facing cash flow problems. Neo
                    was thus induced to make loans totalling $6,084,741.06 to CHKC by handing Lim
                    signed cheques from his personal account, with the name of the payee left
                        blank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Instead of depositing Neo’s

                    $2,080,000 which were meant to repay Neo’s loans to CHKC. Instead of
                    paying those cheques to Neo, Lim had caused them to be deposited into his or

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s Citibank cheque for $300,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Lim and Mdm Tan stated in their AEICs
                    that the latter had originally made a loan of $300,000 to CHKC by way of OUB
                    cheque No 263904 dated 29 January 2002. In exchange, CHKC through Neo
                    issued its UOB cheque No 341396 for the same amount as security for
                    repayment. However, Neo subsequently changed his mind about using CHKC’s
                    UOB cheque for repayment and instead issued his personal cheque, being Citibank
                    cheque No 943909 for repayment of Mdm Tan’s loan. Lim then
                    instructed Jean to cancel CHKC’s UOB cheque but through a
                    misunderstanding, CHKC’s UOB cheque was instead banked into
                    Mdm Tan’s account on 8 February 2002. To rectify the error, Lim
                    issued OUB cheque No 263928 from Mdm Tan’s account on the same
                    day to repay CHKC for the mistaken overpayment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The final result was that the net balance
                    between CHKC and Lim/Mdm Tan was zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s UOB cheque for $380,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Lim asserted that AZ had made a loan of
                    $380,000 to CCPL and that Neo had given his UOB cheque No 112437 to Lim in
                    the knowledge that it was being used to repay the loan owed by
                CCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fictitious Invoices Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     According to Lim, Neo had plans to list
                    CHKC’s holding company, CHH, on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange
                    (“SGX”) sometime between 1998 and 2002. To meet SGX’s
                    listing requirement of a track record of cumulative consolidated pre-tax profits
                    over three years of operations, Neo needed to have a track record of profits and
                    planned to inflate the pre-tax profits of CHKC and CCPL to $7.5 million.
                    Accordingly, Neo hatched the Fictitious Invoices Scheme for CHKC and CCPL to
                    generate artificial revenue by issuing fictitious invoices to AZ and various
                    third parties. These invoices would be indirectly paid for by Neo and
                    CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Pursuant to this arrangement, CHKC and CCPL
                    issued fictitious invoices totalling $7,490,878.35, which were paid in the
                    following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     $4,396,977.30 was paid by AZ to CHKC
                        and CCPL in the form of cheques;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     $2,544,367.80 was set off against progress payments made
                        by CHKC to AZ in respect of work done by AZ for CHKC; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     $549,533.25 was paid by Lim to CHKC
                        and CCPL in the form of cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In order to conceal the real source of the
                    funds for the Fictitious Invoices Scheme, Neo’s and CHKC’s cheques
                    were credited into Lim’s, Mdm Tan’s and AZ’s bank
                    accounts, or cashed out. These monies were eventually used to reimburse Lim and
                    AZ for the payments they made to settle the fictitious invoices. Since the
                    Fictitious Invoices Scheme was designed to evade detection, individual cheques
                    issued by Neo/CHKC were not intended to match any particular invoice. As a
                    result, the total value of invoices issued ($7,490,878.35) was $6,137.29 more
                    than the total value of Neo’s and CHKC’s cheques ($7,484,741.06)
                    used to reimburse Lim and AZ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s Citibank cheque for $300,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Lim/Mdm Tan transferred $600,000 from
                    Mdm Tan’s account to CHKC by two OUB cheques of $300,000 each. In
                    return, CHKC’s UOB cheque for $300,000 was deposited into
                    Mdm Tan’s account. The issue therefore is whether the balance of
                    $300,000 owing to Mdm Tan had been repaid by CHKC separately. CHKC sought
                    to rely on an extract from an account named ‘ACA 25’ in its general
                        ledger<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> as evidence that the $300,000 owing to
                    Mdm Tan was recorded as a loan owing to Lim, which was repaid separately by
                    CHKC. Thus, CHKC argued that Neo’s Citibank cheque was misappropriated by
                    Lim and deposited into Mdm Tan’s account instead of being used to pay
                    off the $300,000 owing by CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The problem with CHKC’s evidence is that
                    this extract from ACA 25 which it relied on only appears to be a statement of
                    accounts between Lim and CHKC. It does not show, on balance, that the $300,000
                    owing to Mdm Tan was in fact paid to Lim. As Lim disputed that he was ever
                    paid this amount, CHKC should have adduced some evidence of payment like
                    receipts or bank records. Since CHKC did not adduce further evidence on this
                    point, I am unable to find that the balance of $300,000 owing to Mdm Tan
                    was paid off by CHKC to Lim. Consequently, I accept Lim’s evidence that
                    Neo’s Citibank cheque was used to repay the $300,000 owing to Mdm Tan
                    instead of being misappropriated by Lim. Therefore, CHKC’s counterclaim
                    for the $300,000 fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Neo’s UOB cheque for $380,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I have no trouble finding from the evidence
                    that Neo knew, and intended his UOB cheque for $380,000 to be a repayment of
                    AZ’s loan to CCPL. Neo admitted during cross-examination that he had
                    signed his UOB cheque for $380,000 after Lim had filled in AZ’s name as
                    the payee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Neo also
                    admitted, from his own AEIC, that he would pay attention to the name of the
                    payee written on his cheques and even question Lim why “Cash” was
                    written instead of CHKC’s name in some instances.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>
                    Therefore, Neo must have known and I so find that the cheque was meant to pay AZ
                    instead of CHKC. In my judgment, CHKC’s counterclaim for the $380,000
                    therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fictitious Invoices Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I now deal with the bulk of CHKC’s
                    counterclaim for misappropriated cheques. The crux of the dispute between the
                    parties in this area essentially turns on Lim’s word against Neo’s.
                    Neo denied any knowledge of the Fictitious Invoices Scheme and accused Lim of
                    starting the scheme to reduce AZ’s taxable income, while Lim maintained
                    that Neo was the mastermind behind the scheme. In the midst of all this
                    finger-pointing, I would note that it is not necessary for either party to
                    establish who exactly came up with the Fictitious Invoices Scheme. What is clear
                    to me, and I so find, is that both Neo and Lim were up to their necks in this
                    convoluted scheme and that what matters more is that Neo was well aware that his
                    and CHKC’s cheques were being used to further such a scheme. I would also
                    note that CHKC did not challenge Lim’s evidence that the $7,490,878.35
                    worth of fictitious invoices issued were all paid off to CHKC and
                CCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Having heard the evidence, I find that the
                    idea to list was Neo’s however the Fictitious Invoices Scheme was
                    something that was hatched by both Neo and Lim in furtherance of Neo’s
                    idea to list his company. I have no doubt that Neo was indeed aware of the
                    Fictitious Invoices Scheme when he was signing his and CHKC’s cheques. If
                    Neo really intended to make loans to CHKC, he would simply have filled in
                    CHKC’s name as the payee on his cheques instead of signing them in blank.
                    The converse would also have applied when Neo, as CHKC’s sole signatory,
                    was signing CHKC’s cheques as repayment for his loans. It was unbelievable
                    that Neo would have signed off on so many of his and CHKC’s cheques
                    without verifying where the money was being paid. Furthermore, the
                    directors’ loan account in CHKC’s audited accounts shows that Neo
                    actually made substantial loans to CHKC <em>after</em> and
                    not before 2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> As Neo
                    had signed off on all of CHKC’s accounts, it must have been clear to him
                    that any loans he purportedly made from 1999 – 2003 were not being paid to
                    CHKC. Lastly, Lim produced an extract from an account named ‘ACA 11’
                    in CHKC’s general ledger<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> which showed that Neo had actually
                    drawn a total of $6,440,438.48 from CHKC between 1 June 1999 and
                    31 May 2003, compared to $2,345,000 which he put into CHKC during the same
                    period. Obviously, Neo must have realised that CHKC had no cash flow problems
                    prior to 2003 if he was able to draw so much money out of the
                company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Despite this clear evidence, Neo continued to
                    maintain during the trial that he trusted Lim completely and simply signed
                    everything Lim put in front of him, be it cheques or audited accounts. As stated
                    earlier, I do not believe this story of Neo’s at all. Although he tried to
                    portray himself as a gullible boss who was easily misled by Lim, I find him to
                    be a very street-wise and shrewd businessman who did not trust people blindly.
                    Neo himself admitted during cross-examination that he was careful with his
                    personal cheques:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Neo, these are your personal cheques at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Since this is your personal account, it
                            doesn’t matter. The point is this: You would certainly be careful
                            about your personal account, wouldn’t you?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If that is the case, you would know whether or not

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since Neo was careful enough to ensure that he had the funds
                    available to honour his cheques, and having heard his evidence, I find that he
                    would also be careful about where his funds were going. Further Mr Khoo
                    produced an analysis,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> which
                    was not denied by Neo, to show that only 7.29% of the CHKC cheques were cash
                    cheques. I find that Neo was careful about signing cash cheques or cheques
                    without a payee and such cheques were for special purposes. Mr Khoo also
                    produced another analysis which showed a comparison between the Director’s
                    loan balances in the Audited Accounts for FY 1999 – FY 2006 and the amount
                    of Neo’s cheques allegedly misappropriated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> For example, FY 2000, the audited
                    accounts showed Neo’s director’s loan balance at $21,843 but the
                    amount of cheques ‘misappropriated’ was $400,000. Again for FY 2001,
                    the director’s loan balance was $50,591 but the amount of cheques
                    ‘misappropriated’ was $1,370,000 and the respective figures for FY
                    2002 and FY 2003 were $2,596 compared to $2,757,700 and $0 compared to
                    $1,157,041.06. It is clear to me beyond doubt that Neo <em>knew</em> his alleged “loans” to CHKC were <em>not</em> going into CHKC. Neo is not the kind of person who
                    would keep quiet for so many years if Lim was indeed
                    ‘misappropriating’ his money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The fact that Neo was the sole signatory for
                    CHKC’s cheques is also a very important indicator that Neo was careful
                    with CHKC’s finances. It is impossible to think he had designated himself
                    as CHKC’s sole signatory only to rubber-stamp every single cheque his
                    subordinates brought to him. As noted before, when Neo was cross-examined on why
                    he did not make Lim a signatory to CHKC’s accounts if he trusted Lim so
                    much, Neo gave the most incredible answer:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You blindly trusted all your general managers, and
                            you had so little time, and you had so many cheques to sign, why
                            didn’t you make them sole signatories in their own
                        right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">For my subsidiary Peter Tan did make the request

                            Here, just be the signatory and free me of this burden”. Why
                            didn’t it occur to you?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I would give the approval if he requested. Well,

<p class="Judg-1">I have no doubt that Neo was blatantly lying on this score. He
                    made himself the sole signatory for CHKC’s cheques because he did not
                    trust anyone else completely enough to give away that mandate. I do not believe
                    that he was signing his and CHKC’s cheques for four years without knowing
                    where the monies were going.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Neo also gave conflicting evidence regarding
                    the restructuring of the Chip Hup group of companies and the intended listing of
                    CHH. He first stated in his AEIC that he decided to restructure the Chip Hup
                    group in 1998 at Lim’s suggestion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> However, he then went
                    on to state that the main purpose of the restructuring was to enable him to take
                    over the shares of CH Timber from his late father’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> I
                    find it hard to reconcile these two positions because it is unlikely that Lim
                    would have suggested the idea of restructuring for a purpose which had
                    absolutely nothing to do with him. It seemed more likely to me that Neo was
                    trying to downplay the fact that listing was one of his main motives for
                    restructuring the Chip Hup group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Neo continued this strategy of downplaying his
                    ambition to list CHH during trial. He said that he had only considered listing
                    CHH in 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> However, this is
                    contradicted by his statutory declaration following the restructuring of the
                    Chip Hup group in 1998, which indicates that one of the reasons behind the
                    restructuring was to “[b]etter reflect the performance track record of
                    these [<em>sic</em>] group of companies with the view that
                    a public offer of any of these companies’ shares may be
                        made.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Neo’s evidence is also contradicted by
                    the testimony of his own witness, KK Lim, who was the former auditor for the
                    Chip Hup group of companies. KK Lim stated in his AEIC that Neo had actually
                    discussed the possibility of listing with him in 1999, in contrast to
                    Neo’s evidence that listing was only considered in 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>
                    Neo further tried to say it was Lim who was actively pursuing plans for an
                    initial public offering. When Lim’s counsel asked Neo why this allegation
                    was never included in any of his previous affidavits, Neo amazingly replied that
                    he had not mentioned it to his lawyers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> That was clearly another
                lie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In my view, Neo certainly gave a lot more
                    thought to the idea of listing CHH than he would have this Court believe. As
                    noted above, Lim did not own any shares in any of the companies nor was there
                    any hint that Lim would be given shares in due course. Neo, not Lim, was the
                    ultimate owner of the Chip Hup group of companies. He was the one who stood to
                    gain the most from a successful listing of CHH’s shares. I find it very
                    unlikely that he would have simply waited until 2000 before making inquiries
                    about listing when that was already one of the purposes for restructuring the
                    Chip Hup group in 1998. I find that Neo’s involvement definitely went
                    beyond just making inquiries with financial advisors. Neo was actively pursuing
                    his goal of a listing until he found he did not have the support of the banks to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Neo had deliberately concealed his knowledge
                    that his cheques were not being used as loans to CHKC, and had also downplayed
                    his involvement in plans to list CHH. The inference to be drawn from such
                    behaviour was that Neo was indeed aware of the Fictitious Invoices Scheme and
                    was trying to hide such awareness. Taking all the above factors into
                    consideration, I accept Lim’s evidence that Neo’s and CHKC’s
                    cheques totalling $7,484,741.06 were used to fund this scheme with Neo’s
                    knowledge instead of being misappropriated as CHKC alleges. Since Neo is a
                    director and ultimate owner of CHKC, I had no trouble in imputing his knowledge
                    to CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     I did not accept CHKC’s contention that
                    Lim alone had started the Fictitious Invoices Scheme behind Neo’s back to
                    reduce AZ’s taxable income. First, it would have been impossible for Lim
                    to pull off such a scheme without Neo finding out his cheques were being
                    misappropriated. Secondly, CHKC’s story does not explain why invoices
                    totalling $549,533.25 were issued to various third parties. These invoices were
                    all settled in cash by Lim and the third parties they were issued to (including
                    one entirely fictitious person named Aw Leong Hock) had no knowledge of the
                    existence of such invoices. Lim clearly had no reason to miss out on the alleged
                    tax savings from these invoices. On the whole, Lim’s version of events is
                    more consistent with the underlying facts that the fictitious invoices were only
                    issued between 1998 and 2002 (when plans to list were still in place), and that
                    the total value of the invoices very closely matched the value of Neo’s
                    and CHKC’s cheques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     For the foregoing reasons, I find that both
                    Neo and CHKC had knowingly issued cheques to fund the Fictitious Invoices Scheme
                    in pursuance of plans to list CHH. These monies have all been diverted back to
                    CHKC or CCPL and were not misappropriated by Lim or unlawfully retained by
                    Mdm Tan or AZ. Accordingly, I dismiss CHKC’s counterclaim against Lim
                    for $5,404,741.06 and $2,080,000. CHKC’s counterclaims against
                    Mdm Tan and AZ on this issue must similarly fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHKC’s counterclaim for payments to fictitious
                subcontractors</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     CHKC’s case is that during his
                    employment with it, Lim had caused CHKC to issue cheques totalling $2,300,416
                    purportedly as payments to third party subcontractors by the names of Lim Kim
                    Kow, Tan Yong Moi and Tan Chuan Aik for work done on CHKC’s
                        projects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> These payments
                    were supported by interim payment sheets. CHKC subsequently discovered that the
                    subcontractors in question were either non-existent or did not work on
                    CHKC’s projects as appeared, and that the interim payment sheets were sham
                    documents prepared by Jean and approved by Lim. CHKC counterclaims against Lim
                    for misappropriating its cheques, which comprised of the sums of $1,552,880 (in
                    the form of cheques made out to these fictitious subcontractors) and $747,536
                    (in the form of cash cheques).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Lim’s original defence was that the
                    monies in question were indeed paid to third party subcontractors for works done
                    on CHKC’s various projects. Lim even went so far as to provide a Schedule
                    D (which Lim subsequently had to delete from his pleadings), listing out the
                    various subcontractors involved, the names of the projects they were working on,
                    and the dates of the individual payments. On 22 October 2007, CHKC
                    successfully obtained summary judgment against Lim in Registrar’s Appeal
                    No 159 of 2007 (“RA 159/2007”) for the sum of $347,030
                    (forming part of its $2,300,416 counterclaim) by producing cheque images showing
                    that $347,030 worth of cheques had been credited to Lim’s account. Lim had
                    chosen not to file an affidavit in support of his original defence at the
                    hearing for summary judgment even though this meant that CHKC was likely to
                    succeed, as it did before the Registrar, on its application for summary judgment
                    against Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Lim subsequently applied to amend his
                    pleadings on 14 December 2007 to introduce a completely new defence, which
                    is the position he currently takes. Lim stated that the $1,552,880 worth of
                    cheques made out to fictitious subcontractors were used for the following
                    purposes, with Neo’s knowledge and approval:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     $349,670 was used to pay
                        supplemental bonuses to some of CHKC’s staff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     $200,000 was used to pay bonuses to
                        the China management staff of CHKC’s foreign
                    workers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)     $56,160
                        was given out as red packets to the contractors, supervisors and staff at
                        CHKC’s construction sites during Chinese New Year;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_d"></a>(d)     $143,300 was used to provide
                        entertainment allowances and incentive payments to the supervisors and
                        contractors involved in CHKC’s projects; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_e"></a>(e)     $803,750 was taken by Neo
                        himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Lim also stated that the $747,536 in cash cheques paid
                        to him was COF compensation agreed between him and CHKC. For my reasons
                        given earlier, I do not believe Lim’s evidence on COF
                        compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Supplemental bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Lim’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> is that at the end of
                    every year, just before the Chinese New Year period, CHKC would pay bonuses to
                    its employees. The individual bonus for each employee would be recommended by
                    Lim and agreed to by Neo. However, in order to minimise feelings of jealousy
                    among the staff, Lim and Neo decided it was necessary to prevent CHKC’s
                    accounts staff from leaking information on how much bonus each employee got
                    relative to the others. Hence, CHKC’s bonuses were divided into two
                    components. The first component was an “official” bonus and was
                    recorded in CHKC’s books. All of CHKC’s employees would get more or
                    less the same amount of official bonus. The second component was a
                    “hidden” supplemental bonus which varied from employee to
                    employee, depending on performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Once the total amount of bonus for a
                    particular year had been confirmed, CHKC would issue cheques to its employees
                    containing the “official” bonus and record these payments proper.
                    At the same time, CHKC would also issue cheques containing the
                    “hidden” supplemental bonus and record these as payments to
                    fictitious subcontractors. All these cheques for the “official”
                    and “hidden” bonuses would be taken by Lim and deposited into his
                    personal account. Lim would then issue a single cheque to each employee that
                    combined both the “official” and “hidden”
                    components.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Through this system, employees who had
                    performed well for that year would be rewarded by receiving a greater amount of
                    bonus than what was recorded in CHKC’s books. Conversely, employees who
                    performed poorly would actually receive a lesser bonus than what was recorded.
                    For example, if CHKC issued a cheque to a particular employee for two and a half
                    months’ bonus and recorded it in its books, Lim might actually give that
                    employee his personal cheque for two months’ bonus. The balance of half a
                    month’s bonus would be used to pay the “hidden” components
                    of the more deserving employees. As the cheques used to pay CHKC’s
                    employees all came from Lim’s personal account, Lim would be the only
                    person who knew exactly how much bonus each employee was getting in
                    total.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Lim stated in his pleadings that $349,670 was
                    used to pay supplemental bonuses for the years 1997, 1998 and 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> However, he later states in his
                    AEIC that only $345,995 was used to pay supplemental bonuses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> He also stated that of the remaining
                    sum, $1,675 and $1,000 were given out as red packets during the 1998 and 2006
                    Chinese New Year respectively. These amounts were given out in addition to the
                    $56,160 worth of Chinese New Year red packets as mentioned in [70(c)] above.
                    This left a balance of $1,000 which was unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Bonuses for China management staff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Lim stated that $200,000 of the payments to
                    fictitious subcontractors was used by Neo to pay bonuses to the management staff
                    of CHKC’s Chinese foreign workers for the year 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chinese New Year red packets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Lim stated that it was a common practice in
                    the construction industry to distribute token monies to CHKC’s
                    contractors, supervisors and workers in the form of red packets during Chinese
                    New Year. His evidence is that a total of $56,160 was distributed in the form of
                    red packets for the years 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Entertainment allowances and incentive payments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Lim stated that it was an industry practice
                    for construction companies to give treats to the supervisors and contractors
                    involved in their projects in the form of meals, karaoke sessions, or incentive
                    payments. This was done in order to “encourage” the supervisors
                    and contractors to reduce supervision and control over CHKC’s operations,
                    and to “procure favours”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Lim’s evidence was that $143,300
                    was spent on these treats. Although he did not indicate the time period over
                    which the money was spent, the cheques allegedly used for such expenses were
                    dated over a period from July 1997 to September 1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Monies taken by Neo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Finally, Lim stated that Neo himself took four
                    cheques totalling $803,750 for his own purposes. Lim stated in his AEIC that Neo
                    had issued instructions for certain amounts to be “expensed
                        out”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> with the
                    necessary paperwork being carried out by Lim, Aileen or Jean. Lim did not know
                    how these monies were spent or used.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s radical change of defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Lim had explained in his prior affidavits that
                    he had originally raised a completely false defence in relation to the
                    fictitious subcontractors issue because he was worried about the potential
                    criminal repercussions on himself and third parties if the true nature of the
                    disguised payments came to light. While such conduct was deplorable, it is
                    perhaps a slight redemption on Lim’s part that he did not carry his
                    deception all the way. When CHKC brought summary judgment proceedings against
                    him for $347,030 in RA 159/2007 heard by Woo Bih Li J, Lim, despite being
                    given the opportunity to do so, chose not to give evidence rather than affirm a
                    false affidavit. This resulted in final judgment being entered against him. This
                    is the difference between Lim and Neo. Neo had no qualms in affirming a false
                    affidavit or giving false evidence before the courts and procuring his
                    witnesses, (<em>viz</em>, Aileen and Juliet) to do
                    likewise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Lim subsequently decided to come clean with
                    the whole story when he realised that the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
                    (“IRAS”) had raided CHKC’s premises and was investigating
                    into its financial affairs and it would only be a matter of time before the
                    truth was revealed. He applied to amend his pleadings in which he admitted that
                    his original defence was a sham. Woo J’s judgment against Lim was then set
                    aside by agreement of the parties in Civil Appeal No 142 of 2007
                    (“CA 142/2007”), but CHKC was allowed to retain the sum of
                    $347,030 until the conclusion of this present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     CHKC submitted that Lim’s new defence is
                    equally a sham because the reason given by Lim for not including his new defence
                    earlier (that he wanted to protect third parties) was untenable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> First, the raid by IRAS was in August
                    2007 whereas Lim only applied to amend his defence in December 2007. Second, Lim
                    claimed in his new defence that Neo had taken $803,750 for himself and $200,000
                    to pay bonuses to CHKC’s China management staff, yet there was certainly
                    no reason for Lim to protect Neo from the start. Third, Lim’s amendment to
                    include his COF claim against CHKC affected only him and not other third parties
                    whom he allegedly wanted to protect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I did not think that it was appropriate to
                    draw any negative inferences against Lim even before looking at the merits of
                    his new defence. Lim applied to amend his pleadings four months after the IRAS
                    raid, which was not too long a period of time. He obviously had to consider
                    carefully the implications of admitting to the Court that his original defence
                    was a complete lie and I accept his reasons for hesitating before making his
                    amendments. I agree with CHKC that Lim had no reason to protect Neo or forgo his
                    claim for COF compensation from the outset, but the fact remains that the monies
                    taken by Neo or given to Lim by way of COF compensation were all disguised as
                    payments to fictitious subcontractors. If Lim disclosed even part of this scheme
                    from the start, it would be inevitable and a matter of time before all the other
                    nefarious schemes and practices in CHKC would come to light. Lim had to either
                    deny the whole fictitious subcontractors scheme or admit everything, and he has
                    chosen the latter. While I certainly did not accept Lim’s new defence at
                    face value simply because he now says that this is the real truth, I did not
                    immediately consider it a sham either. I proceeded to test Lim’s new
                    defence against the evidence before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Payments to China management staff and monies taken by Neo</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I will first set out my findings on the
                    payment of $200,000 to CHKC’s China management staff and the $803,750
                    allegedly taken by Neo. The only evidence CHKC has adduced in this suit to show
                    that Lim had misappropriated these sums are copies of payment vouchers and its
                    internal accounts showing that cheques totalling $200,000 and $803,750 had been
                    issued. Crucially, and significantly, the cheque images for these sums were not
                    produced. Although Neo stated in his AEIC that the cheques made out to
                    fictitious subcontractors “were invariably handed over to Lim and/or
                        Jean”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> he later admitted in cross-examination
                    that he had no way of knowing whether the sums of $200,000 and $803,750 were
                    actually taken by Lim:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>

                        true?</em></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s right.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     On the contrary, Lim produced two payment
                    vouchers during trial showing that Neo himself had approved cash payments of
                    $168,670 and $200,000 to one Lim Kim Kow (who was one of the fictitious
                    subcontractors) on 17 January 1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> The sum of $168,670 formed part of
                    the $349,670 allegedly used to pay supplemental bonuses, while the sum of
                    $200,000 was allegedly used to pay bonuses to CHKC’s China management
                    staff. These are not small sums and the presence of these vouchers contradicts
                    Neo’s own evidence in his AEIC that all payments to fictitious
                    subcontractors were approved by Lim. When confronted with this evidence in
                    cross-examination, Neo was suddenly able to recall that on that occasion, which
                    was more than 10 years ago, Lim was out of the office at the time and he had
                    called Neo asking him to approve the payment vouchers as the cheques were needed
                        urgently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> I did not believe
                    him. Neo had never mentioned this fact in any of his previous affidavits. His
                    own AEIC stated unequivocally that “[a]ll these purported payments to
                    subcontractors were approved by Lim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Neo later tried to claim that he had no
                    independent authority to approve payment vouchers for CHKC on his own. I find
                    this to be another lie. Neo had already admitted that the accounts department
                    would only process payment if a payment voucher had been approved by either Lim
                    or Neo. Despite this, Neo stubbornly maintained that he, as the “big
                    boss” of CHKC, had to take instructions from his underling Lim before
                    approving payments to third parties:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Isn’t it true that your evidence recently
                            given was that the accounts department will process payment if either
                            you or Mr Lim were to sign a payment voucher? Isn’t that
                            true?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Isn’t it also true that you have independent
                            authority in the sense that you could actual [<em>sic</em>] sign the payment voucher first, and then later tell
                            Mr Lim what you have done?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, I disagree, because he is in charge of the

                            may have promised other parties, but then we wouldn’t have enough
                            funds to process the payments and he would have lost the trust of the
                            other parties.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But you are the overall boss, Mr Neo. Surely
                            you are in a position to also dictate to him what are your spending
                            priorities, don’t you agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I may have the authority to sign cheques, but I
                            have to take instructions from him.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Not only is Neo’s evidence inherently
                    incredible, it is also completely at odds with the fact that Neo was the sole
                    cheque signatory for CHKC. As I have mentioned above at [60] and [61], I do not
                    believe that Neo blindly signed cheques brought to him. I find that Neo kept
                    control over the process of approving payments to third parties instead of
                    blindly subordinating himself to Lim. This is also consistent with Jean’s
                    evidence in her AEIC, which I accept, that Neo had the final word on deciding
                    the amount to bid for tenders and quotations in the course of CHKC’s
                        operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having regard to the above evidence, I find
                    that CHKC’s counterclaim in respect of the sums of $200,000 and $803,750
                    has not been made out, mainly because CHKC has failed to discharge their burden
                    of proof and to provide the cheque images for these sums and because the rest of
                    its evidence on this score is tenuous at best. Furthermore, I do not believe
                    Neo’s evidence that he had signed the two payment vouchers to “Lim
                    Kim Kow” on 17 January 1998 on Lim’s instructions. It is much
                    more likely that Neo had approved the payments on his own accord, and that Neo
                    knowingly participated in the practice of recording certain expenses as payments
                    to fictitious subcontractors. This, and other factors like Neo’s plans for
                    listing, are important in determining whether CHKC’s counterclaims for the
                    remaining sums are made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Supplemental bonuses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I had some difficulty accepting Lim’s
                    story on the whole supplemental bonuses system for CHKC’s employees. In
                    the first place, the idea of Lim taking employees’ cheques, banking it
                    into his own account, and issuing personal cheques with the amounts altered was
                    extremely questionable. Lim also admitted ‘writing’ some of the
                    employees’ names on their payment vouchers thus giving the appearance that
                    they signed the same upon receipt of payment. The fact that Lim had complete
                    control over the supplemental bonuses system left a lot of potential for abuse.
                    Secondly, I was doubtful that this system actually worked in achieving its
                        <em>raison d'être</em> – minimising information
                    leaks on how much bonus each staff member got relative to the others. The mere
                    fact that each employee’s actual bonus was kept off the books would not
                    prevent employees from sharing information with each other. The entire system
                    seemed too convoluted, not to mention illegal, to exist just for the purpose of
                    preventing CHKC’s accounts staff from disseminating information about
                    employees’ bonuses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Finally, Lim’s own evidence shows that
                    only $345,995 of the $349,670 taken by him was used to pay supplemental bonuses.
                    I disbelieved his story that $2,675 was used to pay Chinese New Year red packets
                    for 1998 and 2006. It can be seen from Lim’s own pleadings that a single
                    cheque was issued to pay the supplemental bonuses of all the employees in a
                    particular year, while another cheque would be issued separately to pay Chinese
                    New Year red packets. Lim’s story that part of the $349,670 used to pay
                    supplemental bonuses was used to pay red packets was clearly an afterthought.
                    Lim has also failed to account for the remaining balance of
                $1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Having said all this, I think there is
                    sufficient evidence for me to find in favour of Lim on this issue. Despite the
                    highly dubious nature of his story, Lim’s testimony on the existence of
                    the supplemental bonuses system was consistent throughout cross-examination. His
                    answers to counsel’s questions were straightforward and candid. He also
                    admitted readily that he knew it was illegal and wrong for CHKC to declare a
                    certain amount of bonus payable to a staff member and pay him/her less than what
                    was recorded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> (Such an admission
                    however is not relevant for the purpose of resolving the present issue.)
                    Lim’s evidence was also corroborated by affidavit and documentary evidence
                    showing that bonus payments had been made to several ex-employees of CHKC
                    through Lim’s personal cheques. While I still have doubts about
                    Lim’s real reasons for disguising supplementary bonuses as payments to
                    fictitious subcontractors, I accept his evidence that the $345,995 he allegedly
                    misappropriated was used to pay CHKC’s employees and was not pocketed by
                    him. If I had to make a finding, I would find that this form of re-distribution
                    allowed Lim to more generously reward those employees who were more capable,
                    more useful to him and to CHKC and even to ‘buy’ their
                    loyalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The question remains whether CHKC (through
                    Neo) had authorised Lim to pay supplemental bonuses in such a surreptitious
                    manner. On balance I find that the answer to that question is ‘yes’.
                    Neo stated in his AEIC that he had left it to Lim to decide on how the bonuses
                    were to be paid and that Lim would only inform him of the number of months of
                    bonuses to declare.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> However, Neo himself had approved a
                    payment voucher to a fictitious subcontractor for $168,670 which was used to pay
                    supplemental bonuses for 1997. As I have mentioned above at [87], I found that
                    Neo willingly participated in the fictitious subcontractors scheme. These
                    factors, taken together, show that Lim was permitted to use CHKC’s funds
                    to pay supplemental bonuses under the guise of payments to fictitious
                    subcontractors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Since Lim only paid $345,995 in supplemental
                    bonuses, there remained a shortfall of $3,675 from the $349,670 originally taken
                    by him. Lim is thus liable to account to CHKC for this shortfall because I do
                    not believe his story that part of the balance was used to pay Chinese New Year
                    red packets. I therefore allow part of CHKC’s counterclaim for the sum of
                    $3,675. CHKC’s counterclaim for the other $345,995 must
                fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Red packets, entertainment allowances and incentive
                payments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I now deal with the sums of $56,160 (for
                    Chinese New Year red packets) and $143,300 (for entertainment allowances and
                    incentive payments). Lim called several of CHKC’s ex-employees as
                    witnesses during the trial. These witnesses all testified that it was
                    CHKC’s practice during Chinese New Year to distribute red packets to
                    various staff at its project sites (such as construction workers, supervisors,
                    and engineers).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Some of the
                    witnesses also stated that they would bring the project supervision staff of
                    employers and main contractors for meals and karaoke sessions on behalf of CHKC
                    and would be reimbursed for such expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> I accept their evidence. They had no reason
                    to lie and it is not an unknown practice in the building industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     However, the testimony of these various
                    witnesses does not show by itself that the monies used to pay for such expenses
                    came from the sums allegedly misappropriated by Lim. In this regard, CHKC
                    produced two payment vouchers at trial evidencing the payment of red packets to
                    staff at CHKC’s project sites.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> CHKC’s case
                    therefore is that payments in the form of red packets were already recorded
                    legitimately in its books. There was no need for Lim to disguise such payments
                    because they were already booked as expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Lim’s response in cross-examination was
                    that red packet payments involving smaller sums were recorded on the books.
                    Payments involving larger sums were disguised as payments to fictitious
                    subcontractors. Lim explained that he had been investigated by the Corrupt
                    Practices Investigation Bureau in 1995 over alleged bribes to the staff of
                    another company because he had given red packets to those staff. Lim stated that
                    after the incident, Neo had given instructions not to record such payments on
                    the books to avoid further investigation. For the same reason, entertainment
                    allowances and incentive payments were also disguised as payments to fictitious
                        subcontractors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I accept Lim’s explanation on the above
                    matters. The two payment vouchers for red packet payments produced by CHKC only
                    reflected amounts of $1,200 and $2,000. In contrast, the disguised red packet
                    payments involved substantially higher sums of money – $44,600 and $11,560
                    for 1999 and 2000 respectively. It is very conceivable that these larger amounts
                    were used for, to borrow Lim’s phrase, “inducement payments”
                    in the form of red packets to the supervisors and contractors at CHKC’s
                    construction sites. Lim and Neo would certainly wish to keep these payments off
                    the books, even if they were tax-deductible either way. Given my earlier
                    findings that Neo was knowingly participating in the Fictitious Invoices Scheme
                    and making payments to fictitious subcontractors, the likelihood of him being
                    ignorant of these under-the-table gifts to CHKC’s contractors and
                    supervisors was very low. For this reason, I do not believe Neo’s evidence
                    that he did not authorise or instruct Lim to make such “inducement
                    payments”. CHKC’s counterclaim for $56,160 must accordingly
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For the same reason, I also accept Lim’s
                    evidence that CHKC’s other expenses for entertainment and incentive
                    payments were incurred with Neo’s knowledge and approval and had to be
                    similarly concealed in CHKC’s accounts. The sums involved here were even
                    more substantial than the red packet monies – $143,300 from 1997 to 1999.
                    Quite notably, CHKC has not produced any documentary proof that these
                    entertainment expenses and incentive payments were otherwise recorded
                    legitimately in its accounts. The only possible inference to be drawn is that
                    the money for entertainment and incentive payments came from the fictitious
                    subcontractor account. Since the $143,300 was not misappropriated by Lim,
                    CHKC’s counterclaim for this sum must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">CHKC’s claim for $747,536</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Finally, I deal with CHKC’s counterclaim
                    for $747,536 being the value of cash cheques which Lim had allegedly
                    misappropriated. As I mentioned earlier, I do not believe Lim’s defence
                    that there was an oral agreement between him and Neo (on behalf of CHKC) to pay
                    COF compensation as alleged and pleaded by Lim but there was some evidence of
                    interest payments to Lim in the Manual Cashbook, which I accept. However, this
                    does not mean that CHKC’s claim is automatically made out. Since CHKC is
                    alleging that $747,536 worth of cash cheques were <em>misappropriated</em> by Lim, it has to show on the evidence that
                    these cheques were taken by Lim without Neo’s (and therefore CHKC’s)
                    knowledge or consent. Although these are civil proceedings, a party who alleges
                    misappropriation, which is a criminal offence, ought to put forward sufficiently
                    cogent evidence on the self-evident principle that in proportion as the
                    allegation is grave so ought the proof be clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     On the evidence, I find that Neo was aware, in
                    signing the $747,536 worth of cheques, that the monies therein were intended for
                    Lim even though they were recorded as payments to fictitious subcontractors in
                    CHKC’s books. Three factors stand out in particular. First, all the
                    cheques involved here were cash cheques, which were a rarity in CHKC – I
                    have already referred to an analysis produced by Mr Khoo showing that only
                    7.29% of cheques issued by CHKC from 2000 to 2006 were cash cheques. This
                    analysis was not challenged by Neo. These cash cheques would mostly be used for
                    fixed purposes, such as payments to CHKC’s China management team, petty
                    cash claims submitted by Aileen, return loans to Lim, grocery claims by
                    Neo’s wife, and so on. Neo also agreed with Lim’s counsel during
                    trial that cash cheques were generally not a safe form of payment, especially in
                    large amounts:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Do you not agree that if you just drew up a cash
                            cheque for $200,000 and left it lying around, someone could just come
                            along and cash out the money? Do you agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I will only issue cash cheques when Lim Leong Huat
                            came to me.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So in other words, in generally [<em>sic</em>] issuing of cash cheques alone would not be a very
                            safe way to arrange for payments out unless you are satisfied that there
                            are adequate safeguards, right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s right. I would only do it when
                            requested by Lim Leong Huat.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Given the rarity of cash cheques, their
                    relative risk and the fact that they were used for certain fixed purposes, I am
                    quite certain that Neo must have satisfied himself as to the purpose of an
                    intended payment when he was signing a cash cheque. Neo, unsurprisingly,
                    continued to insist in cross-examination that he would just sign any cheque if
                    Lim requested him to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Secondly, the cash cheques comprising the
                    sum of $747,536 were all paid in a recurring pattern, in the same amounts, and
                    to the same parties. CHKC’s records show that the payment vouchers
                    accompanying these cash cheques reflected payments to the following fictitious
                    subcontractors from 2004 to 2006:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Khor Ah Teck – $16,800</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Liu Bi Yu – $4,800</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Shi Chun Bing – $4,375 and
                        $10,000</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Peng Chao - $6,751</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The payments to these individuals were made month after month, all in
                    the form of cash cheques. Each fictitious subcontractor consistently
                    “received” the same fixed amount in each cash
                cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Since the cash cheques were paid in a
                    recurring pattern, it is impossible to believe Neo would not have noticed these
                    sums or know where these monies were going. When Lim’s counsel pointed
                    this out in cross-examination, Neo replied that he had asked Lim about the
                    payments once and was told that the monies were needed for a special project
                    involving safety work which CHKC’s Chinese workers were unable to carry
                        out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> I do not believe him. This explanation
                    was clearly a very important fact because it would show how Lim managed to trick
                    Neo into signing so many cash cheques in a recurring pattern, yet Neo had never
                    mentioned this fact in any of his previous affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Finally, Neo and Aileen both lied in their
                    evidence. Lim’s counsel pointed out to Neo in cross-examination that
                    “Liu Bi Yu” was actually the name of a foreman from CHKC’s
                    China management team and whom Neo himself had approved bonus payments for the
                    year 1999. When it was put to Neo that he must have realised Liu Bi Yu was not a
                    real subcontractor, Neo gave another incredible answer:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So, as far as the evidence shows, you have been
                            signing management vouchers for the Chinese team -- they work closer to
                            you, as you conceded this morning -- you have, clearly in your company
                            vouchers, a clear indication of this gentleman Liu Bi Yu working for
                            Chip Hup Hup Kee. You can’t seriously expect anyone to believe you
                            when you say you thought these persons were subcontractors,
                            Mr Neo.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No I can’t read English, but now that
                            you show me the name -- I can’t read English but if you show me
                            the Chinese characters, of course I will recognise it.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Are you trying to tell the honourable court that
                            you can’t read anything at all in English? It is a damning
                            indictment of even our school system, that a secondary level student
                            can’t read English.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It is not that I can’t read English, but if
                            you just point out Liu Bi Yu to me, I can’t recognise the
                            character. For example, let’s say Su Ji. I call him Su Ji. If you
                            expect me to spell it in English, I can’t spell.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">I find it unbelievable that Neo could claim to read English and
                    yet not know how to recognise Chinese names when they were written in Romanised
                    “hanyu pinyin”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Neo and Aileen had also stated in their
                    AEICs that after Lim had obtained leave to amend his pleadings to include his
                    COF claim in August 2008, they subsequently discovered 15 more payment
                    vouchers with corresponding cheques for the amounts of $16,800, $4,800, $4,375,
                    $6,751 and $10,000 in Lim’s former office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> Aileen was then instructed to cancel these
                    cheques. Unfortunately for Neo and Aileen, CHKC’s Manual Cashbook (where
                    the entries were handwritten, by and large sequentially according to dates),
                    showed that nine of the 15 cheques had already been cancelled about 2 years
                    earlier in October 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, CHKC had moved its
                    premises from Bukit Timah Shopping Centre to Henderson Industrial Park by April
                    2008, some 1 year 5 months after Lim’s dismissal from CHKC in November
                    2006. Neo and Aileen were lying in their AEICs. They were caught out because
                    they were eventually forced to produce unredacted copies of the Manual Cashbook
                    but their AEICs had already been affirmed. Because of their lies, I drew the
                    inference that Neo and Aileen were trying to mask their knowledge of these
                    payments through cash cheques. On the whole, I am satisfied that Neo was fully
                    aware that he was making recurring payments of $16,800, $4,800, $4,375 and
                    $6,751 to Lim (and sporadic payments of $10,000) disguised as payments to
                    fictitious subcontractors. As mentioned above at [45], it is clear that at least
                    some of these payments were interest payments to compensate Lim for CHKC’s
                    use of his funds (although I disbelieved Lim’s story that CHKC agreed to
                    pay him monthly COF compensation until his loans were repaid). While it is not
                    known if there was any other reason behind these recurring payments, I am quite
                    certain that he had not misappropriated these payments. CHKC’s
                    counterclaim for $747,536 therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In summary, I dismiss all of CHKC’s
                    counterclaims totalling $2,300,416 (as payments to fictitious subcontractors),
                    with the exception of $3,675 which Lim is liable to account to CHKC for.
                    Furthermore, since CHKC continues to hold the sum of $347,030 which was obtained
                    in the summary judgment proceedings against Lim that were later set aside, CHKC
                    should accordingly return the $347,030 to Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHKC’s counterclaim for false entries and
                misappropriation</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    CHKC’s original counterclaim against
                    Lim stated that over a period from 2001 to 2006, Lim had caused it to record in
                    its accounts a sum of $5,110,533.65 owing to him under an account entry called
                    “Salary Accruals”. At the time, CHKC claimed that this
                    $5,110,533.65 was actually a sum due to Neo for having personally paid the
                    salaries of CHKC’s workers in cash, on behalf of CHKC. CHKC thus prayed
                    for an order to rectify its accounts to reflect the true position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    However, just as Lim had radically changed
                    his defence on the fictitious subcontractors issue, CHKC similarly changed its
                    counterclaim here. On 26 November 2008, CHKC amended its pleadings to
                    allege that Lim had fraudulently caused to be recorded in its accounts a sum of
                    $5,161,671.65 owing to him, mostly comprising of monies in the Salary Accruals
                    account. These Salary Accruals represented the wages of entirely fictitious
                    workers which Lim had purported to pay on behalf of CHKC, but did not actually
                    do so. In short, Lim had generated false book debts to his credit in
                    CHKC’s accounts. CHKC further alleges that Lim drew this sum of
                    $5,161,671.65 out purportedly as repayment to him for the false book debts.
                    Thus, CHKC abandoned its earlier story of Neo single-handedly paying off the
                    salaries of its workers, and now claims against Lim for misappropriating its
                    funds through the creation of false accounting entries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    CHKC also now counterclaims an additional
                    sum of $949,151.59 against Lim. According to CHKC, this sum was originally
                    recorded in CHKC’s accounts as a debt owing by AZ to CHKC. However, Lim
                    had caused this debt to be reflected as settled by AZ by falsely setting it off
                    against monies owing by CHKC to Neo. This resulted in Neo’s credit balance
                    with CHKC being reduced by $949,151.59, while the corresponding debt owed by AZ
                    to CHKC was extinguished. CHKC now counterclaims against Lim and AZ for the
                    $949,151.59 which remains owing by AZ.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> Along
                    with the $5,161,671.65 in false book entries misappropriated by Lim,
                    CHKC’s total counterclaim on this issue is for
                $6,110,863.24.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Lim’s defence on this issue has been
                    consistent throughout the proceedings. He stated that for a long time, Neo had
                    implemented the system of Proxies in CHKC, see [22] above, and CHKC would pay
                    only the CPF employer and employee components of their wages for official
                        records.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    As noted above at [22], the entire purpose
                    of keeping these Proxies on CHKC’s payroll was to artificially inflate the
                    number of local workers to obtain a higher number of foreign workers as MOM
                    would only allow a company to employ foreign workers based on a strict ratio to
                    its local workers. According to Lim, Neo realised that having foreign workers,
                    especially workers from China, was very profitable. Not only were Chinese
                    workers regarded in the industry as being more productive, but they were also
                    quite literally a source of Neo’s wealth<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> in more ways than one. Lim
                    alleged that Neo collected monthly “commissions” from each Chinese
                    worker without accounting to CHKC for these sums of money and Neo and his wife
                    presented inflated reimbursement claims to CHKC for the purchase of groceries
                    for the Chinese workers. It would be convenient for me to make two findings at
                    this juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Foreign worker
                            commissions</em> – It was customary for foreign workers to
                        pay a commission of about $2,000–$3,000 each to Singaporean employers.
                        These commissions were used to defray expenses connected to their hiring and
                        employment, such as air-tickets, insurance, medical coverage, training
                        course, <em>etc</em>. Lim alleges that instead of
                        paying these commissions to CHKC, Neo simply pocketed them. The total amount
                        from such foreign worker commissions, from 1999 to 2006, was estimated to be
                        about $10–$20 million. I do not have to make a finding for the
                        purposes of these proceedings, whether Neo did indeed pocket such large sums
                        of money, ‘squeezed’ out as commissions from these workers.
                        However I accept Zhang’s evidence, which was unshaken on this point,
                        that commissions were indeed collected from the Chinese workers and paid
                        over to CHKC. No such payments were noted in the accounts of CHKC. I
                        find that Neo did levy such a commission on the Chinese workers and did keep
                        the money for himself. This is one of the main reasons why Neo kept such
                        close and tight control over the Chinese workers and as noted above, I
                        accept Zhang’s evidence that the Chinese teams leaders like Wu and
                        Zhang himself reported to Neo, not Lim. Mr Khoo produced a table drawn
                        from the Manual Cashbook, “PWB-52”, (which was not seriously
                        in dispute), showing consistent loans of between $3,000 to $30,000 from CHKC
                        to Wu from June 2002 to June 2004 totalling $194,312.28. There were also
                        other entries in the Manual Cashbook, <em>e.g</em>., on
                        15 May 2001: “Cash – Su Ji (Adv. Wages)” $20,000,
                        again on 22 May 2001: “Cash – Su Ji (Adv. Wages)”
                        $20,000, on 6 August 2001: “Cash – Su Ji (Adv.
                        Wages)” $30,000, on 18 August 2001: “Cash – Su Ji
                        (Advance Wages)” $20,000, two entries on 3 October 2001:
                        “Cash – Su Ji Adv. Wages” for $300,000 and $200,000,
                        There was no pattern to these payments, <em>e.g</em>.,
                        on 28 March 2003 there was a similarly described entry for $66,667.00
                        and again on 31 March 2003 for $270,000. Mr Khoo cross-examined
                        Neo and submitted that Neo kept dealings with the Chinese workers to himself
                        and Wu or their finance person, Su Ji, and later to Zhang because he had an
                        ulterior motive in making money off them. This was also pleaded. I accept
                        that submission. The evidence certainly showed a lot of unexplained cash
                        passing from the Chinese workers to Neo and/or CHKC and payments from Neo to
                        Wu and Su Ji. I also accept Zhang’s evidence on this point and reject
                        the suggestion put up by Neo that these were monies collected to indemnify
                        CHKC for repatriation costs and were returned to the workers upon their
                        return to China. I find that this was so and find that Neo kept this money
                        for himself. Knowing what schemes Neo was capable of hatching and
                        implementing in CHKC, it is clear to me, and I so find, that Neo was
                        skimming off money from his Chinese workforce with the connivance and
                        assistance of its leaders like Wu and Su Ji, just as Neo and Lim did with
                        their nefarious schemes in CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Inflated grocery expenses</em>
                        – Lim also alleged that Neo had submitted inflated claims to CHKC for
                        grocery expenses purportedly incurred by him and his wife for CHKC’s
                        foreign workers. Neo allegedly overcharged CHKC to the amount of about
                        $4.6–$11.6 million from 1999 to 2006. Again it is not necessary for me
                        to make a finding on how much Neo did over charge on the groceries for his
                        own benefit or whether he did so to the amounts alleged by Lim. Juliet
                        herself admitted that Neo has drawn out more in reimbursement for purchasing
                        groceries for the Chinese workers than the receipts he submitted. A quick
                        trawl through the Manual Cashbook<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> for the first 6 months of 2003
                        shows entries of reimbursement to Mrs Neo, often described as:
                        “Cash – Mrs Neo (Dec 02)”, for sums like $146,245
                        (28 January 2003), $142,429.50 (28 February 2003), $126,625.50
                        (28 March 2003), two entries on 28 May 2003 for the months of
                        April and May 2003 for $106,483.50 and $99,324 and $99,032.50 (28 July
                        2003 for June 2003). In 2004, the claims were slightly lower ranging
                        from $83,000 to $94,000 but in the earlier years like 2001, there was an
                        entry on 13 September 2001 for $179,104.50. These are not insignificant
                        sums. I find that Neo did make such inflated claims for groceries and this
                        formed another source of his tax-free “revenue” stream from
                        CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Besides allowing Neo to maintain a high
                    ratio of foreign workers in CHKC, the presence of Proxies also enabled Neo to
                    draw monies out of CHKC through the Salary Accruals Account, which was exactly
                    what CHKC is now accusing Lim of doing. By pretending to have personally paid
                    the non-CPF wages of these Proxies’ salaries, Neo would credit himself for
                    these “wages” paid by him in CHKC’s books. He could then
                    draw monies out of CHKC’s Salary Accruals Account as
                    “reimbursement” of the “wages” paid by him. As these
                    Salary Accruals would be regarded as expenses in CHKC’s accounts, they
                    also had the effect of reducing CHKC’s tax liability and Neo obtained
                    money without having to declare it as income for his own personal income tax.
                    Lim alleged that Neo drew out about $10m in Salary Accruals from 1997 to
                        2003.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> As a result of these numerous
                    unlawful practices involving CHKC’s foreign workers, Neo, his wife, and
                    CHH have been made defendants in Suit 241 of 2007, a minority oppression case
                    which was tried before me after this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Lim readily admitted his knowledge and
                    involvement in the Proxies system. He stated that when he first joined CHKC in
                    1994, the Proxies system was already in place. Neo subsequently asked Lim to
                    provide the names of some people he knew to become Proxies, which he did. Lim
                    maintains that the bulk of the Proxies were provided by Neo, through his large
                    network of friends. Neo also got other employees of CHKC to contribute to the
                    pool of Proxies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I now come to another main dispute between
                    both parties on this issue. Lim stated that sometime around 1996, he had a
                    discussion with Neo during which Neo agreed that Lim would be entitled to share
                    in CHKC’s profits of up to 40%. This was done in order to encourage Lim to
                    continue working for CHKC. As noted before, Lim had begun harbouring thoughts of
                    setting up on this own. As a result, Neo began to award pay increases,
                    allowances and bonuses to Lim from 1997 onwards. Also as I have found, Lim was
                    allowed to incorporate and run his own company, AZ, in tandem with his running
                    of CHKC. Finally, from 2001, Neo also instructed CHKC’s accounts staff to
                    record Salary Accruals in CHKC’s accounts as owing to Lim as well. Lim
                    alleged that profits from Salary Accruals were divided between him and Neo in
                    the following manner:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Lim explained that he arrived at the above
                    figures based on a typed statement handed to him by Aileen shortly before he
                    left CHKC, detailing the amounts Neo had allegedly awarded to him as
                    profit-sharing through the Salary Accruals account. Aileen also made reference
                    to this typed statement in her AEIC. She acknowledged that she had originally
                    prepared the typed statement containing the above figures for Lim. However, in
                    the course of preparing CHKC’s defence and counterclaim, she discovered
                    some errors in the typed statement. This is why Lim’s figure of
                    $6,151,856.24 was different from CHKC’s counterclaim of $5,161,671.65. The

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Aileen gave the following explanation for
                    the above table:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_a"></a>(a)     The sum of $237,871.27 recorded in
                        2004 is not associated with the Salary Accruals account. It actually
                        represents a false re-classification entry made by Lim in CHKC’s
                        accounts crediting this amount in his favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_b"></a>(b)     Similarly, the sum of $949,191.59 recorded in
                        2004 does not come from Salary Accruals. It is another false
                        re-classification by Lim described in [108] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_c"></a>(c)     The sum of $40,993 recorded in 2006
                        was originally thought to be part of the Salary Accruals accounts but was
                        actually not. Therefore, CHKC’s counterclaim against Lim has been
                        reduced by this amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the parties’ positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Basically, CHKC is counterclaiming
                    $5,161,671.65 against Lim comprising $4,923,800.38 which Lim had allegedly
                    recorded as Salary Accruals and misappropriated, and $237,871.27 based on a
                    false re-classification entry which was unrelated to the Salary Accruals
                    account. In addition, CHKC claims $949,151.59 against Lim and AZ based on
                    another false re-classification entry which Lim had allegedly caused to be
                    entered in CHKC’s accounts. The total amount claimed is $6,110,863.24. It
                    is CHKC’s position in this trial that the Proxies system was started by
                    Lim. It is also CHKC’s position that Lim created the Salary Accruals
                    account and other false accounting entries without Neo’s knowledge in
                    order to siphon money out of CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    On Lim’s part, he alleged that Neo was
                    the one who started and operated the Proxies system and Salary Accruals account
                    and that Neo gave him a 40% profit-sharing stake in the Salary Accruals account.
                    He stated that the $6,110,863.24 claimed by CHKC in this trial all comprises of
                    Salary Accruals, which is contrary to CHKC’s position that the sums of
                    $237,871.27 and $949,151.59 are based on false accounting entries totally
                    unrelated to Salary Accruals. Lim stated that he is entitled to a total of
                    $6,151,856.24 in Salary Accruals pursuant to the profit-sharing arrangement
                    between him and Neo. This sum of $6,151,856.24 comprises the sum of
                    $6,110,863.24 claimed by CHKC in this trial and the $40,993 taken out by CHKC. I
                    should note from the outset that Lim is not making a claim for any Salary
                    Accruals allegedly due to him in the present action. His current position is
                    simply to defend himself against CHKC’s counterclaim of $6,110,863.24
                    which Lim said forms part of the Salary Accruals he is rightfully entitled to.
                    Lim instead has reserved his right to bring a claim for recovery of monies
                    allegedly due to him on the taking of a proper account of the sums and amounts
                    that should correctly be reflected in CHKC’s accounts as owing to him (and
                    vice-versa) in separate proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Misappropriation of $5,161,671.65 through false entries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    CHKC has accused Lim of misappropriating
                    monies totalling $5,161,671.65 which he had allegedly caused to be recorded as
                    false accounting entries. As noted above, CHKC’s onus of proof in this
                    allegation is not merely on a balance of probabilities. Hence, it is not enough
                    in this case to show that Lim had created false entries in CHKC’s
                    accounts; CHKC must also show some evidence that these monies were drawn out by
                    Lim. In this regard, CHKC has only produced three cheques for the sums of
                    $255,597.26, $1,078,743.86 and $516,062.11.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> The total amount from
                    these cheques is $1,850,403.23. Although CHKC alleges that Lim drew out a total
                    of $5,161,671.65 in false entries, the only other evidence it has to
                    substantiate its claim comes from its accounting records showing that Lim had
                    drawn out these monies mixed with loans he had made to CHKC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> I do
                    not think these accounting records by themselves can prove that the payments
                    were actually made. Hence, the very most CHKC can claim against Lim in these
                    proceedings is $1,850,403.23.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Lim submitted that the three cheques
                    totalling $1,850,403.23 do not prove that he had drawn money out through the
                    Salary Accruals account. This is because the payment vouchers for these three
                    cheques indicated that the payments were made to Lim for the purpose of repaying
                    loans made by him. I did not accept this submission. Since the Salary Accruals
                    would already be recorded in CHKC’s accounts as amounts owing to Lim for
                    “paying” CHKC’s Proxies, it would not be totally
                    inconsistent to characterise these payments as repayment of Lim’s loans.
                    On the contrary, it would help to disguise the fact that money was being drawn
                    out of CHKC in a manner designed to evade tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    More importantly, the exact amounts in these
                    cheques are highly inconsistent with them being in the nature of repayment of
                    loans which Lim had made directly to CHKC. The three cheques were for the
                    amounts of $255,597.26, $1,078,743.86 and $516,062.11, which are in odd numbers,
                    as distinct from round numbers, down to the cent. Lim’s own AEIC on the
                    other hand shows that the loans he made directly to CHKC were in rounded amounts
                    such as $50,000 or $200,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> If the three cheques were issued to Lim
                    purely for repayment of loans made directly by him, they should not have any odd
                    sums reflected in them. Furthermore, I find it very difficult to believe that
                    Lim would not have drawn a single cent from the Salary Accruals accounts all
                    this while from 2001, especially when he alleged that he had an agreement with
                    Neo to share up to 40% of CHKC’s profits. On the evidence before me, I
                    find that Lim drew $1,850,403.23 out of CHKC through Salary Accruals. The issue
                    now is whether it was Lim who was operating the Salary Accruals account for his
                    own benefit, or whether it was Neo who had given Lim a 40% stake in the Salary
                    Accruals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Neo stated in his AEIC that shortly after
                    Lim had joined CHKC, he had asked Neo to recruit Proxies to maintain
                    CHKC’s high ratio of foreign workers. Neo accordingly did so. However, Neo
                    claimed that although he knew of the Proxies system, he was unaware that Lim had
                    created the Salary Accruals accounts as a means of misappropriating CHKC’s
                    funds. Neo maintained that it was Lim who was in charge of the Proxies system
                    and the Salary Accruals account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Lim on the
                    other hand stated that Neo was the one running this Proxies scheme and had
                    included Lim’s name in the Salary Accruals accounts as a way of sharing
                    profits with Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> As
                    with all the other issues in this case, this question essentially boils down to
                    whom I believe. Having regard to the evidence, I believe Lim’s story over
                    Neo’s. I took the following factors into account in arriving at this
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    First, Neo was more closely linked to the
                    Proxies than Lim. Neo admits from his own AEIC that he had supplied a
                    substantial amount of Proxies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> Juliet also admitted
                    on the stand that CHKC had a procedure of using recommendation forms to process
                    the names of new Proxies, and that Neo’s name appeared very frequently as
                    a recommender of Proxies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> It was very telling that CHKC had failed
                    to disclose these recommendation forms during discovery. This suggests to me,
                    and I so find, that CHKC was trying to cover up the fact that Neo’s name
                    appeared frequently on the recommendation forms. Neo and Juliet also admitted in
                    cross-examination that the CHKC staff member principally administering the
                    Proxies system was Neo’s secretary, one Katherine Ng May Kuan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> Neo also admitted that he was more closely
                    associated with CHKC’s China management team than Lim, which suggests that
                    it was Neo who was making the decisions on how many more Chinese foreign workers
                    to bring into CHKC. The evidence of Zhang on this score, whose evidence I
                    accept, is consistent with Neo dealing with the China workers and not
                        Lim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> All these little pieces of evidence indicated
                    that the person mainly running the Proxies system was Neo, not Lim. Lim also
                    assisted Neo in this scheme, maintaining the Salary Accruals and also providing
                    some names for Proxies. In time to come, Lim also shared in the Salary
                    Accruals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Secondly, Neo himself benefited from the
                    Salary Accruals. He admitted in his own AEIC and in cross-examination that he
                    had drawn $10,487,256.54 in Salary Accruals. Neo’s explanation was that
                    whenever he wanted to draw money from CHKC, he would inform Lim and Lim would
                    just make the necessary arrangements without explaining to Neo how these
                    withdrawals were recorded. I do not believe him. CHKC’s accounts show that
                    the $10,487,256.54 in Salary Accruals was recorded between 1997 and 2003. Lim,
                    on the other hand, only obtained Salary Accruals between 2001 and 2006. If what
                    Neo says is true, <em>viz</em>. that Lim created the Salary
                    Accruals accounts to withdraw money without Neo’s knowledge, it made
                    little sense for Lim to credit Salary Accruals to Neo from 1997 and only help
                    himself to a slice of the pie from 2001 onwards. Lim’s version of events
                    is more consistent with the underlying facts. It was more likely than not that
                    Neo, with Lim’s active and willing collaboration, implemented the Salary
                    Accruals system and Neo later included Lim from 2001 as a means of profit
                    sharing. Because the proverbial cat had been let out of the bag, these huge
                    withdrawals, wrongfully treated as expenses, had to be put right and this was
                    one of the main causes for the $20 million deficit in CHKC’s 2006
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Thirdly, Neo admitted that he had held Lim
                    in very high regard prior to their falling out. Although Neo came to trial with
                    the strategy of downplaying Lim’s importance to CHKC, I did not think Neo
                    could maintain such a position while claiming at the same time that he placed
                    “absolute trust and confidence in him”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> The
                    objective evidence does in fact show that Lim played a huge role in CHKC’s
                    fortunes. I have already dealt with this above. CHKC’s business began to
                    flounder after Lim’s departure in 2006. Again as noted above, CHKC was
                    unable to fulfil its sub-contract obligations to the main contractor in the
                    Pinnacle project and had to exit the contract prematurely signing an exit
                    agreement acknowledging its inability to perform. CHKC was also ejected from a
                    project involving the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort due to numerous
                    complaints from its main contractor. Lim’s replacement, one Ler Hock Eng,
                    had left CHKC by the time of this trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    When pressed in cross-examination, Neo
                    admitted that he had regarded Lim very highly and even treated him like a
                        brother:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>

                            with me it is quite inappropriate to term Mr Lim as just a mere
                            employee? He was much more than that, wasn’t he?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Before all these things happened, during the
                            initial period when he was with Chip Hup, yes, he made a lot of
                            contributions to the company.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That means during the time when he was with Chip
                            Hup Hup Kee, in your eyes Lim Leong Huat was not just a mere 9 to 5
                            minor employee, right? He was somebody very important in your
                            organisation, isn’t that true?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s right. He would report to me in
                            respect of all matters.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In fact, your relationship with him was so close,
                            you even regarded him as being practically on par with
                        you?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, yes. Then, yes.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Neo also admitted that he was prepared to
                    share profits with Lim (see [16] above):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So Mr Lim says to you, in fact his value to
                            you was so great, you were prepared to share profits with him and to
                            allow him to run [AZ] alongside Chip Hup Hup Kee because you were
                            concerned about Mr Lim Leong Huat no longer remaining in your
                            company, agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. When I did not know what kind of a person he
                            was, I agreed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Finally, I find it unbelievable that Neo
                    could have been oblivious as he claims to the system of Salary Accruals all
                    these years. CHKC’s own witnesses, Aileen and Juliet, alleged that Lim
                    would instruct them regularly on crediting Salary Accruals to his and
                    Neo’s name. Aileen and Juliet also acknowledged at trial that they had
                    been aware of the Proxies system. Therefore, they certainly must have known that
                    the non-CPF components of these Proxies’ salaries were not being paid. Why
                    then, were they content to credit Salary Accruals to Lim’s account
                    regularly on his instructions without blowing the whistle? I certainly do not
                    see any incentive for them to assist Lim in committing a fraud on CHKC. The most
                    likely explanation is, and I so find, that Neo himself was not only aware of but
                    in fact set up and managed the Salary Accruals with Lim’s able assistance
                    from the very start.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Taking all these factors into consideration,
                    I make the following findings. First, I find that Neo was mainly in control of
                    the Proxies system and the Salary Accruals account from the beginning, despite
                    his many denials. Secondly and consequently, I find that Neo was knowingly
                    drawing Salary Accruals from CHKC for his own benefit. Thirdly, I find that Neo
                    had willingly included Lim from 2001 in the Salary Accruals account as a means
                    of profit-sharing with Lim, of which $1,850,403.23 has been shown to be drawn
                    out by Lim. Fourthly, it follows, and I so find, that it was Neo and not Lim who
                    was giving directions to CHKC’s accounts staff on how to deal with these
                    various false entries in CHKC’s accounts. Since the false entries were
                    initiated or caused by Neo, CHKC’s counterclaim for $5,161,671.65 must
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    As I shall deal with in greater detail below
                    (see [182]–[186]), one of the most serious aspects of this case which is
                    against Neo is his repeated and blatant lying in his affidavits and in his
                    blatantly untrue evidence, given more than once, before other courts on oath,
                    that the salaries of these Proxies were real and that he had actually paid them
                    and was therefore entitled to reimbursement from CHKC. He had procured Aileen
                    and Juliet to perpetrate the same lies also on affidavits and in oral testimony
                    before other courts. They lied and misled or attempted to mislead other judges
                    in the Subordinate and High Courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I must take pains to emphasise that I have
                    not made a finding on the exact amount of Salary Accruals which were supposed to
                    be credited to Lim’s name. In my view there is insufficient evidence
                    before me to make such a finding and it is not necessary for the resolution of
                    this issue in any case. As I have mentioned above at [117], Lim has not made a
                    claim for any outstanding Salary Accruals allegedly due to him in the present
                    action and has reserved his right to make such a claim against the relevant
                    parties in separate proceedings. Thus, it is not necessary for me to decide on
                    Lim’s entitlement to the balance of the Salary Accruals in his credit. I
                    would just opine that if Lim brings an action to recover this balance, he has to
                    deal with the hurdle of the obvious illegality of the Salary Accruals system (in
                    allowing Lim to draw out tax-free income from CHKC). I would also add that my
                    findings in this case do not preclude CHKC from contending in separate
                    proceedings that the $6,151,856.24 Lim alleges he is entitled to, has already
                    been paid. CHKC has merely failed to discharge the burden of proof on them that
                    Lim drew out and misappropriated monies other than the $1,850,403.23 from Salary
                    Accruals. If Lim chooses to claim the balance of Salary Accruals, the burden of
                    proof would be on him to show that he has not been paid. Beyond this, I say no
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">False re-classification of $949,191.59</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In the light of my finding above that Neo
                    was the one who caused CHKC’s accounts department to record false entries
                    in its accounts, it follows that Lim is not responsible for causing the debt of
                    $949,151.59 owing by AZ to CHKC to be reflected as settled when in fact it has
                    not. CHKC’s counterclaim against Lim for the $949,151.59 must accordingly
                    fail. That being said, Lim did not dispute that AZ owes this debt to CHKC. He
                    even acknowledged in cross-examination that if there was no reason for
                    setting-off such a debt, this sum should by right be returned to
                        CHKC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> Since no reason
                    has been put forward, I allow CHKC’s counterclaim against AZ for the sum
                    of $949,151.59.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHKC’s claim for wrongful overpayment of salaries</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overpayment of salaries by CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    CHKC’s case is that from around 1998
                    to 2006, Lim, acting without authorisation, had caused CHKC to overpay salaries
                    to him and Mdm Tan. The details of such overpayment are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lim’s authorised salary since
                        he joined CHKC in 1994 was $7,000 a month. For the years 2000 to 2006, Lim
                        had been paying himself monthly salaries ranging from $8,000 to $22,500. The
                        total unauthorised salary drawn out by Lim during this period was
                        $380,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_b"></a>(b)     From
                        1998 to 2000, Lim had caused CHKC to pay a full monthly salary to
                        Mdm Tan ranging from $3,700 to $22,500 even though she did not do any
                        actual work for the company. The total salary drawn out by Mdm Tan
                        during this period was $369,460.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    CHKC had originally claimed in its pleadings
                    the sum of $469,740 against Mdm Tan in respect of overpayment of salaries
                    by CHKC from 1996 to 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>
                    Mdm Tan’s original defence was that she was a Proxy in CHKC. However,
                    unlike other Proxies in CHKC, Mdm Tan actually drew a full salary instead
                    of being paid only the CPF component of her salary. Mdm Tan claimed to be
                    entitled to this full salary as she had provided consideration to CHKC in being
                    a Proxy. When CHKC brought summary judgment proceedings against Mdm Tan in
                    RA 159/2007, Woo J granted final judgment for the sum of $426,700. As for
                    the balance of $43,040, which was the CPF component of her salary during this
                    period, Woo J held (see <em>Lim Leong Huat</em> at
                    [28]) that Mdm Tan had an arguable case on whether CHKC was entitled to
                    recover this amount if it was knowingly paid to her to achieve an illegal
                    purpose (being the maintenance of the Proxies system to deceive MOM and IRAS).
                    As with the final judgment for the sum of $347,030 against Lim (see [80] above),
                    Woo J’s judgment against Mdm Tan for $426,700 was set aside by
                    agreement of the parties in CA 142/2007, but CHKC was allowed to retain the said
                    sum until the conclusion of this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Mdm Tan subsequently amended her
                    defence to state that she had only been a Proxy in CHKC from 1996 to 1998.
                    During that period, she was only paid the CPF component of her salary. From 1998
                    to 2000, she was no longer a Proxy in CHKC but was nevertheless paid a full
                    salary pursuant to an oral agreement between Lim and Neo (on behalf of CHKC).
                    According to Mdm Tan, Lim and Neo had agreed that a portion of Lim’s
                    monthly salary in CHKC was to be paid to her directly by way of gift. Hence,
                    although Mdm Tan did not do any work for CHKC, she claimed to be entitled
                    to this salary anyway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Mdm Tan also disputed the quantum of
                    salary CHKC alleged was drawn out by her. She stated in her AEIC that her total
                    salary from 1998 to 2000 was only $369,460 (consisting of $351,800 in non-CPF
                    salary and $17,660 as employer’s CPF contributions). The CPF component
                    paid to her for being a Proxy from 1996 to 1998 was $8,760. Hence, she claimed
                    that the total salary drawn out by her from 1996 to 2000 was $378,220 instead of
                    $469,740 as CHKC alleged.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    CHKC accepts the figures given by

                    to claim against her only in respect of her salary between 1998 and 2000. In
                    light of Woo J’s judgment in RA 159/2007, CHKC does not seek to
                    recover the sum of $8,760 paid to Mdm Tan as CPF from 1996 to 1998 when she
                    was a Proxy in CHKC. Therefore, CHKC has revised its claim against Mdm Tan
                    to $369,460.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Salaries paid by AZ but charged to CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    CHKC further contended that from 1998 to
                    2006, Lim, Mdm Tan and Yeow all drew salaries from AZ which AZ had
                    wrongfully charged to CHKC. The details of such salaries are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_a"></a>(a)     From 1998 to 2005, Lim had drawn a
                        salary ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 from AZ which amounted to a total of
                        $641,600.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_b"></a>(b)     From
                        2000 to 2006, Mdm Tan had drawn a salary ranging from $17,500 to
                        $22,500 from AZ which amounted to a total of $1,215,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_c"></a>(c)     From 1998 to 2006, when Yeow was in
                        the employ of CHKC, Yeow was also simultaneously employed by AZ. During this
                        period, Lim, without the knowledge and consent of CHKC, approved the payment
                        of two sets of salaries for Yeow under both companies from 2001 to 2006. The
                        portion of Yeow’s salary paid by AZ, amounting to $215,170.03, was
                        subsequently wrongfully charged to CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Total amount claimed for overpayment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Adding all these sums together, CHKC’s
                    total counterclaim against Lim on this issue amounts to $2,822,230.03. CHKC also
                    counterclaims $1,584,960 against Mdm Tan consisting of the $369,460 paid by
                    CHKC and $1,215,500 paid by AZ but wrongfully charged to CHKC. Quite
                    surprisingly, CHKC has not made any claim against AZ here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s and Mdm Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overpayment of salaries by CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Lim’s defence in respect of the
                    overpayment by CHKC of $380,500 is that his pay raises were all approved by Neo
                    and authorised by CHKC. As for the overpayment of $369,460 to Mdm Tan, I
                    have already set out her position above at [134].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Salaries paid by AZ but charged to CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Lim denied that the salaries paid by AZ to
                    him, Mdm Tan and Yeow were charged to CHKC. He stated in his AEIC that CHKC
                    and AZ had a standing arrangement such that each month, CHKC would advance a sum
                    equivalent to the net salaries of AZ’s employees on AZ’s payroll.
                    This was because CHKC had a GIRO payment facility whilst AZ did not have one.
                    CHKC would subsequently issue invoices to AZ for the sums advanced by GIRO.
                    These invoices were either paid directly by AZ or set off against progress
                    payments due to AZ by CHKC in respect of work done on the 11
                        Projects.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overpayment of salaries by CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Having considered the evidence, I have no
                    hesitation in finding that the payments of $380,500 and $369,460 to Lim and
                    Mdm Tan respectively were made with Neo’s approval. I find that the
                    “salary” paid to Mdm Tan was another avenue of rewarding Lim.
                    The most pertinent piece of evidence by far on this issue is a series of bank
                    reports showing the names of various CHKC employees and their corresponding
                    monthly salaries. These reports were made monthly for the purposes of
                    authorising the payment of CHKC’s employees’ salaries by GIRO and
                    Neo personally signed every page of these monthly reports. Obviously, Neo must
                    have known and approved of Lim’s and Mdm Tan’s salaries if he
                    could sign these reports every month without asking any questions. When Neo was
                    shown the bank reports in cross-examination, he claimed to have just signed
                    without noticing the individual entries showing how much salary was paid to a
                    particular employee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Once again, I find him to
                    be disingenuous. Mdm Tan’s name was the only entry on some of the
                    pages of these bank reports, which Neo had signed. It is totally unbelievable
                    that Neo would continue to sign these bank reports, month after month, and yet
                    fail to notice that Lim and Mdm Tan were being paid salaries which
                    according to him they were not supposed to receive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Lim also produced a copy of a table
                    detailing the gross monthly salaries and recommended bonuses of CHKC staff for
                    the year 1998.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> Lim’s evidence was that he would show
                    tables such as this to Neo and the two would discuss how much bonus to award to
                    the rest of CHKC’s employees. Neo admitted seeing such tables in
                    cross-examination but claimed that he was only interested in the total
                        figure:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>

                            of the year he [Lim] would come to me with his proposal of how much
                            salary to pay, but I would not ask him the details as to how many
                            months’ bonus each staff would get. He merely told me a total. I
                            was interested in only the total. I wasn’t interested in the
                            individual amounts that were paid to staff.</span></p>

                            page, sticking out, apart from yours?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s right. I merely signed. I did not look
                            at the details.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Neo was blatantly trying to deny the obvious. I do not for a
                    moment believe that he would instruct Lim on how much money he wanted and yet
                    not see for himself how much money Lim was being paid by CHKC. His attempt to
                    give this obviously untrue answer only shows that he knew of Lim’s and
                    Mdm Tan’s salaries and was trying to hide his knowledge of
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Finally, CHKC’s own extract of gross
                    monthly salaries drawn by Lim showed that he was paid a monthly salary of
                    $10,000 in 1996, $20,000 in 1997, $17,000 in 1998 and $20,000 in
                        1999.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> Yet
                    CHKC has inexplicably only decided to claim overpayment of salary above $7,000 a
                    month from November 2000 onwards. Neo was unable to give any coherent
                    explanation when this fact was pointed out to him in
                cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    I must confess that I find Lim’s and
                    Mdm Tan’s defence very strange. It seemed very puzzling for Lim to
                    arrange for CHKC to pay Mdm Tan a portion of his salary as a gift when he
                    could have simply given her that sum each month directly since they were husband
                    and wife. This is another example of Lim’s convoluted and circuitous
                    manner of doing things which I initially found unsettling during the trial.
                    Furthermore, Mdm Tan had also tendered a letter of resignation from CHKC
                    dated 1 September 2000. If she had been paid monthly salaries as a gift
                    from Lim, why was there a need for her to resign from the company? These little
                    oddities raised doubts in my mind about whether Lim was being entirely truthful
                    with his side of the story. Nevertheless, on the totality of the evidence, it
                    seems patently clear that Neo was fully aware of Lim’s and
                    Mdm Tan’s monthly salaries all this while and this was in all
                    probability another scheme of Lim’s to reduce his tax exposure or profile.
                    Consequently, with my finding that Neo approved these salaries, CHKC’s
                    counterclaim for overpayment of salaries must fail. Furthermore, since CHKC has
                    retained the sum of $426,700 awarded by Woo J against Mdm Tan in RA
                    159/2007, this sum has to be returned to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Salaries paid by AZ but charged to CHKC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Both parties have accepted that CHKC had
                    rendered invoices to AZ for the monthly sums it advanced to AZ by way of GIRO to
                    pay AZ’s employees. The parties have also accepted that most of these
                    invoices were settled by way of set-off against progress payments due to AZ by
                    CHKC in respect of work done on the 11 Projects. Therefore, the issue is whether
                    AZ was entitled to set off such amounts. This depends on my findings in respect
                    of CHKC’s counterclaim on the 11 Projects issue (see below at
                    [155]–[168]). The parties agreed that if I find that AZ was not
                    beneficially entitled to the progress claims from the 11 Projects, CHKC’s
                    invoices would remain unpaid since AZ would have no right to set them off
                    against the progress payments. Lim and AZ would accordingly be liable to account
                    to CHKC for these salaries. Conversely, if I find that AZ is entitled to the
                    progress claims under the 11 Projects, the setting-off of CHKC’s invoices
                    would be valid and CHKC’s counterclaim on this issue must then be
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CHKC’s counterclaim in respect of the 11 Projects</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CHKC’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    I finally deal with CHKC’s
                    counterclaim in respect of the 11 Projects, which is the last and by far the
                    largest counterclaim in these proceedings. Similar to its counterclaim against
                    Lim in respect of the false entries and misappropriations, CHKC has also
                    produced widely differing versions of its story at different times. CHKC’s
                    original story, when its counterclaim was first filed in 2007, was that sometime
                    in 1997, when its business was rapidly growing, Lim had advised Neo that it was
                    necessary for CHKC to hire additional foreign workers to expand its business as
                    CHKC was engaged primarily in structural steel works which were labour-intensive
                    projects. For this purpose, Lim advised Neo to allow him to incorporate AZ so
                    that it could obtain a licence from the Building and Construction Authority
                    (“BCA”) allowing it to hire foreign workers for CHKC’s
                    benefit. Neo agreed and CHKC provided a sum of $1m for Lim to incorporate AZ in
                    August 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Lim also advised Neo that it was necessary
                    for AZ to be engaged in a minimum value of projects in order to maintain its
                    licence with BCA. For that reason, Lim proposed that CHKC could notionally
                    assign a certain number of projects to AZ for the sole purpose of meeting this
                    minimum requirement. Neo and Lim came to an oral agreement that these projects
                    were ultimately for CHKC’s benefit. Thus, the 11 Projects came to be
                    assigned from CHKC to AZ. When CHKC first brought this counterclaim in 2007, it
                    alleged that the terms of the oral agreement between Lim and Neo were that AZ
                    would account for <em>all gross revenues</em> received in
                    respect of the 11 Projects. CHKC also claimed then that it did all the work and
                    bore all the costs of the 11 Projects. As a result, CHKC’s original
                    counterclaim in respect of the 11 Projects alone amounted to
                    $41,959,353.82.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    However, in November 2008, CHKC applied
                    to amend its pleadings to make drastic changes to its story. First, Neo
                    introduced a new reason for the setting-up of AZ: First, as their order book
                    grew, Lim advised Neo not to have all his eggs in one basket and advised Neo to
                    set up another company. Hence CCPL was incorporated in February 1997. Secondly,
                    at a later point in time, Lim warned Neo that if CHKC were to run into any
                    ‘compliance’ problems with the authorities, CHKC and its related
                    companies like CCPL might all be suspended from operations, preventing them from
                    completing their projects. Thus, Neo stated in his new story that Lim had
                    recommended AZ to be structured such that it was not related to CHKC or to Neo.
                    That way, AZ would be able to step into CHKC’s shoes and fulfil its
                    obligations if CHKC’s operations were suspended or shut down. Lim agreed,
                    in the present proceedings, that this was one of the reasons why AZ was
                    originally set up. AZ was therefore incorporated 7 months later in September
                    1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    More importantly, CHKC now alleged that
                    instead of being entitled to the gross revenues of AZ under the 11 Projects, it
                    was now claiming the <em>net profits</em> received by AZ.
                    This also meant that CHKC had completely abandoned its earlier allegation that
                    it did all the work and incurred all the costs on the 11 Projects. CHKC’s
                    counterclaim on this issue, after deducting expenses AZ incurred on its own and
                    prior reimbursements from AZ to CHKC, has thus been reduced by slightly more
                    than half to $20,667,020.92. I should add that this sum does not include the
                    salaries paid by AZ to Lim, Mdm Tan and Yeow which CHKC alleged AZ had no
                    right to set off against progress payments made by CHKC to AZ on the 11
                    Projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unauthorised expenses of $185,149.87</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Finally, CHKC has included a claim of
                    $185,149.87 against AZ which has been computed into its counterclaim of
                    $20,667,020.92. According to CHKC, the $185,149.87 represents unauthorised
                    expenses incurred by AZ and paid by CHKC along with other progress payments and
                    legitimate expenses which AZ billed CHKC for in relation to the 11 Projects.
                    This sum consists of two parts: (a) $130,695 which was used to purchase four
                    personal insurance policies for Lim; and (b) $54,454.87 which was spent on
                    Lim’s house at 54 Wilkinson Road. I have isolated this sum of $185,149.87
                    from the rest of CHKC’s counterclaim for $20,667,020.92 because even if I
                    find that AZ was entitled to retain all profits from the 11 Projects, CHKC can
                    still recover the $185,149.87 if it shows that this expense was wrongfully
                    charged to it by AZ.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lim’s and AZ’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Lim and AZ do not dispute the existence of
                    the oral agreement between him and Neo in 1997 that the 11 Projects would be
                    assigned to AZ. However, Lim contended that neither he nor AZ is liable to
                    account to CHKC for the net profits of the 11 Projects. His story is as follows.
                    Sometime in or around 1997, after working for CHKC for about three years, Lim
                    had thoughts of leaving and starting his own construction company. I have
                    accepted this and I have found that at that point of time, Neo was keen for Lim
                    to continue working for CHKC because Lim had been very successful in growing
                    CHKC’s business. Neo therefore agreed with Lim that he could incorporate
                    his own company and run it while concurrently working for CHKC. Under the terms
                    of the agreement, AZ would not be a direct competitor to CHKC. At the same time,
                    as mentioned above at [148], AZ would provide backup to CHKC and take over its
                    projects in the event that CHKC’s operations were suspended or shut
                    down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Lim also stated that as part of the
                    agreement with Neo, CHKC would assign the 11 Projects to AZ for its benefit. AZ
                    would do the actual work and bear its own costs on the 11 Projects, and would be
                    entitled to any corresponding profits. In return, AZ would pay a notional
                    management fee of around 2%–6% of the project revenue to CHKC. Lim stated
                    that this arrangement was implemented in practice in the following manner. CHKC
                    would usually be the subcontractor engaged by the respective main contractors on
                    the 11 Projects. Thus, while AZ did the actual work, it was CHKC who received
                    the progress payments for these projects in the first instance. CHKC would then
                    deduct its share of the management fees from these progress payments.
                    Furthermore, since CHKC and AZ worked closely together and often shared
                    resources, CHKC would also deduct any expenses and costs it incurred for the
                    project on AZ’s behalf. After setting off any remaining mutual debts
                    between CHKC and AZ in relation to the 11 Projects, AZ would then be entitled to
                    the balance of the progress payments. Lim stated that this arrangement was
                    varied for two of the 11 Projects:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_a"></a>(a)     CHKC was the developer and not the
                        contractor for a project named “Parbury”, which involved the
                        demolition and erection of a few houses. For this project, AZ received all
                        progress payments without having to pay a management fee to CHKC because
                        CHKC had already taken its profits from the sale of the houses since it was
                        the overall developer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_b"></a>(b)     AZ was CHKC’s subcontractor for a project named
                        “Prefab Technology Center” (“PTC”) which
                        involved the fabrication of pre-cast components for use in Housing &amp;
                        Development Board projects. Lim states that AZ billed and received progress
                        payments from CHKC based on fixed and agreed rates for this
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the 11 Projects were assigned to AZ for its
                    benefit, Lim claimed that neither he nor AZ needs to account to CHKC for the
                    profits from these projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unauthorised expenses of $185,149.87</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Lim and AZ denied CHKC’s allegation
                    that the sum of $185,149.87 was wrongfully charged to it by AZ. Lim said that of
                    the four insurance policies CHKC alleged he bought, he only owns one – AIA
                    Policy No L52497807. This insurance policy was obtained for him by Neo
                    around 1997 through a person named Tan Lay Cheng (“TLC”), whom Lim
                    alleged was Neo’s mistress. Lim stated that Neo agreed for CHKC to pay the
                    premiums on his insurance policy. This was in fact done prior to 2001. From 2001
                    onwards, it was AZ who paid the premiums on Lim’s insurance policy and
                    these expenses were charged to CHKC along with the progress claims for the 11
                    Projects. Lim said that all this was done with Neo’s knowledge and
                    approval since he wanted to help TLC in her insurance business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As for the expenses charged to CHKC in
                    respect of Lim’s house at 54 Wilkinson Road, Lim stated that Neo had
                    authorised these expense claims to be made by AZ to CHKC. Neo later caused
                    adjustments to be made to CHKC’s accounts to reflect corresponding
                    reductions of the amounts reflected as owing from CHKC to Lim. Hence, Lim said
                    that CHKC did not bear these expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Despite the massive amount at stake in
                    relation to this part of CHKC’s counterclaim, there is only one issue here
                    and a simple one at that. As with almost all the other claims and counterclaims
                    flung by both sides at each other, the question turns on whether I believe Lim
                    or Neo. Having reviewed the evidence, I accept Lim’s version of the terms
                    of the oral agreement over Neo’s. My reasons are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The most striking factor that led me to find
                    in Lim’s favour is the fact that prior to the dispute between Lim and Neo,
                    CHKC had never once attempted to make AZ account for the profits under the 11
                    Projects. AZ started working on the first of the 11 Projects since December
                    1997. For nearly nine years until the argument between Lim and Neo in 2006, Neo
                    had not even asked Lim what happened to the profits from the 11 Projects, much
                    less demanded an account. Even when CHKC was experiencing cash flow problems,
                    Neo had never asked Lim about the 11 Projects. It was not as if Neo was
                    blissfully unaware that AZ was retaining profits from the 11 Projects all this
                    time. On the contrary, Neo obviously knew of this fact as can be seen from the
                    transcript of the very telling conversation Neo had with Yeow on 1 February
                    2007 which was secretly recorded by Yeow:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I [Neo] have been very nice to all of you, it is just that I am not
                        minding the business. I let him do the controlling. <em>For
                            more than 10 years, I have even seen his AZ took my tens of millions of
                            dollars</em>, all of which was not declared from taxation.
                        … He took tens of millions of dollars from me, do you know that?
                        … My PTC [referring to the PTC project] lost over $3 million, all of
                        which went to him. This is called losing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As noted previously, this conversation took place when Neo was trying
                    to persuade Yeow to give evidence on his behalf against Lim. The transcript is
                    revealing and rings true because it also showed the veiled threats Neo made to
                    Yeow if Yeow chose to give evidence on behalf of Lim. Yeow’s evidence,
                    which I accept, was that Neo promised him a monetary inducement as well if he
                    stayed and helped Neo against Lim and Neo would forget about the sums of money
                    given to him by Lim which Neo claimed had been misappropriated from CHKC. Neo
                    made good his threat by commencing Suit No136 of 2007 (and a related Suit No137
                    of 2007) against Yeow when Yeow chose not to give evidence for
                Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Since Neo had clearly been aware that AZ was
                    keeping the profits from the 11 Projects, why did it never occur to him to seek
                    an account from Lim? Neo came up with another lie when asked this question in
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Neo, it would be very natural for you to
                            have come hunting for the profits, but your story is erected on an
                            unbelievable foundation. For eight years you have financial problems and
                            you never thought it fit to chase down the profit, because the truth is
                            that in August 1997 you agreed that Mr Lim could have AZ and its
                            profits; isn’t that the truth?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, I don’t agree. No, no fool -- that person
                            would be a fool if he agreed to let him take everything.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Neo, you are not a fool.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What he told me was that I have to sign AZ’s
                            cheque when the payment was for AZ, because the money will eventually
                            come back to me, so very naturally I agreed that this was the correct
                            way to do so. So I make no checks on this. I didn’t expect that
                            the money did not come back.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Neo’s answer flatly contradicted what he said in his
                    recorded conversation with Yeow, <em>viz</em>, he, Neo, had
                    watched AZ take his millions for so many years, yet he continued to maintain at
                    trial that he did not check on AZ because he thought the money was coming back
                    to CHKC. Neo was, once again, obviously not telling the truth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    As Lim’s counsel put it, Neo was
                    definitely not a fool. Neo and CHKC tried to argue in these proceedings that it
                    would be ludicrous for CHKC to assign the 11 Projects beneficially to AZ in
                    return for notional management fees totalling $1,525,888.94, which was a bare
                    fraction of the $20,667,020.92 AZ received in profits. However, Neo failed to
                    acknowledge Lim’s continued contributions to CHKC from the time AZ was set
                    up. He stated in his own AEIC that from 1997 to 2006, CHKC was engaged in about
                    60 construction projects with a total contract value of $543m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> In
                    comparison, in the same period, 1997 to 2006, AZ’s 11 contracts had a
                    total contract value of $38 million. Looking at the big picture, it is clear
                    that Neo and CHKC gained immensely from Lim’s continued presence from
                    1997. I do not think that Lim, who had no equity stake in CHKC’s business,
                    would have stayed on in CHKC out of mere love and affection for Neo. It is more
                    likely that Neo, being the savvy businessman he is, had done his calculations
                    well. The 11 Projects were as much an incentive for Lim to stay on and work for
                    CHKC as his other bonuses, salary increments, and his sharing in the Salary
                    Accruals. When all was said and done, the 11 Projects made up a fraction of the
                    benefits Neo derived from CHKC’s continued success, which was due largely
                    to Lim’s industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Another strong reason why I believe
                    Lim’s story over Neo’s is that Neo had offered no good explanation
                    for the radical change in his story. When CHKC first brought its counterclaim in
                    2007, Neo had claimed that CHKC had done all the work and incurred all the costs
                    on the 11 Projects and that it was entitled to the gross revenues from these
                    projects. Neo even affirmed several affidavits to this effect. When CHKC
                    subsequently applied to amend its pleadings to the current version, Woo Bih
                    Li J required it to file an affidavit explaining why it was drastically
                    changing its position. Neo’s affidavit, filed on 10 February 2009,
                    claimed that at the time, CHKC did not understand how the costs of the 11
                    Projects and the inter billings between both parties were booked. I do not
                    believe this explanation at all. CHKC’s original claim could not have been
                    a simple mistake on its part because it already had an entire litigation team
                    consisting of lawyers, accounting experts and its own employees from the start.
                    I do not for a moment believe that from 2007, when CHKC filed its original
                    counterclaim until late 2008 when it applied to amend its pleadings, it did not
                    know how to compute the exact amount of profits it was claiming from AZ in
                    respect of the 11 Projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Neo was similarly unable to explain
                    CHKC’s drastic change in position during cross-examination. On the
                    contrary, he even admitted that when he filed his affidavit of 10 February
                    2009, he was still trying to avoid giving such an explanation:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Neo also conceded that he did not intend to
                    admit that CHKC’s amendments to its defence in 2008 amounted to a change
                    in its position until he was forced to do so by Woo J in 2009:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span></p>

                            that you had to make a shift in position in your pleadings and claims
                            relating to the 11 projects until you were forced to do so by Justice
                            Woo Bih Li, isn’t that true, in 2009?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I find that the real reason why CHKC had to
                    drastically amend its pleadings from a claim for revenue to a claim for profit
                    is this. CHKC and Neo knew from the start that Lim was entitled to the profits
                    from the 11 Projects. Nevertheless, CHKC filed a massive counterclaim including
                    a $41,959,353.82 claim for revenue from the 11 Projects as part of its strategy
                    to intimidate Lim, even though Neo knew such a claim was baseless. However, Neo
                    subsequently realised that such a claim was untenable because its allegation
                    that AZ did no work and incurred no costs on the 11 Projects flew in the face of
                    overwhelming evidence on Lim’s and AZ’s part. Thus, CHKC revised its
                    claim to a claim for profit, making it harder for Lim and AZ to disprove. This
                    also explains why Neo and CHKC have failed to provide a coherent reason for
                    their amendments – they cannot afford to admit that they filed a claim
                    from the start in the knowledge that it was not a genuine claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    I find that CHKC has also failed to prove
                    its allegation that it had lent the sum of $1m to Lim to incorporate AZ in 1997.
                    CHKC relies on an entry in its general ledger showing that $1m had been lent to
                    Lim in 1997,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> but AZ’s own general ledger shows that
                    it was originally incorporated with a paid-up capital of $200,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> CHKC also did not adduce
                    any further evidence showing that the $1m loan it allegedly provided to Lim was
                    in fact used to incorporate AZ. On the whole, I find on a balance of
                    probabilities that Lim capitalised AZ using his own funds. This fact lends
                    credence to Lim’s position that AZ was an independent company with its own
                    projects instead of existing for the purpose of making profits for CHKC.
                    Further, if Neo’s ostensible reason for incorporating AZ was true, it did
                    not quite sit well with AZ being set up only 7 months after Neo incorporated
                    CCPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Finally, Lim has produced several extracts
                    from CHKC’s general ledger showing the various payments it received from
                    its various employers or main contractors for nine of the 11 Projects. Lim has
                    juxtaposed these sums against the progress payments made by CHKC to AZ for these
                    nine projects. A comparison of the figures strongly corroborates Lim’s
                    case that CHKC in fact retained a notional management fee of between 2%–6%
                    for these projects. (As mentioned above at [152], there were no management fees
                    charged for the Parbury project while the fees for the PTC project were
                    calculated separately.)</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Lim’s figures, which were also included in his AEIC,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> were not challenged by CHKC at
                    trial. CHKC has only submitted that it made no commercial sense for it to assign
                    the 11 Projects to AZ in return for these management fees which only totalled
                    $1,525,888.94. I have already dealt with this submission at [158]
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    It remains for me to deal with some points
                    raised by CHKC’s counsel. First, CHKC alleged that Neo’s signatures
                    on the Quintet and Punggol East C28 subcontracts for the assignment of these
                    projects to AZ were forged. CHKC submitted that these forgeries show that Lim
                    had caused CHKC to assign the 11 Projects to AZ without Neo’s knowledge
                    and approval. Leaving aside the question of whether CHKC has proved its
                    allegations of forgery, I do not see how CHKC’s contention was strictly
                    relevant to the issue. Neo’s own position, as set out in his AEIC, is that
                    he and Lim had agreed for CHKC to assign some of its projects to AZ, and that
                    Lim would determine which projects were to be assigned. The dispute between the
                    parties is whether Neo and Lim had agreed for AZ to account for the profits on
                    the projects that were assigned to it by CHKC. As such, I do not see how this
                    submission can assist CHKC in the face of all the other evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Next, CHKC submitted that Lim and Neo
                    treated AZ as if it were part of CHKC:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_a"></a>(a)     AZ obtained its Chinese foreign
                        workers from CHKC and these workers were managed by CHKC’s China
                        management team. Lim also admitted in cross-examination that when the China
                        team reported to Neo on the progress of projects at the weekly Monday
                        morning meetings, they made no distinction between CHKC’s and
                        AZ’s projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_b"></a>(b)     CHKC bore all the costs of bringing in and training foreign workers
                        which were engaged by AZ on the 11 Projects. The levies on these foreign
                        workers were also all paid by CHKC. CHKC also owned all the machinery and
                        equipment used by AZ to carry out work under the 11 Projects without
                        charging AZ for their use.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_166-p2_c"></a>(c)     CHKC and AZ shared office premises. CHKC paid for all
                        outgoings including rental and utilities expenses without charging AZ.
                        CHKC’s office staff would also perform support functions for AZ (such
                        as accounting and administrative work) without AZ being charged for such
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">CHKC thus submitted that having regard to the ways
                    CHKC and AZ were run, it made no commercial sense for CHKC to assign the 11
                    Projects to AZ purely for AZ’s own benefit when many of the other dealings
                    between the two companies were not arm’s length transactions. This
                    arrangement only made sense if AZ was not an independent company and had to
                    account to CHKC for profits on the 11 Projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    I cannot agree with this submission. While
                    the above factors evince a very close relationship between CHKC and AZ, they do
                    not necessarily show that AZ existed solely to carry out CHKC’s work and
                    plough the profits from the 11 Projects back into CHKC. Since Lim and Neo had an
                    extremely good working relationship back then, and Neo was keen to keep Lim
                    working for him at CHKC it would not be surprising for CHKC and AZ to share many
                    of their resources. This did not mean that CHKC was sponsoring all of AZ’s
                    operations – AZ still paid CHKC for labour costs and reimbursed it for
                    expenses incurred on AZ’s behalf on the 11 Projects. As for other expenses
                    such as the salaries of the China management team and the office staff which
                    were fully borne by CHKC, I agree with Lim that AZ’s share of these
                    expenses was paid through the management fees CHKC retained from the 11
                    Projects. Ultimately, despite their close working relationship, I find that Neo
                    and CHKC were fully aware that AZ was meant to be an independent company, not a
                        <em>de facto</em> subsidiary of CHKC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    On the totality of the evidence, I therefore
                    agree with Lim and find that the 11 Projects were beneficially assigned by CHKC
                    to AZ. AZ is thus not liable to account to CHKC in respect of its profits of
                    $20,667,020.92. It also follows that AZ was entitled to set off the sums CHKC
                    advanced to it to pay Lim, Mdm Tan and Yeow against the progress payments
                    made to it by CHKC. Consequently, CHKC’s counterclaim for overpayment of
                    salaries by AZ (see [145] above) is also dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unauthorised expenses of $185,149.87</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Finally, I set out my findings on the
                    $185,149.87 which CHKC said AZ wrongfully charged to it. In respect of the four
                    insurance policies totalling $130,695, Lim clarified during cross-examination
                    that he still owns one policy and that the other three have since been cashed
                    out by him,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span> and it was not
                    really disputed that all these policies were purchased by Lim at inception.
                    Although it is not clear in his AEIC whether Lim had purchased all four policies
                    from the same person (TLC), I am quite certain he had because the policies are
                    numbered consecutively: L52497807, L52497808, L52497809 and L52497810. The issue
                    then is whether Neo had approved charging the premium of these policies to CHKC.
                    On a balance of probabilities, I find that he did. Lim’s evidence on the
                    circumstances surrounding his purchase of the insurance policies from TLC, and
                    on Neo’s motives for helping her, (Lim alleged she was Neo’s
                    mistress), were not challenged in cross-examination. On the other hand, CHKC
                    only has a bare denial by Neo that the expenses on the insurance policies were
                    charged to CHKC without his knowledge. CHKC did not call TLC to give evidence to
                    or otherwise rebut Lim’s case. On balance, I find the evidence here weighs
                    more heavily in Lim’s favour. Therefore, Lim and AZ are not liable to
                    account to CHKC for the expenses on these policies because they were authorised
                    by Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    As for the expenses of $54,454.87 incurred
                    on Lim’s house at 54 Wilkinson Road, CHKC has accepted that a sum of
                    $29,251.39 has been set off against its running account with Lim,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> so that it has in effect not been
                    charged this amount. This leaves a sum of $25,203.48 which Lim has failed to
                    account for. I therefore allow CHKC’s counterclaim against Lim on this
                    issue for $25,203.48. The rest of CHKC’s counterclaim fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The strength of each party’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I have arrived at all my above findings
                    after much difficulty chiefly because I had to decide between the often
                    diametrically opposed versions put forward by Lim and Neo, both of whom were
                    equally and culpably steeped in the unlawful and unsavoury practices going on in
                    CHKC and AZ. The evidence, especially the ledgers, accounts and supporting
                    documents, were not easy to follow. I daresay they were designed to confuse and
                    prevent easy unravelling or tracing and the incomplete discovery completed, as
                    Mr Khoo rightly characterised it, their hall of smoke and mirrors. Lim and
                    Neo’s manner of running the companies clearly show that neither of them is
                    fit to sit as a director in any public listed company. They devised and
                    participated in one nefarious scheme after another to siphon profits out of CHKC
                    while attempting to cheat or mislead a number of authorities including MOM, IRAS
                    and, if their plans had worked out, SGX and the investing public. When they fell
                    out, neither could tell the whole or any part of the story without implicating
                    himself. They have, to different degrees, brought their dishonesty with them
                    into court. Neo however is by far the more culpable, having made false
                    allegations at the start of the action, affirming false affidavits, giving false
                    evidence in related proceedings, misleading other judges and then by fabricating
                    lies at this trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    As I have mentioned at the start of this
                    judgment, when the objective evidence was unclear and I only had Lim’s
                    word against Neo’s, I generally preferred Lim’s evidence. I now set
                    out four reasons, generally, why I felt that Lim had the stronger case on the
                    whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Credibility of key witnesses at trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    I felt that Lim’s key witnesses, Jean
                    and Yeow, were generally more credible than CHKC’s witnesses. This is not
                    to say that I believed them to be completely impartial – Jean and Yeow had
                    also been sued by CHKC in related proceedings and they would appear to have an
                    incentive to give evidence that favoured Lim’s side of the story. They
                    were understandably a little defensive. However, just as I found that Neo first
                    tried to get Yeow to give evidence on his side and then sued Yeow when he chose
                    not to, I accept Jean’s evidence and find that Neo also tried to get Jean
                    to give evidence against Lim and when she refused, he sued her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span> Jean answered questions
                    without hesitation and in a straightforward manner. I also accept her evidence
                    that Neo knew of and authorised the ‘interest’ payments (that I have
                    referred to above at [45] and [104]) to Lim, that Aileen prepared some of these
                    cheques, that some of the cheques were pre-prepared before she wrote out the
                    fictitious support documents and that the entries noted in
                    “PWB-49” and the Manual Cashbook bears this out. I also accept
                    Jean’s evidence that Neo knew exactly what was going on in CHKC and that
                    he discussed matters relating to contracts with her and gave her instructions
                    directly. It also appears that Jean stopped short of filing a false affidavit
                    even though she was facing a summary judgement application.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span> On the whole, I found both
                    these witnesses were candid and straightforward in cross-examination. They did
                    not appear uncertain and neither were they evasive or try to evade questions
                    from counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    What struck me about Lim’s evidence as
                    a whole was that he always did things in a complicated and a round about, almost
                    surreptitious, fashion. There was nothing simple or straightforward about how he
                    went about doing things in CHKC. Although he was not caught lying outright at
                    trial, my consistent impression was that on some points he would come up with
                    the most convoluted process as to why he did something. For that reason, I found
                    his story on his claim for COF compensation as pleaded to be made up. But yet
                    there was some kernel of truth in some of his allegations, <em>e.g</em>., there were undeniable multiple payments to him in 2005 of
                    $4,800 and $4,375 captured in the Manual Cashbook clearly showing interest
                    payments to Lim. His explanations on the other issues, such as the fictitious
                    invoices, were more straightforward. I was more inclined to believe his
                    testimony in relation to those issues. On the whole, his evidence was far more
                    reliable than Neo’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    I find Neo to be blatantly lying and not
                    above fabricating evidence before the court, as can be seen from his affidavits
                    and cross-examination. There are many passages that bear this out but to recite
                    them here would be to lengthen this judgment unnecessarily. Throughout the
                    proceedings, Neo had attempted to portray himself as a simple, uneducated man
                    who was cheated of his hard-earned money by an ungrateful underling. However, as
                    I have shown above at [16], his demeanour in court convinced me otherwise. He
                    was alert and sharp, and several times was shrewd enough to even backtrack on
                    his evidence when he realised that Lim’s counsel was leading him towards
                    making a damaging admission. Neo’s manner in cross-examination was also
                    very guarded. When counsel put certain facts to him, he would simply disagree
                    without volunteering an explanation. While Lim was forthcoming in elaborating
                    upon his answers to CHKC’s counsel, Neo seemed to be adopting a strategy
                    of “catch me if you can”. He would take the most unbelievable
                    positions in response to counsel’s questions as long as the objective
                    evidence did not contradict him outright. Throughout the trial, he kept sticking
                    to the same mantra: that he blindly trusted Lim and left Lim in control of
                    everything. This led to Neo giving answers which I found were blatantly untrue,
                    to the point of being ridiculous:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The other key witnesses of CHKC, Aileen and
                    Juliet, fared little better on the stand than Neo. Aileen was evasive and
                    combative in cross-examination and, like Neo, continued to disagree with counsel
                    even after the falsehoods and inconsistencies in her evidence were exposed.
                    Aileen gave untrue evidence before other judges and knowingly affirmed untrue
                    affidavits to support Neo. Her facial expressions and manner of giving evidence
                    showed unexplained hostility towards Lim. She would often glower, turn her body
                    and roll her eyes in anger when she answered the questions, but I noticed she
                    seldom looked at Mr Khoo even though he was cross-examining her and never
                    looked me in the eye unless I intervened to ask a question. Even then her eye
                    contact was extremely brief because she almost never gave an answer while
                    looking me in the eye. Aileen only looked at the interpreter or looked down or
                    to some inanimate object as she gave her answers. She was prepared to resort to,
                    and I so find, dishonest tactics such as forging two bank-in slips<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> which CHKC
                    then alleged to be forged by Lim to misrepresent to Neo that he had advanced
                    about $1.5m into CHKC in 2003. Lim engaged a handwriting expert, Ms Lee Gek
                    Kwee, whose evidence I accept, and who testified that the handwriting on the
                    bank-in slips was actually Aileen’s and not Lim’s. I find that
                    Aileen was not above dishonesty in other ways. In addition to her salary, she
                    paid herself an ‘additional salary’ every month from $1,500 (from
                    September to December 2003), to $2,000 (from January to August 2004), to $2,400
                    (from September 2004 to February 2005) and to $4,400 (in March and April 2005)
                    before lowering it back to $2,000 (from August 2005 to October 2006). She made
                    no additional claims in some months (July 2005, October 2005, December 2005 and
                    January 2006). I find that she helped herself to a total of $77,400 over the
                    period of September 2003 to October 2006).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> It is not without significance that
                    she stopped doing so from October 2006, the month Lim and Neo had their big
                    quarrel. Her only lame answer, which I totally reject, was that Lim authorised
                    her to do this, yet she admitted she did not declare these sums as salary to
                    IRAS and did not pay tax on these additional sums. She also put forward her
                    sister as a ‘Proxy’ and then surreptitiously paid her sister an
                    ‘actual salary’ of $750 per month when she was in charge of the
                    payroll. As I said, with all these withdrawals being made by Lim and Neo, Aileen
                    decided she too could do likewise with these relatively small payments which Neo
                    and Lim would not notice. But the lengths to which she would go to for Neo went
                    beyond someone who had been caught with her hand in the till and was being
                    coerced to ‘co-operate'. When she was caught out, Aileen too could twist
                    and turn when cornered. This occurred when Aileen gave evidence that shortly
                    after the big quarrel between Lim and Neo in October 2006, Lim had given her a
                    stack of 24 repayment cheques to cancel. Aileen’s story would evolve as
                    each lie was exposed in cross-examination; it went from:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_a"></a>(a)     she cancelled the
                            cheques,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> to</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_b"></a>(b)     she handed the cheques to Juliet to cancel
                        (when it was discovered, from the Manual Cashbook that had been recently
                        discovered with un-redacted pages, that 16 of those cheques had been already
                        cancelled in September 2006, the month before the big quarrel),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> to</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_176-p2_c"></a>(c)     both of them <em>i.e</em>
                        Aileen and Juliet cancelled the cheques because she stamped the word
                        “cancelled” on each of those cheques but Juliet did the Manual
                        Cashbook entries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Her ready lie that Juliet
                    back-posted the 16 cancelled cheques in the last week of October 2006 into
                    September 2006 because the September account was not ‘closed’ was
                    again exposed when the 17<sup>th</sup> cancelled cheque was
                    posted as cancelled in October 2006, not September 2006 along with the other 16
                    cheques, in the Manual Cashbook. Also, her account of what happened immediately
                    after the big quarrel between Lim and Neo was, like Neo’s account in his
                    AEIC of the same incident and his oral testimony, very different when tested in
                    cross-examination. I find Aileen to be a completely unreliable
                witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Juliet was a less combative and evasive
                    witness but she gave very non-committal answers. She smiled at times
                    inappropriately and seemed to treat the proceedings lightly. She would confirm
                    whatever others were saying but when she was pressed in cross-examination, she
                    would simply say that she was not sure or that she did not know. At times she
                    would have long pauses before she answered. For example, when Lim’s
                    counsel asked her why she had knowingly sworn a false affidavit in prior
                    proceedings relating to the Salary Accruals issue, she was unable to give an

<p class="Judg-1">Juliet was not as intelligent or as quick thinking as Aileen. I find
                    that without thinking things out clearly, she affirmed the false affidavit and
                    gave false evidence for Neo but wisely chose not to do so further and had to be
                    subpoenaed to appear before me at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    I find that the credibility of Lim’s
                    key witnesses was on the whole far more honest and trustworthy than CHKC’s
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Internal consistency of each side’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Save for his pleaded COF claim, Lim’s
                    case theory was simple enough. He had performed well and grew CHKC’s
                    business tremendously during his time there, and was allowed to join Neo in
                    siphoning off CHKC’s profits under the nose of the tax authorities. He was
                    also allowed to incorporate and run AZ and even had the benefit of the 11
                    Projects. Until their big quarrel and fallout in 2006, Lim and Neo were very
                    close and both of them were fully engaged in running all the unlawful practices
                    in CHKC. I find that Neo also gave Lim a share of the spoils for a very
                    important reason - Neo wanted to make sure Lim would not have a hold over him.
                    Lim could not spill the beans because Lim was equally guilty of doing the same
                    thing and sharing the illegal spoils.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Neo’s case theory on the other hand,
                    was rife with inconsistencies. Neo claimed to have reposed complete faith and
                    trust in Lim and thus allowed him to have a free rein over CHKC’s
                    operations without being aware of Lim’s acts of misappropriation. Yet in
                    the same breath, he claims that Lim’s authorised salary, since he joined
                    CHKC, remained at a paltry $7,000 a month, despite Lim managing to earn CHKC
                    $543m in revenue during his time there. Neo’s detailed evidence also
                    contradicts his stand that he was completely unaware of the state of
                    CHKC’s accounts and finances. Neo was repeatedly caught out on his lies
                    and contradictory evidence. Another can be added here. Neo’s account of
                    their big quarrel at or around the end of October 2006 in his AEIC was changed
                    completely during cross-examination. In the end he had to agree with
                    Mr Khoo that what was set out in his AEIC could be completely disregarded.
                    Neo’s inconsistencies and contradictions, both at the micro and macro
                    level, led me to seriously doubt the veracity and reliability of much of his
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misleading the court in prior proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    It is clear that both Lim and CHKC had made
                    false allegations in court; Lim in relation to the fictitious subcontractors
                    issue and CHKC in relation to the Salary Accruals and 11 Projects issues.
                    However, to Lim’s credit, he was a lot quicker to come clean on his
                    deception than CHKC. As I noted above at [79], Lim chose not to swear false
                    affidavits despite being given an opportunity to do so in CHKC’s summary
                    judgment proceedings against him in RA 159/2007 and even though it would result
                    in judgment being entered against him. During cross-examination, Jean also
                    claimed that when she faced a summary judgement application against her in Suit
                    No142 of 2007, she chose not to affirm a false affidavit. Since this was not
                    explored further and is the subject matter of another action, I say no
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    On the other hand, Neo and his witnesses
                    were prepared to lie all the way on oath. Neo claims he and his investigation
                    team ‘discovered’, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    Proxies and Salary Accruals Scheme soon after Lim was dismissed in November
                    2006. Yet, when CHKC first brought its counterclaim against Lim, in January
                    2007, Neo had taken the false position that there were no Proxies in CHKC and
                    that Neo had personally paid off the salaries of its workers (see [106] above).
                    Neo explained in his AEIC that he had tried to deny the existence of the Proxies
                    at the time because he was worried about the potential implications on
                    CHKC’s workers and its ongoing construction projects if the truth came to
                        light.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span> He also stated that however
                    by February 2007, he felt that there were too many irregularities uncovered
                    and thus he proceeded to lodge a police report explaining the whole truth. This
                    led to a raid on CHKC’s offices by IRAS in August 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Despite Neo’s purported decision to
                    reveal everything, CHKC only applied to amend its pleadings on the Salary
                    Accruals issue <em>in September 2008</em>. Even after
                    Neo filed his police report on 26 February 2007, he and Aileen proceeded to
                    file affidavits on 28 February 2007 maintaining their earlier falsehoods on
                    the absence of Proxies. It bears noting that Neo’s police report itself
                    did not mention anything about Proxies or Salary Accruals. In fact, the first
                    time Neo admitted to the existence of Proxies in CHKC was in an affidavit he had
                    filed on 30 March 2007 which only indirectly conceded that CHKC had
                    Proxies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Needless to say, Neo’s extended
                    indolence in coming clean with the truth demanded an explanation. When
                    Lim’s counsel asked Neo why he took so long to amend his pleadings to
                    reflect the true state of affairs, Neo replied that he was too busy:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You say in your evidence-in-chief in paragraph 270

                            come out that you have proxies in Chip Hup Hup Kee, true?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>

                            own admission that there are proxies in Chip Hup Hup Kee, what was
                            stopping you from apologising to the court, admitting that you had lied
                            in your earlier affidavits about receiving the cash portion of the
                            proxies’ wages? What was holding you back?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There were so many suits ongoing at that time, for
                            example, suit 779, suit 136. I was very busy at that time, and whenever
                            [Lim’s solicitors] asked for something, they wanted it that day.
                            So we had many discussions and maybe I could have neglected to report on
                            this matter.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    I did not believe Neo’s cavalier
                    excuse that he was too busy. To my mind, the real reason why Neo held off
                    amending CHKC’s pleadings was because it wanted to succeed in its ongoing
                    interlocutory battles with Lim. When CHKC brought summary judgment proceedings
                    against Lim and Mdm Tan in RA 159/2007, one of the defences raised by them
                    was that CHKC had Proxies on its payroll to deceive MOM. Obviously, CHKC would
                    fail in its application for summary judgment if it admitted then and there that
                    Proxies existed. Thus, even though Neo had purportedly made the decision to come
                    clean by February 2007, CHKC deliberately remained silent and did not
                    disclose the Proxies system in RA 159/2007 before Woo Bih Li J. Neo
                    admitted to this when pressed in cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">… Justice
                            Woo was misled by you because you say you were too busy to be honest,
                            and rendered a judgment to this effect, where he was only able to say,
                            “Mr Lim and Mdm Tan were saying things and unable to
                            confirm that what they were saying was true.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">You knew in your heart of hearts if you were to come forward and admit
                            to Justice Woo that you were, in fact, lying throughout the whole order
                            14 proceedings, you would be forced to admit the proceedings before her
                            Honour Dorcas Quek, from whom the appeal to Justice Woo went, was
                            actually completely misguided by your failures to be honest.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I agree. I was covering up the truth. Even my
                            lawyers, they were unaware. I agreed with that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    From the evidence above, it seems clear to
                    me that Neo had never truly intended to come clean with the real story on
                    CHKC’s Proxies and Salary Accruals. I believe the only reason why CHKC
                    eventually applied to amend its pleadings in September 2008 was because it was
                    forced to. Neo had appeared as a witness in DAC 15743/08, which involved a
                    criminal charge against Lim’s brother, LLC. During cross-examination in
                    that trial, Neo was forced to admit that he knew about the Proxies system in
                    CHKC. As such, I find that the reason CHKC had to amend its pleadings was
                    because it realised it could no longer maintain its rapidly crumbling position
                    that there were no Proxies in the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    CHKC had also misled the courts by claiming
                    at first (see [149] above) that it had done all the work and incurred all costs
                    on the 11 Projects. Like their position on the Salary Accruals issue, CHKC only
                    amended their story on the 11 Projects very late in the day. Neo admitted at
                    trial that one of the reasons CHKC had maintained their original story for so
                    long was because Lim had outstanding an application to strike out CHKC’s
                    counterclaim on the 11 Projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    It was clear that CHKC was so desperate to
                    win its legal battles at all costs that it was willing to put forward false
                    evidence to the Courts and follow through with its deception all the way. It was
                    only forced to change its positions on the Salary Accruals and 11 Projects when
                    they became untenable in the face of the objective evidence. Because
                    CHKC’s key witnesses had shamelessly misled the courts in prior
                    proceedings, I formed a very low opinion of their credibility. Their performance
                    in cross-examination only affirmed my views.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misfeasance in discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Finally, Neo and CHKC have repeatedly sought
                    to withhold relevant documents from Lim and AZ during discovery. For example,
                    when Lim sought discovery of various invoices and final statements of account
                    between CHKC and its main contractors in relation to the 11 Projects, CHKC
                    opposed discovery on the ground that it had many documents amounting to several
                    cartons, which subsequently became only three cartons of documents. After Lim
                    obtained a court order requiring CHKC to produce these invoices and statements
                    of final accounts, CHKC amazingly said that it had made a mistake and now
                    realised that the three cartons of documents were actually documents between
                    CHKC and AZ, not the main contractors. Lim eventually managed to obtain the
                    relevant documents very close to the trial and they proved to be very crucial
                    indeed, as they provided strong evidence that CHKC had been charging AZ a
                    2%–6% notional management fee on the 11 Projects (see [164]
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    CHKC’s strategy in suppressing
                    discovery of documents was such that Lim had to go to court and obtain four
                    “unless” orders against CHKC throughout the history of these
                    proceedings in order to compel their discovery. Even at trial, CHKC’s own
                    witnesses confirmed the existence of documents which it never provided to Lim in
                    discovery. These include the payment vouchers many of which were not produced
                    despite there being evidence that the cheques invariably had payment vouchers
                    attached to them. Another example was CHKC’s Proxy recommendation forms
                    which would have showed that Neo contributed, as his own witness Juliet
                    confirmed, the most number of Proxies. The fact that many relevant documents
                    were still missing at trial convinced me, and I find, that CHKC had failed to
                    give full discovery and had a pattern of hiding documents. Even during trial,
                    and often during cross-examination, documents would turn up which had not been
                    given in discovery. Sometimes only some documents were put to witnesses when
                    there were obviously more documents, still not discovered, and there were even
                    whole files being produced. For example there was an attempt during
                    Juliet’s re-examination to produce a whole file to help explain away the
                    evidence of Ms Lee Gek Kwee, the handwriting expert, who testified that the
                    handwriting on two bank pay-in slips, alleged by Neo to have been forged by Lim
                    to misappropriate his cheques, was in fact Aileen’s. The documents in this
                    file would, it is alleged, show how someone did a ‘cut and paste’
                    job for these bank pay-in slips causing Aileen’s handwriting to be on
                    those pay-in slips. I disallowed that attempt to introduce new evidence during
                    re-examination, on the second-last day of a 6 week trial on an issue, <em>viz</em>, whose handwriting was on the two
                    ‘forged’ pay-in bank slips, that had been in contention for some
                    time. I accept Ms Lim and her legal team had no hand in this, but it was
                    her clients who decided to try and spring this ‘ambush’ in a manner
                    that would leave Lim or Ms Lee Gek Kwee unable to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Another egregious example of suppressing
                    very cogent evidence was CHKC’s strenuous efforts in resisting production
                    of their Manual Cashbook from January 1999 to November 2006. CHKC produced
                    severely redacted pages restricting it to bank reconciliation statements pasted
                    onto pages of the Manual Cashbook at the end of each month, but with none of the
                    daily entries. CHKC fought this all the way to the Court of Appeal. Neo swore an
                    affidavit claiming it contained “sensitive financial
                        information”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_133" id="Ftn_133_1"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span> and
                    discovery would cause irreparable damage to CHKC. CHKC was nonetheless ordered
                    to give discovery of the Manual Cashbook. They eventually complied but the
                    handwritten pages from June to November 2006 were not produced. Instead
                    typed pages were produced. The explanation given was that starting
                    from June 2006, (FY 2007), CHKC no longer maintained a handwritten Manual
                        Cashbook.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_134" id="Ftn_134_1"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span> In fact this trial opened rather
                    dramatically with an application to strike out the defence and counterclaim
                    because CHKC had failed to produce the Manual Cashbook entries from June
                    to November 2006 despite an order to do so by the Court of Appeal.
                    Mr Khoo said that despite the foregoing explanation, CHKC could not be
                    believed because when the police were prosecuting LLC after June 2007, CHKC
                    provided the police with some handwritten pages from the Manual Cashbook’s
                    entries in November 2006. I disallowed the application as the trial was
                    about to start but told Mr Khoo he could cross-examine the witnesses and
                    make submissions on the non-production of the relevant pages for the crucial
                    June to November 2006 period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Before me, Neo had to admit that discovery
                    of the unredacted pages, (other than the June to November 2006 period), did
                    not result in catastrophe for CHKC nor did it cause CHKC irreparable damage or
                        prejudice:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    As noted above, CHKC kept a Manual Cashbook
                    where chronological entries were made for all payments that were made or
                    received by it. By and large, entries were made in a chronological sequence by
                    date. There were some out-of-sequence entries, but they were out by, at most, a
                    few days, and they were not so frequent or of such a nature that would render
                    the record unreliable. On the contrary, I found these entries the most reliable
                    piece of objective evidence in the accounts because they were contemporaneous
                    entries, captured all payments in and out of CHKC and had the entries in
                    handwriting in, largely, chronological date sequence. It was possible to
                    ascertain who made the entries and any meddling with the entries would also be
                    obvious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Mr Khoo submitted, and I accept his
                    submission that CHKC was afraid that the entries in the Manual Cashbook would
                    show the truth and expose the lies told by Neo, CHKC and Aileen. Of all people,
                    Aileen would have known she was giving false evidence because she was in the
                    Accounts Department of CHKC, knew what was in the Manual Cashbook and in fact
                    made some of the entries herself. This is what the Manual Cashbook
                    exposed:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Neo claimed that on the day of their big quarrel,
                            he was shocked to find that CHKC owed Lim, a ‘mere
                            employee’, so much money. The big quarrel took place at or around
                            the end October 2006. The Manual Cashbook shows, and I so find, that Neo
                            had signed 24 cheques totalling $4.74 million in replacement for the
                            stale CHKC repayment cheques held by Lim. All 24 cheques were signed by
                            Neo on the 15 July 2006, about 3½ months before their big
                            quarrel. He surely could not have forgotten those 24 cheques totalling
                            $4.74 million in that time.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Again Neo claimed that Lim presented him a list
                            of 80 cheques amounting to $10.495 million on the day of their big
                            quarrel at the end of October 2006 and Lim subsequently cancelled 24
                            cheques leaving a balance of $7.205 million. This was again a lie. The
                            Manual Cashbook entries showed that CHKC had cancelled 16 of those
                            repayment cheques in September 2006, one month before their big
                            quarrel.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Neo and Aileen also lied in alleging that when
                            Aileen checked Lim’s office after August 2008, she found 15 of the
                            Cost of Funds cheques. The Manual Cashbook showed that 9 of those 15
                            cheques had already been cancelled in October 2006. Further after Lim
                            was dismissed in November 2006, CHKC moved office from Bukit Timah
                            Plaza to Henderson, so Lim never had an office at the Henderson
                                location.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span></div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">I have noted above Neo’s evidence that he
                            was shocked at the amount of Lim’s loans to CHKC. Under
                            cross-examination, Neo claimed Lim was a ‘mere employee’ and
                            in effect a nobody. When Neo rhetorically postulated how Lim could raise
                            such large sums of money for the loans to CHKC, he was then confronted
                            with a cheque for $1 million made out to Lim that he signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span>
                            Neo’s reply was first, if Lim asked him to sign a cheque, he would
                            just sign it, secondly when it was put to him that CHKC must have
                            accepted it owed money to Lim because of such cheque payments, Neo said:
                            “But based on the accounts then, it did not show that this sum of
                            money was owing to Mr Lim Leong Huat.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_138" id="Ftn_138_1"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span> The next day, Neo was
                            confronted with a compilation of the $7.025 loan that appeared in the
                            Manual Cashbook.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_139" id="Ftn_139_1"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span> There were clear
                            handwritten entries in relation to the loan of $7.025 million. The
                            Manual Cashbook had entries like: “LLH-Return loan” on
                            7 November 2005 of $150,000 or “LLH-Loan” on
                            15 July 2006 of $150,000 or “Cash-return loan (LLH) on
                            19 May 2006 of $100,000.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    The problem which gave rise to the striking
                    out application at the start of the trial arose because Neo claimed he was
                    unable to produce those pages of the Manual Cashbook for the crucial months
                    leading to Lim’s dismissal, June to November 2006. Neo conveniently
                    claimed that after the start of the new financial year, 1 June 2007, CHKC
                    switched to the ‘Computerised Cashbook’. In his earlier
                        affidavit,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_140" id="Ftn_140_1"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span> Neo stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the financial year 2007 onwards (that is starting from June
                        2006), the manual cash book were all typewritten instead and CHHKC no longer
                        maintained a handwritten manual cash book from June 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yet, when the Police decided to charge LLC after May 2007, CHKC was
                    able to produce some pages with handwritten entries from November 2006 of the
                    Manual Cashbook for the purposes of the prosecution. Ten days later, on
                    25 September 2009, Aileen swore an affidavit explaining that CHKC ran the 2
                    systems in parallel, <em>i.e</em>. the Manual Cashbook and
                    the Computerised Cashbook, which they called the ‘Excel
                        cashbook’.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> Hence when
                    the prosecution needed the evidence, CHKC could let the Police have the relevant
                    pages of the Manual Cashbook. When Neo and CHKC’s backs were to the wall
                    in this action as a result of the Court of Appeal’s order to produce the
                    unredacted Manual Cashbook, they then claimed that the Manual Cashbook had been
                    lost. They had searched all over for it but to no avail, or so they say. I have
                    little doubt that they are again not telling the truth. The Manual Cashbook had
                    entries that were extremely inconvenient and contradictory to some of their
                    relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Lastly I must mention two more
                    discrepancies. Aileen explained<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_142" id="Ftn_142_1"><sup>[note: 142]</sup></a></span> that
                    when Sergeant Ong asked her for copies for the month of November 2006, she
                    photocopied the entries and gave it to Sergeant Ong, stating that she does not
                    remember how many pages there were, but the transcripts for the criminal
                    proceedings against LLC (DAC 15743/2008) refer to six pages of the Manual
                    Cashbook entries in November 2006. It is clear from the transcript of
                    LLC’s trial that the prosecution produced and relied upon six pages of the
                    Manual Cashbook. It is noteworthy that CHKC did not give the prosecution the
                    whole Manual Cashbook but photocopied the relevant pages for the police. But
                    when CHKC were forced to produce those pages, an extra seventh page mysteriously
                    turned up. CHKC’s explanation was that as they did not have the Manual
                    Cashbook, they contacted Sergeant Ong who gave them copies of the Manual
                    Cashbook that he had managed to find, the rest having been destroyed a few
                    months after LLC’s acquittal, and that is what CHKC gave Lim’s
                    solicitors. The implication was that Sergeant Ong must have had seven pages.
                    Sergeant Ong could not remember how many pages he had, as he gave the whole
                    clutch of papers to Neo and Aileen. The transcript clearly refers to only 6
                    pages, the Police wrote a letter to Lim’s solicitors on 18 July 2008
                    which forwarded six pages of the Manual Cashbook which was then used at the
                    trial and before me this was what Sergeant Ong said when asked about the extra
                    page by Mr Khoo:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_143" id="Ftn_143_1"><sup>[note: 143]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But, as far as you are concerned, would it be fair
                            to say that all the documents of all the extracts of the cashbook taken
                            by you were in the trial? You were not hiding anything
                        right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, your Honour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Aileen disingenuously said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unfortunately, when I tried to look for the Handwritten Cashbook, I could
                        not find it. I do not know what had happened to it or if anyone had taken it
                        …
                        <em>I did not explain fully to [Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC]
                            nor Neo the fact that we had run parallel for a few months from June
                            2006 and that we had maintained 2 sets of cashbook … I did not
                            think that this is an important information and I had honestly told
                            [Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC] that we no longer maintained the
                            handwritten version of the cashbook from June 2006</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the end nothing much turned on whether there were in fact six or
                    seven pages, except for being one of the planks of Lim’s allegation that
                    Neo was hiding documents. I have little doubt that CHKC are hiding the Manual
                    Cashbook. Here is a final example that occurred at the end of Aileen’s
                    evidence. Mr Khoo asked Aileen how the pages of the ‘Excel
                    Cashbook’ were kept. Aileen’s clear evidence was that they were
                    printed out for each month and kept in a file and at the end of year they would
                    bind them into a book. For example, Aileen identified an Excel printout
                        page<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_145" id="Ftn_145_1"><sup>[note: 145]</sup></a></span> for July 2006 which would be kept loose in a
                    file. When Mr Khoo asked for confirmation that these printouts were kept in
                    a file and not pasted onto pages of the Manual Cashbook, Aileen’s reaction
                    was immediate and very telling, she stalled in her answer to gain time and
                    started desperately flipping through the pages at the end of the Excel printout
                    pages and bank reconciliation statements for June to November 2006 to double
                    check their appearance. Mr Khoo then asked her why the September 2006 bank
                    reconciliation statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> seemed to be pasted onto a page
                    of a book, just like the bank reconciliation statements made earlier, before
                    CHKC switched to the Excel Cashbook:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Look at page 8675, you can see, like the previous
                            bank reconciliation statements, obviously this document was stuck on to
                            something. Isn’t that so? Isn’t it clear to you that page
                            8675 is actually stuck on to some book?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I should think so. Probably at the time of making
                            the photocopy, there was some markings or some other things on the
                            document.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Ms Khoo, you can see very clearly
                            –</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I am not too sure about this.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">--that this is not a marking and if you compare
                            that, for example, with page 8636, you will find a similar sort of lined
                            backing.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was clear that the bank reconciliation statement for September
                    2006, 4 months after CHKC claimed they switched to the Excel Cashbook, was
                    pasted onto a page with printed lines, just as in the earlier period when there
                    was only the Manual Cashbook. What was telling is that the earlier pages
                        before<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> and the pages after that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span>
                    all appear as printed out pages, not pasted onto anything – why should
                    this one page appear, out of the blue, otherwise? Unfortunately for CHKC,
                    someone had been very careless in the photocopying and bundling of the Manual
                    Cashbook extracts. I find that CHKC and Neo were hiding relevant documents and
                    this included the important Manual Cashbook and the handwritten entries from
                    June to November 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conspiracy to injure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Having found in favour of Lim in respect of
                    his claim for recovery of $7,205,000 in loans to CHKC, it remains to consider
                    whether CHKC and Neo are liable in the alternative for conspiring to injure Lim
                    by preventing him from collecting on his loans. In <em>Nagase
                        Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Hai Huat</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80
                        (“<em>Nagase</em>”), Judith
                    Prakash J laid down (at [23]) the following elements to found a claim in
                    the tort of conspiracy:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_197-p2_a"></a>(a)     a combination of two or more
                        persons and an agreement between and amongst them to do certain
                    acts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_197-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the
                        conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of the
                        conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff but if the
                        conspiracy involves unlawful means, then such predominant intention is not
                        required;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_197-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        acts must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_197-p2_d"></a>(d)     damage must be
                        suffered by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Some purists may argue that a company
                    “cannot act in its own person for it has no person” (<em>Ferguson v Wilson</em> (1866) LR 2 Ch App 77 at
                    89). CHKC must, by necessity, act by its directors, managers or other agents,
                    and therefore, CHKC and Neo cannot be guilty of conspiring to injure Lim.
                    However this issue was decided by Andrew Ang J in this action when Neo was
                    added as a 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant: see <em>Lim
                        Leong Huat v Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    2 SLR(R) 318. The learned judge, after comprehensively reviewing the
                    authorities, ruled that where the company was a victim of the alleged conspiracy
                    of directors and sued its directors for breach of duty, the company did not
                    become a co-conspirator with the directors, just because the directors were the
                    conspirators – otherwise a company’s errant directors would escape
                    liability. However where a company and its directors, (or, I would add, a
                    director), were in an established arrangement which benefited the company and/or
                    its directors to the detriment of third parties, there was no reason why the
                    assets of the company and/or that of its controlling director, should not be
                    liable to answer for conspiracy. In <em>Nagase</em>,
                    Prakash J held that as a matter of law, there can be a conspiracy between a
                    company and its controlling director to damage a third party by unlawful means
                    even where the director is the company’s moving spirit. I respectfully
                    agree with both these judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    On the facts, it is quite clear that CHKC
                    and Neo had combined to cause CHKC to bring a huge counterclaim against Lim.
                    Having heard the evidence, it is also clear that CHKC’s counterclaim was
                    almost entirely based on lies and false evidence. The reason for Neo’s and
                    CHKC’s actions, and so I find, is that Neo felt deeply insulted by
                    Lim’s initial act of filing suit against CHKC. Neo was the big boss or
                    “towkay” of CHKC, and for a former underling like Lim to bring
                    CHKC to court amounted to a huge loss of face for Neo. Neo thus induced CHKC to
                    respond by raising a massive (but ultimately false) counterclaim in order to
                    intimidate him and force him to back off. This is evident from the transcript of
                    Neo’s recorded conversation with Yeow on 1 February 2007 in which Neo
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He [Lim] wants to topple me, ah, Yeow, do you know that? But I will not be
                        toppled, I cannot be toppled. My NKE to topple just like that, I will not be
                        toppled by him, ah he will be toppled by me. I am giving him the show-hand
                        now. Let us see who will topple…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Despite knowing that Lim’s claim was
                    genuine, Neo and CHKC conspired to prevent him from making what would have been
                    a relatively simple debt-recovery claim by dragging him into a protracted legal
                    battle lasting over three years. I thus find that the predominant intention of
                    Neo and CHKC in causing the latter to bring its counterclaim was to injure Lim.
                    It is also clear that Lim has suffered damage from Neo’s and CHKC’s
                    actions as he has been deprived of monies which were rightfully due to him from
                    the very start. CHKC and Neo are therefore liable to Lim in the tort of
                    conspiracy for the damage he has suffered (<em>i.e</em>.
                    the sum of $7,205,000 and any resulting interest). This would mean that, if for
                    whatever reason CHKC is unable to satisfy Lim’s claim for recovery of his
                    loans, Lim has an avenue of recourse against Neo personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    It may also be argued that CHKC here is
                    ‘innocent’ in that Neo and Lim, although not a director in name, but
                    clearly an officer of the company, implemented schemes like the
                    ‘Proxies’ and Salary Accruals Account to siphon money out of the
                    company and causing the company to evade tax. However, this was not a case where
                    money was withdrawn from the Salary Accruals account by Lim and immediately lent
                    the same sums of money back to CHKC as loans. The evidence shows, and I so find,
                    that sums of money were withdrawn by Lim, but they went into his accounts where
                    they were mixed with other monies and the loans were made at different times and
                    in differing amounts. Further, I have found that all these withdrawals from the
                    Salary Accruals and other accounts were made with the connivance and consent of
                    Neo. The ‘innocent’ company element does not come into play in this
                    situation where Lim is seeking repayment of his loans from CHKC and from
                    Neo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Having found that Lim and Neo were involved
                    in a whole host of illegal activities in CHKC, it remains for me to consider
                    whether any of the parties are barred by the doctrine of illegality from making
                    out their various claims and counterclaims. On this issue I reluctantly think
                    the answer must be ‘no’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    As Woo Bih Li J said in <em>Chee Jok Heng Stephanie v Chang Yue Shoon</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 153 at [35], the general principle of illegality,
                    epitomised in the Latin maxim <em>ex turpi causa non oritur
                        actio</em>, is based on a public policy that prevents a court from
                    assisting a litigant whose cause of action is based or tainted by illegality.
                    However it is settled law that it only precludes a party from asserting a claim
                    if he has to rely on the illegality in question. In <em>Tinsley v
                        Milligan</em> [1994] 1 AC 340, the plaintiff and the
                    defendant had pooled their funds together to buy a house. However, the house was
                    registered only in the plaintiff’s name in order to allow both parties to
                    make false benefit claims on the Department of Social Security. The plaintiff
                    subsequently claimed sole possession and ownership of the house and the
                    defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that the house was held by the
                    plaintiff on trust for the parties in equal shares. The House of Lords upheld
                    the defendant’s counterclaim. As the defendant was basing her claim to a
                    half-share in the house on a resulting trust, there was no need for her to rely
                    on her illegality and she could thus succeed in her claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Although <em>Tinsley v
                        Milligan</em> concerned a case where a party was asserting proprietary
                    rights, the principle that a plaintiff could succeed in a cause of action if he
                    did not have to rely on his illegality has found general application: see
                        <em>e.g. American Home Assurance Co v Hong Lam Marine Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 992; <em>Siow Soon
                        Kim v Lim Eng Beng</em> [2004] SGCA 4; <em>Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd v Chenab Contractor Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 1 SLR(R) 375. In the present case, Lim’s claim is for
                    monies which he had extended as legitimate loans to CHKC from his own sources
                    and accounts. Although it is possible that some of those monies had been
                    obtained through the Salary Accrual accounts and were thus tainted with
                    illegality (<em>i.e</em>. evasion of income tax), Lim does
                    not have to rely on the illegal conduct in question to seek recovery of his
                    loans. Similarly for those of CHKC’s counterclaims which are made out,
                    CHKC does not have to found its claim on any illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The only comfort I take is that counsel have
                    informed me that IRAS and MOM intend to but have withheld taking further action
                    pending the outcome of this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    For the foregoing reasons, I allow
                    Lim’s claim against Neo and CHHKC for the amount of $7,205,000. In the
                    event there is no necessity to decide on Lim’s alternative claim for
                    dishonoured cheques. Lim’s claim for COF compensation is dismissed. I also
                    order that CHKC pays back the sums of $347,030 and $426,700 to Lim and
                    Mdm Tan respectively. CHKC’s counterclaim is allowed in part for the
                    following amounts:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$3,675 and $25,203.48 against Lim;
