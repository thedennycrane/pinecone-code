<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This Registrar’s Appeal No 178 of
                    2009 (“RA 178”) was brought by the plaintiff, T S Lines Ltd,
                    to reverse a decision of the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) made on
                    13 May 2009 to set aside the arrest of the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> renamed <em>Engedi</em>. The main
                    question in the appeal concerned the degree of disclosure required on an
                    application for a warrant of arrest. On 29 May 2009, I allowed the
                    plaintiff’s appeal with costs of the appeal and below to be taxed, if not
                    agreed. I now publish the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts and circumstances leading to the arrest of the
                    <em>Eagle Prestige</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By way of summary, the proceedings herein arose
                    out of the grounding of the <em>TS Bangkok</em> in Tanjong
                    Priok, Indonesia, on 10 November 2007 which resulted in hull and propeller
                    damage to the vessel. At all material times, the plaintiff was the disponent
                    owner of the <em>TS Bangkok</em>. By a time charterparty
                    dated 22 May 2007 (“the May sub-charter”), the plaintiff
                    sub-chartered the <em>TS Bangkok</em> to the defendant, EP
                    Carriers Pte Ltd (“EP Carriers”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On arrival at Tanjong Priok, the <em>TS Bangkok</em> grounded whilst berthing thereby sustaining
                    hull and propeller damage. The damage was later repaired in Hong Kong. The head
                    owner of the <em>TS Bangkok</em> sought to recover the
                    costs of the repairs related to the grounding from the plaintiff who, in passing
                    on the claim to EP Carriers, <em>inter alia</em>, brought
                    an action <em>in rem</em> against the defendant’s
                    vessel, the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>, the short title of
                    which is Admiralty In Rem No 233 of 2008
                    (“Adm 233”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       It is the plaintiff’s case that in breach
                    of the May sub-charter, EP Carriers had directed the <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em> to berth at Tanjong Priok, an unsafe port/berth. The
                    principal claim was put forward on the basis that the defendant’s orders
                    to berth the <em>TS Bangkok</em> at Tanjong Priok amounted
                    to breach of the charterparty terms because it was an unsafe port/berth;
                    alternatively, the loss was sustained as a consequence of complying with the
                    orders of EP Carriers as charterer of the <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em>. In correspondence, the plaintiff also claimed the sum of
                    US$42,753.94 being outstanding charges and expenses due under the May
                    sub-charter. Before me, however, the arguments centred on the principal claim
                    which, according to the endorsement of claim, was for damages and/or an
                    indemnity for breach of contract and/or duties contained in or evidenced by the
                    May sub-charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The <em>Eagle Prestige</em>
                    was first arrested in Singapore waters on 8 January 2009 by the master and
                    crew in Admiralty in Rem No 9 of 2009 for unpaid wages
                    (“Adm 9”). On 17 February 2009, the master and crew
                    applied for the vessel to be sold <em>pendente lite</em>.
                    Eventually, the claim in Adm 9 was amicably resolved and the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was released from arrest on
                    27 February 2009. Adm 9 was discontinued on 3 March 2009. On the
                    same day of her release, the plaintiff arrested the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> in Adm 233 for breach of the May sub-charter in
                    respect of the vessel <em>TS Bangkok</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Fortunately for the plaintiff, the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> in Adm 233 was issued on
                    2 December 2008 <em>before</em> the vessel’s
                    ownership changed on 22 December 2008. At the time of the plaintiff’s
                    arrest, not only had the ownership of the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> changed, by 17 February 2009, EP Carriers was in
                    provisional liquidation by way of a creditors’ voluntary winding up, and
                    provisional liquidators were also appointed.<b><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></b> It appears that the
                    creditors approved the liquidation of EP Carriers on 6 March
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The circumstances leading to the
                    plaintiff’s arrest of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>
                    were recounted in the two affidavits of Li Kang-Lin (“Li”), both
                    filed on behalf of the plaintiff on 27 February 2009. I begin at the point
                    when the plaintiff received notice of the grounding claim from the head
                    owner’s P&amp;I Club, The Swedish Club. In formally denying liability
                    under the head charter of the <em>TS Bangkok</em> between
                    the head owner and the plaintiff, the UK P&amp;I Club (on behalf of the
                    plaintiff), in its fax of 6 October 2008 requested, <em>inter alia</em>, details of the damage and the subsequent repairs. In
                    addition, the UK P&amp; I Club referred to a possible defence to the damage
                    claim. The last paragraph of the fax read as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… we find that there is a special provision in Clause 90 [of
                        the Head Charterparty] which states that “The Charterers shall not be
                        responsible for… loss or damage to the vessel and/or other objects
                        arising from perils insured by customary policies of insurance” and
                        Clause 102 states that the owner has a proper hull insurance against
                        all hull risks. As the repair costs arising out of the ship’s damage
                        is well covered by the ship’s Hull insurance policy, Clause 90
                        will take effect and the [plaintiff] is not responsible for the [head
                        owner’s] loss covered by their insurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It was common ground that the head charter and
                    May sub-charter were back to back, and there was a comparable provision in the
                    May sub-charter. Capital Gate Holdings Pte Ltd (“Capital Gate”)
                    who intervened in the proceedings alleged that cl 90 was a complete defence
                    to the plaintiff’s claim, and as such was a material fact that should have
                    been (but was not) disclosed in the affidavits leading the warrant of arrest
                    (see <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a>–<a href="#p1_111">[111]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 6 November 2008, The Swedish Club, on
                    behalf of the head owner, replied rejecting the alleged defence with the counter
                    argument that “the damage caused by the ship’s grounding [was] a
                    peril that [was] covered under the prevailing c/p.” The Swedish Club also
                    stated that the head owner had already notified EP Carriers of the repairs made
                    to <em>TS Bangkok</em>, and that surveyors on behalf of EP
                    Carriers had duly attended the surveys carried out in connection with the
                    repairs. In short, the grounding damage was notified to the defendant and its
                    liability insurers. On 10 November 2008, the plaintiff passed on the head
                    owner’s claim of US$ 481,572.19 to the defendant. In particular, the UK
                    P&amp;I Club on behalf of the plaintiff wrote as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As [the plaintiff’s] C/P terms with you are on back to back basis
                        and in other words [the plaintiff] is entitled to bring an indemnity claim
                        on similar grounds as contended by the headowner against you, we are
                        grateful that you can confirm to furnish an acceptable form of security for
                        the owner’s claim plus interest and costs to [the plaintiff].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     EP Carriers had presumably notified the claim
                    to its insurers because some 18 days later, QBE Marine Underwriting Agency Pte
                    Ltd (“QBE”), a subsidiary of QBE Insurance (International)
                    Limited, responded in an email to the plaintiff’s Hong Kong lawyers, DLA
                    Piper (“DLA”). The email of 28 November 2008
                        stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    We are considering your security wording in detail
                            and please give us time to revert on the same latest next by
                            Wednesday…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ernest, you know us very well. We will not run away from our
                        responsibilities as we consider ourselves as reputable insurers. Please rest
                        assured we will sort out the security issue and hence please do not in the
                        meantime take pre-emptive action against the Insured’s vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Since security was not forthcoming, the
                    plaintiff went ahead to file the writ <em>in rem</em>
                    against the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> on 2 December
                    2008. The picture that emerged was a pattern of unfulfilled assurances from the
                    defendant’s insurers, QBE, over the security issue. DLA sent reminders to
                    QBE on 4 December 2008, and again on 8 December 2008. On
                    11 December 2008, QBE replied to DLA stating that they were still in
                    discussions with EP Carriers on this claim and asked that they be given time
                    till the next day at which time they said that DLA would receive a substantive
                    response on the security demanded from their lawyers in Singapore. However, no
                    positive response on security as promised materialised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the meantime, unbeknown to the plaintiff,
                    EP Carriers had, on 22 December 2008, sold the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> to the intervener “in consideration of the sum of
                    one dollar (US$1.00) … and other good and valuable consideration
                        …”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The shipping manager of Capital
                    Gate, Tan Siew Ling (“TSL”) was the deponent of all the affidavits
                    filed on behalf of the intervener. It is apposite to note that the only reason
                    why TSL said she was in a position to testify on matters involving the defendant
                    was because she was a director of EP Carriers from March 2001 to March 2009, and
                    I noted from the documents that the bank facilities provided by United Overseas
                    Bank (“UOB”) continued to be guaranteed by TSL and two others. The
                    bill of sale of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was co-signed
                    by TSL in her capacity as director of EP Carriers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     TSL had deposed in her
                        4<sup>th</sup> affidavit that the defendant’s
                    liability to UOB in the region of US$10.335m and S$1.61m was assumed by Linford
                    Pte Ltd following an Assignment and Novation Agreement dated 24 December
                    2008 (“Novation Agreement”). Furthermore, ownership of the
                        <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was transferred to Capital Gate
                    as nominee of Linford Pte Ltd. The Novation Agreement was executed by TSL on
                    behalf of EP Carriers. Tan Eng Joo, a director of EP Carriers signed the
                    Novation Agreement on behalf of Linford Pte Ltd in his capacity as director of
                    the company. Tan Eng Joo is also the sole shareholder of Linford Pte Ltd, a
                    company newly incorporated in Singapore on 11 November 2008. It was a term
                    of the Novation Agreement that Linford Pte would provide security in favour of
                    UOB. Linford Pte Ltd agreed to give security by way of a legal mortgage on
                        <em>Eagle Prestige</em>. Linford Pte Ltd was to procure
                    its nominee, Capital Gate, to execute a first priority statutory mortgage over
                    the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>. As TSL acknowledged in her
                    affidavit, the value of the vessel was S$1.8m (and not US$8.2m as stated in the
                    UOB facility letter dated 19 December 2008), and it was not surprising to find
                    UOB requiring additional security to cover the indebtedness, namely a fresh
                    legal mortgage on the same office property belonging to Eagle Stevedoring (Pte)
                    Ltd and the same residential property of Tan Kheng Chong and Lim Guat.
                    Furthermore, the same three directors of EP Carriers, Tan Kheng Chong, Tan Eng
                    Joo and TSL were to execute in favour of UOB fresh joint and several guarantees
                    for S$1.61m and US$10.335m respectively. For completeness, the Novation
                    Agreement also involved the mortgage on another vessel, the <em>Eagle Pride</em>. I need only mention two events of default under the
                    UOB facility that are relevant. The first event of default is that the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> is not to remain under arrest for more
                    than three days. The other event of default is the failure to pay the wages of
                    the master and crew of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> by
                    31 December 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The master and crew arrested
                    the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> in Adm 9 on 8 January
                    2009 and she was not released until 27 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Reverting to the narration of the procedural
                    history, the first arrest of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>
                    was on 8 January 2009. On learning about the first arrest in Adm 9,
                    the plaintiff filed a caveat against release on the same day. As stated earlier,
                    Capital Gate entered an appearance in Adm 9. On 15 January 2009,
                    AsiaLegal LLC (“AsiaLegal”) on behalf of Capital Gate wrote to
                    Allen &amp; Gledhill LLC (“A&amp;G”) as solicitors for the
                    plaintiff to demand that the caveat be withdrawn on the basis that the
                    intervener owed no liability to the plaintiff. In response, A&amp;G pointed out
                    that the plaintiff’s writ <em>in rem</em> was issued
                        <em>before</em> the change of ownership, and as such
                    its claim was unaffected by the ownership change. At that point, AsiaLegal
                    requested details of the plaintiff’s security requirements on
                    21 January 2009. Meanwhile, on 16 January 2009, DLA wrote to EP
                    Carriers repeating the request for security in respect of the plaintiff’s
                    claim. This time, the request was totally ignored. It later transpired that EP
                    Carriers being insolvent and unable to carry on business had gone into
                    provisional liquidation on 17 February 2009, and provisional liquidators
                    appointed. Upon the vessel’s release from the first arrest on
                    27 February 2009, she was arrested by the plaintiff in
                Adm 233.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 9 March 2009, EP Carriers (through the
                    liquidators) entered an appearance in Adm 233 as owner of <em>Eagle Prestige</em> at the time the writ was issued. One
                    month later, Capital Gate intervened in Adm 233 and entered an appearance
                    on 16 April 2009 as the new owner of the vessel. I noted that Capital Gate as
                    early as 15 January 2009 had entered an appearance in Adm 9 as owner of the
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summons No 1777 of 2009 to set aside the warrant of arrest and
                outcome</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In Summons No 1777 of 2009
                    (“Summons 1777”), the intervener, Capital Gate, applied for the
                    setting aside of the warrant of arrest (and not the writ <em>in
                        rem</em>) and damages for wrongful arrest. The grounds of the
                    application were set out in TSL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit
                    filed on 16 April 2009, and they were entirely based on the
                    plaintiff’s failure to make full and frank disclosure of material
                    information in the affidavits leading the warrant of arrest. In particular,
                    cl 90 of the May sub-contract would absolve the defendant from all and any
                    liability arising from the alleged grounding incident, and cl 90 should
                    have been disclosed in the affidavit leading the warrant of arrest. TSL also
                    alleged that the plaintiff had failed to disclose in the affidavits leading the
                    warrant of arrest that the plaintiff was disputing the claim against the head
                    owner and had raised the very same clause and cl 102 in the head charter in
                    defence against the head owner’s damage claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Clauses 90 and 102 of the May sub-charter
                    read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">90    The Charterers shall not be responsible for loss of
                            life nor personal injury nor arrest or seizure or loss or damage to the
                            vessel and/or other objects arising from perils insured by customary
                            policies of insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102    Owners to keep the vessel fully insured against
                            all hull risks as per institute time clause (HULLS) 1.10.1983 including
                            RDC or equivalent conditions and usual deductibles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     TSL’s 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    affidavit filed on 5 May 2009 introduced other areas of non-disclosure.
                    They were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no information on the
                        status of the head owner’s claim against the plaintiff, and since the
                        head owner’s claim against plaintiff had not been determined the claim
                        against the defendant was premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     EP Carriers had liability cover with QBE and the
                        plaintiff was aware of that cover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the midst of the additional areas of
                    non-disclosures raised in the affidavits was the incongruous argument that there
                    was a need for the plaintiff to demonstrate a “good arguable case”
                    against the defendant. The latter argument was raised in TSL’s
                        3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit filed on 5 May 2009 wherein
                    she made the cursory allegation that there was no good arguable case because
                    there was no evidence or contemporaneous correspondence that the grounding
                    occurred. It is unclear what else was said before the AR hearing Summons 1777
                    who had noted down in his minute sheet the contention of Mr Timothy Tan,
                    counsel for the intervener, that first, <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)”</em>) required the
                    plaintiff to show a good arguable case and that second, this onus was not
                    discharged by the plaintiff. The main objection was still material
                    non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The AR agreed with the intervener and ordered
                    that the warrant of arrest be set aside for material non-disclosure. The AR
                    explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the plaintiff] had failed to disclose the material fact that they had
                        raised the defence of Clause 90 against the [head owner]. They ought to
                        have done so, even if only to add that they themselves felt that to be a
                        weak argument, or that the failure to raise the same argument in the
                        pre-arrest correspondence showed that they too did not believe it to be a
                        strong defence, or that the defence available to the [plaintiff] vis-à-vis
                        the [head owner] would not have been available to the [intervener] for some
                        reason or another.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Notably, Capital Gate chose to confine its
                    objection to material non-disclosure. TSL’s affidavits did not rely on
                    jurisdictional grounds to set aside the warrant of arrest. Equally, there was no
                    separate application in Summons 1777 to strike out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). At the risk of
                    stating the obvious, if a claim is made without foundation, the defendant can
                    always challenge jurisdiction under O 12 r 7 of the ROC as well as
                    strike out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action under
                    O 18 r 19.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to adduce further affidavit evidence after first
                hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     At the hearing of RA 178, the plaintiff
                    applied for leave to adduce further evidence by way of an affidavit from Henry
                    Ng (“Mr Ng”), a Senior Associate in A&amp;G who attended
                    before Assistant Registrar, Mr Adrian Loo (“AR Loo”),
                    for the issuance of the warrant of arrest. Counsel for the plaintiff,
                    Ms Vivian Ang, explained that the purpose of filing Mr Ng’s
                    affidavit was to set out the various matters that were orally conveyed to
                    AR Loo. According to Mr Ng, he attended before AR Loo for more
                    than an hour but the certified true copy of AR Loo’s minute sheet
                    recorded the following limited matters:</p>

                    Mr Ng’s affidavit. At the hearing of RA 178, Mr Tan argued
                    that Mr Ng’s affidavit was plainly an afterthought and the court
                    should not give it weight. Although Mr Tan objected to the lateness of the
                    application and doubted its veracity and credibility, the intervener did not
                    appeal against my decision granting leave to adduce further

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Before proceeding further, it is necessary to
                    mention that after I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal in RA 178, the
                    plaintiff’s adjourned application for the sale of the vessel <em>pendente lite</em> was listed for hearing before Lai Siu
                    Chiu J who ordered the judicial sale of the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> on 5 June 2009. Interestingly, the intervener did
                    not appeal against Lai J’s judicial sale order, but instead filed a
                    notice of appeal against my decision on 22 June 2009 without seeking, in
                    the meantime, an order to stay execution of the judicial sale order pending the
                    intervener’s appeal against my decision to the Court of Appeal. The
                    judicial sale of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was completed
                    on 25 August 2009, and the proceeds of sale were paid into court on the
                    same day. The sale proceeds have remained with the Sheriff as the
                    plaintiff’s claims are being disputed. As I understand from
                    Ms Ang’s arguments, the mortgage on the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> was created after the plaintiff’s writ <em>in rem</em> was issued.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Against this statutory background, it is not
                    disputed that the plaintiff whose claim is for breach of the May sub-charter,
                    has to satisfy both ss 3(1)(<em>h</em>) and 4(4) of
                    the HCAJA to maintain the arrest. Conversely, in order to have the arrest set
                    aside, it would have been sufficient for Capital Gate to succeed on either
                    statutory provision. If either statutory provision was not satisfied, the arrest
                    could not be sustained. Even if the statutory provisions were satisfied, the
                    court retains the discretion to set aside the arrest on a separate and
                    independent ground if there was material non-disclosure (see <em>The Rainbow Spring</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 362
                        (“<em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)”)</em> at
                    [37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In Summons 1777, the intervener applied for
                    the warrant of arrest to be set aside for material non-disclosure. As stated,
                    there was no application to set aside the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> on jurisdictional grounds under O 12 r 7, or to
                    strike out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action under
                    O 18 r 19 or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction for
                    frivolous or vexatious proceedings. Mr Tan, on behalf of the intervener,
                    explained that there was no dispute that the plaintiff’s claim fell
                    squarely within s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA having
                    regard to the existence of the May sub-charter of the <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em> made between the plaintiff and EP Carriers. He averred
                    that the plaintiff’s claim arose from the May sub-charter. Furthermore,
                    although the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was not the ship in
                    connection with which the claim was said to have arisen, the arrest was of a
                    vessel owned by EP Carriers who was the charterer of <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em> at the time the plaintiff’s cause of action arose.
                    There was no contest on the rightful ownership of the <em>Eagle
                        Prestige</em> at the time the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> was issued on 2 December 2008 as ownership had remained
                    constantly with EP Carriers. However, Mr Tan argued that even though the
                    plaintiff had satisfied the requirements of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) and s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)(ii), the
                    plaintiff must still demonstrate that it had a good arguable case on the merits.
                    Mr Tan contended that the plaintiff’s claim was premature, and went
                    so far as to argue that <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    in effect changed the <em>in personam</em> test in
                        s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) to a higher threshold, and in
                    doing so, departed from the legal principles enunciated in <em>The St Elefterio</em> [1957] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 283
                        (“<em>The St
                Elefterio”)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Ms Ang pointed out that since the same
                    facts were used in arguments, the intervener was muddling issues of a lack of
                    jurisdiction with issues of non-disclosure such that it was not clear if the
                    arguments made were directed to one issue or both. In short, it was far from
                    clear whether the intervener in raising the need to show a “good arguable
                    case” on the merits was mounting a jurisdictional challenge when Summons
                    1777 was grounded entirely on material non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Tan first raised two broad issues in
                    his written submissions. They are paraphrased as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_i"></a>(i)     Whether the arresting party is
                        required to show, at the stage when the warrant of arrest is being
                        challenged (“the challenge stage”) that it has a “good
                        arguable case” on the merits of the claim; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Whether the duty of disclosure in
                        applications for warrant of arrest extends to cover plausible defences on
                        the merits of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the course of argument,
                    Mr Tan raised a third issue which is whether at the application for a
                    warrant of arrest (“the application stage”), the arresting party
                    is required to show that it has a “good arguable case” on the
                    merits of the claim. The issues will be examined shortly. Suffice it to say at
                    this point of time, I did not accept Mr Tan’s various
                    contentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>The
                    Vasiliy Golovnin</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mr Tan’s arguments were supposedly
                    drawn from what was said to be legal propositions laid down in the recent
                    decision of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>. Before
                    examining <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> on the three
                    issues identified by Mr Tan and paraphrased in [30], it is necessary that I
                    begin by summarising the relevant facts. A fuller account of the facts is
                    reported in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 277 (“<em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (HC)”</em>). It must also be remembered that the defendant, Far
                    Eastern Shipping Co Plc (“FESCO”), applied (a) to set aside the
                    writ <em>in rem</em> and the warrant of arrest for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, non-compliance with s 3(1) of
                    the HCAJA (<em>ie</em>. want of jurisdiction) and (b) for
                    the writ <em>in rem</em> and action to be struck out as
                    vexatious and an abuse of process under O 18 r 19 of ROC or under the
                    inherent jurisdiction of the court. At the risk of stating the obvious, the
                    striking out application under O 18 r 19 is a separate process under
                    the ROC and available as a procedural remedy for the summary disposal of clear
                    and wholly unmeritorious, and hence, unsustainable actions. Tan Lee Meng J
                    in <em>Recordtv Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 43 at [17] helpfully summarised the
                    meaning of “frivolous or vexatious” and “abuse of
                    process” as decided by our Court of Appeal in two cases:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>The Osprey</em> [1999]
                        3 SLR(R) 1099, LP Thean JA reiterated at [8] that the words
                        “frivolous and vexatious [in O 18 r 19(b)] mean actions
                        which are “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong”
                        and this expression also connotes “a lack of purpose or seriousness
                        in the party’s conduct of the proceedings.” As for what amounts
                        to an “abuse of process” [in O 18 r 19(d)], in
                            [<em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee Chong
                            Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649] <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> <em>supra</em>), the Court of Appeal stated at [22]
                        stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The term, ‘abuse of process of the Court’, in
                            Order 18 Rule 19(1)(<em>d</em>), has been
                            given a wide interpretation by the courts. It includes considerations of
                            public policy and the interests of justice. This term signifies that the
                            process of the court must be used <em>bona
                                fide</em> and properly and must not be abused. The court will
                            prevent the improper use of its machinery. It will prevent the judicial
                            process from being used as a means of vexation and oppression in the
                            process of litigation. The categories of conduct rendering a claim
                            frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process are not closed and will
                            depend on all the relevant circumstances of the case. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     FESCO as the head owner chartered the vessel
                        <em>Chelyabinsk</em> on amended New York Produce
                    Exchange (“NYPE”) terms to head charterers, Sea Transport
                    Contractors Ltd (“STC”). STC, in turn, sub-chartered the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> on amended NYPE terms to Rustal SA
                    (“Rustal”) for the carriage of a shipment of rice on a voyage from
                    China and India for discharge at Lomé, Togo. The banks who provided financing to
                    Rustal and received the relevant bills of lading as security were Crédit
                    Agricole (Suisse) SA (“Crédit Agricole”) and Banque Cantonale de
                    Genève SA (“BCG”). The relevant bills of lading named Lomé as the
                    port of discharge. The dispute that arose was over the payment of hire for the
                        <em>Chelyabinsk</em>. As a result, FESCO received
                    conflicting instructions from STC and the banks, “Crédit Agricole”
                    and BCG. STC instructed the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> to sail to
                    Lomé, Togo, while the banks gave instructions to discharge the cargo at Douala,
                    Cameroon, in exchange for a letter of indemnity. Two of the three pertinent
                    bills of lading stated the port of discharge to be Lomé, and the third was
                    “any African port.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     One pertinent fact in the case was that STC,
                    on Rustal’s instructions, had requested FESCO to switch the bills of
                    lading to alter the port of discharge of the cargo from Lomé to Douala but the
                    switch never took place. Even without the switch, the banks still wanted the
                    cargo discharged at Douala. FESCO, under instructions to discharge the cargo at
                    Lomé, refused. On discharge, some of the cargo sustained damaged, and
                    FESCO’s P&amp;I Club provided security for the cargo damage. Meanwhile, on
                    21 February 2006, the banks obtained a Lomé court order for the arrest of
                    the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> in connection with FESCO’s
                    refusal to discharge the cargo at Douala and for damage to cargo. At an
                        <em>inter partes</em> hearing, FESCO successfully
                    opposed the arrest by obtaining an order to set aside of the arrest. The banks
                    did not appeal against the Lomé decision of 24 February 2006. The Lomé
                    court made the following important findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The banks could not deal directly
                        with FESCO without going through Rustal and STC, and FESCO could only follow
                        STC’s instructions since Lomé was stipulated as the port of discharge
                        in a number of the bills of lading.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     FESCO had not been at fault in proceeding to Lomé on
                        STC’s instructions since STC had control over the commercial
                        management of the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> as
                        charterer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     Douala was not listed as a port of discharge on the bills of lading
                        although the banks claimed that the cargo was bound for
                    Douala.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     Sufficient
                        security was given for the claims for loss and damage to the cargo and the
                        banks could not claim that they had suffered any loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On 18 March 2006, the banks started
                        <em>in rem</em> proceeding in Singapore and arrested
                    the <em>Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, a sister ship of the
                        <em>Chelyabinsk</em>, in respect of the very same
                    claims earlier made unsuccessfully to the court in Lomé. FESCO duly applied to
                    set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> and warrant of arrest of
                    the <em>Vasiliy Golovnin</em>. The Assistant Registrar,
                    Ms Ang Ching Pin (“AR Ang”) allowed FESCO’s
                    application. The writ <em>in rem</em> and the warrant of
                    arrest of the <em>Vasiliy Golovnin</em> were set aside for
                    three reasons, namely (a) issue estoppel, (b) material non-disclosure and (c)
                    lack of an arguable case against FESCO. On appeal, Tan Lee Meng J affirmed
                    AR Ang’s decision (except for the cargo damage claim, which Tan J did
                    not strike out). Crédit Agricole and <em>not</em> BCG,
                    appealed to the Court of Appeal against Tan J’s decision. However,
                    FESCO’s cross-appeal for wrongful arrest was against both
                banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In deciding against Crédit Agricole, the Court
                    of Appeal held that the bank did not have a “good arguable case”
                    because FESCO had no duty to obey Crédit Agricole, the holder of the bills of
                    lading and named consignee, in deviating to Douala from Lomé. To do so would
                    have made FESCO liable for breach of the head charter and breach of the
                    contracts of carriage contained in or evidenced by the relevant bills of lading.
                    Furthermore, unless the sub-charter provided otherwise, the master was obliged
                    to obey all instructions of STC who was entitled to give employment instructions
                    to FESCO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the subject of material non-disclosure, the
                    Court of Appeal held that Crédit Agricole had insufficiently disclosed the
                    existence of proceedings in Lomé. The Court of Appeal noted that there was no
                    real difference between the “essential features of the Togolese and
                    Singapore claims”. The bank should have disclosed to Assistant Registrar,
                    Mr David Lee (AR Lee), who heard the application for a warrant of arrest
                    that the objective of the proposed switch of the bills of lading was to change
                    the port of discharge without which the discharge port remained the same.
                    Further, Crédit Agricole should have disclosed to AR Lee the fact that there had
                    been an <em>inter partes</em> hearing in Lomé and its
                    outcome in FESCO’s favour to the effect that it had correctly performed
                    the terms of the bills of lading contract by discharging the cargo at Lomé. If
                    those facts were disclosed, AR Lee would have made enquiries in order to be
                    better placed to make an informed decision as to whether or not to issue the
                    warrant of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On issue estoppel, it was not necessary for
                    the Court of Appeal to discuss the plea in detail and the Court of Appeal agreed
                    with Tan J that issue estoppel was made out on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I now turn to examine <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> in order to consider the three issues
                    raised by Mr Tan as supporting his arguments. I will deal with issues (i)
                    and (iii) together as the arguments are the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">“Good arguable case”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In respect of issue (i) set out in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above, Mr Tan submitted that paras [51]
                    and [52] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> supported
                    his proposition that, at the challenge stage, the plaintiff is required to show
                    that he has a good arguable case on the merits. Paragraphs [51] and [52] of
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    The arrest of a vessel is never a trifling matter.
                            Arrest is a very powerful invasive remedy. … Maritime arrests
                            can, when improperly executed, sometime be as destructive as Anton
                            Piller orders and even as potentially ruinous as Mareva injunctions, the
                            two nuclear weapons of civil litigation. As such, a plaintiff must
                            always remain cautious and rigorously ascertain the material facts
                            before applying for a warrant of arrest. While there is no need to
                            establish a conclusive case at the outset, there is certainly a need to
                            establish a good arguable case, before an arrest can be issued. This
                            determination plainly requires a preliminary assessment of the merits of
                            the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    The standard to be applied in Singapore at this
                            early stage of the matter, if there is a challenge on the merits, is
                            indeed the “good arguable case” yardstick (see Karthigesu
                            JA’s observations in <em>The Jarguh
                                Sawit</em> (CA), at [47], above). The plaintiff does not have
                            to establish at this stage that he has a cause of action that might
                            probably prevail in the final analysis. Karthigesu JA has rightly
                            pointed out in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> (CA) that
                            the plaintiff need only show that he has a “good arguable
                            case” that his cause of action falls within one of the categories
                            provided for in s 3(1) of the HCAJA. The party invoking the arrest
                            procedure must be prepared, when challenged, to justify that it was
                            entitled right from the outset to invoke this remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     At the hearing, Mr Tan expanded on his
                    contention to include issue (iii) which is set out in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above. He said he was relying on <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> for the proposition that at the time of
                    applying for the warrant of arrest, the plaintiff has to satisfy the yardstick
                    of a good arguable case on the merits. He claimed that his contention was
                    reinforced by the Court of Appeal enlarging the arresting party’s duty to
                    disclose material facts to cover plausible defences on the merits. That
                    enlargement of the disclosure duty, so the argument developed, served to affirm
                    the need to show a good arguable case on the merits at the application stage. In
                    doing so and as a result, the Court of Appeal departed from the legal principles
                    in <em>The St Elefterio</em> (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In my view, Mr Tan had misunderstood
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> which discussed and
                    decided two different challenges: (a) procedural challenge to jurisdiction which
                    encompasses the existence of jurisdiction and the court’s exercise of such
                    jurisdiction; and (b) substantive challenge on the merits of the claim as it was
                    without foundation in the context of an application to strike out the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> and action under O 18 r 19 of
                    the ROC. Turning to specifics, in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em>, there was an application to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> and warrant of arrest on grounds of want of
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under s 3(1) of the
                    HCAJA. There was also a further application to strike out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action under O18 r 19 or under the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction which is a different point from
                    jurisdiction. As stated in <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above,
                    Tan J struck out all of the banks’ claims other than that relating to
                    damage to the cargo as the action failed to satisfy the threshold of being
                    “arguable” (see [24] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em>). On appeal to the Court of Appeal, VK Rajah JA
                    (delivering the judgment of the appellate court) discussed (a) the setting aside
                    of the writ <em>in rem</em> and warrant of arrest (under
                    O 12 r 7) on the ground that the claims did not fall with s 3(1)
                    of the HCAJA, and (b) striking out the writ <em>in rem</em>
                    and action under O 18 r 19 or under the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction on the ground that the claims were unmeritorious or clearly
                    unsustainable (see [44] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em>). As Rajah JA observed (at [48] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>), O 18 r 19 of the ROC is a
                    useful procedural remedy for the summary disposal of an action <em>in rem</em> which is vexatious in the sense that the action
                    is clearly hopeless, unmeritorious and, hence, unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As I have alluded to earlier, Mr Tan had
                    argued that paras [51] and [52] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em> supported his contentions in issue (i) and issue (iii). The
                    contentions are, in my view, misconceived. Paragraphs [45] to [52] fall under
                    the heading “Requirements for determining whether the claim falls within
                    section 3(1) of the HCAJA” and they have nothing to do with the <em>in personam</em> test in s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) (<em>per</em> Selvam JC (as he then
                    was) who coined the phrase “<em>in personam</em>
                    test” in <em>The Opal 3</em>, [1992]
                    2 SLR(R) 231 at [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning first to the discussions on
                    s 3(1) of the HCAJA in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em>, Rajah JA discussed in [45] to [52] the statutory
                    requirements for determining whether a claim falls within s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA. Rajah JA began the discussions on
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA by citing
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829
                        (“<em>The Jarguh Sawit”</em>) and quoted
                    with approval extracts from Toh Kian Sing SC, <em>Admiralty Law
                        &amp; Practice</em> (Lexis Nexis, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,
                    2007 at pp 45-46) (“<em>Admiralty Law &amp;
                        Practice”</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the claim is challenged at the jurisdictional stage, the court is not
                        usually concerned with its merits. The concern at this stage is whether the
                        nature of the plaintiff’s claim is within a particular head of
                        jurisdiction, rather than the strength of the claim. <em>So
                            long as the claim is not so frivolous as to be dismissed in limine, the
                            plaintiff does not have to establish at the outset that he has a cause
                            of action substantial at law</em>. Neither would the existence of
                        a good defence to a claim negate the court’s admiralty jurisdiction.
                        If the subject matter jurisdiction of the court is challenged, <em>the plaintiff under the law of Singapore only has to show that
                            he has a good arguable case that his claim comes within one of the limbs
                            of section 3(1) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act, as
                            opposed to the more onerous test of a balance of
                            probabilities</em>. The test in England, at least where the
                        jurisdictional challenge relates to the existence of particular facts,
                        remains that of a balance of probabilities… The position in Australia
                        is that any such jurisdictional fact must be proved on a balance of
                        probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in the original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     M Karthigesu JA in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> pointed out, at [42] of the report,
                    that the nature of the legal examination and the standard of proof will be
                    different if one is asserting jurisdiction as compared with liability which is
                    another question. If the dispute is whether the requirements of s 3(1) are
                    satisfied, Karthigesu JA at [43] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a hearing of an application to dispute jurisdiction [under
                        s 3(1)], the plaintiff need only show that he has a good arguable case
                        that his cause of action falls within one of the categories of s 3(1),
                        in this case, ground (c). His objective is to persuade the court that there
                        is sufficient evidence that a claim of the type specified in s 3(1)(c)
                        exists. As the plaintiff in the present case did so, the court was entitled
                        to find that the plaintiff rightly invoked its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Karthigesu JA went on to explain at [44]
                    that it would be later when the action reaches trial stage that the very same
                    facts used to establish jurisdiction must be proved at the hearing of the
                    substantive dispute on liability and the standard of proof then is on a balance
                    of probabilities. In <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>, the
                    appellants, before filing their defence, applied to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> under O 12, r 7 on the grounds that the
                    court had no jurisdiction to hear the action as they were not liable <em>in personam</em> to the respondents. On the facts, the
                    procedural issue in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> had already
                    been conclusively determined in an earlier interlocutory application and the
                    point was <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Subsequently, at [52] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, Rajah JA agreed with
                    Karthigesu JA that at the early stage of the application filed to dispute
                    jurisdiction (<em>ie</em>, the challenge stage), all the
                    plaintiff needed to do was to merely demonstrate that “he has a good
                    arguable case that his cause of action falls within one of the categories
                    s 3(1)”. The standard of proof is the “good arguable
                    case” yardstick, that is to say the “plaintiff does not have to
                    establish at this stage that he has a cause of action that might probably
                    prevail in the final analysis” at the trial. In practice, in order for
                    the plaintiff to establish that he has a good arguable case within one of the
                    categories of s 3(1), and using as an example s 3(1)(<em>h</em>), the plaintiff will have to set out the grounds
                    comprising the factual foundation of the claim and the assertion of a legal
                    right consequential upon those grounds. A claim that a breach of contract has
                    occurred is thus a claim for relief founded on grounds where an essential part
                    of the claim is a contract relating to the hire or use of a ship. Significantly,
                    at that stage, the strength of the claim is not relevant as the plaintiff does
                    not have to establish at the outset that he has a cause of action substantial at
                    law (see <em>The St Elefterio</em> (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above); <em>Baltic Shipping Co
                        Ltd v Pegasus Lines SA</em> [1996] 3 NZLR 641 at 647-648
                    &amp; <em>Admiralty Law &amp; Practice</em> at p 46
                    (see <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The dictum in [52] of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> is consistent with the line of authorities
                    that an <em>in rem</em> plaintiff need do no more than
                    demonstrate that the claim falls within one of the claims listed in s 3(1),
                    and that there is <em>no</em> onus on the in <em>rem</em> plaintiff to go beyond that early stage to prove the
                    further point that the claim is likely to succeed <em>unless</em> there is a <em>separate
                        challenge</em> that the action is so frivolous as to be summarily
                    dismissed. This is the approach adopted in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> and <em>The Moschanthy</em> [1971]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 37 at 42 (“<em>The
                        Moschanthy”</em>). One must therefore read paras [45] to [52]
                    of the <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> in the context of
                    the discussion on first, whether or not the plaintiff’s cause of action
                    fell within one of the categories in s 3(1) of the HCAJA and second, in the
                    context of Rajah JA’s agreeing with the observations of Karthigesu JA
                    in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> on the standard of proof at
                    the challenge stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In relation to the applicable standard of
                    proof, one must always keep in mind the context of the case. In <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>, the nature of the claim for the
                    purposes of s 3(1)(<em>c</em>) of the HCAJA was not
                    controversial. It concerned an undisputed fact that the claim was in respect of
                    a ship’s mortgage that came within s 3(1)(<em>c</em>). The complaint was whether the current owner of the vessel
                    without notice of the plaintiff’s unregistered mortgage was liable to the
                    respondent and that was an issue to be resolved at trial (see MPH
                    Rubin J’s decision reported in [1995] 2 SLR(R) 913 at [37]
                    which was upheld on appeal in Civil Appeal No 122 of 1995). Similarly, in
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>, the nature of the
                    claim was not in dispute. Crédit Agricole was able to establish, at the
                    challenge stage, a claim for relief founded on grounds an essential part of
                    which was a contract relating to the hire or use of a ship that came within
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>). Again context is
                    important.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I digress here a little for a brief reminder
                    on the proper standard of proof of jurisdictional questions under the HCAJA.
                    When jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> is challenged (and the
                    challenge to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> and warrant
                    of arrest is usually made under O 12 r 7), the proper standard of
                    proof on jurisdiction is on a balance of probabilities. It is clear that where
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> is based on the existence of
                    particular facts or a particular state of affairs, a challenge to jurisdiction
                    can only be resisted by establishing the facts on which it depends. In the
                    event, the particular facts or state of affairs must be established on the
                    balance of probabilities in the light of all the affidavit evidence before the
                    court to determine whether there is jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>. This approach is illustrated by such cases as <em>The Catur Samudra</em> [2010] SGHC 18
                        (“<em>The Catur Samudra</em>”), <em>The Alexandrea</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 813
                        (“<em>The Alexandrea</em>”), <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 523
                        (“<em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>”),
                        <em>The Inai Selasih</em> (<em>ex
                        “Geopotes X”</em>) [2005] 4 SLR(R) 1
                        (“<em>The Inai Selasih</em> “) and the
                    Court of Appeal’s decision reported in [2006] 2 SLR(R) 181. A
                    review of those cases will show that where, for instance, the nature of the
                    claim requires, for example, the establishment of factual preconditions in
                    s 3(1) or contemplates a s 4(4) ownership question, the <em>in rem</em> plaintiff was obliged to prove the existence of
                    the particular jurisdictional fact and to show jurisdiction on a balance of
                    probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>The Catur
                        Samudra</em>, a recent decision of Steven Chong JC, one of the issues
                    that arose was, <em>inter alia</em>, whether a claim under
                    a guarantee for the liabilities of a related company as charterer under a
                    charterparty was a claim arising out of an agreement relating to the use or hire
                    of a vessel within the scope of s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of
                    the HCAJA. The plaintiff was required to satisfy the burden of proof on a
                    balance of probabilities in respect of an essential jurisdictional issue. In
                    that case, the nature of the claim went to the heart of the jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em>, and at the challenge stage, it was for
                    the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities the jurisdictional issue in
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     
          <em>The Alexandrea</em>
                    concerned the supply of contaminated marine fuel oil to the vessel, <em>Front Melody</em>, resulting in damage to <em>Front Melody</em>’s machinery. The plaintiff commenced an
                    action <em>in rem</em> against the <em>Alexandrea</em> and arrested the vessel. One of the grounds upon
                    which the court’s jurisdiction was challenged by the defendant was that
                    the plaintiff’s claim did not arise “in connection with a
                    ship” (see s 4(4) of the HCAJA). The High Court held that the
                        <em>Front Melody</em> and not the <em>Alexandrea</em> was the ship in connection with which the claim
                    arose. The plaintiff had to prove on a balance of probabilities the
                    jurisdictional issue in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>The Inai
                        Selasih</em>, the plaintiff there entered into a joint venture with
                    the defendant pursuant to a memorandum of understanding (the
                    “MOU”). Thereafter, the plaintiff provided a dredger, the
                        <em>Inai Seroja</em>, to the defendant for its use.
                    Various claims under the MOU arose between the parties and the plaintiff
                    eventually commenced proceedings against the defendant and arrested the
                        <em>Inai Selasih</em>, a vessel owned by the defendant.
                    The defendant applied to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em>
                    and the warrant of arrest on the basis, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, that it was not the charterer of the <em>Inai
                        Seroja</em> because the charterparty relied upon by the plaintiff in
                    the <em>in rem</em> action was a sham, and it could not
                    have the effect of conferring the status of charterer on the defendant. The High
                    Court held that the onus was on the plaintiff to establish, on a balance of
                    probabilities, that the defendant was the charterer of the <em>Inai Seroja</em> when the cause of action arose. That burden was not
                    discharged as the requirements of s 4(4) were not satisfied (see the Court
                    of Appeal’s decision reported in [2006] 2 SLR(R) 181 at [15]
                    upholding the High Court on this point).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>The Andres
                        Bonifacio</em>, the plaintiffs arrested the <em>Andres
                        Bonifacio</em> as security for their claim arising from the charter of
                    another vessel. The defendant applied to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em>. The main issue for determination was whether the
                    defendant was the beneficial owner of the <em>Andres
                        Bonifacio</em>. Karthigesu J (as he then was) decided (at [47])
                    that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[o]n the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that [the defendant was]
                        the beneficial [owner] of all the shares in the ‘Andres
                        Bonifacio’ from 1980 through to the date when these <em>in rem</em> proceedings were commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal in [1993] 3 SLR(R) 71 upheld Karthigesu J’s findings on beneficial

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unmeritorious substantive claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I now come to the other part of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> relating to the question of
                    whether the banks’ claims were unmeritorious or clearly unsustainable (see
                    [44] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>). On the facts
                    of that case, a good starting point is the test of jurisdiction under s4(4)(b)
                        (<em>ie</em>, the <em>in
                        personam</em> test). It is important to bear in mind the <em>in personam</em> test in two contexts. The first concerns
                    what has been described as “the low threshold of the merits
                    enquiry” (“Situation 1”), and the second is where the
                    proceedings are frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process so as to
                    warrant halting such proceedings <em>in limine</em> by
                    striking out the action under O18 r 19 of ROC or under the court’s
                    inherent jurisdiction (“Situation 2”). Under
                    Situation 2, the merits of the claim are examined as a summary disposal of
                    the action is being sought. Notably, <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em> was concerned with Situation 2. In contrast, the
                    present case falls typically within Situation 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, the defendant shipowner applied to set aside the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> arguing that the plaintiff’s
                    claim against the defendant for damages arising out of the antedating of the
                    bills of lading did not fall within s 1(1) (<em>h</em>) of the Administration of Justice Act 1956 (“the 1956 Act
                    (UK)”) (our s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA).
                    Willmer J held that the words “claims arising out of any agreement
                    relating to the carriage of goods in a ship” in s 1(1)(<em>h</em>) were wide enough to cover claims in tort as well as
                    in contract. As such, the plaintiff’s claim came within
                        s 1(1)(<em>h</em>) and (<em>g</em>) and it was properly brought against the vessel <em>St Elefterio</em> under s 3(4) of the same Act (our
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA). The question whether the court had jurisdiction to
                    entertain the plaintiff’s claim <em>in rem</em>
                    against the <em>St Elefterio</em> was answered by reference
                    to the <em>nature of the claim</em> as put forward without
                    going beyond that to ask whether it was likely to succeed or not in the final
                    analysis. In construing the wording of s3(4)(<em>b</em>)
                    (the equivalent of our s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)),
                    Willmer J made clear that the existence of a good defence to a claim would
                    not “negate the court’s admiralty jurisdiction”. The
                    principles enunciated by Willmer J in his judgment (at 287-288) are
                    reproduced here in <em>extenso</em> as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I need hardly say that none of these contentions advanced on behalf of the
                        defendants was accepted as correct by the plaintiffs; but I do not propose
                        to go into the merits of these various contentions now, or to decide whether
                        the defendants are right or whether the plaintiffs are right. <em>It seems to me having regard to the view I take of the
                            construction of section 3(4) of the Act [our s4(4) of the HCAJA], that
                            this is not the moment to decide whether the defendants are right or
                            whether they are wrong in their submissions on the points of law raised.
                            If they are right on all or any of these various points advanced, it may
                            well be that in the end they will show a good defence to the action. But
                            that, in my judgment, furnishes no good reason for setting these
                            proceedings aside in limine, and thereby depriving the plaintiffs of the
                            right to have these issues tried</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It has not been suggested that the proceedings are
                            frivolous or vexatious, so as to call for the exercise of the
                            court’s inherent jurisdiction to halt such proceedings in
                            limine</em>. The defendants’ argument is founded on the
                        proposition that section 3 (4) of the Act of 1956 [our s4(4) of the HCAJA]
                        introduces a new restriction on the right to proceed <em>in
                            rem</em>, and that a plaintiff cannot arrest a ship under that
                        subsection unless he can prove – and prove at the outset – that
                        he has a cause of action sustainable in law. In my judgment that proposition
                        rests upon a misconception of the purpose and meaning of section 3 (4). As
                        it appears to me, that subsection, so far from being a restrictive
                        provision, is a subsection introduced for the purpose of enlarging the
                        Admiralty jurisdiction of the court. As I view it, its purpose is to confer,
                        and to confer for the first time in England, the right to arrest either the
                        ship in respect of which the cause of action is alleged to have arisen or
                        any other ship in the same ownership. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment the purpose of the words relied on by Mr Roskill, that
                        is to say, the words “the person who would be liable on the claim in
                        an action <em>in personam</em>” is to identify
                        the person or persons whose ship or ships may be arrested in relation to
                        this new right (if I may so express it) of arresting a sister ship.
                            <em>The words used, it will be observed, are “the
                            person who would be liable” not “the person “who is
                            liable,”</em> and it seems to me, bearing in mind the
                        purpose of the Act, that <em>the natural construction of
                            those quire simple words is that they mean the person who would be
                            liable on the assumption that the actions succeeds”.
                            …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]ny other construction of section 3(4) of the Act other than
                        the construction I have sought to put upon it, would as it seems to me, lead
                        to the most intolerable difficulties in practice. If Mr Roskill is
                        right in saying that a plaintiff has no right to arrest a ship at all,
                        unless he can show <em>in limine</em> a cause of action
                        sustainable in law, what is to happen in a case (and, having regard to the
                        argument I have listened to, this may be just such a case) where the
                        questions of law raised are highly debatable, and questions on which it may
                        be desired to take the opinion of the Court of Appeal or even of the House
                        of Lords? Suppose, for instance, following Mr Roskill’s argument,
                        that this court comes to the conclusion, on the preliminary argument held at
                        this stage of the action, that the action is not one that is sustainable in
                        law, it will presumably set aside the writ and the warrant of arrest. It is
                        possible (these things have been known to happen) that a higher court might
                        take a different view; but in the meantime the ship, which is a foreign
                        ship, has been freed from arrest, has gone, and may never return to this
                        country. It might be that in those circumstances the plaintiffs would have
                        lost their right for ever to entertain proceedings in rem in this
                        country.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact is, and this is the sanction against abuse, that the plaintiffs,
                        if their alleged cause of action turns out not to be a good one, will be
                        held liable for costs, and those costs will include the costs of furnishing
                        bail in order to secure the release of the ship. The defendants can always
                        secure the release of their ship by the simple expedient of furnishing bail.
                        It is true that if, as they say it will, the action fails, they will
                        probably not recover <em>inter partes</em> the whole of
                        the costs of furnishing the bail; but in that respect I do now know that
                        they are in any different position from other defendants in other types of
                        action. That observation applies especially in these days of legal aid.
                        There is many a defendant, who has been unsuccessfully sued, and who at the
                        end of it all finds himself in the position that he cannot recover the whole
                        of his costs. That is one of the incidents of litigation which, as it seems
                        to me, parties have to accept in modern conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It must be highlighted that the only
                    application before Willmer J in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> was the application to set aside the writ and warrant
                    of arrest on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>. There was no application to strike out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action as disclosing no cause of action, or
                    that the proceedings were frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process.
                    One other fact to note in <em>The St Elefterio</em> is that
                    the relevant agreement in s 1(1)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    1956 Act (UK) had in fact been made between the two parties to the action. In
                    addition, and this is a significant distinction to note, the further point on
                    likely success is relevant, as Willmer J recognised in his judgment,
                        <em>only if</em> the defendant <em>separately</em> contends that the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> and action should be struck out on the ground that it is
                    frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process (<em>ie</em>, Situation 2 as in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). The action is said to be vexatious because it is
                    unlikely to succeed (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). This
                    separate process is brought under O18 r 19 of the ROC or under the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction. As McKay and Henry JJ correctly
                    observed in <em>Baltic Shipping v Pegasus Lines SA</em> at
                    650 (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a claim is made unreasonably, in the sense of being without foundation,
                        the defendant can always move to strike out as well as challenging
                        jurisdiction, as was done in <em>The
                            “Moschanthy</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In short, it is open to a defendant to apply
                    at an early stage of the proceedings for the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> and action to be struck off on the ground that the action has
                    no chance of success and is, therefore, vexatious. It is at this stage of
                    striking out application that the court is asked to assess the sustainability of
                    the action. It is at this stage of the striking out application that the
                    validity or strength of the claim will be relevant, and the burden on the issue
                    of non-liability lies on the defendant to show that the case is wholly and
                    clearly unarguable. If there is any arguable basis put up by the plaintiff that
                    the action could succeed then the court should not order the striking out of the
                    action. In <em>The Vasiliy Golonvin (CA)</em>, the
                    hopelessness of the plaintiff’s claim was beyond doubt. Crédit Agricole
                    could not show that it had an arguable case for the breach of contract arising
                    from the discharge of the cargo at Lomé, and the Court of Appeal concluded that
                    for that “reason alone its claim ought to be struck out” (see [78]
                    of <em>The Vasiliy Golonvin (CA)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     From the analysis of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golonvin (CA)</em> and explanation above, there is no
                    substance and merit in Mr Tan’s contentions on issue (i) and issue
                    (iii). There was no basis or room for Mr Tan’s contention that
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> changed the position
                    at law enunciated in <em>The St Elefterio</em> which was
                    followed in <em>The Wigwam</em>
                    [1981-1982] SLR(R) 689 (“<em>The
                        Wigwam”</em>). If <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> is no longer good law in Singapore, the Court of Appeal
                    would have explicitly said so. <em>The St Elefterio</em>
                    was not even referred to by its case name in <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin (CA</em>). In fact, the Court of Appeal in [49] of the
                    judgment quoted with approval <em>Admiralty Law and
                        Practice</em> where the author had at pp 45-46 of the text
                    summarised the legal principles from <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> which were followed in <em>The
                        Wigwam</em>. <em>The St Elefterio</em> received
                    approval for the propositions that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So long as the claim is not frivolous as to be dismissed <em>in limine</em>, the plaintiff does not have to establish
                        at the outset that he has a cause of action substantial at law;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Neither would the existence of a good defence to a claim negate the
                        court’s admiralty jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>The Wigwam</em>,
                    the claim there was brought under s 3(1)(<em>l</em>)
                    and (<em>m</em>) of the HCAJA. Following <em>The Elefterio</em>, FA Chua J held that the plaintiff was not
                    required to prove at the outset that his cause of action was substantial in law.
                    Chua J specifically noted that there was no suggestion that the proceedings
                    were frivolous or vexatious. Further, the affidavits had disclosed conflicting
                    evidence which could only be resolved at trial. Chua J’s decision was
                    upheld by the Court of Appeal (see [1984] SGCA 24 at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The assumption under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA- that a party would be liable on the
                    claim in an action <em>in personam</em> on the assumption
                    that the action succeeded – is the default position so long as there is no
                    suggestion that the claim is frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of
                    process (<em>ie</em>, Situation 1 as in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). This default position is reflected in
                    O70 r 4(7)(a) of the ROC which requires the affidavit leading the warrant
                    of arrest to state the name of the person who would be liable on the claim in an
                    action <em>in personam</em>. Willmer J in <em>The St Elefterio</em> left open the possibility of striking
                    out the action if the action on the evidence is frivolous or vexatious or
                    otherwise an abuse of process (<em>ie</em>,
                    Situation 2 as in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). Choo Han
                    Teck JC (as he then was) in <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>
                    [1996] SGHC 212 cited <em>The St Elefterio</em>
                    and <em>The Wigwam</em> and observed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Insofar as the construction of the words
                            “the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in
                            personam” are concerned, I am in complete agreement with
                            Willmer J as Chua J was in “the
                        Wigwam”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    However, <em>the judgment of
                                Willmer J does not invariably open a door which cannot be shut
                                until the matter has been ventilated in full at trial. Although the
                                courts will not deny access to any party who is able to formulate a
                                cause of action against a party identified as the person who would
                                be liable in personam on that cause of action (whether the party
                                suing succeeds or not is a matter for the trial judge)</em>,
                                <em>nonetheless, if it is clear that the evidence
                                relied upon by the Plaintiffs is obviously tenuous the courts will
                                strike out the action. In other words, if the action appears to the
                                court to be frivolous then it would not be permitted to
                                proceed</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    To found an action in rem in this case, the
                            Plaintiffs must show that the person who <em>would

                            adduced by the Plaintiffs themselves I find that there is no reasonable
                            ground to assume that the Defendants were the contracting party whether
                            as principal or through an agent.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In that case, the plaintiffs supplied bunkers
                    and marine fuels to the <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>. This was
                    done pursuant to a telefax request on 10 January 1996 stating the buyer to
                    be “the master and/or owner and/or operator and Portserv Limited”.
                    On the same day, the plaintiffs received a telefax from “Portserv
                    Limited”, a company in Canada, stating that the vessel would arrive in
                    Singapore on 12 January 1996. The next day, the master of the <em>Lok Maheshwari</em> sent a telex to the plaintiffs stating
                    “…Understand u stemming IFO 200mt n MDO 50 mt outside Singapore
                    Port limits as advised by Transmar Shipping…”. The vessel was at
                    all material times on a time charter to Halla Merchant Marine Co Ltd of Seoul,
                    Korea who sub-chartered the vessel to the Transmar Shipping referred to in the
                    master’s telex of 11 January 1996. In the circumstances, the
                    defendants, owners of the <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>, refused
                    to pay on an invoice sent by the plaintiffs for the supply of the bunkers and
                    marine fuels. Subsequently, the plaintiffs sued the defendants and arrested the
                    vessel in an action <em>in rem</em>. The defendants then
                    applied to strike out the writ of summons on the grounds that the court had no
                    jurisdiction over the claim since the defendants were not the party liable
                        <em>in personam</em>. The defendants’ application
                    was allowed. Choo JC held that the plaintiffs’ claim was frivolous as
                    “[i]t was clear that the party whom the Plaintiffs intended to contract
                    with was the party who requested the bunkers, and that was undisputedly,
                    Transmar Shipping, the sub-charterers.” Even on the plaintiffs’ own
                    case, the defendants would clearly not be liable <em>in
                        personam</em> for the plaintiffs’ claim. There was clear
                    affidavit evidence that the claim against the defendant was misconceived as the
                    defendant was not the contracting party. It was therefore plain that the action
                    was unsustainable and, in the circumstances, frivolous. Choo Han Teck JC at
                    [18] of the judgment said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court need not make any finding whether any particular party had lied
                        as that is a matter for trial, but the basic foundation must be laid, and
                        this the Plaintiffs have failed to do and up to the date of the hearing
                        before me this was not done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Similarly, in <em>The
                        Rolita</em> (1988 WL 1057731), an unreported decision of the Hong Kong
                    High Court No AJ 105 of 1988, 22 August 1988, Cruden J (at 6)
                    observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a plaintiff has an unsupportable case and would be unable to
                        establish its claim at trial, I recognise that it would be unjust to allow
                        it to exploit at an interlocutory stage the legal assumption that its
                        allegations of fact are true. In that hopefully uncommon situation at
                        defendant’s safeguard is to bring a summons under Order
                        18 Rule 19 R.S.C. and have the claim struck out. Unless and until
                        a claim is struck out as vexatious or otherwise, the legal assumption that
                        the plaintiff’s allegations are true prevails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>The Moschanthy</em> (1971) 1  Lloyd’s
                        Rep 43 is an example of where a defendant’s application to set
                        aside was supported by an application for a stay on the ground that the
                        proceedings were vexatious. In the present action there is no application
                        for striking out or for stay on the grounds that the claim is vexatious or
                        otherwise. If that issue were before the Court, the plaintiff’s stance
                        was that the affirmations, telexes and other documents showed that the claim
                        was far from being frivolous or vexatious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Cruden J’s decision was upheld on appeal
                    (see [1989] 1 HKLR 394). The appellate court reaffirmed <em>The St Elefterio</em> approach as it covers</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the agreement (as in our s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of
                        HCAJA) as well as the breach, the establishment of the cause of action and
                        damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As I mentioned earlier, <em>The
                        St Elefterio</em> is a case where the relevant agreement had in fact
                    been made between the two parties to the action. In other words, there was no
                    dispute on the proper defendant in an <em>in personam</em>
                    action and there was no question that the plaintiff should have sued someone
                    else <em>in personam</em> in respect of the claim arising
                    under the bills of lading. There have been cases where the writ <em>in rem</em> is sought to be set aside under O 12
                    r 7 on the ground that the claim did not fall within s 4(4) because
                    the plaintiff should have sued someone else <em>in
                        personam</em>. In other words, there was <em>no
                        subsisting</em> claim <em>in personam</em>
                    against the person who was at that time the owner of the vessel, and there was
                    no jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> because the basis of an
                    action <em>in rem</em> arose from the personal liability of
                    the owner of the vessel. The common argument in the decisions of <em>The Thorlina</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 258, <em>The Lok Mashewari</em>, <em>The AA
                        V</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 664 (“<em>The
                        AA V</em>”) and <em>The Rainbow
                        Spring</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>The Rainbow Spring (HC)</em>”) and <em>The
                        Rainbow Spring (CA</em>) reported in [2003] 3 SLR(R) 362 was
                    that the plaintiff should have sued someone else <em>in
                        personam</em>, and there was clear evidence of the absence of a
                    subsisting claim against the defendant shipowner at the time the writ <em>in rem</em> was filed. There was want of jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em>. The substance of the underlying claim
                    was factually inseparable from the basis of jurisdiction. The jurisdictional
                    fact in dispute could on the evidence be summarily disposed of. In <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em>, the relevant agreement under
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA was between the
                    parties to the action, namely Crédit Agricole and FESCO. At the risk of
                    repetition, FESCO, at the challenge stage, separately argued that the
                    bank’s claim was without foundation; it was hopeless and was bound to
                    fail. FESCO had applied to strike out the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> and action under O 18 r 19 or under the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court, an avenue recognised in the <em>St
                        Elefterio</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-disclosure of material facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is not in dispute that non-disclosure of
                    material facts is an independent ground upon which the court will, as a general
                    rule, set aside any order made in favour of an applicant in interlocutory
                    proceedings. The duty to disclose is to inform the court of any facts which the
                    plaintiff knows which might tell in the defendant’s favour (<em>per</em> Warner J in <em>Re A Debtor
                        (No 75 of 1982), ex p The Debtor v National Westminster
                        Bank</em> [1983] 3 All ER 545 at 551). There is no doubt
                    that the duty to disclose applies to an <em>in rem</em>
                    plaintiff applying <em>ex parte</em> for a warrant of
                    arrest under O 70 r 4 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the present case, Capital Gate, the
                    intervener, only applied to set aside the warrant of arrest for material
                    non-disclosure. Although no application was made under O 12 r 7 or
                    O 18 r 19 on the ground that the claim did not fall within s 4(4)
                    of the HCAJA, suggesting that there was jurisdiction to sue <em>in rem</em> and that the procedural requirements in O 70
                    r 4 were met, the avenue of non-disclosure as an independent ground to
                    discharge the warrant of arrest was available to Capital Gate. In short, it is
                    possible to apply to set aside the warrant of arrest because either there was a
                    lack of <em>in personam</em> liability or there was
                    non-disclosure of material facts (see <em>The Rainbow Spring
                        (CA)</em> at [35] – [37]). In <em>The
                        Harima</em> [1987] 2 HKC 118 (“<em>The
                        Harima</em>”), the defendant there (not unlike Capital Gate)
                    did not apply under O 12 r 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (HK) to
                    set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> or strike out the action
                    under O 18 r 19 on the ground that the claim did not fall within
                    s 21 of the Supreme Court Act in the (UK) (the equivalent of our
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA). The setting aside was only on the ground of
                    non-disclosure of material facts. Hunter J in <em>The
                        Harima</em> advocated that the proper course was for the defendant to
                    apply to strike out the action, rather than to rely on non-disclosure which was
                    a backdoor route. As Hunter J reminded, there was no application before him
                    to strike out and that even if there was an application to strike out, he would
                    not have acceded to it. Although there were difficulties in the
                    plaintiff’s case with a back-dated bill of lading and allegations of
                    illegality arising from the back-dating, Hunter J did not think it was
                    possible to say that there was no arguable case so as to warrant a striking out.
                    On the issue of setting aside of the warrant of arrest on the basis of
                    non-disclosure, Hunter J said (at 405):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But in my judgment, such power [to arrest] is not being abused or misused
                        if a plaintiff is bringing an action which prima facie falls within the
                        subsection but may hereafter fail, so long as the action itself cannot be
                        said to be an abuse of process or vexatious or demurrable. Further that is a
                        separate process. If it is being asserted that the claim is demurrable, that
                        must be asserted properly and openly by the defendant on the appropriate
                        application [<em>ie</em> at the challenge stage], and
                        you do not reach the same result by the indirect or backdoor route of a
                        process of non-disclosure. In other words, in my judgment at least, although
                        the same principle about disclosure on ex parte applications plainly applies
                        to this process as to any other, the material facts which have to be
                        considered at the time on an application under O 75 are very different,
                        for example, to the material facts which would be considered on an
                        application for something like a Mareva injunction, where the whole relief
                        largely turns upon the apparent validity of the plaintiff’s claim. In
                        these circumstances, in my judgment, the defendant’s application
                        fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Nonetheless, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal
                    recognised that non-disclosure could be an independent ground for discharging
                    the warrant of arrest, but on the facts of that case, the appellate court upheld
                    Hunter J’s decision that the legality of the bill of lading was not
                    directly relevant to the issue of the warrant of arrest, and as such the
                    plaintiff was not obliged to depose to the merits of its claim when it applied
                    for the warrant following the legal principles enunciated in <em>The St Elefterio</em> and <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It is settled law in Singapore that (a)
                    non-disclosure of material facts is an independent ground for setting aside an
                    arrest, and (b) the court retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set
                    aside or discharge the arrest for non-disclosure. Judith Prakash J in
                        <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> referred to <em>The AA V</em> and <em>The J
                        Faster</em> [2000] 1 HKC 652 as decisions where the courts
                    in Singapore and Hong Kong have acknowledged that an arrest can be set aside
                    because either there was a lack of <em>in personam</em>
                    liability or there was non-disclosure of material facts.</p>

                    the court was an important bulwark against the abuse of the arrest process and
                    went on to quote the rest of [37] which stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I now come to Mr Tan’s issue (ii)
                    as set out in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above. It is not
                    controversial that material facts that have to be disclosed are determined by
                    what is “material” to the grant or refusal of the <em>ex parte</em> application for the issue of the warrant.
                    Rajah JA in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    reiterated that facts are material if they have a “bearing on the
                    decision-making process or outcome of the original application” to issue
                    a warrant of arrest (at [88]) and the scope of disclosure is based on what is
                    “reasonable in the given circumstances at the time of the arrest”
                    (at [90]). Elaborating, Rajah JA at [87] said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test for materiality is always an objective one. In the words of
                        Prakash J in <em>The Rainbow Spring</em>, the test
                        is to simply ask “how <em>relevant</em> the fact
                        is” [emphasis added] (at [33]). However, the duty imposed on the
                        applicant requires him to ask what might be relevant to the court in its
                        assessment of whether or not the remedy should be granted, and not what the
                        applicant alone might think is relevant. This inevitably embraces matters,
                        both factual and legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the
                        successful outcome of the applicant’s application. <em>It extends to all material facts that could be reasonably ascertained
                            and defences that might be reasonably raised by the
                        defendant</em>. <em>It is important to stress, however,
                            that the duty extends only to plausible, and not all conceivable or
                            theoretical, defences</em>. For example, if there have been
                        unsuccessful prior proceedings, the context as well as the reasons for the
                        dismissal must be adequately disclosed. In short, the material facts are
                        those which are material to enable the judge to make an informed decision
                        (see <em>Brink’s Mat Ltd v Elcombe</em> [1988]
                        1 WLR 1350 <em>per</em> Ralph Gibson LJ at
                        1356).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In his review of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> in the Singapore Academy of Law
                    Annual Review, (2008) 9 SAL Ann Rev 54, Toh Kian Sing SC (at 2.13)
                    observed that the decision appears to have extended the duty to disclose to
                    “defences that might be reasonably raised by the defendant” in an
                    application for the arrest of a vessel under O 70 r 4 of the ROC. This
                    part of my decision examines whether or not <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin (CA)</em> indeed enlarged the duty to disclose to include
                    plausible defences to the plaintiff’s claim. I interpose to mention that
                    central to the intervener’s argument in RA 178 was cl 90 of the
                    May sub-charter, which Mr Tan, for the intervener, said gave the defendant
                    a complete defence to the plaintiff’s claim for the grounding damage.
                    Mr Tan’s view of the matter invariably raised the question of the
                    merits of the claim for the grounding damage. His argument rested on the
                    statement in [87] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    that the duty of disclosure extended to “plausible, and not all
                    conceivable or theoretical defences”. That dictum, Mr Tan argued,
                    imposed a duty on the <em>in rem</em> plaintiff to inform
                    the court of plausible defences to the claim which the defendant would seek to
                    raise at the trial, and a failure to make full and frank disclosure of the
                    plausible defences was sufficient ground to discharge or set aside the warrant
                    of arrest. Putting Mr Tan’s argument in perspective, the real issue
                    before me was whether or not the merits of the claim could be called into
                    question in the context of an application for a warrant of arrest so much so
                    that a failure to refer to cl 90, an argument which the defendant may seek
                    to raise in answer to the plaintiff’s claim at the trial, should be
                    characterised <em>as a failure to make full and frank
                        disclosure</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In my view, the expression “plausible
                    defences” has to be understood in the light of the realities of the
                    situation in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>. The claim
                    was held to be “really implausible” and unsustainable; the point
                    that the cause of action was frivolous and vexatious could easily be taken and
                    determined summarily based on plainly cogent affidavit evidence. In a way, the
                    expression “plausible defence” is being used loosely; the meaning
                    of “plausible defences” may be culled from the context and
                    surrounding circumstances. First, <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em> was a case falling under Situation 2 where the merits
                    of the claim including the defences to the claim were examined. Second, from a
                    broader perspective, “plausible defences” are matters referable to
                    objections (factual and/or legal) to the claim being brought in the first place,
                    or to the arrest being mounted at all. They are material facts which,
                    objectively speaking, are of such weight that their omission, at the application
                    stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of process. Such an abuse of
                    process is strictly not a <em>defence</em> to the claim; it
                    is an objection to the claim or arrest being brought at all. In the context of
                    the duty to make full and frank disclosure, a failure to disclose material facts
                    that constituted the abuse, would be a ground for discharging or setting aside
                    the warrant of arrest for material non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I now come to the reasons for holding the view
                    that in the context of an application for a warrant of arrest, the duty to
                    disclose “plausible defences” is <em>not</em>
                    generally directed at defences to the claim that may be raised at the trial in
                    answer to the plaintiff’s claim but in a broader perspective to matters
                    that constitute an abuse of the arrest process (see [72] and [74]). In a case
                    falling under Situation 2, there will be matters (factual and/or legal) of
                    such weight as to deliver the “knock out blow” to the claim
                    summarily, <em>and</em>, on any reasonable view, their
                    omission, at the application stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of
                    process. These matters are likely to be, or at the very least, overlap with
                    defences that deliver the “knock out blow” to the claim summarily,
                        <em>and</em> it is their omission that is likely to or
                    may mislead the court in the exercise of its discretionary powers of
                    arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     At the application stage, one must be mindful
                    of the distinction between questions of jurisdiction and questions of merits of
                    the claim (see <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> and <em>The St Elefterio</em>). If the expression “plausible
                    defence” is referable to a plausible defence <em>to the
                        claim</em>, it will invariably raise the question of the merits of the
                    claim, and the question that arose in RA 178 was this: are the merits of
                    the claim (not jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>) <em>now</em> relevant in the context of an application for a
                    warrant of arrest under O 70 r 4 of ROC even under Situation 1 as
                    in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above because of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>? Or is the requisite disclosure of
                    material facts, at the application stage, still confined primarily to
                    considerations of jurisdiction and not to merits so that the failure to refer to
                    defences to the claim (which the defendant may seek to raise in answer to the
                    plaintiff’s claim at the trial) should <em>not</em>
                    generally be characterised as a failure to make a full and frank disclosure? The
                    answer is that there is <em>no</em> change to what has
                    previously been established by case law. <em>The concerns of the
                        court at the application stage are firstly, with considerations of
                        jurisdiction in rem (and generally not the merits of the claim) and
                        secondly, disclosure of material facts which are germane to considerations
                        of jurisdiction in rem and overlaying that is the absence of facts and
                        circumstances suggesting an abuse of the arrest process</em>. Notably,
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> applied existing
                    legal principles to the facts of the case which brought into sharp focus the
                    interplay between the court’s twin concerns at the application stage for a
                    warrant of arrest (as to what the twin concerns are see also <a href="#p1_81">[81]</a>-<a href="#p1_82">[82]</a>
                    below) and the duty to make full and frank disclosure. For purposes of the
                    present discussion, at the application stage, the distinction between questions
                    of jurisdiction and questions of the merits of the plaintiff’s claim must
                    be appreciated. The jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> principles
                    allow the <em>in rem</em> plaintiff to arrest the
                    defendant’s vessel to obtain security based on the plaintiff’s
                        <em>best arguable case</em> (see <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em> at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above),
                    rather than with the question “who is likely to win”. The line of
                    authorities show that at the application stage, an <em>in
                        rem</em> plaintiff is required to show that the claim falls within one
                    of the heads of claim listed in s 3(1) rather than the strength of the
                    claim <em>and</em> that there is <em>no</em> onus on the in <em>rem</em> plaintiff to
                    go further at that early stage to show that the claim is likely to succeed
                        <em>so long as it cannot be said that the action is an abuse
                        of process or that it is so obviously frivolous and vexatious as to be open
                        to summary dismissal</em>. What this means and amounts to is that in
                    typically Situation 1 cases, the <em>in rem</em>
                    plaintiff is <em>generally</em> not required to go to the
                    merits of the claim at the application stage. Undoubtedly, there may be many
                    points which would be relevant to the ultimate merits of an action, but which
                    could not on any reasonable view affect the court in deciding whether to grant
                    the application for a warrant of arrest. Thus, defences to the claim such as
                    exclusion clauses and Hague Visby Rules defences go to the merits of the claim,
                    not to jurisdiction, and they need not be disclosed as they are not material to
                    the grant or refusal of the <em>ex parte</em>
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Rajah JA approved in [49] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> the various legal propositions
                    summarised in <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> at
                    pp 45-46 and that included endorsing the proposition in <em>The St Elefterio</em> that at the interlocutory stage <em>save for frivolous claims</em>, the <em>in
                        rem</em> plaintiff need not establish at the outset that he has a
                    cause of action sustainable in law, and neither the existence of a good defence
                    to a claim would negate the court’s admiralty jurisdiction. Enlarging the
                    duty to disclose plausible defences would effectively let in an aspect of
                    considering the merits of the claim by the backdoor after agreeing with the
                    aforementioned principles in <em>The St Elefterio</em> and
                    that could not have been intended by Rajah JA. In my view, the non-disclosure of
                    defences that the defendant could raise at the trial in answer to the
                    plaintiff’s claim (as that pertains to the ultimate merits of the action
                    and the question of who is likely to win), are <em>generally</em> not characterised as a failure to give full and frank
                    disclosure <em>unless</em> (and this is the qualification
                        (<em>ie</em> Situation 2) mentioned in <em>The St Elefterio</em> (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above)) they <em>are matters that show up
                        the claim as an abuse of process, or one that it is so obviously frivolous
                        and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal and, on any reasonable
                        view, their omission, at the application stage, is tantamount to or
                        constitutes an abuse of process</em>. From a broader perspective,
                    failure to disclose matters showing that the claim or arrest should not have
                    been brought at all, are material facts that constitute the abuse of process.
                    Simply put, <em>they constitute matters of such weight that their
                        omission is likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its
                        discretionary power of arrest</em> (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     A strong and direct pointer in support of the
                    view subscribed comes from the specific example given in [87] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>. Immediately following the
                    sentence stating that the duty to disclose extends to only “plausible,
                    and not all conceivable or theoretical, defences”, Rajah JA followed
                    up with an example of plausible defences that would constitute material facts
                    that have to be disclosed since they would have a “bearing on the
                    decision-making process or outcome of the original application” to issue
                    a warrant of arrest (at [88]) and are also “reasonable in the given
                    circumstances at the time of the arrest” (at [90]). Rajah JA’s
                    illustration found at [87] is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if there have been unsuccessful prior proceedings, the context as
                        well as the reasons for the dismissal must be adequately disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Putting that example into a legal framework,
                    it is of a party seeking to arrest a vessel or sister ship in respect of the
                    same claim in one jurisdiction after another, and it might well be an abuse of
                    the arrest process to permit a second arrest. Rajah JA’s example is
                    drawn from the factual circumstances leading to the arrest and subsequent
                    release of the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> by the Lomé court, and
                    more pointedly, their relevance to the question of whether the sister ship
                    arrest in Singapore in respect of the same claim could in any way be regarded as
                    an abuse of the arrest process and hence oppressive. In that case, the second
                    arrest, including the issue as to whether the bringing of the action based on
                    the same claim as in the Lomé proceedings, was an abuse. It is not always the
                    case that the mere fact that a plaintiff has arrested a vessel which has
                    previously been released by order of a court of competent jurisdiction will
                    amount to an abuse of the arrest process (see for example, <em>The Blue Fruit</em> [1979-1980] SLR(R) 238). A lot depends
                    on the circumstances, and that is what the court will want to know at the
                    application stage. It is for the arresting party to explain fully the propriety
                    of the second arrest, and show that the second arrest is not an abuse of the
                    arrest process. In short, the court will want to know whether it is oppressive
                    and vexatious to re-arrest. Obviously, if the application to arrest is proper,
                    an abuse of process argument cannot be founded on the basis that the
                    consequences of the proper application may produce an oppressive result. The
                    non-disclosures in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>, in a
                    nutshell, were with the question of vexatiousness arising from the Lomé
                    proceedings, and the arrest was an abuse of process and unjustly oppressive. The
                    present case is very different (see <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the context of the facts of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>, the problems in the
                    background for the banks in the arrest application, and of which AR Lee was
                    unaware of, were the Lomé court’s (a) finding that sufficient security had
                    been provided for the loss and damage to cargo claims; and (b) finding in
                    FESCO’s favour on the very same claims that were being pursued in
                    Singapore against a sister ship. The clear stipulation in the relevant bills
                    naming Lomé as the port of discharge, and the objective behind the proposal to
                    switch bills was to change the port of discharge, but no switch materialised in
                    the end. Certainly, they were matters that showed the breach of contract claim
                    to be without foundation. All those facts were found by the Court of Appeal to
                    be material facts and circumstances that ought to be disclosed as they made it
                    difficult for the banks to apply to court for a warrant of arrest on the
                    reasonable basis that there was valid breach of the contracts of carriage
                    contained in the relevant bills. The banks were aware of all those facts, but
                    went before the court in effect on the basis that there was no issue or problem
                    as to the banks’ rights to claim in contract. The Court of Appeal held
                    that this basis was not in fact the case, and it was something that was either
                    known or ought to have been appreciated. The failure of disclosure could not be
                    regarded as proceeding from a mere oversight or from a pardonable mistake as a
                    result of haste. In the light of the decision of the Lomé court, it would be an
                    abuse of the arrest process for the banks to arrest again by re-running the same
                    claim for breach of contract which had already been determined in FESCO’s
                    favour at the <em>inter partes</em> hearing in
                Lomé.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Quite clearly, the arrest of the <em>Vasiliy Golovnin</em> in Singapore was based on obviously
                    frivolous and vexatious claims (“really implausible claims”)
                    having regard to the fact that the Lomé court ordered the release of the
                        <em>Chelyabinsk</em> after an <em>inter
                        partes</em> hearing that found, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the discharge of the cargo at Lomé was pursuant to the
                    contract of carriage that named the port of discharge as Lomé. The first arrest
                    of the <em>Chelyabinsk</em> in Lomé and the decision of the
                    Lomé court would have a “material bearing on the decision making process
                    or the outcome of the original application” (see [88] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>). Not only were the prior Lomé
                    proceedings and outcome considered as material facts, the objective for the
                    proposed switch of the bills of lading was also important. On the prior
                    proceedings, Rajah JA observed (at [99]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that the Lomé court had already considered and dismissed the
                        Banks’ arguments as to whether the chartered vessel could be arrested
                        by the Banks at Lomé was, certainly, a material fact to be taken into
                        account by AR Lee in considering whether or not a warrant of arrest of the
                            <em>Vasiliy Golovnin</em> should be issued here in
                        Singapore. He would have in all likelihood have pursued this line of enquiry
                        further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Again at [100], Rajah JA made the same
                    point:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the Banks had been frank in their disclosure to the court about the
                        existence of the prior <em>inter partes</em> hearing
                        (and its outcome), the court may “well have required further
                        clarification on the situation before deciding to issue the warrant”
                        (per Judith Prakash J in <em>The AA V</em> (at
                        [47]). This would certainly have allowed AR Lee to make a more informed
                        decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It must always be remembered that the
                    court’s twin concerns at the application stage, are with (a) questions of
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> (as explained in <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above), and (b) that its power of arrest is
                    not being abused or misused (and this is where the duty to make full and frank
                    disclosure is germane). The twin concerns are noted by Hunter J in
                        <em>The Harima</em> [1987] 1 HKC 397 at 405
                    in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that on an application for a warrant under O 75
                        r 5 [our O 70 r 4] the court’s first concern is to see
                        whether the facts alleged prima facie bring the plaintiff within one or
                        other of the relevant subsections in s 20(2) [our s 3(1) of
                        HCAJA]. That is the main purpose of the filtering process established by
                        r 5. It also concerned at that stage, with the absence of any other
                        facts which might show that the power is being abused or misused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Likewise, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Harima</em> quoted with approval Clough J
                    in <em>The Cynthia G</em> (1985, unreported) on the twin
                    concerns of the court at the application stage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst it is not for the plaintiff to prove his case when he applies for
                        the issue of a warrant of arrest in an action in rem but only to comply with
                        O 75 r 5(4), it seems to me that <em>it is the duty
                            of the registrar when presented with an affidavit of the
                            plaintiff’s solicitor acting on his client’s instructions
                            and expressing grounds of belief required under O 75 r 5(8),
                            to inquire into any matter coming to the registrars notice that gives
                            rise to doubts as to whether the grounds for belief expressed are
                            genuinely those of both the plaintiff and of the solicitor acting for
                            him. Otherwise the way would be open for abuse</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The duty to make full and frank disclosure at
                    the application stage is, as Prakash J reminded in <em>The
                        Rainbow Spring (CA)</em>, the bulwark against abuse of the arrest
                    process. <em>The Cynthia G</em> aptly illustrates this
                    principle of abuse of the arrest process. In <em>The Cynthia
                        G</em>, the plaintiff there arrested the vessel for unpaid bunkers and
                    lubricating oil that were on board and sold together with the <em>Cynthia G</em>. After the sale, ownership of the <em>Cynthia G</em> was registered in Huofung Maritime &amp; Enterprises
                    (Panama) Incorporated (“Huofung”). For purposes of the arrest,
                    evidence was adduced that the <em>Cynthia G</em> was
                    beneficially owned by Huofung. One week later, the plaintiff applied for a
                    second warrant of the <em>Cynthia G</em> to recover unpaid
                    bunker and lubricating oil that were on board and sold together with the
                        <em>Marcia</em>. The registered owner of the <em>Marcia</em> was Ocean Venture Shipping Co SA (“Ocean
                    Venture”). It was therefore necessary for the plaintiff to adduce
                    evidence that the <em>Cynthia G</em> and <em>Marcia</em> were sister ships. The <em>Marcia</em> was not nominally owned by Huofung. The plaintiff in the
                    second arrest alleged that Huofung and Ocean Venture were nominees of a third
                    party, and this third party was the true beneficial owner. On the application
                    for the second arrest of the <em>Cynthia G</em>, the
                    plaintiff did not disclose that it had a week earlier put before the court
                    evidence that Huofung was the beneficial owner. The inconsistent allegations
                    were found to be material facts and the failure to disclose the inconsistent
                    allegations was tantamount to an abuse of the arrest process. Had the Registrar
                    hearing the application been told of the previous inconsistent allegation on
                    ownership, he might not have been satisfied that jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> had been established. The non-disclosure was significant
                    as it related to a matter on which the jurisdiction to bring the action
                        <em>in rem</em> was based.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     To summarise, in the light of the low
                    threshold of the merits enquiry (<em>ie</em>, typically
                    Situation 1 as in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above), the
                    omission to refer to defences on the merits which the defendant may seek to
                    raise in opposition of the plaintiff’s claim would <em>not</em> generally be characterised as a failure to make full and
                    frank disclosure. This is the position so long as it cannot be said that the
                    action is an abuse of process, or that it is obviously frivolous and vexatious
                    so as to be open to summary dismissal. Once this tipping point exists (as was
                    the case in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>), there will
                    be matters (factual and/or legal) which are of such weight as to deliver the
                    “knock out blow” to the claim summarily, and their omission is
                    likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its discretionary powers
                    of arrest, then these matters are material facts that will have to be disclosed
                        (<em>ie</em>, Situation 2 as in <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). Equally, a failure to disclose facts
                    which constituted the abuse of the arrest process would be ground for
                    discharging or setting aside the warrant, whether under Situations 1 or 2 (see
                        <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>, <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> and <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> and instances
                    of abuse of the arrest process at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> above). It is for the arresting
                    party to bring out the material facts to the court’s attention and show
                    that what is being done by an application for a warrant of arrest does not
                    constitute abuse of the arrest process. This duty to make full and frank
                    disclosure stems from the application of the principle that if the plaintiff
                    knew or ought to have known of matters which might reasonably caused the court
                    to inquire or have doubts as to whether or not to issue the warrant of arrest
                    these matters are material and should be disclosed; otherwise “the way
                    would be open for abuse” of the court’s power of arrest (see
                        <a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Paragraph [88] of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> warns against the “meticulous
                    dissection of the factual matrix to ‘invent’ missing material
                    facts”. Each case is fact-sensitive in terms of material facts advanced
                    for consideration by the court. As Rajah JA observed, applying common
                    sense, the scope of disclosure is based on “what is reasonable in the
                    given circumstances at the time of the arrest” (at [90]) The Court of
                    Appeal found the material non-disclosures there “indefensible” (at
                    [107]), and rightly so, since on the facts the tipping point was reached and
                    there was <em>equally</em> a clear failure to disclose
                    facts which constituted the abuse and was thus, ground for setting aside the
                    warrant of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RA 178 of 2009: discussions and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As stated earlier, Capital Gate applied to set
                    aside the warrant of arrest only on the ground of non-disclosure of material
                    facts. Before I deal with the non-disclosure argument in detail, I propose, for
                    completeness, to comment on Mr Tan’s assertion on the need to show a
                    good arguable case on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No arguable case on the merits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Mr Tan argued that <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em> required the plaintiff to show a good
                    arguable case on the merits at the application stage, and at the challenge stage
                    (hereafter referred to collectively as “the interlocutory stage”).
                    The plaintiff’s claim was allegedly premature, and as such the plaintiff
                    had no “good arguable case” on the substantive merits of its
                    claim. Mr Tan pointed out that, at the time of the arrest, the head owner
                    had not commenced legal proceedings or arbitration against the plaintiff nor
                    demanded security. In fact, it was the plaintiff who forced the issue by
                    commencing arbitration against the head owner. Furthermore, Mr Tan also
                    argued that the plaintiff had no “good arguable case” because, by
                    virtue of cl 90 read with cl 102 of the May sub-charter, the defendant
                    was exonerated from liability as such grounding damage would fall to be covered
                    under the vessel’s customary policies, particularly its hull and machinery
                    policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     On the other hand, Ms Ang denied that the
                    plaintiff was under any duty to show that it had a “good arguable
                    case” on the substantive merits of the case at the interlocutory stage.
                    This was because the intervener was not challenging the plaintiff’s claim
                    on jurisdictional grounds in that the claim fell under s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA. There was also no application to strike
                    out the writ <em>in rem</em> and action under O 18
                    r 19. Ms Ang averred that the plaintiff’s claim against the EP
                    Carriers was not dependent on the plaintiff being found liable to the head owner
                    in the arbitration between the latter and the plaintiff. The presence of
                    cl 90 in the May sub-charter of itself did not prevent the plaintiff from
                    having a “good arguable case”. It was pointed out that the
                    effectiveness of cl 90 as a defence could not be resolved at the
                    interlocutory stage as there were issues to be determined before the effect of
                    cl 90 is known. In any case, in the present action, there was an
                    arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant which the
                    plaintiff intended to rely on. Therefore, this court was urged to take care not
                    to trespass into the merits of the claim, an issue intended for the arbitration
                    tribunal to determine. I pause here to mention that it was not necessary to deal
                    with the arbitration point in the light of my analysis of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     For the reasons stated in [39] to [48], there
                    was no substance in Mr Tan’s assertions. As explained above, his
                    understanding of what <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    stood for was incorrect. To summarise, first, the jurisdictional challenge in
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em> was based on
                    s 3(1) of the HCAJA, and any reference to a “good arguable
                    case” yardstick must be understood in that context. Apart from that,
                    Mr Tan accepted in the course of arguments, and rightly so, that
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) of the HCAJA was not in issue
                    in the present case. Second, and more generally, the Court of Appeal did not
                    change the law on s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA
                    which has its equivalent in jurisdictions like England and Hong Kong. As stated
                    previously, <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> was
                    concerned with Situation 2. The bank’s claim was so obviously
                    frivolous and vexatious, and it was struck out for that reason alone under
                    O 18 r 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. In
                    contrast, the present case is a Situation 1 case. There was no question
                    that, in the present case, the statutory requirements under
                        s 3(1)(<em>h</em>) and s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA were satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Turning to the related argument that the
                    plaintiff’s claim was premature, I agreed with Ms Ang that
                    Mr Tan’s contention was untenable. Firstly, although Mr Tan
                    argued that the plaintiff’s claim for an indemnity was premature, it is
                    telling that Capital Gate did not separately apply to strike out the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> and action under O 18 r 19 or
                    under the inherent jurisdiction of the court on the ground that there was
                        <em>no subsisting</em> cause of action. Inferentially,
                    the intervener accepted that there was a <em>prima
                        facie</em> cause of action as it was not suggesting that the action
                    was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise an abuse of process. Secondly, the cause
                    of action was not inchoate at the time the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> was issued. Once there is a <em>prima
                        facie</em> breach of the May sub-charter, the plaintiff has a cause of
                    action against the defendant. Thirdly, although the May sub-charter was back to
                    back with the head charter, the plaintiff’s claim for an indemnity was
                    founded on breach of the May sub-charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Turning to the facts before me, the defendant
                    had contracted with the plaintiff and was required to observe cl 6 of the
                    May sub-charter on safe port/berth which read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That the cargo or cargoes be laden and/or discharged in any dock or at any
                        wharf or place or anchorage that Charterers [the defendant] or their Agents
                        may direct, provided the vessel can safely lie always afloat at any time of
                        tide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Besides cl 6, the employment clause in the May sub-charter (cl 8)
                    obliges the master to follow the instructions and orders of the
                    charterer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The plaintiff’s case is that the
                    defendant was in breach of the May sub-charter in that the <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em> was damaged because the defendant had chosen an unsafe
                    port/berth. Repairs were carried out by the head owner in Hong Kong. According
                    to The Swedish Club, the head owner had notified EP Carriers of the repairs made
                    to <em>TS Bangkok</em> and that surveyors on behalf of EP
                    Carriers had duly attended the damage surveys carried out in connection with the
                    repairs. In short, the grounding damage was notified to the defendant and its
                    liability insurers. The head owner back then in 2008, gave notice of its repair
                    claim amounting to US$ 481,572.19. Since then, the head owner has indicated an
                    additional claim for loss of hire in its defence and counterclaim filed in
                    arbitration on 18 May 2009. In any back to back charters, the head
                    charterer/disponent owner in the position of the plaintiff is
                    “sandwiched” between the head owner and the sub-charterer. It is
                    not uncommon that the head charterer/disponent owner, out of pragmatism,
                    suggests to the sub-charterer to take over from the head charterer/disponent
                    owner the conduct of answering the head owner’s claim. It was no different
                    here but the plaintiff‘s practical requests was not taken up as was the
                    prerogative of the sub-charterer. Obviously, each charter is a separate contract
                    with different contracting parties, and it is for the plaintiff to prove at the
                    trial that the <em>TS Bangkok</em> was damaged because the
                    defendant breached the safe port/berth clause, and liability would lie solely
                    with the defendant. So far as the cause of action is concerned, the plaintiff
                    has shown a <em>prima facie</em> case of breach of the May
                    sub-charter. The plaintiff’s claim for damages is for breach of cl 6
                    and the further claim for indemnity is for consequential loss arising from the
                    breach. In short, the relief sought is founded on a <em>prima
                        facie</em> breach of cl 6 of the May sub-charter arising from the
                    orders given under cl 8 of the May sub-charter and damage was sustained as
                    a consequence of complying with the defendant’s orders as charterer. The
                    indemnity claim here is distinguishable from <em>The Caroline
                        P</em> [1985] 1WLR 553, which has to do with the nature of
                    the indemnity to be implied when an owner’s agent was required under the
                    terms of the charterparty to sign bills of lading as presented. I agree with the
                    sentiments expressed by Mr Geoffrey Brice QC sitting as Deputy Judge in
                        <em>The Catherine Helen</em> [1998]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 that it would be a commercially strange result
                    that the head charterer/disponent owner has to wait until the head owner’s
                    claim is ascertained before the head charterer/disponent owner’s right to
                    claim indemnity from the sub-charter can arise. After all back to back charters
                    are not uncommon commercial transactions and the passing on to the sub-charterer
                    of the head owner’s potential claims against the head charterer/disponent
                    owner are events that do occur and are within the reasonable contemplation of
                    the parties. In the present case, at the time the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> was filed, there had been clear intimation from The Swedish
                    Club of the head owner’s claim based on what it knew and anticipated. More
                    importantly, the cause of action for breach of the May sub-charter had come into
                    existence at the time the writ <em>in rem</em> was
                    filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I now come to the other related argument which
                    is whether the defendant would be liable in an action <em>in
                        personam</em> as the defendant had a good defence to the
                    plaintiff’s claim in law because of cl 90 read with cl 102 of
                    the May sub-charter. Mr Tan’s argument was premised on cl 90
                    being an exclusion clause that effectively exonerates the defendant from
                    liability for grounding damage and consequential losses. Ms Ang denied that
                    cl 90 is a total exclusion clause. She disagreed with Mr Tan that on a
                    construction of cl 90 read with cl 102 of the May sub-charter, the
                    meaning of “customary policies of insurance” is ambiguous. She
                    submitted that it is unclear from the May sub-charter who determines what is
                    “customary” and whose custom is being referred to. It is also
                    unclear who the customary policy is to be taken out by and who it is to benefit.
                    The nature and extent of the indemnity cover under the customary policy is
                    unclear, and in particular, whether it covers damage and consequential loss like
                    loss of hire, and expenses. There was also no express link between cl 102
                    (which requires the owners to insure the vessel and against specified risks) and
                    cl 90 which refers to “customary polices of insurance.” If
                    cl 90 and cl 102 are intended to be linked, it could have been easily
                    provided for in the terms of the May sub-charter. In discussions hereafter, I
                    have proceeded on the assumption (without deciding the point) that cl 90 is
                    to be read with cl 102 as argued by Mr Tan and taking his case at the
                    highest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     So far as cl 90 is concerned, the clause
                    does not purport to transfer the sole risk of all loss or damage to the vessel
                    to the plaintiff. It is not entirely clear based on the wording of cl 90
                    what risks have been passed to the owners and what risks to the charterer. The
                    position here is to be contrasted with <em>Norwich City Council v
                        Harvey</em> [1989] 1 WLR 219 where it was clear that the
                    first part of the clause in question transferred the entire risk of damage by
                    fire and other stipulated listed risks to the building to the
                owners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As stated, I agreed with Ms Ang that
                    cl 90 is ambiguous. Furthermore, having regard to the wording of
                    cl 102 which imposed on the owner the obligation to insure, it is clear
                    that a mere obligation to insure does not render and make the clause an
                    exclusion clause (see <em>Wisma Development v Sing-The Disc Shop
                        Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 749).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Even if, for the sake of argument, cl 90
                    is an exclusion clause, the defendant has to show that it is an effective
                    exclusion clause in that the grounding was fortuitous, and the incident was an
                    insured peril within the meaning and scope of “customary policies of
                    insurance”. These are matters to be resolved at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In the light of the low threshold of the
                    merits enquiry, the merits of the claim in the present case were not called into
                    question, there being no question of want of jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> nor suggestion that the claim was frivolous, vexatious or
                    otherwise an abuse of the court. As such, Mr Tan’s contention that
                    the plaintiff needed to establish its case beyond the low threshold must fail.
                    In the present case, the person who “would be liable” on <em>The St Elefterio in personam</em> test was clearly the
                    defendant. Mr Tan’s submission that the warrant of arrest be set
                    aside on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to establish a good arguable
                    case on the merits of its case, at the application and challenge stage, was
                    plainly without basis and was untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Non-disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     I now turn to the arguments on non-disclosure
                    of material facts. I will deal with the facts alleged to be material and not
                    disclosed in turn. The intervener, Capital Gate, had accused the plaintiff of
                    failing to disclose the following material information to AR Loo:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_a"></a>(a)     The May sub-charter contained
                        cll 90 and 102 and that cl 90 as a defence was raised by the
                        plaintiff in answer to the head owner’s claim, and the latter’s
                        claim had not commenced against the plaintiff at the time of the arrest
                        (“Disclosure (a)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_b"></a>(b)     EP Carriers had liability cover with QBE
                        (“Disclosure (b)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_c"></a>(c)     No arbitration proceedings had in fact been
                        commenced against EP Carriers at the material time (“Disclosure
                        (c)”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff, in Originating Summons No 238 of 2009 (“OS
                        238/2009”), only sought leave to continue with the <em>in rem</em> action but did not obtain leave to bring arbitration
                        proceedings against EP Carriers (“Disclosure (d)”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_e"></a>(e)     The leave
                        obtained in OS 238/2009 was pursuant to an <em>ex
                            parte</em> application when the rules of court called for the
                        application to be made <em>inter partes</em>
                        (“Disclosure (e)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     So far as Disclosure (a) is concerned,
                    Ms Ang submitted that: (i) cl 90 was indeed disclosed; (ii) it was not
                    necessary to disclose cl 90 since it was not a material fact; and (iii)
                    this court should, in any case, exercise its discretion not to set aside the
                    arrest in view of the circumstances of the case. The plaintiff also did not
                    agree that the defendant’s liability with QBE had to be disclosed as such
                    cover did not amount to security for the plaintiff’s claim. In fact,
                    disclosures (b) to (e) are irrelevant, and one views them as attempts by the
                    intervener to “invent missing material facts” to bolster the
                    non-disclosure. It was alleged that the plaintiff had pointed out that
                    arbitration may be commenced between the plaintiff and the defendant in OS
                    238/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Disclosure (a): Premature indemnity claim and cl 90
                exclusion clause</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Mr Tan argued that the plaintiff had
                    failed at the application stage to sufficiently disclose that the
                    plaintiff’s claim for an indemnity was premature; it was a premature
                    action because the claim for indemnity was in respect of an alleged liability to
                    the head owner of <em>TS Bangkok</em> who had not, at the
                    time of the arrest of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>,
                    commenced legal proceedings or arbitration against the plaintiff. The plaintiff
                    should have disclosed, so the argument developed, the status of the head
                    owner’s claim and whether proceedings had been brought or not.
                    Furthermore, the plaintiff did not disclose that it was disputing the claim
                    against the head owner, and that cl 90 was raised as a defence to the head
                    owner’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I have explained in <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>-<a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> above my reasons
                    for rejecting Mr Tan’s contention that the plaintiff’s claim
                    was premature. The cause of action was not inchoate so much so that the
                    suggestion that there was no jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>
                    was incorrect and misconceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I have also explained in <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>-<a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>
                    above my reasons why the argument that cl 90 read with cl 102 of the
                    May sub-charter (reproduced in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above)
                    amounts to an exclusion clause is not free from ambiguity. As such, it is not a
                    matter that could be readily and summarily resolved from a mere construction of
                    the clauses without further proof of facts in issue. That is a significant point
                    to note in the non-disclosure argument. Since the alleged non-disclosure of
                    cl 90 read with cl 102 depended upon it being clearly an exclusion
                    clause, or a clause that afforded the defendant a complete defence to the
                    plaintiff s claim, and given the fact that the character of the cl 90
                    was plainly in issue and cannot be readily and summarily resolved, it would be,
                    in my view, certainly inappropriate to set aside the warrant of arrest for
                    non-disclosure of cl 90 alone, or read together with
                cl 102.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The intervener had emphasised that the
                    plaintiff was obviously aware of cl 90 as the plaintiff used this clause
                    against the head owner’s claims as evidenced by the fax dated
                    6 October 2008 sent by the UK P&amp;I Club to The Swedish Club. Therefore,
                    it was the plaintiff’s duty to disclose in the affidavits leading the
                    warrant of arrest that it had used cl 90 against the head owner. The
                    plaintiff’s first line of opposition against the intervener’s
                    allegation that cl 90 was not disclosed was that the clause was indeed
                    brought to the attention of AR Loo by Mr Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    As previously mentioned, AR Loo’s
                    minute sheet from the hearing of 27 February 2009 consisted of only three
                    short paragraphs on ownership and made no mention of cl 90 (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above ). AR Loo’s minutes were not
                    verbatim notes of the hearing judging from the fact that Mr Ng attended
                    before AR Loo for over an hour. Ms Ang submitted that AR Loo had
                    simply noted down what he regarded as important matters. Mr Ng, who
                    attended before AR Loo, set out in a subsequent affidavit, filed on
                    19 May 2009, that cl 90 was brought orally to AR Loo’s
                    attention. In that affidavit, Mr Ng affirmed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Thereafter, I referred AR Loo to the matters
                            set out in Li’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit. In
                            particular, I brought AR Loo through paragraphs 1 to 11 of
                            Li’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit, and the exhibits
                            thereto, including the letter from the UK P&amp;I Club to the Swedish
                            Club of 6 October 2008 at page 14, where the Plaintiffs had raised
                            certain queries with the Head Owners on the merits of the Head
                            Owners’ claim including amongst other things the applicability of
                            clause 90 of the charterparty between the Head Owners and the
                            Plaintiffs. In this regard, I emphasized that notwithstanding the
                            Plaintiffs’ position vis-à-vis the Head Owners the Plaintiffs were
                            entitled, as against the Defendants, to security for their best arguable
                            case and that the Plaintiffs believed that they had a good arguable case
                            on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Clause 90 was not mentioned in the text
                    of the affidavits leading the warrant of arrest. The clause was referred to in
                    one of the exhibits (the letter of 6 October 2008 sent by the
                    plaintiff’s UK P&amp;I Club to The Swedish Club) to the Li’s
                        2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). In this case, the plaintiff’s position was
                    that Mr Ng had pointed out and explained cl 90 to AR Loo. The
                    problem with leaving information to oral arguments and submissions, however, is
                    one of proof, especially, in circumstances where AR Loo’s notes were
                    not verbatim notes. To my mind, a supplementary affidavit recording the
                    disclosure of cl 90 to AR Loo ought to been filed soon after the
                    hearing. Such an affidavit would have certainly carried more weight than the one
                    now filed on the very day RA 178 was listed for hearing. Even with the best
                    will in the world, Mr Ng’s late affidavit coming after the AR’s
                    decision on Summons 1777 was bound to lack some objectivity. In any case, it was
                    not necessary to resort to Mr Ng’s affidavit in the light of my
                    analysis of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em> and my
                    conclusion on the materiality of cl 90 and observations in <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Tan had relied on <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin(CA)</em> for the proposition that cl 90
                    must be disclosed as it was a complete defence to the plaintiff’s claim.
                    It followed, so the argument developed, that the plaintiff did not have an
                    arguable case on the merits against the defendant. In relation to cl 90,
                    the first point is whether cl 90 is an exclusion clause, and second, if it
                    was an exclusion clause, did it give the defendant a plausible defence to the
                    plaintiff’s claim so that it must be disclosed in the affidavit leading
                    the warrant of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Tan’s mechanistic argument
                    that defences to the claim so long as they are plausible (not conceivable or
                    theoretical) have to be disclosed is misconceived for the reasons explained. In
                    the light of the low threshold of the merits enquiry applicable to the facts of
                    the present case, the merits of the claim were not called into question in the
                    context of an application for a warrant of arrest so much so that the omission
                    to refer to cl 90 of the May sub-charter (assuming cl 90 is an
                    exclusion clause) would not be characterised as a failure to make full and frank
                    disclosure. It followed that the factual evidence - that UK P&amp;I Club in its
                    fax of 6 October 2008 raised cl 90 in purported response to the head
                    owner’s claim for grounding damage (assuming that was the intention) -
                    need not be disclosed. It was not information that was material to the exercise
                    of AR Loo’s function and discretion, and it need not be disclosed to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Even if I had concluded that the omission of
                    cl 90 and the plaintiff’s reliance on the same clause in the UK
                    P&amp;I Club’s fax of 6 October 2008 to The Swedish Club were facts
                    that ought to have been disclosed to AR Loo as they were material to
                    AR Loo’s decision whether or not to issue the warrant of arrest, I
                    would still decline to set aside the warrant of arrest because I would have
                    regarded such a step as a disproportionate response to the omission for the
                    following reasons taken cumulatively. A court may in a proper case refuse to set
                    aside an arrest even if it was found that there was non-disclosure of material
                    information (see <em>The Fierbinti</em> [1994]
                    3 SLR(R) 574).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I accepted the plaintiff’s submission
                    that it did not intentionally set out to omit mentioning cll 90 and 102 in
                    the body of the affidavits leading to the warrant of arrest. I noted that, given
                    the ambiguity of cl 90, the character of the clause was plainly in issue.
                    It must be remembered that it was not the intervener’s case that the
                    action <em>in rem</em> was frivolous or vexatious or
                    otherwise an abuse of process. As such, it could not be said (and it was not
                    said) that cl 90 read with cl 102 was a clear and obvious defence to
                    show up the claim as frivolous and vexatious. That said, the tenor of the UK
                    P&amp;I Club’s fax dated 6 October 2008 sent on behalf of the
                    plaintiff indicated that the raising of cll 90 and 102 were tentative and
                    even speculative rather than with a solid amount of conviction. At that stage,
                    the plaintiff had no information on the grounding damage as evidenced by the
                    fact that, in the same communication, the UK P&amp;I Club requested more
                    information on the incident, damage and repairs made to <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em>. Not unexpectedly, one month later, the head owner
                    roundly rejected cl 90 and its validity as a defence to the head
                    owner’s claim. Above all, after cl 90 was raised by the UK P&amp;I
                    Club until the time of arrest, the circumstances had changed. The events that
                    unfolded painted the picture of the defendant walking away from the claim. I
                    start at the time when the plaintiff passed on the claim to the defendant by
                    seeking damages against it (on 10 November 2008), and it never raised the
                    two clauses again, and for good reason. According to The Swedish Club, the
                    defendant was aware of the grounding incident involving <em>TS
                        Bangkok</em> and the extent of the damage. Surveyors representing the
                    defendant’s insurers attended the repairs at Hong Kong. On the
                    defendant’s part, it did not deny the validity of the plaintiff’s
                    claim against it, nor raised cll 90 and 102 at all. The first time
                    cl 90 was raised was in early March 2009 after the arrest of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>. However, that event is not crucial. Of
                    importance were the events before the arrest which on any reasonable view of the
                    defendant’s conduct could be interpreted as evincing an intention to
                    defeat what appeared to be a genuine claim the defendant was well aware of
                    through a change of ownership of the vessel, and the liquidation of EP Carriers.
                    According to TSL, EP Carriers had carried out a writ search on 23 December
                    2008 to find out if there were any <em>in rem</em> writs
                    filed against the <em>Eagle Prestige</em>. The writ search
                    did not reveal the plaintiff’s writ in this action filed on
                    2 December 2008. The vessel’s ownership changed on 22 December
                    2008, and the defendant was placed in provisional liquidation by way of a
                    creditors’ voluntary winding up on 17 February 2009 (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> to <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above). Between 10 November 2008 and 27 February 2009, the plaintiff
                    was led to believe that the defendant through QBE would provide security for the
                    plaintiff’s claim. As it turned out, QBE’s assurances that security
                    would be provided were empty promises; they were excuses to buy time for the
                    defendant as well as to stop the plaintiff from arresting the vessel as early as
                    November 2008 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    On the ownership change, the plaintiff found
                    out from a search carried out on 16 February 2009 that on 18 December
                    2008, the Panamanian Registry was requested to issue a provisional patente to
                    effect change of owners of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> to
                    Capital Gate as well as to change the vessel’s name from <em>Eagle Prestige</em> to <em>Engedi</em>.
                    The preliminary registration was done on 22 December 2008 but permanent
                    registration of the ownership had not taken place. If and when completed within
                    six months of the preliminary registration, the permanent registration would be
                    recorded as of the date of preliminary registration <em>ie</em> 22 December 2008. On 18 February 2009, A&amp;G
                    conducted a search against EP Carriers and found that EP Carriers was in
                    provisional liquidation under a creditors’ voluntary winding up and that
                    provisional liquidators had been appointed. It was after the arrest that the
                    then solicitors for the liquidators of EP Carrier entered an appearance and in
                    March 2008 raised cl 90 as a defence. By 13 April 2009, the liquidators of
                    EP Carrier decided that they would no longer deal with the plaintiff’s
                        claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Had
                    the plaintiff entirely relied on QBE’s assurances and been slow in filing
                    a writ <em>in rem</em> against the defendant, it would, for
                    all intents and purposes, have lost its <em>in rem</em>
                    claim against the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> and <em>in personam</em> claim against EP Carriers would be pointless
                    against an insolvent company under creditors’ voluntary winding up. It
                    also appears that the transfer of ownership of <em>the Eagle
                        Prestige</em> was to a company whose director and shareholder was also
                    a director and shareholder of EP Carriers (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> and <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    For those reasons, I was not disposed to set
                    aside the warrant of arrest on the basis of material non-disclosure of
                    cll 90 and 102. The above views regarding the exercise of my discretion
                    also applied to the other allegations of non-disclosure, thereby rendering them
                    irrelevant. I shall, nevertheless, examine them briefly for the sake of
                    completeness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Disclosure (b): QBE liability cover</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In her 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    affidavit of 5 May 2009, TSL had argued that the defendant possessed
                    insurance cover with QBE which covered the defendant against any liability owed
                    to the plaintiff. Upon the liquidation of the defendant, such insurance cover
                    was transferred to and vested in the plaintiff pursuant to the UK Third Parties
                    (Rights against Insurance) Act. As such, the plaintiff possessed adequate
                    security for its claim. In the present action, the intervener argued that such
                    facts were material and were not disclosed at the hearing of 27 February
                    2009. There is nothing in this allegation. How rights under that legislation can
                    amount to security for the plaintiff’s claim is inexplicable. Until there
                    is a judgment against EP Carriers, the legislation has no
                relevance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In a letter from A&amp;G addressed to
                    AsiaLegal dated 30 April 2009 and exhibited in Leona Wong’s third
                    affidavit, filed on 6 May 2009, A&amp;G disputed the adequacies of the
                    policy as security for the plaintiff’s claim on several grounds. There had
                    been no response from the intervener in answer to A&amp;G’s allegation
                    that the policy did not amount to good security. As such, I was of the view that
                    the intervener did not seriously consider that such information was material.
                    This, to my mind, was a belated attempt to “invent missing material
                    facts” and merited no consideration (see <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin(CA)</em> at [88]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Disclosure (c): Commencement of arbitration
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The intervener also alleged that the
                    plaintiff had failed to disclose that no arbitration had, in fact, been
                    commenced against the defendant as of 27 February 2009. While it is true that
                    the plaintiff did not expressly so state, this was implicit from the first
                    arrest affidavit filed by Li Kang-Lin on 27 February 2009. The relevant portions
                    of the affidavit stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    The parties hereto have agreed to refer their
                            disputes to London arbitration. Clause 51 of the Charterparty [Tab
                            1] provides so far as is material as follows: …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    The Plaintiffs are ready, willing and able to refer
                            the disputes to arbitration. The Plaintiffs’ writ herein and
                            application for a Warrant of Arrest are not to be construed as a waiver
                            of their rights to refer their claims and disputes to arbitration in
                            London or a step in the proceedings. The Plaintiffs expressly reserve
                            all their rights under the applicable laws and legislation, including
                            but not limited to the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A)
                            (“IAA”). In particular, the Plaintiffs reserve their
                            rights to commence and pursue arbitration proceedings pursuant to the
                            provisions in the Charterparty as aforesaid and to apply for a stay of
                            the action herein in favour of arbitration in London and for the
                            property arrested to be retained as security or for equivalent security
                            to be provided, pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, it was readily discernible that while there was an
                    arbitration agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, no arbitration
                    had yet been commenced. The intervener’s allegation had no
                merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Disclosure (d): No leave to bring arbitration
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Another baseless allegation was the
                    assertion that there was no disclosure of the fact that leave was not sought to
                    bring arbitration proceedings against the defendant. This was not a material
                    fact which required to be disclosed as no arbitration proceedings had been
                    commenced at the point in time. What was material, at the hearing of
                    27 February 2009 for the purpose of the arrest, was that arbitration was
                    contemplated and that, if so commenced, the vessel would be used as security for
                    the arbitration proceedings. As mentioned above, such an intention was indeed
                    disclosed in the affidavits leading the warrant of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(v)   Disclosure (e): OS 238/2009 – ex parte
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Similarly, the intervener’s argument
                    that the fact that OS 238/2009 was heard <em>ex parte</em>
                    ought to have been, but was not, disclosed was disingenuous. The reasons for the
                    urgency of the hearing were explained to the court hearing the application and
                    it was accepted. Accordingly, this was not a matter that AR Loo needed to
                    take into account in deciding whether to grant the application to arrest the
                        <em>Eagle Prestige</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The intervener’s application to set
                    aside the arrest of the <em>Eagle Prestige</em> was
                    unmeritorious. In the circumstances, the appeal against the order made on
                    13 May 2009 to set aside the warrant of arrest was allowed. Costs of the
                    appeal and below were ordered to be taxed, if not agreed.</p>
