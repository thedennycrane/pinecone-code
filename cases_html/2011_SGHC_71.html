<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the Applicant against the
                    decision (the “Decision”) of the Deputy Registrar of Patents and
                    the Principal Assistant Registrar of Patents (the “Tribunal”)
                    dated 31 December 2009. The Respondent appeals against certain aspects of
                    the Decision as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       For the reasons which follow, I allow the
                    Applicant’s appeal against the Tribunal’s decision in the
                    Respondent’s application for revocation of the Patent (the
                    “Revocation Proceedings”) and dismiss both parties’ appeal
                    and cross-appeal against the Tribunal’s decision relating to the
                    Respondent’s objections to the Applicant’s various sets of
                    amendments to its patent (the “Amendment Proceedings”) except with
                    regard to Claim 42 and consequently Claim 45 in the Proposed 2006 Amendments
                    (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> below for the explanation on this
                    set of amendments).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
                    statutory sections below are to the Patents Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed)
                    (the “Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Applicant is Martek Biosciences Corporation,
                    a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware of the United
                    States of America. The Respondent is Cargill International Trading Pte Ltd, a
                    company incorporated in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Applicant is the proprietor of the Singapore
                    Patent P-No. 49307, entitled “Microbial Oil Mixtures and Use
                    Thereof” (the “Patent”), granted by the Intellectual
                    Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”). It applied for a grant of
                    the Patent on 13 April 1996 under section 116(6) of the Patents Act (Cap.
                    221, 1995 Rev Ed) and was granted the Patent on 10 January
                    2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Application filed two sets of amendments
                    prior to the grant of the Patent. One set is dated 2 July 1997 (the
                    “1997 Amendments”) and the second is dated 13 October 1999
                    (the “1999 Amendments”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 20 January 2006, the Respondent filed an
                    application to revoke the Patent on the following grounds:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That the invention was not a patentable invention
                            under section 80(1)(a) of the Act.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Insufficiency, <em>i.e</em>. the specification of the Patent did not disclose the
                            invention clearly and completely for it to be performed by a person
                            skilled in the art, as required by section 80(1)(c) of the Act;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That the 1999 Amendments disclosed matter in
                            the specification of the Patent beyond that disclosed in the application
                            for the Patent as filed, within the meaning of section 80(1)(d)(i) of
                            the Act.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Applicant filed a counter statement on
                    15 September 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This was accompanied by a copy of proposed
                    amendments to the claims in the Patent (the “Proposed 2006
                    Amendments”) pursuant to section 83 of the Act and Rule 80(3) of the
                    Patents Rules (Cap 221, R1, 1996 Rev Ed) (the “Patents
                    Rules”). This was advertised in The Patents Journal (Issue 200610A) on
                    30 October 2006. During the opposition period allowable, the Respondent
                    filed a notice of opposition to the amendments under section 83(2) of the Act
                    and Rule 85(1) of the Rules. The Respondent alleged that the Proposed 2006
                    Amendments constituted additional subject matter extending beyond the
                    application as originally filed and are therefore not allowable under section
                    84(3)(a) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Applicant obtained leave to file another
                    set of amendments and did so on 19 March 2008 (the “Proposed 2008
                    Amendments”). By a letter dated 27 March 2008, the Respondents
                    objected to these amendments on the ground that they extended the protection
                    conferred by the Patent. Other than this letter, no notice of opposition was
                    received during the allowable opposition period pursuant to the advertisement of
                    the Proposed 2008 Amendments in The Patents Journal on 28 May
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At a Case Management Conference on
                    28 April 2008, the IPOS Hearing Officers informed the parties of their
                    intention to cause the Patent to be re-examined under section 80(2) of the Act.
                    The Respondent followed by filing the request for re-examination under Rule
                    81(1)(a) of the Rules. The Patent was then re-examined by an examiner from the
                    Danish Patent and Trademark Office who then produced a report (the
                    “Re-examination Report”). The Re-examination Report was made
                    available to the parties on 6 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Revocation Proceedings and the Amendment
                    Proceedings were consolidated and heard together by the Tribunal from 16 to
                    18 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Tribunal’s Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In summary, the Tribunal held:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The 1999 Amendments are allowable under
                            s 84, except for claim 30;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The Proposed 2006 and 2008 Amendments contain
                            some claims which do not meet the requirements of
                        s 84;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">All the claims in the Proposed 2006 and 2008
                            Amendments as well as the 1999 Amendments are not
                        patentable;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">All the claims in the Proposed 2006 and 2008
                            Amendments as well as the 1999 Amendments meet the threshold of
                            sufficiency, <em>i.e</em>. disclose the invention
                            clearly and completely for it to be performed by a person skilled in the
                            art.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The Tribunal held accordingly that the Respondent succeeded in its
                    application to revoke the Patent and ordered the Applicant to pay the Respondent
                    its costs to be taxed or agreed save for the costs relating to the
                    Respondent’s witness, Dr Puah Chum Mok.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Patent </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is useful at this point to summarise the
                    Patent and its claims. The invention that is the subject of the Patent is
                    entitled “Microbial Oil Mixtures and Uses Thereof”. The abstract
                    of the invention reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The present invention relates to compositions including blends of
                        microbial oils, methods of using such compositions, particularly as
                        supplements for infant formula, and methods of increasing the amount of long
                        chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in infant formula.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In their opening statements below, both
                    parties explained the structure of polyunsaturated fatty acids
                    (“PUFAs”) and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
                    (“lcPUFAs”). Basically, a PUFA is an unsaturated fatty acid which
                    has at least 2 carbon double bonds in its fatty acid tail. An lcPUFA is a PUFA
                    that additionally has at least 20 carbon atoms in its fatty acid tail.
                    Arachidonic acid (“ARA”), for example, is an example of an lcPUFA
                    in the omega-6 fatty acid family. Docosahexaenoic acid (“DHA”) is
                    an example of an lcPUFA in the omega-3 fatty acid family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prior art</p>

                    referenced as D1 to D35 and T1 to T4. Before me, parties focused particularly on

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respondent’s witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There were two expert witnesses who filed
                    Statutory Declarations on behalf of the Respondent (the applicant below):
                    Dr Puah Chum Mok (“Dr Puah”) and Dr Nga Been Hen
                    (“Dr Nga”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Dr Puah was from the Singapore
                    Polytechnic where, at the time of the hearing below, he headed the Technological
                    Centre for Life Sciences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At the hearing below, the Respondent informed
                    the court of its decision to withdraw Dr Puah from taking the stand despite
                    not withdrawing his Statutory Declaration. The Appellant therefore did not have
                    the opportunity to cross-examine Dr Puah on the evidence in his Statutory
                    Declaration. This was a significant issue before me and I deal with it below at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Dr Nga was from the National University
                    of Singapore Department of Chemistry and, at the time of the hearing below, had
                    38 years of working knowledge in microbial fermentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the proceedings below, the Applicant
                    objected to the admission of Dr Nga’s evidence, on the basis that it
                    was not confined to evidence in reply to Dr Lien’s statutory
                    declaration and therefore prejudicial. The Tribunal held that the Applicant had
                    not suffered any prejudice as it had sufficient opportunity in cross-examination
                    to refute Dr Nga’s evidence (Decision at [44]). The Applicant did not appeal this finding before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the course of his evidence, Dr Nga
                    admitted that he was not an expert in the use of microbial oils in the human
                    diet, that he did not have broad knowledge of general nutrition and was not an
                    expert in the field of paediatric nutrition. He also admitted during
                    cross-examination that his evidence and conclusion on the prior art documents
                    were made with the benefit of hindsight after reading the Patent. The Tribunal
                    thus held that they would be “cautious” about relying on
                    Dr Nga’s evidence because he did not appear to have specific
                    expertise in microbial oils and his conclusions were made with the benefit of
                    hindsight (Decision at [46]). I address
                    the significance of this below at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicant’s witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Two expert witnesses filed Statutory
                    Declarations on behalf of the Applicant: Dr Eric Lien
                    (“Dr Lien”) and Dr David Kyle

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Dr Lien is a consultant to the Applicant
                    since 2005 and is an expert in the areas of dietary fatty acids and proteins and
                    infant formula research. In the Respondent’s submissions below, the
                    Respondent questioned Dr Lien’s objectivity but elected not to
                    challenge his testimony during cross-examination. Dr Lien’s testimony
                    challenging Dr Puah’s construction of the Patent therefore remained
                    unchallenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr Kyle is the sole inventor of the
                    Patent and an expert in micro-organisms and PUFAs found in polar lipids and
                    non-polar lipids. He was employed by the Applicant since 1985 but left in 2001
                    to start his own company and was therefore no longer employed by the Applicant
                    at the time of the hearing below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Tribunal held that, while it accepted the
                    testimonies of Dr Kyle and Dr Lien where they were relevant to the
                    technical issues pertaining to the prior art, it had to scrutinise the
                    testimonies with greater care because of the “increased likelihood of
                    bias”. I will deal with this issue at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As explained above, the Applicant filed four
                    sets of amendments: in 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2008. Only the 1997 Amendments
                    remained unchallenged below. The Tribunal first examined the allowability of
                    each set of amendments before examining the validity of the Patent as amended by
                    each set respectively. It seems to me that a better approach would have been to
                    first examine whether the Patent is valid in the first place and, if it is, then
                    to examine whether the respective sets of amendments are allowable. I thus adopt
                    this approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Respondent does not appeal against the
                    Tribunal’s decision to allow the 1999 Amendments save for claim 30. I will
                    therefore examine the validity of the Patent <em>as amended by
                        the 1999 Amendments</em> (save for claim 30). If it is valid, I will
                    then go on to examine the allowability of the Proposed 2006 Amendments and the
                    Proposed 2008 Amendments respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Validity Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A patent may be revoked on the grounds that
                    the invention is not a patentable invention (section 80(1)(a)) or if the
                    specification of the patent does not disclose the invention clearly and
                    completely for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art (the
                    “Sufficiency” condition) (section 80(1)(c)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     A patentable invention must: (1) be new; (2)
                    involve an inventive step; and (3) be capable of industrial application (s
                    13(1)). I will refer to (1) as the “Novelty” condition and (2) as
                    the “Inventive Step” condition respectively. The Novelty condition
                    is satisfied if the invention “does not form part of the state of the
                    art” (section 14(1)). In order to invalidate the patent, the prior art
                    must disclose clear and ambiguous directions which, if followed, would lead to
                    an infringement of the patent (<em>Muhlbauer AG v Manufacturing
                        Integration Technology Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 724 at
                        [17] (“<em>Muhlbauer</em>”). This question is to be approached as at the
                    date of publication of the prior art rather than <em>ex post
                        facto</em> and each prior art document must be construed separately
                    rather than combined into a mosaic to arrive at the invention (<em>Muhlbauer</em> at [18]). The “Inventive Step” condition is satisfied
                    if the step is “not obvious to a person skilled in the art”
                    (section 15).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Respondent challenges the Patent on the
                    three grounds of Novelty, Inventive Step and Sufficiency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As stated above, I assess these issues based
                    on the Patent as amended by the 1999 Amendments, so all my references are to
                    claims in the 1999 Amendments unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What were the inventive concepts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Applicant’s position is that there
                    are two distinct inventions in the Patent both of which aim to provide an infant
                    formula which is simple, safe, and as effective as human breast milk
                    (“HBM”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The first invention is an infant formula
                    supplement which comprised a blend of two microbial oils, one containing ARA and
                    the second containing DHA. The Applicant claims that the state of the art then
                    was that infant formula supplements should match HBM as closely as possible in
                    both the types and amounts of lcPUFAs present. Contrary to this, the inventor of
                    the Patent discovered that it was unnecessary to match HBM with respect to all
                    lcPUFAS. Rather, supplementation with only ARA and DHA was sufficient to produce
                    an infant formula with the beneficial effects of all the lcPUFAs found in HBM.
                    Thus, the invention was to produce an improved infant formula with a blend of
                    microbial DHA-containing oil and microbial ARA-containing oil, which made it
                    unnecessary to include other lcPUFAs found in HBM (the “First
                    Invention”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The second invention involves a blend of fish
                    oil and a microbial oil containing ARA to produce a supplement for adding
                    lcPUFAs to infant formula. The Applicant claims that the state of the art then
                    was that supplementing infant formula with fish oil was considered to lead to a
                    decreased weight gain in infants. However, according to the Applicant, the
                    precise cause of this effect was not identified, since fish oil contains both
                    DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (“EPA”). The invention was therefore
                    the discovery that the problems of low weight gain associated with fish-oil
                    supplemented infant formula could be overcome by the addition of ARA in the form
                    of microbial oil to the formula (the “Second Invention”). This
                    stemmed from the discovery that it was an excess of EPA that causes the low
                    weight gain problem, by inhibiting the metabolic conversion of linoleic acid
                    (“LOA”) to ARA and that this excess could be overcome by adding
                    ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Findings on the First
                Invention</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Respondent contends that the First
                    Invention is not consistent with the Patent specifications. According to the
                    Respondent, the claims specified in the Patent are not limited to DHA and ARA
                    only but includes other lcPUFAs. The Tribunal agreed, finding at [137] that the
                    Patent was directed instead at providing a process of supplementing infant
                    formula such that the supplemented infant formula would contain PUFAs in amounts
                    comparable to those in HBM. In particular, the Tribunal found that the Patent
                    did not exclude other PUFAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I disagree with the Tribunal on this finding.
                    I accept the Applicant’s submissions that the Patent discloses the First
                    Invention for the reasons which follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     First, a particularly striking feature of this
                    case is the extraordinary state of the evidence before me. The evidence of the
                    Applicant’s expert witnesses was almost completely unchallenged. The
                    Respondent chose not to cross-examine Dr Lien at all, which is
                    extraordinary given that Dr Lien’s evidence extensively rebutted the
                    evidence of the Respondent’s first expert witness Dr Puah. While the
                    Respondent did cross-examine Dr Kyle, it never challenged
                    Dr Kyle’s testimony on the First Invention<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Applicant’s expert
                    testimony that the Patent disclosed the First Invention is therefore entirely
                    unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As far as the Respondent’s
                    experts’ testimony goes, the Respondent chose to withdraw Dr Puah
                    from cross-examination, right before Dr Puah was due to take the stand. In
                    doing so, the Respondent explicitly took the position that Dr Nga’s
                    evidence was sufficient for its case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I will deal with Dr Nga’s evidence
                    in a while, but first I should make it clear that the withdrawal of Dr Puah
                    from cross-examination means that his evidence should bear no weight at all.
                    O 38 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Rules of Court”) makes it clear that a witness’s affidavit
                    will not be received in evidence if he is not cross-examined, except with leave
                    of court. Of course, O 38 r 1(2) applies to actions commenced by writ,
                    not usually to hearings before IPOS. However, in my view O 38 r 1(2)
                    should apply with equal force here, with the witnesses’ statutory
                    declarations analogous to affidavits in a trial. The parties agreed at a Case
                    Management Conference on 6 February 2009 that the Evidence Act would apply
                    to their proceedings<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and implicitly the Rules of
                    Court too by virtue of section 137 of the Evidence Act. In any case,
                    whether in a trial or in IPOS proceedings, it would clearly prejudice the
                    Applicant for the Respondent to refuse to present its main witness for
                    cross-examination, especially at the last minute, and still seek to keep that
                    witness’s statutory declaration on record.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I take cognisance of the Applicant’s
                    argument before me that Rule 80 of the Patents Rules leaves open the procedure
                    of revocation proceedings and therefore it is important for this case to clarify
                    the evidential consequences of irregularities such as the one here. In my view,
                    where parties have clearly agreed to conduct IPOS proceedings like court trials,
                    namely, applying the Evidence Act and the Rules of Court, they must abide by the
                    principles governing court trials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The only evidence in favour of the Respondent,
                    therefore, remains Dr Nga’s. The problem is that Dr Nga’s
                    expertise is not specific to the field involved in this case. Dr Nga
                    admitted under cross-examination that he had no experience in general nutrition,
                    much less paediatric nutrition. His expertise pertained to the genetics of
                    micro-organisms, without possessing specific knowledge of the use of microbial
                    oils in the human diet, specifically the diet of infants. While his evidence
                    cannot be “wholly disregarded” as the Applicant urges, it cannot
                    be denied that the evidence of the Applicant’s witnesses, by virtue of
                    their greater expertise in this field, would be of greater assistance to this
                    court than Dr Nga’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The final picture we have of the evidence
                    before me, therefore, is quite extraordinary. On the one hand, the
                    Applicant’s evidence as to the First Invention is completely unchallenged
                    – by the Respondent’s own election – and on the other hand,
                    the Respondent’s evidence is confined to that of one expert without
                    sufficient expertise in the relevant field. The Respondent argues, of course,
                    that the evidence of the Applicant’s witnesses must be treated with
                    caution because of their alleged bias. In the circumstances of this case, I give
                    no weight to this argument. In <em>Muhlbauer</em> at
                        [46]-[47], the Court of Appeal refused to discount the evidence of
                    one witness on the grounds of apparent bias, because he was one of the actual
                    inventors of the patented machine. The Court of Appeal affirmed that, for the
                    purposes of determining whether the evidence of an expert should be discounted,
                    the relevant test is one of actual partiality rather than apparent partiality.
                    The Respondent did not adduce any evidence of actual partiality here. In fact,
                    the Respondent did not put any allegation of bias at all to Dr Kyle or
                    Dr Lien on the witness stand. Instead, it chose to make its allegations of
                    bias by way of legal submissions, giving Dr Kyle and Dr Lien no
                    opportunity to respond to the same. In any case, even if there is an increased
                    likelihood of bias on the part of an allegedly non-independent witness, it is
                    for the adverse party to challenge his testimony and demonstrate its
                    unreliability. Given that the Respondent has chosen not to challenge the
                    testimony of Dr Lien at all and the testimony of Dr Kyle with regard
                    to the Patent disclosing the First Invention, it is insufficient for the
                    Respondent to merely allege bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There is the “third” source of
                    evidence before me, <em>i.e</em>. the Re-examination
                    Report, which agreed with the Respondent that the Patent did not disclose the
                    First Invention but rather included other lcPUFAs besides ARA and DHA. It is
                    common ground that the Re-examination Report is not binding on this court.
                    Furthermore, the Re-examination Report was made based on the statutory
                    declarations of the various witnesses taken at face value, without taking into
                    account the limitations of Dr Puah’s and Dr Nga’s evidence
                    as subsequently demonstrated during the proceedings. For the reasons I have
                    already analysed above, the Re-examination Report’s value has therefore
                    been greatly diminished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I now turn to my second point, <em>i.e</em>. the objective evidence before the court, in the
                    form of the text of the Patent specification itself. This is the sole basis upon
                    which the Tribunal rejected the Applicant’s submission that the Patent
                    disclosed the First Invention, despite the unusual state of the evidence that I
                    have already highlighted above. If the Tribunal were right in its interpretation
                    of the Patent specification, then it would have been right to reject the
                    Applicant’s submission notwithstanding the expert evidence – a court
                    is always entitled to examine an expert’s evidence based on logic and
                    rationality. However, I could not agree with the Tribunal’s interpretation
                    of the text of the Patent specification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Tribunal found that the Patent
                    specification was inconsistent with the Appellant’s submission that the
                    inventive concept was that only DHA and ARA were needed, based on extracts from
                    the specification such as:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It seems clear enough from the text of Claims
                    1 and 2, at least, that the Patent disclosed the First Invention. Furthermore,
                    Dr Lien testified that a person skilled in the field of infant formula
                    would appreciate from reading the claims and the specification that the
                    preferred oil blend for supplementing infant formula is a blend of only one
                    DHA-containing oil and one ARA-containing oil. The Tribunal appeared to have
                    construed the Patent solely on a piece-meal analysis of the text of the
                    specification, without addressing the text of the claims themselves or the
                    expert evidence as to what a skilled addressee would understand the claims to
                    convey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Furthermore, even the parts of the
                    specification cited above (at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>) are not
                    as damning to the Applicant’s submissions as the Tribunal considered them
                    to be. The stated objective of the Patent, for example, being to “provide
                    a PUFA-enriched additive, the composition of which when added to commercial
                    infant formula will provide <em>desired</em> long chain
                    PUFAs in amounts comparable to the amounts of those PUFAs found in human breast
                    milk” [emphasis added] does not necessarily show that Patent taught the
                    inclusion of as many lcPUFAs present in HBM as possible. Dr Lien gave
                    evidence that the word “desired” indicates that not all lcPUFAs
                    are included in the supplement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The same applies to the fourth
                    passage cited at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Tribunal seems to have been inconsistent
                    in its understanding as to whether the Patent teaches the use of only two
                    microbial oils. At [87] of the Decision,
                    it allowed one of the Proposed 2006 Amendments on the ground that
                    “Example 5 [of the Patent application as originally filed] <em>showed that DHA oil and ARA oil are to be the only lcPUFAs required
                        for the oil blend</em>” [emphasis added]. This would contradict
                    its finding on the inventive concept of the Patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In conclusion, the weight of the evidence
                    shows that the first inventive concept in the Patent was to produce an improved
                    infant formula with a blend of <em>only</em> a microbial
                    DHA-containing oil and a microbial ARA-containing oil, thus making it
                    unnecessary to include as many lcPUFAs present in HBM as possible. It is this
                    inventive concept that we must then test against the requirements of Novelty and
                    Inventive Step.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>Findings on the Second
                Invention</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     With respect to the Second Invention, the
                    dispute between the parties is different. Whereas the first dispute was over
                    whether the First Invention was a proper <em>characterisation</em> of the inventive concept disclosed by the
                    Patent, in this second dispute the Respondent does not challenge the
                    characterisation of the inventive concept. Rather, the Respondent disagrees with
                    the Applicant as to what the state of the art was then. The Respondent contends
                    that the state of the art then already included the knowledge that it was EPA
                    that caused the problem of low weight gain, by inhibiting the conversion of
                    linoleic acid (“LOA”) to ARA, thus rendering the solution provided
                    in the Second Invention obvious. This thus goes to the issues of Novelty and
                    Inventive Step.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Novelty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Tribunal found Claim 1 to be novel, like
                    Claim 1 of the Proposed 2006 Amendments, on the basis that the relevant prior
                    art D1 only discloses a ratio range for omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids, whereas
                    Claim 1 discloses a specific range for ARA:DHA <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> It accordingly found Claim 2 novel
                    too because Claim 2 is similar to Claim 1 except that the second oil stated
                    therein can be selected from any oils instead of from a microbial oil, a fish
                    oil or a vegetable oil, and the ratio range now includes EPA. It presumably
                    found the remaining dependent claims novel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     While the Tribunal was right to hold that the
                    claims in the Patent are novel, I should clarify that it is not the ratio ranges
                    of omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids that should be tested against the requirements of
                    Novelty and Inventive Step but rather the First Invention and Second Invention
                    as characterised above. The Court of Appeal emphasised in <em>Muhlbauer</em> at [40] that
                    in assessing the validity of a patent, the parties and the court must
                    characterise the invention accurately. In <em>Muhlbauer</em>, the tribunal below had erroneously based its analysis
                    of Novelty and Inventive Step on the quantity of pick-up heads in the machine
                    taught by the patent against the machines taught by the respective prior art
                    publications when the enquiry should be really the <em>overall
                        qualitative difference</em> between the respective machines.
                    Similarly, in this case, the Tribunal’s analysis should not therefore have
                    been about ratio ranges disclosed by the Patent against prior publications but
                    whether the First and Second Inventions were novel and contained inventive
                    steps.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As prior publications cannot be assembled into
                    a ‘mosaic’ for the purposes of assessing the novelty of an
                    invention, we must compare the First and Second Inventions against each
                    individual piece of prior art to see if any of them has anticipated the
                    respective inventions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>The First Invention: did any of the prior art
                    teach the use of only an ARA-containing microbial oil and a DHA- containing

<p>
<b><em>D1</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     D1 is an invention directed to a fatty acid
                    mixture to prepare nutritional compositions, especially infant formula. It is
                    clear that D1 does not anticipate the First Invention. While D1 teaches that
                    PUFAs are needed by infants, there is no evidence that D1 contemplates that only
                    an ARA-containing and a DHA-containing microbial oil are sufficient to replicate
                    the benefits of HBM. In fact: (i) D1 teaches the use of at least 4 and
                    preferably 6 fatty acids; (ii) D1 does not refer to or teach microbial oils; and
                    (iii) D1 teaches the matching of as many of the lcPUFAs found in HBM as
                    possible. All these three points were conceded by Dr Nga in
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b><em>D2</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     D2 relates to the development of commercial
                    sources for purified omega-3 lcPUFAs in the free acid or methyl ester to replace
                    the use of fish oil for pharmaceutical uses. The Tribunal read D2 as disclosing
                    microorganisms as potential sources of PUFAs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and
                    the Respondent submits that D2 teaches a commercial microbial source of DHA and
                    a commercial microbial source of ARA. Insofar as the Respondent submits that D2
                    teaches a source of ARA, however, this is wrong. As the Applicant pointed out at
                    the hearing before me, D2 is explicitly concerned with alternative sources of
                    only <em>omega-3 fatty acids</em>, which includes EPA and
                    DHA but <em>not</em> ARA which is an omega-6 fatty acid. On
                    that ground alone, D2 clearly does not anticipate the First Invention, not to
                    mention the fact that D2 does not refer to infant formula supplements at all nor
                    even considers whether the use of the microorganisms listed is safe in a food
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b><em>D3</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     D3 clearly does not anticipate the First
                    Invention. The fatty mixture taught in D3 can be obtained by a number of sources
                    including fish oils, egg oil, cows’ and pigs’ liver and kidney fat
                    and vegetable oils, rather than specifically microbial oils as taught in the
                    Patent. The only basis on which the Respondent argues that D3 teaches the use of
                    microbial oils is the reference to “algae oils” on page
                        4<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> but the Applicant points out that the algae
                    listed are all seaweeds and would not be considered sources of microbial
                        oil<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. This is buttressed by the fact that
                    Dr Nga also conceded that D3 does not teach the use of microbial
                        oils<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. In fact, Dr Nga also conceded that D3
                    teaches that lcPUFAs other than ARA and DHA are required. This being the case,
                    D3 clearly did not teach the use of only an ARA-containing and a DHA-containing
                    microbial oil for the purpose of replicating the benefits of HBM in an infant
                    formula supplement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It follows that the First Invention is not

                    problem associated with fish-oil supplemented infant formula and that this can
                    be overcome by the addition of ARA in the form of microbial oil to the
                    formula?</u>
</p>
<p>
<b><em>D27</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     D27 is central to the dispute over whether the
                    Second Invention was already part of the state of the art. Also known as the
                    “Carlson Study”, D27 states at p306 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DHA/EPA supplemented infants weighed less from 48 (n=60) through 92 weeks
                        (n=30) PCA. Omega-3 supplementation during infancy…appeared to result
                        in the accumulation of less body fat”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Respondent contends that the Carlson Study
                    therefore already observed the problem that fish oil led to lower weight gain
                    and the Second Invention is therefore not novel. However, two points can be
                    made: first, the Carlson Study did not identify whether it is the DHA or the EPA
                    in fish oil that causes the lower weight gain; second, even if we assume that it
                    did identify the problem, nowhere does it identify the <em>solution</em> to this problem. It is these two aspects that are the
                    essence of the Second Invention. Furthermore, as the Applicant argues, there is
                    no indication in the first place that the Carlson Study considered this lower
                    weight gain to be a <em>problem</em> that had to be
                    addressed before fish oil could continue to be fed to infants. D27 therefore
                    does not anticipate the Second Invention.</p>

                            decreased (page 96, column 1, paragraph 1, lines 21-23).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Applicant contends that D34 does not even
                    pertain to the effects of MaxEPA on <em>infants</em>,
                    rather than adults. Even if we assume for the sake of argument that the effects
                    of MaxEPA on adults and infants are identical, D34, like D27, does not identify
                    whether it is the EPA or the DHA that is responsible for this effect. This is
                    something Dr Nga again conceded in cross-examination. Furthermore, as
                    highlighted by Dr Lien and unrebutted by the Respondent, D34 does not draw
                    any causal link between the inhibited production of ARA and reduced weight
                    gain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Therefore, the Second Invention is also not
                    anticipated by any prior art and is novel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inventive Step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The burden of proof is on the party attacking
                    the validity of a patent to show that no inventive step was involved. The Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Muhlbauer</em> at [19] affirmed that the primary evidence with
                    regard to this element will be that of properly qualified expert witnesses who
                    will say whether or not in their opinion the relevant step would have been
                    obvious to a skilled man having regard to the state of the art. Once again, the
                    Respondent never challenged this aspect of Dr Kyle’s and
                    Dr Lien’s evidence. Its own expert evidence is confined to
                    Dr Nga’s, who is not an expert in the relevant field. The Respondent
                    has clearly failed to discharge its burden of showing that the First and Second
                    Inventions were obvious to a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In any case, the First Invention falls within
                    the clear case of non-obviousness <em>i.e</em>. when the
                    invention <em>goes against conventional wisdom</em>. As
                    articulated by the English Court of Appeal in <em>Pozzoli SpA v
                        BDMO SA</em> [2007] FSR 37 at [27]: “A patentee who contributes something new by
                    showing that, contrary to the mistaken prejudice, the idea will work or is
                    practical has shown something new. He has shown that an apparent 'lion in the
                    path' is merely a paper tiger. Then his contribution is novel and non-obvious
                    and he deserves his patent”. The First Invention showed that supplemented
                    infant formula need not include as many lcPUFAs found in HBM as possible to
                    replicate the benefits of HBM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This also applies to the Second Invention
                    insofar as the expert evidence is that conventional wisdom held fish oil to be
                    beneficial for infants, without identifying the need to solve the problem of
                    lower weight gain. As established at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>
                    above, even D27, the prior publication closest to the Second Invention, does not
                    identify the phenomenon of lower weight gain as a <em>problem</em> that had to be addressed before fish oil could continue
                    to be fed to infants as a supplement. In fact, the preferred examples disclosed
                    in D1, which teaches a fatty acid mixture to prepare nutritional compositions
                    especially for infant formulas, contain <em>much higher levels of
                        EPA</em> than HBM.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This
                    demonstrates that the state of the art did not see fish oil as problematic for
                    infant consumption and the Respondent has adduced no prior art that teaches to
                    the contrary. Even if the state of art had identified lower weight gain as a
                    problem that needed to be solved, the essence of the Second Invention was to
                    single out EPA rather than DHA as the source of the problem. The Respondent has
                    not been able to point to any prior art that suggests any attempt to isolate
                    which component of fish oil it was that caused lower weight gain. The
                    Patent’s identification of EPA as the source, and going one step further
                    to provide the solution, is therefore non-obvious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Additionally, the Applicant submits that the
                    commercial success of the Patent illustrates that the inventions were
                    non-obvious. It is true that commercial success may play a role in establishing
                    non-obviousness, albeit not conclusively (Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, Rev Ed, 2009) at paragraph 30.1.52 (“<em>Law of
                        IP in Singapore</em>”)). However, I would not accord too much
                    weight to this factor here. The “commercial success” referred to
                    by the Applicant is Dr Kyle’s evidence that the only sources
                    currently used in infant formula are “the designer oils, DHA and ARA,
                    designer oils or a combination of the fish oil with the ARA designer
                    oil”. This is despite the fact that D1 has long been revoked and is
                    therefore free for everyone to use. While this may well be true, in my view this
                    evidence is not specific enough to establish the Patent’s commercial
                    success. It was only mentioned in passing during the oral examination of
                    Dr Kyle, unlike in <em>Muhlbauer</em> where evidence
                    was specifically submitted that more than 100 of the patentee’s machines
                    had been sold as compared to only four units of the machine taught in a prior
                    publication. The evidence is certainly insufficient to prove that the alleged
                    commercial success was due to the invention itself rather than extrinsic factors
                    such as successful marketing (<em>Law of IP in
                        Singapore</em> at paragraph 30.1.52). In any case, this does not
                    affect the outcome of this case. I have found above that both the First and
                    Second Inventions did contain inventive steps.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sufficiency</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The Respondent further contends that the
                    Patent should be revoked under s 80(1)(c) for lack of sufficiency,
                        <em>i.e</em>. the specification of the patent does not
                    disclose the invention clearly and completely for it to be performed by a person
                    skilled in the art. It challenges the sufficiency of claims in the 1999
                    Amendments, the Proposed 2006 Amendments and the 2008 Amendments respectively.
                    The Tribunal found that all claims in the respective Amendments were sufficient.
                    I reiterate that I only examine the validity of the Patent based on the 1999
                    Amendments. Therefore, I turn to the Respondent’s submissions that the
                    claims in the 1999 Amendments are insufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Respondent submits that three parts of the
                    1999 amended claims in particular are insufficient:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The phrase, “comparable to…in human
                            breast milk”, in Claims 1, 2, 21 and 22;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The phrase, “substantially free of
                            EPA”, in Claims 3, 8 and 16; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Claims 7, 20 and 26 where the Patent
                            “does not disclose products that are not directly obtainable from
                            the claimed processes”</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     With regard to (i) and (ii) above, the
                    Respondent’s objection is one of lack of clarity. The phrase in (i)
                    allegedly lacks clarity because the lcPUFA content of HBM varies according to
                    factors such as the ethnicity of the mother. The phrase in (ii) does not specify
                    a quantitative limit on the amount of EPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     However, to revoke a patent on the grounds of
                    insufficiency, it is not enough for the Respondent to highlight ambiguities in
                    the plain language of the claims. As the court in <em>Rediffusion
                        Simulation v Link-Miles</em> [1993] FSR 369 at 388
                    affirmed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here is seldom a case where a person, who is asked to look at every
                        word of a specification to try and destroy it, cannot make out a case of
                        potential ambiguity. That is not the correct approach. The specification
                            <em>should be read through the eyes of the skilled
                            addressee attempting to give it practical meaning and endeavouring to
                            ascertain the intention of the draftsmen</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The Respondent has adduced no expert testimony
                    to prove that the above phrases would render the invention unworkable <em>from the point of view of a skilled addressee</em>. In
                    contrast, Dr Lien at pages 3 to 8 of his Statutory Declaration explained
                    how a skilled addressee would understand how to work the invention. In
                    particular, Dr Lien explained at pages 11 to 13 how the phrase in (i) would
                    be clear to the person skilled in the field of infant formula and this evidence
                    has remained unrebutted by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As for (iii), the Respondent merely alludes to
                    the fact that these claims are product-by-process claims. I do not see how this
                    is an objection based on sufficiency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I therefore find that the claims in the 1999
                    Amendments meet the requirement of sufficiency.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Status of corresponding patents in other jurisdictions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It only remains for me to address one final
                    point. Both in the proceedings below and before me, the Respondent highlighted
                    the status of the Applicant’s various foreign patents that allegedly
                    correspond to this Patent. In particular, the Respondent stressed foreign
                    proceedings where the Appellant was either unsuccessful in obtaining a patent or
                    unsuccessful in defending its granted patents in opposition proceedings. I
                    appreciate the Respondent’s efforts in highlighting the similarities
                    between the Patent and each foreign patent individually. Unfortunately, however,
                    this does not really aid in either proving or disproving the validity of this
                    Patent. In my view, the Tribunal was correct to rely on the Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment in <em>Main-Line</em> at [2] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, it must also be acknowledged that an adjudication on patent
                        rights is predicated upon not only the applicable regulatory framework and
                        practices, but also the evidence presented as well as the submissions made
                        to the tribunal concerned. <em>Care must therefore be taken
                            by counsel when referring to and/or relying on another apparently
                            similar decision on the “same” issue from another
                            jurisdiction</em>. [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While it is true that the court in <em>Main-Line</em> did contemplate at [58] that the decision of the New Zealand
                    patent office could be “of some penumbral assistance” in that
                    case, that was because the court found that there was some consistency between
                    the statutory matrices of Singapore and New Zealand. The Respondent has made no
                    such submissions here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the Validity Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     For the above reasons, I find that the Patent
                    fulfilled the requirements of Novelty, Inventive Step and Sufficiency. I
                    therefore dismiss the Revocation Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Amendments Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I turn next to the issue of whether the
                    Appellant’s amendments to the Patent should be allowed. As established
                    above, the Appellant filed four set of amendments in total. The 1997 Amendments
                    were never challenged and the Respondent has discontinued its appeal with regard
                    to the 1999 Amendments. Only the Proposed 2006 Amendments and the Proposed 2008
                    Amendments therefore remain in dispute. Insofar as the Applicant appeals against
                    the Tribunal’s decision to disallow claim 30 of the 1999 Amendments
                    (“Claim 30”), Claim 30 also remains in issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I note that the Respondent does not resurrect
                    its argument below that the Proposed 2008 Amendments are prohibited because
                    section 80 of the Act affords patentees only <em>one</em>
                    opportunity to amend a patent during revocation proceedings. As the Tribunal
                    pointed out at [115]-[116] of the Decision, there is no statutory basis for this
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Section 84(3) of the Act provides that no
                    amendment will be allowed if it: (a) results in the specification disclosing
                    additional matter; or (b) extends the protection granted by the patent. With
                    regard to section 84(3)(a), the subject matter will be considered
                    “additional matter” if it is not clearly and unambiguously
                    disclosed, either implicitly or explicitly, in the application as originally
                    filed (<em>Bonzel v Intervention Ltd</em>
                    [1991] RPC 553 at 574). With regard to section 84(3)(b), it is to be
                    noted that the scope of an individual claim may be extended so long as it does
                    not extend the overall monopoly of the patent (<em>Siegfried
                        Demel v Jefferson</em> [1999] RPC 155).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1999 Amendments – Claim 30 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Claim 30 discloses that the microbial oil
                    containing DHA and/or the microbial oil containing ARA are “in
                    triglyceride form”. The only basis of this claim in the original Patent
                    specification is Example 1 on page 12, where it states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“The second fraction was predominantly phospholipids whereas the
                        first fraction contained a mixture of phospholipids and triglycerides. The
                        combined fractions produced an oil containing about 30-35% arachidonic acid
                        and no detectable EPA.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Re-Examiner took this to indicate that
                    “during production of the microbial oils it appears that fatty acids are
                    in the form of phospholipids and triglycerides” and on this basis
                    concluded that Claim 30 did not disclose additional matter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    However, in my view the Tribunal was right to find that Example 1 is
                    inconclusive support for Claim 30. Example 1 indicates that different fractions
                    in the production of the microbial oils were different mixes of phospholipids
                    and triglycerides, with the second fraction apparently containing no
                    triglycerides at all. Example 1 thus does not “clearly and
                    unambiguously” disclose the subject matter of Claim 30.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Applicant’s appeal against the
                    Tribunal’s finding in this regard is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Proposed 2006 Amendments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I turn now to the Proposed 2006
                    Amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   
        <u>“Substantially lower”
                    – Claim 2</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The first proposed amendment to claim 2 is to
                    include that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the amount of each other long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (lcPUFA) in
                        said supplemented infant formula is <em>substantially
                            lower</em> than the amount of that lcPUFA in human breast milk
                        [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     “Each <em>other</em>” lcPUFA refers to the fact that this claim only
                    refers to lcPUFAs other than ARA and DHA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Tribunal allowed this amendment on the
                    basis that this feature is disclosed in Tables 2 and 7 of Examples 5 and 10
                    respectively (“Tables 2 and 7”) in the original application. The
                    Tribunal found that Tables 2 and 7 reflected that the amount of lcPUFAs other
                    than ARA and DHA in the supplemented infant formula is either lower or in
                    significantly lower amount compared to that in HBM. In my view, this is correct.
                    I note in particular that in interpreting the Tables, care must be taken to
                    examine only the relevant profiles – as clarified by the Applicant and the
                    Tribunal, some of the profiles reflected in the Tables are <em>not</em> lcPUFAs but other types of fatty acids. An examination of
                    the relevant profiles reflects substantially lower amounts than in
                HBM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I find, contrary to the Respondent’s
                    argument, that the skilled person <em>is</em> guided to the
                    quantitative meaning of “substantially lower”. The specification
                    of a patent should be read through the eyes of the skilled addressee,
                        “<em>attempting to give it a practical meaning and
                        endeavouring to ascertain the intention of the draftsmen</em>”

                    [1993] FSR 369 at 388) [emphasis added]. In this light, I find that
                    the Tribunal was right to hold that a skilled addressee, reading the Patent and
                    attempting to give it a practical meaning, would have been able to obtain the
                    results as stated in Examples 5 and 10 had he carried out the necessary
                    experiments.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The second proposed amendment is to amend the
                    phrase “comprising of” to “consisting of” in claims
                    2 and 26.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Tribunal allowed this amendment on the
                    basis that it constituted a positive limitation on the claim. The Respondent
                    contends that the amendment is the Applicant’s way of distinguishing its
                    alleged invention from prior art by excluding any additional features that were
                    disclosed by the prior art.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I do not think there is any dispute as to the
                    effect of the proposed amendment. The Tribunal held that
                    “comprising” is commonly understood to mean “including but
                    not limited to” whereas “consisting of” is close-ended.
                    However, that is not what the Respondent is objecting to. The Respondent’s
                    objection is that this limitation conveys the meaning that the oil blend
                    consists <em>only</em> of ARA-containing oil and
                    DHA-containing oil to the exclusion of all other types of oils and additives. In
                    other words, this is the Respondent’s argument on the validity issue,
                    which I have already addressed earlier. Given that I have already held that the
                    Patent did disclose that an oil blend of only a microbial oil containing ARA and
                    a microbial oil containing DHA is necessary, the dispute over this amendment is
                    moot. In fact, I have already noted that it is somewhat strange for the Tribunal
                    to have found at [87] of the Decision
                    that “Example 5 showed that DHA oil and ARA oil are to be the only
                    lcPUFAs required for the oil blend”, and yet reach the conclusion it did
                    on the revocation issue.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The third proposed amendment is to include the
                    phrase “an infant formula that is substantially free of lcPUFAs”
                    in claims 2 and 26.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The Tribunal allowed this amendment on the
                    basis that it was disclosed in Tables 2 and 7 in Examples 5 and 10 respectively,
                    as with the first proposed amendment at <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a>
                    above. I agree. The Respondent contends that the Tables merely describe the
                    composition of the unsupplemented infant formula and there is no teaching in the
                    Patent that this infant formula is intended to be “substantially free of
                    lcPUFAs”. However, this fails to consider that a description of the
                    composition of the unsupplemented infant formula can implicitly teach that this
                    infant formula is “substantially free of lcPUFAs”. This is
                    especially when we examine the Tables from the viewpoint of a person skilled in
                    the art. In my view, the profiles reflected in the Tables do this.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The fourth proposed amendment is to amend
                    claims 3, 16, 29 and 46 to include the phrase “At least 25% by weight

                    and 48 to include the phrase “Rich in DHA”. The Tribunal addressed
                    these two proposed amendments together because the arguments involved were
                    interlinked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The Tribunal disallowed both amendments, in my
                    view correctly. It found that, while not disclosing additional matter, the
                    amendments extend the protection granted by the Patent. It found that the
                    amendments do not disclose additional matter because the Patent specifications,
                    at lines 8-9 at page 5 read with line 6 at page 9, do disclose a <em>lower limit</em> of 25% and the teaching of
                    “richness” in DHA and ARA. However, lines 5-6 at page 9 also
                    disclose an <em>upper limit</em> of 40% by weight DHA. The
                    phrases “at least 25% by weight DHA” and “rich in
                    DHA” therefore extend the scope of protection granted by the Patent
                    because they disclose only lower limits, not an upper limit. The Applicant
                    contended below on the basis of lines 8-9 on page 5 that the Patent did not
                    impose an upper limit but only that the microbial oils should be
                    “rich” in DHA. However, the Applicant cannot pick and choose parts
                    of the specifications to rely upon for the purposes of establishing what the
                    Patent disclosed. Having urged the Tribunal to read lines 8-9 at page 5
                        <em>together</em> with line 6 at page 9 in order to
                    establish that no additional matter was disclosed, it cannot then ignore the
                    latter and rely only upon the former to argue that the Patent did not impose an
                    upper limit of 40%.</p>

                    fourth and fifth proposed amendments above on the proportion of DHA. For the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Apart from the proposed amendments above, the
                    Proposed 2006 Amendments contained other amendments which the Respondent did not
                    specifically submit on below. Nevertheless, the Tribunal stated that save for
                    Claim 45, the proposed amendments to all other claims were allowable. Insofar as
                    these claims are dependent claims, their allowability depends on the
                    allowability of the relevant parent claim analysed above. Also, Claims 1 and 25
                    are no longer in issue because the Respondent has withdrawn its appeal with
                    regard to these claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As for Claim 45, it is for “the
                    composition of any one of claims 42 to 44”. I have already held earlier
                    that amended Claims 43 and 44 are not allowed. It follows that Claim 45 is
                    disallowed insofar as it is dependent on claims 43 or 44. On the other hand, the
                    Tribunal held that Claim 45 is allowed insofar as it is dependent on Claim 42,
                    which it allowed. I disagree with the Tribunal’s finding that Claim 42 be
                    allowed for the reasons stated below at <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a>-<a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> where I
                    consider the allowability of certain Proposed 2008 Amendments because those
                    amendments involve the same phraseology as the Proposed 2006 Amendment to Claim
                    42.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Under the Proposed 2008 Amendments,

                    deletion of Claims 31 and 48. The rest of the claims remain substantively
                    identical to those in the Proposed 2006 Amendments. I therefore need only
                    consider the proposed amendments to Claims 2, 15 and 26 (together with Claim 42
                    as explained above at <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>), as well as the

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The first proposed amendment is to replace

                    Proposed 2006 Amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The Tribunal disallowed this amendment. I
                    find that it was correct to do so because the amendment extends the scope of
                    protection conferred by the Patent within the meaning of section 84(3)(b) of the
                    act. The words and terms in a claim are to be given their ordinary English
                    meaning unless: (a) a word or expression has a specialised meaning in the
                    relevant art (<em>Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen
                        Ltd</em> [1939] 56 RPC 23 at 24); or (b) the specification
                    may indicate an ambiguous meaning thereby justifying resort to the body of the
                    specification to define the words used in the claim (<em>Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd</em> (1973) 130 CLR 461). I
                    accept the Respondent’s submission that, given their ordinary English
                    meanings, it is clear that “containing” is wider than “rich
                    in”. The former would mean that the microbial oil may contain <em>any amount</em> of DHA or ARA whereas the latter requires a
                        <em>large amount</em> of the same. This is sufficient
                    to dispose of the issue although the Respondent also objects to the amendment on
                    the basis of section 84(3)(a) as well <em>i.e</em>. that it
                    discloses additional matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It follows that Claim 42 (which is the same
                    in both the Proposed 2006 and 2008 Amendments) should not be allowed.
                    Consequently, Claim 45 of the Proposed 2006 Amendments is also not allowed (see
