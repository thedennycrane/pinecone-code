In or around end August 2017, the first defendant was depressed and had expressed to him her worries about her business suffering losses due to the adverse publicity. She considered letting other parties take over and operate the Kindergarten. To that end and purpose, the first defendant said she wanted to source for buyers through WeChat for an asking price of $150,000. She told him she would leave his number in her WeChat broadcast and let him deal with interested parties as he was more proficient in English than she is. At that juncture, the plaintiffs had already commenced the first committal proceedings against her so the first defendant was “already very mindful of her actions”.

The reply did not give the plaintiffs’ consent. Instead, the two defendants were told they should cease all attempts to dissipate assets or undermine the value of the assets in breach of the Mareva Order.

The reply seemed to suggest that the plaintiffs were in agreement with the first defendant’s decision to sell the kindergartens, including the Kindergarten, to salvage the fourth defendant.

These included selling or attempting to sell the kindergartens and siphoning out the funds from the kindergartens other than for the proper and ordinary purposes of the kindergartens. Our instructions are that your general query whether our clients are agreeable to your clients selling the kindergartens is but an afterthought to try to camouflage and whitewash your clients’ nefarious acts committed in aggravation of their contempt of the Mareva Injunction Order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 Without prejudice to our clients’ position as aforesaid, and to obviate any unreasonable allegations that our clients are against the preservation of the value of the assets, we are instructed to state our clients’ position categorically that they are not against legitimate steps to safeguard the value of the assets.

That paragraph 6 was subject to paragraph 5 (see above at [23]) where the plaintiffs’ solicitors were asking for details of the two defendants’ proposal to sell the fourth defendant’s assets. The second defendant made no mention of paragraph 5 in his reference to Lee &amp; Lee’s letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The second defendant had also omitted from his affidavit (deliberately I am certain) any mention of the fact that he/TJC failed to respond to Lee &amp; Lee’s letter and their inquiry in paragraph 5 therein notwithstanding a reminder dated 19 September 2017. At para 3 of the letter dated 19 September 2017, Lee &amp; Lee raised the complaint that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… illegitimate transfers and payment out of substantial funds from the Kindergarten accounts have been made by [the second defendant] and [the first defendant’s] relatives such that there is now not enough money left to even pay the salaries of the teachers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In response to this, TJC’s non-committal reply on 20 September 2017 was that “we are unaware of the matters as disclosed in your letter and are taking our clients’ instructions on this matter”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It is telling that by 28 August 2017, according to the second defendant’s own affidavit (see above at [13]), the second defendant had shown the premises of the Kindergarten to five prospective buyers. Yet, he failed to disclose this fact to the plaintiffs’ solicitors in TJC’s letter. Equally, there was no mention by the second defendant of his attempt to find buyers using the WeChat platform (see above at [9(b)]). Consequently, the second defendant’s excuse (at [10(e)] above) that he was not a party to the WeChat group’s broadcast rang hollow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It was absurd of the second defendant to contend that his attempts to sell the kindergartens of the fourth defendant did not amount to dissipation of the fourth defendant’s assets as no sale took place. This argument is akin to saying that attempts to commit, and abetment of, crimes attract no punishment. The Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) is replete with examples of punishments for offences relating to abetment of, and attempts at, commission of various offences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The second defendant’s alternative argument was that the contemplated sale of the Kindergarten was done in the ordinary and proper course of the business of the fourth defendant. Such an argument puts a strained interpretation on the words “in the ordinary and proper course of business”. In the court’s view, the hiring and firing of teachers for the kindergartens operated by the fourth defendant would be done in the ordinary and proper course of the fourth defendant’s business. So too would the renting of premises for operating its kindergartens. It was certainly not in the ordinary and proper course of the fourth defendant’s business to sell its kindergarten businesses or the Kindergarten or to sell its shares to third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It speaks volumes of the conduct and culpability of the first defendant that another judge/court imposed on her a sentence of more than five months’ imprisonment for breach of the Mareva Order under the first committal proceedings. The heavy sentence (by the first defendant’s own admission before this court

</div>) reflected the court’s strong disapproval of her blatant breach and contempt of an order of court. Yet the first defendant appeared not to have learnt her lesson. Instead, she embarked on further attempts to breach the same order of court, this time with the help and connivance of her husband, the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 No extenuating circumstances were put forward by the second defendant as to why this court should exercise its discretion to overlook his deliberate attempts to breach the Mareva Order. Far worse was the fact that the second defendant made no apologies or express remorse for his attempted breaches; his attitude was one of self-righteousness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As the court was not persuaded by the arguments put forth by and on behalf of the second defendant, the Committal Application was granted against him as well as against the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu <br/>Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Quek Mong Hua, Chua Yi Ying and Yik Shu Ying (Yi Shu Ying) (Lee &amp; Lee) for the plaintiffs;<br/>The first defendant in person;<br/>Goh Kim Thong Andrew and Nicholas Yong Yoong Han (Fortis Law Corporation) for the second defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
