<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal on a question of law arising
                    out of an arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties to the arbitration were SCDA
                    Architects Pte Ltd (“SCDA”), a firm of architects that was engaged
                    by Motor Image Enterprises Pte Ltd (“Motor Image”) to be the
                    architects in respect of the proposed retrofitting works and alterations
                    (“the project”) to be carried out to Motor Image’s premises
                    at 25 Leng Kee Road. The arbitration proceedings resulted from a dispute by the
                    parties over the fees payable for the services rendered by SCDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       SCDA was the claimant in the arbitration. It
                    claimed the sum of $334,367.44 which it alleged constituted unpaid fees due to
                    it for its work on the project. SCDA was largely successful in respect of its
                    claim and by his award dated 5 February 2009 (“the Award”), the
                    arbitrator, Dr Goh Chong Chia (“the Arbitrator”) ordered,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that Motor Image was to pay SCDA
                    its claim of $463,335 less payment to date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequently, Motor Image applied for leave to
                    appeal to the High Court on a question of law arising out of the Award. On
                    2 October 2009, I granted leave to Motor Image to appeal on the following
                    question of law (“the Question”):</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where an architect
                    who is engaged under the Singapore Institute of Architects Conditions of
                    Appointment and Architect’s Services and Mode of Payment (“the
                    Appointment Conditions”) has agreed with his client to call for tenders
                    based on an agreed set of drawings but instead calls for and receives tenders
                    based on a different set of drawings, is the architect entitled to fees based on
                    the lowest of the tenders under or by reference to clause 1.3(3)(b) of the
                    Appointment Conditions?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 12 October 2009, SCDA took out a summons
                    (“SUM 5332/09”) asking for leave under s 49(7) of the
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to
                    appeal against the grant of leave to Motor Image to appeal on the Question. I
                    dismissed this application some two weeks later and the appeal proper then came
                    on for hearing in March and April this year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appointment of SCDA as architects for the
                    project took place in February 2004. The contract of service between the parties
                    was subject to the Appointment Conditions. It was agreed that SCDA would be paid
                    fees equivalent to 8.5% of the total construction cost subject to a minimum lump
                    sum fee of $200,000. The Appointment Conditions provide by Condition 1.3(3) for
                    the manner of calculating the construction cost as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.3(3)    The total construction cost of the works for
                            the purpose of calculating the fees shall include all builders’
                            works as set out in the Building Contract and all specialists and/or
                            sub-contractors’ works forming part of the project. The total
                            construction cost of the Works shall be arrived at in accordance with
                            the order of priority as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    For completed works, the total construction costs
                            of all works including variations and additional work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    For works not contracted, the lowest bona fide
                            tender received by the Architect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    For works where tenders have not been received by
                            the Architect, the latest estimate of the total construction costs
                            prepared by the appointed Quantity Surveyor, if any; or in the absence
                            of the Quantity Surveyor, the Architect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After its appointment, SCDA made three
                    submissions of drawings to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the
                    URA”) for approval. The first submission was made on 18 August 2004,
                    the second on 28 June 2005 and the final one on 18 August 2005. In
                    addition, on 29 June 2005, Motor Image received another set of drawings
                    from SCDA (“the 29 June 2005 drawings). Written permission for
                    construction was finally obtained from the URA in September 2005. Motor Image
                    was aware that the “use quantum” (<em>ie</em>
                    the URA’s requirement that only 40% of the premises could be used as a
                    showroom or for ancillary purposes such as for offices or storerooms) was the
                    major issue raised by the URA in the latter’s written directions in
                    response to the submissions and was responsible for the URA’s rejection of
                    the first two sets of drawings. Nonetheless, Motor Image briefed SCDA shortly
                    before the second submission saying that it wanted more offices. It was common
                    knowledge that this would delay and complicate the URA approval
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After written permission was obtained, SCDA
                    called a tender for the project (the “Main Contract Tender”).
                    Motor Image subsequently decided to reduce the scope of the project. After Motor
                    Image accepted a revised scope of works, SCDA called a second tender
                    (“Tender No 2”). Finally, Motor Image decided to call the project
                    off. The lowest tender for the Main Contract Tender was $9,480,000 and the
                    lowest tender for Tender No 2 was $3,782,912.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The fees claimed by SCDA were calculated on the
                    basis of 57.5% (being the stage of the work reached when the project was
                    terminated, something that was not in dispute) of 8.5% of $9,480,000 being the
                    lowest tender for the Main Contract Tender. Motor Image was not happy with this
                    claim: it considered that it had been grossly overcharged for the work done
                    especially because various mistakes had been made in the tender
                drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim and the Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     SCDA based its claim in the arbitration on the
                    results of the Main Contract Tender and the application to the same of Condition
                    1.3(3). The defences that Motor Image put up involved allegations of breach of
                    contract, negligence, breach of statutory duty and or professional duties and/or
                    ethical duties and illegality. The gravamen of these allegations (apart from
                    illegality) revolved around SCDA’s alleged failure to ensure that the
                    drawings complied with all relevant laws and regulations and to give proper
                    advice to Motor Image on whether the design brief and drawings could be
                    implemented lawfully or complied with the URA’s prescribed use quantum and
                    its further failure to advise Motor Image in a timely fashion that the
                    prescribed use quantum had been breached and the design brief could not have
                    been achieved. The allegation of illegality was based on the assertion that SCDA
                    in the third submission to the URA had submitted an application and drawings
                    which contained particulars or statements which were false, misleading,
                    inaccurate and constituted a sham. This submission, it alleged, had resulted in
                    a breach of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1998 Rev Ed). Motor Image also
                    put in a counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Arbitrator found no merit in any of Motor
                    Image’s defences or its counterclaim. His key findings were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Counterclaim for breach of contract of statutory duty/
                            obligations of professional duties and/or ethical
                        duties</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is my belief that two separate schemes were being prepared concurrently
                        and it would be incorrect to conclude that one scheme was to mislead the URA
                        and the other [Motor Image]. … [SCDA] was trying to fulfil Motor
                        Image’s brief in one, the URA in the other and at the same time
                        preparing for tender. <em>It is not unusual for the
                            submission drawings to be different from the tender drawings and not in
                            full compliance to [Motor Image’s] brief</em>. It is common
                        practice for an amendment to be submitted later to regularise the works.
                        … (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Motor Image] had full knowledge of the various steps and actions
                        being taken by [SCDA].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I dismiss the allegation that SCDA had breached their statutory
                        duties/obligations, professional duties and/or ethical duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Counterclaim on Negligence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[SCDA] made mistakes, however, mistakes in themselves do not amount to
                        negligence. [Motor Image] had alleged negligence by [SCDA], but did not
                        present any assessment of the damage during the hearing ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This claim is rejected as no evidence was presented to establish the
                        damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Defence of Illegality</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Motor Image] had pleaded in their Defence and Counterclaim dated
                        27 May 2007 that the contract and/or its performance thereof is illegal
                        and/or unenforceable by reason of an alleged contravention/breach of the
                        Planning Act and/or the Rules and Notifications and thus [SCDA] is not
                        entitled to their claim for $334,674.44. [Motor Image’s] contention
                        was that the 3rd submission plans were false, misleading, inaccurate and/or
                        for show/appearance sake in order to obtain Written Permission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Planning and developing a project is a process. To alleged
                            [<em>sic</em>] illegality in midstream of the
                        process is not appropriate. Any difference in the submission drawings from
                        the tender drawings would have had to be regularised through amendment
                        submissions, appeals, waivers or concessions made as required to get
                        approval. This is normal procedure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not believe that after 2 years of developing the project with [SCDA],
                        [Motor Image is] not aware, of the details in the design and the implication
                        of use quantum, after having followed the process of obtaining [written
                        permission] through its 3 submissions and re-terming. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The process of submission and compliance to Authority requirements by
                        [SCDA] although took 3 submission [<em>sic</em>] cannot
                        be said to have been in breach of the Planning Act or were in any way
                        illegal. I conclude that [SCDA] had not made any inaccurate, misleading or
                        false statements to URA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>URA Submissions</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In April 2005, shortly before the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        submission, [Motor Image] wanted more offices, conference/training room,
                        meetings etc [<em>sic</em>] and not larger display area
                        on the 2<sup>nd</sup> storey. A set of drawings responding
                        to [Motor Image’s] requirement[s] was prepared and submitted (ICB55)
                        to [Motor Image] titled, as “Schematic Design-Planning
                        submission.” These drawings … received [by Motor Image] on
                        29 June 2005, were clearly drawings incorporating clients’ brief
                        and were not the 2<sup>nd</sup> submission to URA. …
                        these were not the submission drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Meanwhile on 29 June 2005, [SCDA] proceeded with the
                            2<sup>nd</sup> submission to URA which consisted of
                        amended drawings from the 1<sup>st</sup> submission which
                        continued to have “new parts display area” and no part of the
                        previous showroom had been allocated for use as offices, conference/training
                        room and meeting rooms as desired by [Motor Image]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I come to the conclusion that 2 sets of designs were being prepared
                        concurrently and [it] would be a mistake to confuse the two sets of designs
                        and present them as contradictions. They were separate legitimate attempts
                        to satisfy [Motor Image] and the URA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Motor Image had also made more specific
                    arguments on the manner in which the fees should be calculated. It asserted that
                    the Main Contract Tender was not a “<em>bona
                        fide</em> tender” within the meaning of Condition 1.3(3)(b) and
                    that the tender to use for computing the architects’ fees should have been
                    Tender No 2. The Arbitrator’s findings on these issues were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em><u>Bona fide tender</u></em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Two tenders had been called. The contention was which of the tender
                            [<em>sic</em>] was a bona fide tender on which
                        tender construction cost was the fees to be computed from [<em>sic</em>] ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Motor Image] had asserted that the [Main Contract Tender] was not bona
                        fide as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. it was not based on the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        submission</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. did not represented [<em>sic</em>] what [Motor
                        Image] wanted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Motor Image] pointed out many mistakes and discrepancies in the drawings.
                        These mistakes were not denied by [SCDA]. These mistakes in themselves do
                        not make the Main Contract Tender a non bona fide tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had earlier concluded that there were two concurrent processes going on
                        at the time of tendering, one for planning application and the other for
                        tender. The tender drawings were based on design [<em>sic</em>] and drawings received by [Motor Image] on 29 June 2005.
                        This design was clearly what [Motor Image] wanted. Just because the tender
                        was not based on drawings submitted to URA does not make it a non bona fide
                        tender? [<em>sic</em>]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the stages of the service were done with the full knowledge and
                        agreement of [Motor Image]. Motor Image had not expressed any unhappiness
                        with the service, the relationship was amicable and the agreement to a
                        reduced scope of works and to recall the tender after the initial design
                        tender was termed “not cost effective” was constructive. Up to
                        that point in time there was no dispute on the fees …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both the expanded scope tender and the reduced scope tender were done with
                        the full knowledge and consent of [Motor Image]. I rule that both tenders
                        were bona fide.</p>

<b>Which tender to use for computing Architect’s
                            fees</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The agreement between SCDA and Motor Image indicated a minimum fee of
                        $200,000. That limit had passed after the Q.S. estimate. After agreeing for
                        [SCDA] to [do] the additional work to recall the tender for a reduced scope
                        of work and then to nullify the works for Tender No 1 and to suggest that
                        that [<em>sic</em>] the fees should be based on the
                        Tender No 2 lowest tender of $3,782,912 is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The lowest tender of $9.48 million was reasonable [<em>sic</em>] close to the QS estimate of 6 Sept 2005 of $8.24
                        million plus $930,000 provisional sum. For [SCDA] to base his fees on the
                        first tender and on the lowest tendered sum and not submitted [<em>sic</em>] any claim for the additional service for
                        preparing for the second tender is reasonable. There was nothing in the
                        agreement requiring that [SCDA] to call the tender for the works
                        twice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In arriving at my decision, I had taken into consideration that [Motor

                        submissions including calling of Main Contract Tender and Tender Addendum No

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decision is that [SCDA]’s claim [for] architectural fees based
                        on the lowest tender from the Main Contract Tender without claiming any fees

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal – preliminary issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The main contention that SCDA put forward on
                    the hearing of the appeal was that the Question was based on findings of fact
                    that the Arbitrator did not make in the Award and therefore since it was not a
                    question of law arising from the Award, the appeal should be dismissed. Motor
                    Image responded with three contentions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     that SCDA was estopped from raising
                        issues that were already raised when the court considered Motor
                        Image’s application for leave to appeal under s 49(3)(b) of the
                        Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     that a
                        respondent to an appeal under s 49 of the Act could not challenge the
                        factual premises of the question of law that the appellant had been granted
                        leave to appeal on; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     that it was an abuse of process to allow SCDA to reprise
                        arguments it had already made during the hearing of SUM 5332/09 when it was
                        seeking leave to appeal under s 49(7) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The issues raised in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above have to be considered before I turn to the Question
                    since the Question would be rendered otiose if SCDA’s position is correct
                    in relation to the Award, and it cannot be prevented from making those
                    arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Motor Image contended that the principles
                    relating to issue estoppel applied in this case so as to prevent SCDA from
                    re-litigating the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Arbitrator found that
                        Motor Image had instructed SCDA to call for tenders based on the third
                        submission drawings or the 29 June 2005 drawings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Arbitrator found that the
                        29 June 2005 drawings and the third submission drawings were
                        different;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether Motor Image had exaggerated the effect of mistakes made by
                        SCDA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether
                        SCDA was entitled to architectural fees on the alternative basis of the
                        “latest estimate of the total construction costs” pursuant to
                        Condition 1.3(3)(c) of the Appointment Conditions; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     Whether the Question was dealt with by
                        the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Motor Image further contended that all of the
                    above issues had been argued by it at the leave stage and that SCDA had
                    responded in detail to the same. In granting leave to appeal on the Question,
                    the court had finally and conclusively determined all of these issues and
                    accepted the arguments put forward by Motor Image. This determination was
                    fundamental in the court’s decision to grant leave to appeal because under
                    s 49(5)(c) of the Act, the court could only grant leave if it was satisfied
                    that the Question was one which the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine and
                    that on the basis of the findings of fact in the Award the decision of the
                    arbitral tribunal was obviously wrong or, at least, open to serious doubt. The
                    lower threshold applied if the court also determined that the Question was one
                    of general public importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The framing of the Question itself showed that
                    the court had agreed with Motor Image’s submission that the Arbitrator
                    found that SCDA had called for tenders based on the 29 June 2005 drawings
                    when Motor Image had instructed SCDA to call for tenders based on the third
                    submission drawings. That explained why the Question was premised on the
                    disparity between (i) the agreement between the client and the architect as to
                    what drawings would be used for the tender and (ii) the drawings that were
                    actually used for the tender. If SCDA had persuaded the court that Motor Image
                    had instructed it to call for tenders based on the 29 June 2005 drawings
                    and not the third submission drawings, then leave would not have been granted
                    and the Question would not have been framed. Clearly, therefore, the court had
                    determined the issues when it granted leave to appeal. Further, the decision of
                    the court was a final decision and conclusive on the issue of whether leave to
                    appeal against the Award should be granted. Thus, Motor Image argued, the
                    requirements of issue estoppel had been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As regards the law on what these requirements
                    were, Motor Image cited <em>Wing Joo Loong Ginseng Hong
                        (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd and another
                        and another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 814 which discussed
                    the law of issue estoppel as determined by the case of <em>Lee
                        Tat Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No 301</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 157 (“<em>Lee Tat</em>”)
                    at [165]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Issue estoppel, in particular, is the doctrine which prevents
                        re-litigation of an issue which the court has already determined on the
                        merits in previous proceedings between the same parties (see <em>Blair v Curran</em> (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 531-532). In
                            <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v MCST Plan No
                            301</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 ... this court held that
                        the following requirements had to be met in order to establish issue
                        estoppel (at [14]-[15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    there must be a final and conclusive judgment
                                on the merits of the issue which is said to be the subject of an
                                estoppel;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    that judgment must be by a court of competent
                                jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the parties in the two actions that are being
                                compared must be identical; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    there must be identity of subject matter in
                                those two actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no dispute that the above case correctly sets
                    out the necessary requirements. As far as the argument that follows is
                    concerned, the only dispute as to whether these requirements have been met
                    relates to the first of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The question that arises is whether in
                    granting leave to appeal I did in fact “finally and conclusively”
                    determine the various issues raised in the leave application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     SCDA’s submission was that when deciding
                    whether to grant leave to appeal under s 49(3)(b) of the Act, the court
                    simply had to consider whether a “strong prima facie case”
                    existed: it did not have to make any final decision. SCDA relied on <em>Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd v Hiap Hong &amp; Co Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 510 (“<em>Hong Huat</em>”). In <em>Hong Huat</em>
                    at [40], the Court of Appeal noted that the discretion to grant leave to appeal
                    would be exercised differently according to the context in which the question of
                    law arose and stated at [41] that where the matter concerned a standard form
                    contract, the prospective appellants “need only show a strong <em>prima facie</em> case that the arbitrator is wrong in his
                    determination”. The question of law raised in <em>Hong
                        Huat</em> involved a standard form contract. In that respect, there is
                    no difference between the fact situation in <em>Hong
                        Huat</em> and that raised here since the Question involves the
                    Appointment Conditions which are standard form clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     
          <em>Hong Huat</em>,
                    however, was decided under the old Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev
                    Ed). Under the new Act, the test of “a strong prima facie case”
                    which was applied in the situation of standard form contracts or clauses has
                    been replaced with one of whether the arbitral tribunal’s decision is
                    “at least open to serious doubt”. I do not think that the change
                    in terminology makes a difference to the conclusiveness of the court’s
                    finding. It is clear to me that when the court decides that an
                    arbitrator’s decision is “at least open to serious doubt”,
                    the court does not make and cannot be making a “final and conclusive
                    judgment on the merits of the issue[s]” as required in <em>Lee Tat</em> to allow issue estoppel to operate. If the latter
                    position were correct, it would reduce the subsequent substantive appeal stage
                    to a “mere formality”, as SCDA rightly submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first instance decision of Bingham J
                    in <em>Tor Line A.B. v. Alltrans Group of Canada Ltd. (The
                        “TFL Prosperity”)</em> [1982] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 617 (“<em>The TFL Prosperity</em>”)
                    at 627 is also of interest in this context. There, Bingham J first granted leave
                    to appeal having found “a strong prima facie case”; then went
                    right on to dismiss the appeal without a further hearing. The case supports the
                    contention that granting leave to appeal is not akin to making a concluded
                    decision on the issues such that the appeal is bound to succeed and the judge is
                    precluded from dismissing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I am therefore satisfied that while in
                    deciding to grant Motor Image leave to appeal I might have come to certain
                    conclusions, those conclusions could not have been more than provisional and I
                    did not render any final and conclusive decisions on the issues raised. Such
                    decisions could only be given on the hearing of the appeal proper if the same
                    issues arose for consideration. This conclusion is also supported by <em>Hiscox v Outhwaite (No. 2)</em> [1991] 1 WLR 545
                    where Lord Donaldson MR stated at 547 that the judge at the leave to appeal
                    stage forms “provisional” views on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Therefore, SCDA is not estopped from bringing
                    up those issues again.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Challenge to factual premises of the Question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Motor Image took the position that on the
                    appeal, SCDA could not challenge the factual premises of the Question. It
                    contended that the appeal was only concerned with whether the Arbitrator had
                    erred and that the arguments and issues that were relevant at the leave stage
                    were not relevant at the appeal stage. In this context, it relied on the
                    following observation in D Rhidian homas, <em>Appeals from
                        Arbitration Awards</em> (Lloyd’s of London Press Ltd, 1994)
                        (“<em>Thomas</em>”) at [9.2.1]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a distinct and unambiguous difference between an application for
                        leave and the full appeal. The application for leave is concerned with the
                        question whether an appeal should be admitted into the judicature ... Where
                        leave to appeal is given the sole question before the court is whether the
                        award manifests an error of law, and if it does, to respond to the error in
                        any of the ways provided for in [the Arbitration Act]. At this stage the
                        history of the appeal and the policy associated with the initial question of
                        leave to appeal play no part. The sole question is whether the appellant has
                        established legal error in the award: the whole issue is one of right or
                        wrong ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Motor Image thus contended that on the appeal, SCDA could not
                    challenge the premises or terms of the Question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The discussion in relation to estoppel has,
                    however, established that the arguments and issues relevant at the leave to
                    appeal stage can still be relevant at the substantive appeal stage. It all
                    depends on the circumstances. Whilst the task of the judge on hearing the appeal
                    is to decide whether, as <em>Thomas</em> states, the award
                    manifests an error of law – in order to make that determination, the
                    appellate judge has to be satisfied regarding the factual basis from which the
                    alleged error stems. Therefore, the appellate judge may, depending on the
                    arguments, need to relook at the factual premises of the question. Further,
                    while the judge at the leave to appeal stage forms provisional views on merits,
                    the appellate judge must form final and conclusive views on the merits.
                    Therefore, the arguments on issues at the leave stage may very well be relevant
                    at the appeal stage as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There is a precedent for this approach in the
                    case of <em>Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd v Samwoh Resources Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2006] SGHC 43 (“<em>Ng Huat
                        Foundations</em>”) which I decided. In that case, I allowed
                    challenge of the factual premises of the question of law which the appellant was
                    granted leave under section 49(3)(b) to appeal on. I noted at [16] that
                    “the parties took different positions on what had been found by the
                    Arbitrator as a question of fact”, as is the case here, and went on to
                    find at [29] that the question of law was “misconceived” because
                    it was premised on facts that had not been found by the arbitrator and ignored
                    both his views on the facts and his factual findings. Although there were no
                    arguments on this point in <em>Ng Huat Foundations</em>, I
                    consider that the approach taken there was correct. If Motor Image was right, it
                    would mean that the court is asked at the leave stage to make final and
                    conclusive determinations at least regarding the factual premises underlying the
                    questions of law which the court gives leave to appeal on. It is not appropriate
                    to ask this of the court at the leave stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The leave stage functions as a time and
                    cost-saving filter against cases which are not even open to serious doubt. (See
                        <em>Antaios Compania SA v Salen Rederierna AB (The
                        Antaios)</em> [1985] AC 191 (“<em>The
                        Antaios</em>”) at 206G–207C, where Lord Diplock holds up
                    the practice of the House of Lords in dealing with petitions for leave to appeal
                    from judgment of the Court of Appeal in civil actions as an example to be
                    followed: “generally a brief oral hearing <em>inter
                        partes</em> is permitted of which the average duration is ten to
                    fifteen minutes; the parties are not allowed to use the hearing as an
                    opportunity to argue the appeal that is the subject of the petition.”).
                    Whilst arguments for leave in the courts here generally take somewhat longer
                    than 15 minutes, the court should hear only enough at the leave stage to adopt a
                    provisional view on the merits which allows it to decide whether a full-dress
                    hearing is warranted. To ask the court to hear enough at the leave stage to make
                    final and conclusive determinations would undermine the utility of the leave
                    stage as a filter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Motor Image argued that if SCDA were allowed
                    to revisit the issues that were argued at the leave stage, it would result in a
                    serious mockery of the process of the court and would effectively mean that the
                    application for leave and the exercise of framing the Question were a waste of
                    time. It would also mean that the principles that govern whether a party can
                    appeal a decision granting leave to appeal an arbitration award to the Court of
                    Appeal could be easily undermined. This court had rejected SCDA’s attempt
                    by SUM 5332/09 to appeal against the grant of leave and now SCDA would be
                    getting a second bite of the cherry because it was making the same arguments on
                    appeal that it had made in SUM 5332/09. This was an abuse of
                process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The argument that Motor Image has put forward
                    cannot stand, however, because it is based on the wrong premise. SCDA was not
                    allowed leave to appeal under s 49(7) because I accepted Motor
                    Image’s submissions that SCDA’s approach to the s 49(7)
                    application was misconceived. At that stage, Motor Image argued that leave to
                    appeal under s 49(7) is granted only if the statutory guidelines governing
                    leave to appeal to the High Court under s 49(5) required some elucidation.
                    It cited English authorities on the English statutory equivalents (<em>eg The Antaios</em> at 205; <em>CMA CGM SA v
                        Beteiligungs-Kommanditgesellschaft MS “Northern Pioneer”
                        Schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Co. and Others</em> [2003]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 212 at 216-217.) However, SCDA did not make
                    submissions relating to whether s 49(5) required some elucidation. Rather,
                    it made submissions relevant to the present substantive appeal: for example,
                    that the Question was not based on findings of fact in the Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I was persuaded by the English authorities
                    which Motor Image cited at the s 49(7) leave to appeal stage and considered
                    that they should be applied to the interpretation of s 49(7). That is the
                    main reason why SCDA was not granted leave to appeal under s 49(7). The
                    fact that SCDA made irrelevant arguments during the hearing of SUM 5332/09
                    cannot, however, prevent it from making those same arguments on this substantive
                    appeal as long as they are relevant to this appeal. As I have stated above, the
                    arguments are relevant arguments and must be considered on this
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Motor Image submitted that to allow SCDA to
                    reprise its arguments would mean its failure to obtain leave to appeal under
                    s 49(7) was of no consequence. This is not true. The consequence of
                    SCDA’s failure was that it expended its opportunity to convince the Court
                    of Appeal to further elucidate s 49(5) of the Act in a manner which might
                    have led to the reversal of my decision to grant Motor Image leave to appeal
                    under s 49(3)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In the circumstances, there is in my judgment
                    no abuse of process on the part of SCDA in raising questions as to the factual
                    findings of the Award as part of its case on this substantive
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The substantive appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Arbitrator find as a fact that SCDA had agreed with Motor
                Image to call for tenders based on the third submission drawings?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     SCDA based its bill to Motor Image on the
                    lowest tender received in response to the Main Contract Tender. The drawings
                    used for the Main Contract Tender were not the same as the third submission
                    drawings. The premise of the Question is that there was an agreed set of
                    drawings for the Main Contract Tender but SCDA did not use those. To reprise,
                    the Question reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where an architect who is engaged under the
                    Singapore Institute of Architects Conditions of Appointment and
                    Architect’s Services and Mode of Payment (“the Appointment
                    Conditions”) has agreed with his client to call for tenders based on an
                    agreed set of drawings but instead calls for and receives tenders based on a
                    different set of drawings, is the architect entitled to fees based on the lowest
                    of the tenders under or by reference to clause 1.3(3)(b) of the Appointment
                    Conditions?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In order for the Question to be raised on an appeal
                    against the Award, it must arise out of a finding of fact in the Award.
                    SCDA’s main contention in the appeal was that the Question did not come
                    out of such a finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     SCDA argued that the Arbitrator never found
                    that there was an agreement between the parties that the third submission
                    drawings should be used as the basis for the Main Contract Tender. Instead, the
                    Award described the exact opposite: that Motor Image knew and agreed to base the
                    Main Contract Tender on the 29 June 2005 drawings. SCDA argued that the
                    Arbitrator had found that Motor Image had agreed to a “concurrent
                    process” for both the submission to the URA and the tender process. It
                    continued to be “concurrent” at the time of the Main Contract
                    Tender and could be regularised later by amendment or waiver, this being part of
                    the normal design and approval process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Motor Image disputed the contention that the
                    Arbitrator had found that Motor Image had instructed SCDA to call for tenders
                    based on the 29 June 2005 drawings. It argued that the Arbitrator could not have
                    made such a finding given that he had dismissed Motor Image’s defence of
                    illegality in the Arbitration. This was that SCDA had tried to mislead the URA
                    and had acted illegally by submitting the third submission drawings when it knew
                    that what Motor Image actually wanted was the design shown in the 29 June
                    2005 drawings. In response to that defence, SCDA had argued that in late July
                    2005, Motor Image had decided to build, and therefore to call for tenders, based
                    on the third submission drawings and instructed SCDA to proceed on that basis.
                    Given those instructions, SCDA argued, SCDA did not mislead the URA and did not
                    act illegally in submitting the third submission drawings. Motor Image then
                    stated that the Arbitrator had accepted SCDA’s case that Motor Image had
                    from late July 2005 decided to build and call for tenders based on the third
                    submission drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Secondly, Motor Image argued that SCDA’s
                    contention that the Arbitrator had found that Motor Image had instructed SCDA to
                    call for tenders based on the 29 June 2005 drawings was not correct in the
                    light of SCDA’s own case in the Arbitration (which the Arbitrator
                    accepted) that it had intended to prepare the tender drawings based on the third
                    submission drawings and had left the 29 June 2005 drawings in the tender
                    drawings by mistake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Thirdly, Motor Image argued that SCDA’s
                    contention was baseless given the Arbitrator’s dismissal of Motor
                    Image’s contention that even after the second submission was rejected, it
                    had instructed SCDA at a meeting on 28 July 2005 that it still wanted only
                    the design in the 29 June 2005 drawings and SCDA had assured it that that
                    could be achieved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any event, Motor Image said, even if the
                    Arbitrator did find that it had instructed SCDA to call for tenders based on the
                    29 June 2005 drawings, that would not help SCDA. It was clear that the
                    tender drawings were not fully based on the 29 June 2005 drawings: they
                    consisted of a patchwork of 29 June 2005 drawings and the third submission
                    drawings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     To an extent, Motor Image’s arguments
                    miss the point. Although SCDA argued that the parties had agreed to base the
                    tender on the 29 June 2005 drawings, the Question assumes that the
                    Arbitrator found that the agreed drawings for the tender were the third
                    submission drawings and that other drawings (unspecified) were used instead of
                    the third submission drawings. The basic fact for the appeal therefore would be
                    whether the Arbitrator found as a fact that the third submission drawings were
                    the ones that were needed to be used for the Main Contract Tender. If he found
                    this fact and then found the further fact that the drawings used for the Main
                    Contract Tender were not the third submission drawings, it does not matter
                    whether he found that the tender drawings were the 29 June 2005 drawings or
                    a composite of the 29 June 2005 drawings and the third submission drawings
                    or, for that matter, any other set of drawings that may have been floating
                    around SCDA’s office. I must therefore in my consideration of the Award
                    concentrate on whether it contains a finding that the third submission drawings
                    were to be the agreed basis of the Main Contract Tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I should first note that the Question was not
                    before the Arbitrator. I have set out the various defences that Motor Image put
                    forward to resist SCDA’s claim. In none of those defences did it say
                    directly that the fees claimed were not earned because it had instructed SCDA to
                    use the third submission drawings for the Main Contract Tender and SCDA had used
                    other drawings instead. Such an assertion would have placed the issue before me
                    squarely before the Arbitrator as well. What the Arbitrator thought had been
                    argued has to be gleaned from his findings and comments on the other defences
                    raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Although Motor Image argued at the Arbitration
                    that the Main Contract Tender was not <em>bona fide</em>
                    because the tender drawings were based on the 29 June 2005 drawings instead
                    of the third submission drawings, this argument was related to the illegality
                    argument and was not an assertion that SCDA had gone against its express
                    instructions to use the third submission drawings for the Main Contract Tender.
                    The Arbitrator rejected the assertion that the Main Contract Tender was not
                        <em>bona fide</em> by finding that there was a
                    legitimate concurrent process at work right through the period during which the
                    tenders were held and that Motor Image was fully informed and well aware of this
                    at all times. This is a consistent theme running through the
                Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The following excerpts from the Award, some of
                    which are repeated from <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above, are

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Bona fide tender</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Motor Image’s] contention was that the Main Contract tender was
                        based on drawings they had received on 29 June 2005 and not based on the 3rd
                        submission drawings. The design in the drawings received on 29 June 2005 was
                        what [Motor Image] wanted but in their mind “would not be
                        approved”. [Motor Image] further content [<em>sic</em>] that the 3rd submission drawings which later obtained
                        approval “were not what [Motor Image] wanted”. This position
                        is unreasonable. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had earlier concluded that there were two concurrent processes going on
                        at the time of tendering, one for planning application and the other for
                        tender. The tender drawings were based on design and drawings received by
                        [Motor Image] on 29 June 2005. This design was clearly what [Motor Image]
                        wanted. Just because the tender was not based on drawings submitted to URA
                        does not make it a non bona fide tender? [<em>sic</em>]
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the stages of the service were done with the full knowledge and
                        agreement of [Motor Image]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Nowhere in any of the above excerpts from the
                    Award or anywhere else in the Award does the Arbitrator find either that Motor
                    Image had instructed SCDA, or the parties had agreed, to use the third
                    submission drawings for the purpose of the Main Contract Tender. Indeed, as SCDA
                    submitted, the Arbitrator’s finding of fact was the opposite <em>ie</em> that the third submission drawings were not to be
                    used for the Main Contract Tender. The third submission drawings were used to
                    get URA approval with the intention that during the development process,
                    amendments could possibly be approved which would bring the building actually
                    constructed more in line with what Motor Image actually wanted – which was
                    encompassed in the drawings of 29 June 2005 which in turn were, basically,
                    the drawings used for the Main Contract Tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Motor Image took the position that by the time
                    of the Main Contract Tender, it had instructed SCDA to use the third submission
                    drawings for the tender instead of the 29 June 2005 drawings which Motor
                    Image and SCDA “had clearly discarded and abandoned.” In other
                    words, according to Motor Image, by that stage, only one set of drawings was
                    relevant for the planning application process and the tender process: the third
                    submission drawings. This is inconsistent with what the Arbitrator held in the
                    Award: that there were two different sets of drawings used for the two
                    concurrent processes which were “going on at the time of
                    tendering”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Arbitrator provided the last nail in the
                    coffin of Motor Image’s case under the heading “Which tender to use
                    for computing Architect’s fees”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In arriving at my decision, I had taken into consideration that [Motor
                        Image] did agreed [<em>sic</em>] with all the
                        submissions including calling of Main Contract Tender and [Tender
                        No 2]. At no time was [SCDA] stopped for unsatisfactory service.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This plainly suggests that the Arbitrator
                    found that Motor Image agreed with SCDA’s calling of the Main Contract
                    Tender and did not raise any of the present issues then. In the face of such
                    strong language in the Award, Motor Image cited page 8 of the Award to be read
                    with a series of excerpts from SCDA’s pleadings and submissions. Page 8 of
                    the Award makes reference to the third submission drawings but does not suggest
                    that Motor Image instructed SCDA to use the third submission drawings instead of
                    the 29 June 2005 drawings as a basis to call the Main Contract
                    Tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     SCDA’s closing submissions in the
                    Arbitration had sought to establish that the third submission drawings were
                    prepared and submitted to the URA with approval from Motor Image. This is
                    consistent with the Arbitrator’s finding that “[a]ll the stages of
                    the service were done with the full knowledge and agreement of [Motor
                    Image].” This does not show, however, that SCDA agreed with Motor Image
                    to base the Main Contract Tender on the third submission drawings instead of the
                    29 June 2005 drawings. In any case, what is relevant to the present
                    discussion is what the Arbitrator held, and not what the parties
                    submitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Having mined the Award several times, I am
                    unable to find a finding of fact that would support the premise of the Question.
                    On the hearing of the leave to appeal application, whilst this issue was raised,
                    I was more concerned with the proper interpretation of Condition 1.3(3)(b) and
                    this concern was part of the reason for allowing the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having now had the time and opportunity to
                    consider the position and the Award in more detail, I am satisfied that the
                    Question is not appropriate because it is premised on facts that were not found
                    by the Arbitrator and ignores his factual findings as well as his view of the
                    facts. The difficulty that Motor Image faced on the appeal is that the case it
                    now seeks to run was not foreshadowed in its pleadings and submissions for the
                    Arbitration. Indeed, some of the points it made before the Arbitrator are
                    inconsistent with its present stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the event this appeal must be dismissed
                    with costs. I do not express any opinion on the substantive questions of
                    interpretation raised in the course of the appeal as an interpretation exercise
                    can only be conducted in the light of relevant facts. There are no such facts at
                    present.</p>
