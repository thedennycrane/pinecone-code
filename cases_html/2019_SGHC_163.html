</div> Between 24 February 2014 and 2 June 2014, Pan made part payments to the plaintiff on behalf of SVM, Feasto and Mizimegah, amounting to $400,000 in total.

The loans to SVM, Feasto and Mizimegah could not be sham transactions. The fact that the three companies in turn loaned the monies to Pan was an entirely separate matter altogether. Indeed, SVM did regard itself as having loaned monies to Pan. SVM’s lawyers sent a letter of demand dated 17 February 2014 to Pan demanding that Pan repay the sum of $400,000 that Pan had borrowed from SVM.

</div> As discussed in greater detail in [35]–[42] below, the prohibition against unlicensed moneylending under the MLA does not apply to persons who lend money solely to corporations. I rejected the Defendants’ submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 None of the Defendants had specifically pleaded that the loans to the three companies were a sham for this reason. Scarlett did not make this specific allegation in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief either. This allegation was made only during oral closing submissions and had not been put to the plaintiff or his witnesses in cross-examination. In my view, it was not open to the Defendants to argue, in closing submissions, that the loans to the three companies were a sham for this reason. In any event, this argument would not have succeeded. As stated in [24] above, the evidence showed that the plaintiff gave the loans to SVM, Feasto and Mizimegah because he wanted collateral for the loans and these companies owned the properties that could be and were used as the collateral.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Guarantee should be set aside on the ground of unconscionability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 To rely on the defence of unconscionability to vitiate an agreement, it must be shown that one party was suffering from an infirmity that was exploited by the other party: <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span> at [142]. Scarlett claimed that she was led to believe that Tang was her lawyer and acting in her and the companies’ interests, and this constituted an infirmity sufficient to invoke the doctrine of unconscionability. I rejected the defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I was not satisfied that Scarlett had relied on Tang as her lawyer. This was just a bare allegation. There was no evidence that Tang or Lester had said or done anything that would have led her to believe that Tang was acting for her at the 26 September meeting. On the contrary, the facts suggested otherwise. The plaintiff was not even present at the meeting. Clearly, Tang was representing the plaintiff at the meeting. Tang was also the one who handed the plaintiff’s cheques to Scarlett.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In any event, in my view, Scarlett’s alleged reliance on Tang as her lawyer was not an “infirmity” for the purposes of the defence of unconscionability. While a person need not be poor and ignorant to invoke the ground of unconscionability, any infirmity relied upon must be of sufficient gravity as to have acutely affected that party’s ability to protect his interests: <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span> at [141]. Scarlett was not under such an infirmity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Further, even assuming that she was under an infirmity when she signed the Guarantee, there was no evidence of exploitation of that infirmity by Tang as the plaintiff’s agent. Scarlett was a well-educated, reasonably experienced businesswoman, and a careful person. She knew she was signing a guarantee and what a guarantee meant. She also knew the loans were being given to the three companies and that the Guarantee was for these loans. In my view, she signed the Guarantee willingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Guarantee should be set aside on the ground of non est factum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The defence of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> was easily disposed of. It is well-accepted that two requirements must be satisfied before one can invoke this doctrine: first, there must be a radical difference between what was signed and what was thought to have been signed, and second, the party relying on the doctrine must prove that he was not negligent in signing the document: <span class="font-italic">Mahidon Nichiar bte Mohd Ali v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin</span> [2015] 5 SLR 62 at [119].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Scarlett confirmed under cross-examination that she knew the document was titled “Deed of Guarantee”, and that she understood what a guarantee meant. However, she claimed that the Guarantee was not explained to her and she did not read it. The law is clear that in these circumstances, the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> is not available to her. In <span class="font-italic">Kuek Siew Chew v Kuek Siang Wei </span>[2015] 1 SLR 396 (“<span class="font-italic">Kuek Siew Chew</span>”), the court held that a deed of consent was binding on a signatory who had knowledge of the general nature and effect of the deed prior to signing it, even though the signatory had not read the document and its terms were not explained (at [58]–[60]). Like the signatory in <span class="font-italic">Kuek Siew Chew</span>, Scarlett clearly knew the effect of the Guarantee prior to signing it. There was no radical difference between what she signed and what she believed herself to be signing. Accordingly, the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est factum</span> failed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the loans were unlicensed moneylending transactions under MLA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The final defence, and the main plank of the Defendants’ case, was that the plaintiff was an unlicensed moneylender. Unlicensed moneylending is prohibited under s 5 of the MLA. If the loans to SVM, Feasto and Mizimegah were unlicensed moneylending transactions, the result would be that both the loans and the Guarantee would be unenforceable under s 14(2) of the MLA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Under s 3 of the MLA, a person is presumed to be a moneylender if he “lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid”. The Defendants argued that the plaintiff had charged interest and that therefore the presumption of moneylending under s 3 of the MLA applied. Consequently, the burden would fall on the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by proving that he was not carrying on the business of moneylending: <span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 524 at [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 There was some evidence that the plaintiff had charged interest. In her text message to Scarlett, sometime in December 2013, Pan stated that she had paid $40,000 to the plaintiff as interest, apparently in connection with obtaining an extension of the loan duration until 23 December 2013.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff denied having charged interest. He claimed that the loans were given using the proceeds from the sale of his house at Mount Sinai and were not extended for any financial gain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I found it hard to believe that the plaintiff, a retiree of some 20 years, would have agreed to lend a substantial sum of $800,000 to three companies owned by persons who were strangers to him, without charging interest for the risk he was taking. The plaintiff claimed that he simply wanted to pay back to society. I could not see how lending to strangers for commercial purposes could be said to be paying back to society. Indeed, the fact that the plaintiff had extracted onerous terms in the OTPs to secure the loans, contradicted his altruistic claims. Under the terms of the OTPs, not only would the plaintiff have the option of taking over the purchase of the companies’ uncompleted units at a substantially reduced price, the loans extended to the three companies would still be repayable upon exercise of the OTPs.

</div> This, in my view, was an unusually harsh term to impose for someone claiming that he only wanted to help others. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 However, it was not necessary for me to make a finding on whether interest was in fact charged on the loans. Neither s 3 nor s 14(2) applies to an “excluded moneylender”. Section 3 expressly excludes an excluded moneylender from its scope, as does the definition of the term “moneylender” in s 2. An “excluded moneylender” refers, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to any person who lends money solely to corporations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the present case, the loans were made to three corporations. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was in the business of making loans to any non-corporate entities. In fact, there was no evidence that the plaintiff had made any other loans at all. The plaintiff was therefore an excluded moneylender and as such did not fall within the definition of a “moneylender” in s 2 of the MLA, and the presumption of moneylending under s 3 also did not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In their closing submissions, the Defendants submitted that the plaintiff was not an excluded moneylender because the loans were made to Pan.
