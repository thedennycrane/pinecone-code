Foo”), appeals against the decision of the judge below (the “Judge”), who found him liable in negligence in relation to the liposuction and fat transfer surgical procedure (“surgical procedures”) carried out by him on 28 June 2013 on his patient, Ms Mandy Yeong (“the Deceased”) and her death about 3 hours 46 minutes after the surgical procedures ended. Dr Foo also appeals against the consequent award of damages in the sum of $5,599,557.48 (plus coroner’s inquiry (“CI”) fees to be taxed if not agreed) together with interest and costs. The Judge’s decision is reported in <span class="font-italic">Seto Wei Meng (suing as the administrator of the estate and on behalf of the dependants of Yeong Soek Mun, deceased) and another v Foo Chee Boon Edward and </span><span class="font-italic">others (Singapore General Hospital Pte Ltd, third party)</span> [2020] SGHC 260 (the “Judgment”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The first respondent is the Deceased’s husband, Mr Seto Wei Meng (“Mr Seto”), while the second respondent is Mr Seto’s father. Mr Seto and the second respondent are the administrator and co-administrator of the Deceased’s estate respectively. The action was brought by the respondents on behalf of the estate of the Deceased as well as the Deceased’s dependants. The dependants included the Deceased’s parents (her father having died some three years four months after the Deceased’s death); the two sons of the marriage (named Marcus and Melvin); and Mr Seto, who claimed for loss of support for household expenses, expenses related to the “Hilloft” condominium property which was jointly owned by the Deceased and Mr Seto (“Hilloft property”), and the loss of car expenses. Mr Seto also brought a loss of inheritance claim under s 22(1A) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Deceased was 44 years of age when she died. At the time of her death, she was the Head of Regional Market Development at Roche Diagnostics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Roche”), where she had worked for the past 20 years. Her performance appraisals show that she was a valued officer of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Dr Foo is a general and vascular surgeon in private practice. The surgical procedures were carried out at TCS Aesthetics Central Clinic (“the Clinic”), located at The Central, Eu Tong Sen Street. The second defendant was a company that held the licence to operate the Clinic and the third defendant was its collection agent. As both companies subsequently went into liquidation, the action against them has been stayed. Dr Foo had brought in the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) as a third party but he discontinued this third party claim on the last day of the evidentiary hearings before the Judge.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In their statement of claim, the respondents allege that Dr Foo was negligent in three respects. First, Dr Foo failed to obtain the Deceased’s informed consent and did not properly advise her on the risks and complications associated with the surgical procedures; furthermore, Dr Foo failed to explain that the surgical procedures would entail a higher risk of fat embolism, particularly as it involved a repeat procedure. Secondly, Dr Foo was negligent in carrying out the surgical procedures. Thirdly, Dr Foo was negligent in his post-operative management and care of the Deceased by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, failing to call for an ambulance in time. Dr Foo denied all three allegations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 It should be noted that, in relation to the first allegation of negligence, the Deceased had two previous cosmetic procedures (this is not in dispute). The first was liposuction performed by Dr Richard Teo on 29 July 2010. Dr Richard Teo was one of the two shareholders of the second defendant. Dr Richard Teo subsequently passed away. The second involved liposuction and fat transfer and was performed by Dr Foo on 18 July 2011. These procedures were carried out because the Deceased had “hollows” on both her medial and lateral thighs with surface irregularities which she hoped could be remedied by these procedures. However, the 2011 procedure was not entirely successful and there were resulting “dents” in the Deceased’s inner medial thigh. The Deceased thus consulted Dr Foo again on 28 May 2013 and complained of residual hollows on both inner thighs. The suggestion was then to remove the bulge of fat on the front anterior abdomen and transfer that onto the dents of her upper medial thighs. We mention this because this repeat procedure on the thighs could be considered more difficult due to scar tissue caused by the earlier procedure on the thighs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The following facts are not in dispute, save where indicated. Dr Foo carried out the surgical procedures from 12.00pm to 2.00pm on 28 June 2013 at the Clinic. While the Judge found as a fact that the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level was 100% at 2.00pm (see Judgment at [19]), the objective evidence based on the photograph of the vital signs monitor screen shows that the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level was 96% at 2.00pm.

</div> Very shortly after the surgical procedures were completed, the Deceased was in difficulty, variously described as coughing and making a gurgling sound and experiencing a shortness of breath.

</div> It is common ground that, at 2.05pm, the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level plunged to 72% (from 96% at 2.00pm when the surgical procedures ended). At 2.10pm, Dr Chow Yuen Ho (“Dr Chow”) was called in to assist as the Deceased’s oxygen saturation was not improving. Dr Chow came into the operating theatre at 2.10pm and the Deceased’s oxygen saturation was still at 72%. Dr Chow deposes that he noticed the Deceased was already wearing a venti-mask attached to an oxygen tank; he changed that to an air-viva (bag and mask) as he felt it would be more beneficial as it had a better seal.

</div> There is no recording or documentation of the Deceased’s oxygen saturation after 2.30pm. Slightly after 2.30pm, Dr Shenthilkumar s/o Sritharan Naidu (“Dr Shenthilkumar”) was called into the operating theatre for assistance by Dr Chow. Dr Shenthilkumar saw that the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level was at 92%. Dr Shenthilkumar noted the Deceased was blabbering, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, she could not be understood. The Judge noted that Dr Shenthilkumar alleged that he had advised Dr Foo to call an ambulance (see Judgment at [20]), but the evidence indicates instead that Dr Shenthilkumar told Dr Chow to call for the ambulance while Dr Foo was in listening range; in addition, Dr Chow himself also told Dr Foo to call an ambulance.

</div>
</div>
</div> Either way, the Judge rightly noted that unfortunately this sensible advice was either not heard or disregarded by Dr Foo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Judge found that the Deceased suffered a collapse in the cardiovascular sense at 2.45pm (see Judgment at [23]), though the respondents’ case and the State Coroner’s finding is that the Deceased “collapsed” earlier at 2.30pm. We see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding. Dr Foo called for the ambulance at 2.53pm. The ambulance arrived at the Clinic in just four minutes and its crew were attending to the Deceased by 3.10pm. The Deceased was conveyed to the Accident and Emergency (“A&amp;E”) Department at SGH; the ambulance arrived there at 3.23pm. The Deceased passed away at about 5.46pm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Deceased’s cause of death was pulmonary fat embolism (“PFE”), a condition where fat globules have entered a patient’s blood vessels and obstruct or block the continuous blood flow within the blood vessels and/or cause inflammation of the blood vessels. The net result is an interruption to the blood bringing oxygen to the lungs thereby causing oxygen starvation to the body. The medical evidence shows that the blockage of the blood flow in the pulmonary vessels affects the heart which can lead to right-sided heart failure (see [33(e)] below). This happened to the Deceased, as found by the Judge, at 2.45pm.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The trial before the Judge took some 15 days. The doctors mentioned above gave evidence, as did Dr Lim Jia Hao (“Dr Lim”) from the A&amp;E department of SGH. There was expert medical evidence presented to the Judge and there were a number of issues that were hotly contested before the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 One of the contested issues was the incidence of PFE in the surgical procedures carried out in this case. Whilst it is undisputed that PFE is a known risk in these surgical procedures, it is uncommon for it to cause symptomatic problems. According to the medical evidence, there are two forms of fat embolism syndrome (“FES”): a less serious form, known as non-fulminant FES, and a far more serious form known as fulminant FES (“FFES”), which “presents as acute cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and/or embolic phenomena leading to death within a few hours of injury”.

</div>
</div> The Deceased died from the latter, FFES. The survival rate from FFES was also hotly contested. Another hotly contested issue and finding by the Judge was the cause of the Deceased’s FFES and whether Dr Foo had inadvertently introduced the fat globules directly into the Deceased’s blood stream. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 There were other contested issues. This included whether the Deceased was properly advised of the risks of the surgical procedures she was going to undergo and whether the Deceased signed the consent forms, which warned of the risks of the surgical procedures, before Dr Foo. Dr Foo alleges that he had advised the Deceased of these risks at the time she signed the consent forms in his presence. The Judge noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, and we agree with him, that Dr Foo’s notes of that consultation made no reference to any such advice, they barely covered half a page and they concerned the surgical and medical fees.

This is not a conclusion anyone could draw from the evidence presented in this case as well as the expert medical evidence before the Judge. It is noteworthy that Dr Foo did not submit any specific data for FFES found in the medical literature to support his contention. On the contrary, as we shall point out below, the medical literature placed before the court even included a case of FFES which, <span class="font-italic">with timely detection</span>, survived apparently without any ill effects (see [28] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The surgical procedures ended at 2.00pm. By 2.05pm, just five minutes later, the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level had plummeted to 72%. The expert medical evidence is that normal oxygen saturation levels should be around 96% or 95%. In a medical context, even a drop to 92% is a matter of great concern; Associate Professor Lim Thiam Chye (“A/Prof Lim”), an expert called by the respondents, gave evidence, which was not contradicted by any of the other doctors who gave evidence, or challenged by Dr Foo, that such an event becomes a matter of great concern and everyone would crowd into the operating theatre to ascertain the cause of the drop.

</div> There was thus evidence to support the Judge’s finding that the Deceased arrived at the A&amp;E department of SGH too late to be saved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 We also agree with the Judge’s finding below that Dr Foo was not <span class="font-italic">au</span><span class="font-italic"> fait</span> with that potential problem of FES, let alone FFES, and was unable to recognise what had occurred to the Deceased when her oxygen saturation level plummeted to 72% and she was coughing, making gurgling sounds and unable to articulate what was wrong. We concur with the Judge’s finding that this accounted for the 48 minutes of frantic exploration by Dr Foo in the vain hope that her oxygen saturation levels would improve instead of calling for the ambulance despite being asked to do so by Dr Chow and Dr Shenthilkumar. The clear evidence of A/Prof Lim and Dr Boey was that fat embolism had occurred and Dr Foo did not recognise this and never considered it a possibility. Even after the Deceased “collapsed” at 2.45pm, Dr Foo took another eight minutes before deciding to call for the ambulance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Dr Foo contends that the appropriate time to have called the ambulance was 2.45pm and not any earlier because (a) there was medical equipment available and put to use at the Clinic to assist the Deceased, which distinguishes this from a collapse on a public road; (b) there were doctors at the Clinic; (c) reasonable time was needed to exclude the other probable diagnoses that require urgent attention; and (d) FES was extremely rare and FFES was much rarer. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dr Foo’s breach of duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We state at the outset that none of Dr Foo’s contentions have any substance or validity and must be soundly rejected. The expert medical evidence is unequivocal and consistent. First and foremost, all the doctors who gave evidence held the view or agreed that Dr Foo should have called for an ambulance immediately or very soon after the onset of the Deceased’s symptoms. Significantly, the first two doctors called in to help with the emergency situation that had developed, Dr Chow and Dr Shenthilkumar, although coming into the operating room at different times, came to the same conclusion upon assessing the situation, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, there was an immediate need to call an ambulance. Secondly, Dr Foo had no valid excuse to delay calling for an ambulance in those critical 48 minutes (2.05pm to 2.53pm). As the medical evidence shows, there was every reason to do so quickly and no reason to delay that call. Thirdly, it is our clear conclusion and our key finding that, once the Deceased exhibited the symptoms that she did at 2.05pm, because FES or FFES was a live possibility (see [25] below), Dr Foo should have immediately called for an ambulance to get the Deceased to a tertiary hospital. The failure to call for an ambulance until 2.53pm was inexcusable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The truth is that the possibility of FES or FFES did not occur to Dr Foo at all when the Deceased started exhibiting the symptoms described above at 2.05pm (see Judgment at [26]). That was the evidence of Dr Boey and that was the finding of the Judge after hearing and considering all the evidence; we are in complete agreement with the Judge on that finding of fact. In fact, from the medical literature adduced, the view, which we accept, is that “physicians should have a high index of suspicion for FES following liposuction” (Md Saon <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, “Pulmonary Fat Embolism Syndrome After Liposuction Surgery” (2019) Clinical Pulmonary Medicine Vol 26(1) at p 32 (“Pulmonary Fat Embolism Syndrome After Liposuction Surgery”)).

</div> This was also the view of the SGH cardiothoracic surgery registrar, Dr Soo Ing Xiang (“Dr Soo”) who was on call when the Deceased arrived at SGH (see [33(e)] below). Dr Soo said that “fat embolism is something we do think of, especially during liposuction”. Dr Foo was clearly in breach of his duty of care to the Deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Dr Foo’s submission that the Clinic had available medical equipment which was put to use is without any substance whatsoever. The specialist medical and resuscitative equipment, available medical expertise and facilities at a tertiary institution, like SGH, were unarguably superior compared to what was available at the Clinic; see Judgment at [33] which Dr Foo does not challenge in this appeal. To make comparisons with a collapse along a public road was a red herring. The fact is that the Clinic did not have the medical equipment and facilities that SGH had, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the ECMO. We have referred to Dr Chow’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) at [7] above which refers to the use of a venti-mask and later an air-viva (bag mask and valve). Dr Chow and Dr Shenthilkumar, who had been called in to help Dr Foo at different junctures, both asked Dr Foo to call an ambulance. The reason for this is self-evident. They certainly did not believe the medical equipment and facilities in the Clinic were adequate to cope with the difficulties the Deceased was experiencing. Dr Chow also deposed to the ambulance crew changing the Deceased’s mask with a “laryngeal mask, intubating [the Deceased]”.

</div> By implication, the Clinic did not possess a laryngeal mask or Dr Chow or Dr Shenthilkumar would have used it. Further, SGH, the largest hospital in Singapore, was not all that far away. Neither Dr Chow nor Dr Shenthilkumar needed a “reasonable” time of some 45 minutes to exclude other diagnoses that would have required more urgent attention. The undeniable fact remains that the Deceased was suffering from FES or FFES and Dr Foo did not recognise nor consider that a possibility. This is indeed ironic when his printed consent form, which he claims he went through with the Deceased, mentions both FES and FFES.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Dr Foo also cannot claim that the measures taken by him or his fellow doctors did alleviate the Deceased’s oxygen saturation levels, and that hence there was no immediate need to call for the ambulance. Even if it were true that the oxygen saturation level did reach 86% and 92% at some points in time, this did not assist Dr Foo’s case for two reasons. First, even 92% would be a level of great concern, as mentioned at [16] above. Secondly, and more importantly, as A/Prof Lim testified, even if the oxygen saturation level goes up, if the underlying cause or problem is not resolved, it can drop again.

</div> It is self-evident, as the Judge rightly found (see Judgment at [24]), that there was nothing to stop Dr Foo from calling for the ambulance whilst simultaneously trying to diagnose the problem. If Dr Foo was indeed cognisant of the potential possibility of FES, as he attempts to submit, then it is even more inexcusable for Dr Foo not to have called the ambulance at 2.05pm or shortly thereafter. That certainly was the most obvious action called for in the evidence of Dr Chow, at 2.05pm and later Dr Shenthilkumar when he came into the operating theatre shortly after 2.30pm. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Causation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Dr Foo denies causation in the death of the Deceased. On his submission, once the Deceased suffered from FFES, the Deceased was doomed anyway, even if the ambulance was called at 2.05pm. We categorically reject this submission. We digress to make a point here. It is normally incumbent on the plaintiff to prove causation and this may often not be difficult or even contested. But here it is Dr Foo who mounts an affirmative case that, even if he was in breach of his duty as we have found, there would be no causation because she was suffering from FFES. In short, it is his affirmative case that a patient with FFES was bound to die. This leads to two points. First, there was evidence before the Judge that FFES is a very rare occurrence and it happens when fat is injected into the vein. Secondly, a properly conducted liposuction procedure should not result in fat being injected into the veins and if it had happened here, we would have been prepared to find that the most plausible explanation, and certainly on a balance of probabilities, was that Dr Foo had negligently injected fat directly into the Deceased’s vein. Mr Sreenivasan SC conceded, correctly in our view, that, if the cause of the Deceased’s FFES was Dr Foo’s negligence in injecting fat directly into her veins, then there was no break in the chain of causation between that act and her death. But leaving this to one side, the evidence simply did not support Dr Foo’s contention that once the Deceased had FFES, however it was caused, she was doomed to die and that there was absolutely nothing that could be done to save her. We reiterate that it is incumbent on Dr Foo to make good this assertion because it is his positive case that this was so. In truth it is not supported by the expert and medical evidence, which is that FFES is <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessarily fatal. Fatality usually occurs when the doctor performing the liposuction and/or fat transfer fails to recognise that FES or FFES has occurred and there is undue delay in getting the patient to a hospital which would have the necessary equipment to help the patient recover. As noted above, it is telling that the respondents’ trial closing submissions made the point that Dr Foo was unable to produce any medical literature with data for FFES to support his contention that the onset of FFES meant death was inevitable.

The article reports on the case of a 21-year-old Asian college student who underwent elective liposuction surgery under general anaesthesia. He “presented with symptoms” and was intubated and put on oxygen. One hour after extubation, he became breathless and hypoxia worsened with an oxygen saturation level of 50%. He was transferred to an adjacent hospital’s accident and emergency centre and was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. When he was admitted to the hospital of the authors of the article, his oxygen saturation level was 76%. He was intubated and oxygen was supplied by Ambu bagging and supportive care with mechanical ventilation and, <span class="font-italic">three</span> days later, his medical condition had improved.

The authors state that clinicians should distinguish between acute FFES and other FES.

First, A/Prof Lim went on immediately to explain that the statistics he had given had to be viewed in context. Pulmonary embolism from liposuction occurred quite frequently but if one took a select group who had injuries due to liposuction in large tertiary referral centres, then that would report death rates of close to 20%. However, if one took statistics from all the cases in the United States, which had close to 300,000 cases per year, then that figure was only about 1% to 5% depending on which paper one looked at. Dr Boey’s testimony was that FFES was “so rare that we don’t get enough data on it.”

Dr Foo only called for an ambulance some 48 minutes after the onset of grave and severe symptoms at 2.05pm and some eight minutes <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Deceased had suffered a collapse in a cardiovascular sense in the Clinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 There was no dissonance in the chorus of voices from the doctors who gave evidence that getting the Deceased to the hospital quickly would have made a difference. This makes no sense at all if, as Dr Foo contends, there was nothing that could possibly have saved the patient once she had FFES. In fact, the weight of the medical evidence is best summed up by Dr Foo’s own expert, Dr Ramasami. As noted above, to the question if earlier access to full circulatory and respiratory support for the Deceased would have made a difference to the outcome, he unequivocally answered, “Of course, yes.”

</div> There was little dispute over this item of claim by Dr Foo and the Judge found that there was no evidence that Mr Seto is renting or intends to rent out the Hilloft property (Judgment at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Before us, Ms Kuah Boon Theng SC (“Ms Kuah SC”), counsel for the respondents, informed us that, although this was an investment property, Mr Seto and the Deceased decided to use the Hilloft property as a recreational weekend home as it was a cluster housing project with full recreational facilities.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Hilloft property expenses encompassed two aspects: (a) mortgage payments for the outstanding loan on the property; and (b) property-related expenses including (i) the condominium maintenance fees; (ii) property insurance; and (iii) property tax. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The mortgage instalment payments may superficially be seen as a “benefit” which Mr Seto might have received from the Deceased but for her demise. However, the key difference between the mortgage payments and other benefits claimed by Mr Seto is that these mortgage payments represent the use of the Deceased’s income to acquire an <span class="font-italic">asset</span> – the Hilloft property – which Mr Seto will own at the end of the day. There would thus be an element of double counting in this case. The tortfeasor is asked to pay a sum representing the money the Deceased would have earned which is then used to purchase an asset, the full value of which would, at the end of the day, belong to Mr Seto. Put in another way, Mr Seto gets the full <span class="font-italic">value</span> of the property <span class="font-italic">in addition</span> to the cash sum of the mortgage payments. Mr Seto thus gets not only the <span class="font-italic">use</span> of the money but also the <span class="font-italic">value</span> of the money. Indeed, it is telling that the respondents have not cited a single case to show that mortgage instalment payments have been successfully claimed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the other hand, the property-related expenses stand on another footing and are claimable. Unlike the mortgage payments, which represent the use of the Deceased’s income to acquire an <span class="font-italic">asset</span>, the sum for property-related expenses is indeed a <span class="font-italic">benefit</span>, <span class="font-italic">in addition to </span>the household expenses and car expenses claimed by Mr Seto, which Mr Seto would have received from the Deceased, if not for her demise. This lost benefit would not accrue to Mr Seto via any other way besides this dependency claim. Therefore, we agree with the respondents that these property-related expenses are claimable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The parties have, since the oral hearing, agreed that the mortgage instalment payments amounted to a sum of $703,112.97, while a sum of $113,850 was for the property-related expenses. The parties have agreed, quite rightly in our view, that the sum of $703,112.97 for the mortgage payments should not be awarded. Accordingly, we reduce the damages awarded for Mr Seto’s dependency claim by this amount. For the reasons set out above, we do not disturb the Judge’s award of damages for the property-related expenses amounting to $113,850. We accordingly reduce the sum of Mr Seto’s loss of support claim from $1,400,415.93 to <span class="font-underline">$697,302.96</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of inheritance claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The respondents made a claim for loss of inheritance and the Judge awarded a total sum of $3,839,872.59, comprising $3,283,372.59 for loss of inheritance based on projected income and $556,500 for loss of inheritance in relation to stock options. The Judge applied an average annual salary increment of about 5% until the age of 60, which would translate into an average annual income of $754,468.13 (Judgment at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Judge found that an approximate figure of $90,000 per year would have been spent on the Deceased’s annual expenses on her dependants. The Judge also applied the “presumption” in <span class="font-italic">Carol Ann Armstrong</span> at [212] that “a person in a household of four with two children would typically spend 25% of her income on personal expenses” (Judgment at [61]), which meant that the Deceased’s average annual personal expenditure would have been $188,617.03 (25% of $754,468.13). As such, the Judge found that the appropriate multiplicand for the loss of inheritance based on the Deceased’s projected income should be $475,851.10 ($754,468.13 minus $188,617.03 minus $90,000). The Judge applied a multiplier of 6.9 years ((67 minus 44) years with a discount of 70%), which gave rise to the total award of $3,283,372.59 ($475,851.10 x 6.9).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As for the stock options, due to the “limited evidence” available, the Judge was “hesitant” to find that the Deceased “would have continued to accumulate 1,200 stock options annually till the end of her working life”, as claimed by the respondents. Thus, the Judge used a “more conservative and realistic estimate” of “1,000 stock options (valued at $92.75 each) per year for a total of about 20 years”. The Judge applied a multiplier of 6 years (20 years with a discount of 70%). This gave rise to a total sum of $556,500 ($92.75 x 1000 x 6). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 With respect, we find that the Judge had erred in both his analysis on the loss of inheritance from the projected income and the stock options. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Loss of projected income</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 First, the Judge had applied the Deceased’s <span class="font-italic">pre-tax </span>income to determine the appropriate multiplicand for the loss of inheritance from projected income. The reason for doing so is not apparent from the Judgment, even though Dr Foo had submitted at the trial below that it should be the <span class="font-italic">post-tax</span> income that should be taken into consideration. Dr Foo unsurprisingly repeats this submission in this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The respondents do not dispute in this appeal that income tax should be taken into consideration. Rather, the respondents’ submission is that the income tax which ought to be discounted had already been taken into consideration as part of the 25% discount which the Judge had applied for the Deceased’s personal expenditure (see [52] above). We do not agree with the respondents’ submission. It is neither apparent from the Judgment below nor the Judge’s analysis that the Deceased’s income tax was taken into account in his assessment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is settled law that claims based on loss of earnings must be net of income tax. The English case of <span class="font-italic">British Transport Commission v Gourley</span> [1956] AC 185 (“<span class="font-italic">Gourley</span>”) settled this issue. The House of Lords explained that this was because “the tribunal should award the injured party such a sum of money <span class="font-italic">as will put him in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the injuries</span>” [emphasis added] (per Earl Jowitt at 197). The plaintiff should have his damages assessed “upon the basis of what he has really lost”, even if it became “necessary for the tribunal assessing damages to form an estimate of what the tax would have been if the money had been earned” (per Earl Jowitt at 197 and 203). The rule in <span class="font-italic">Gourley</span> applies when two conditions are satisfied: (a) the damages awarded are compensation for loss of a taxable income or gain and not for loss of a capital asset; and (b) the damages themselves must not be taxable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This Court has applied the principle in <span class="font-italic">Gourley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in Singapore: see <span class="font-italic">Raja’s Commercial College v Gian Singh &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1974–1976] SLR(R) 225; <span class="font-italic">Klerk-Elias Liza v K T Chan Clinic Pte Ltd</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 609; and <span class="font-italic">Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 340. Although none of these cases, strictly speaking, involved a loss of inheritance claim, there is no doubt that the same principle would apply. In <span class="font-italic">Carol Ann Armstrong</span>, which did involve a loss of inheritance claim, this Court and the High Court both considered the <span class="font-italic">post-tax</span> income of the deceased to assess the multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim (though <span class="font-italic">Gourley </span>or its progeny were not cited).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Consequently, the Judge had erred in applying the pre-tax, rather than post-tax, projected income to calculate the multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim. As the parties were unable to let us have the post-tax income figure at the oral hearing, we asked the parties to agree upon that figure and to revert. The parties have agreed that the applicable post-tax income for the loss of inheritance claim should be $625,335.14. Thus, the starting point of the determination of the multiplicand should be $625,335.14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Unsurprisingly, despite the parties being asked to agree upon the figure of income tax to be deducted from the gross annual income, this brought forth further disagreements and submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The respondents submit that, since it is the post-tax income that is being considered, the Deceased’s expenditure on her dependants and on herself should be reduced accordingly. The respondents calculate this by applying the 25% discount (for the Deceased’s personal expenditure) to the <span class="font-italic">post-tax income</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 0.25 x $625,335.14 = $156,333.79), and by reducing the Deceased’s expenditure on the dependants ($90,000) by deducting the mortgage payments from this (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $90,000 minus $50,950.22 = $39,049.78). Thus, the respondents’ calculation of the revised multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim is $429,951.57 ($625,335.14 minus $156,333.79 minus $39,049.78).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Dr Foo disagrees and submits that the 25% discount for the Deceased’s personal expenditure should be applied to the <span class="font-italic">pre-tax income</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 0.25 x $754,468.13 = $188,617.03, which is the Judge’s finding), and that the Judge’s sum of $90,000 for the Deceased’s expenditure on the dependants should not be reduced for the mortgage payments, as it “is quite clear that the $90,000 figure did not include the Hilloft expenses”. Thus, on Dr Foo’s calculation, the multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim should be $346,718.11 ($625,335.14 minus $188,617.03 minus $90,000).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We agree with the respondents that the 25% discount for the Deceased’s personal expenditure should be applied to the <span class="font-italic">post-tax income</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of $625,335.14, rather than the pre-tax income of $754,468.13. This was also the implicit position taken in <span class="font-italic">Carol Ann Armstrong</span> at [212], as this Court held in that case that the 25% discount for personal expenditure is to be deducted from “the deceased’s <span class="font-italic">net salary</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 As for the sum of $90,000 for the Deceased’s expenditure on her dependants, it is not clear from the Judgment whether this sum included the mortgage payments. As noted, Dr Foo says it does not. The respondents say that their figures stated in their trial closing submissions did include the mortgage payments in the $90,000. It appears that the Judge had essentially adopted the respondents’ figures at trial. However, the Judge reduced the respondents’ figure of $111,427.79 per year to $90,000 per year. At [61] of the Judgment, the Judge said the former sum should be reduced because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [the Deceased’s] expenditure on household expenses, property-related expenses, and her parents’ and sons’ expenses would not have been [as] extensive as the plaintiffs claim. In my view, an approximate figure of about $90,000 per year would be appropriate. ... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It was incumbent on the respondents to show that the Judge had included the mortgage payments in the $90,000. As they have not been able to establish this, we shall accordingly not disturb this finding.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 This means that the revised multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim should be <span class="font-underline">$379,001.36</span> ($625,335.14 minus (0.25 x $625,335.14) minus $90,000). The revised loss of inheritance claim for loss of projected income, based on the multiplier of 6.9 (see [52] above), would thus be <span class="font-underline">$2,615,109.35</span> ($379,001.36 x 6.9) instead of $3,283,372.59.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, we pause at this juncture to note a related point that was not raised by the parties, either in this appeal or in the trial below. We noted  there was no reference to the Deceased’s CPF, especially the employer’s contributions, in relation to the dependants’ claims and the loss of inheritance claim. There might have been some special reason for this omission that is not readily apparent to us. We need say no more in the circumstances except to note that there have been cases where CPF contributions have been taken into account for dependency claims.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd v Lim Soon Yong </span>[1983–1984] SLR(R) 159 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Soon Yong</span>”), this Court held that CPF contributions formed part of a dependency claim.

</div> Dr Foo submits that the Judge erred in awarding a sum of $556,500 for the loss of inheritance on account of the stock options, as no evidence was led on the stock options the Deceased would have received or the criteria for receiving the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There is some documentary evidence adduced by the respondents at the trial below which shows the Deceased’s accumulation of stock options awarded to her by Roche as part of her remuneration package, and the consequent accumulation of value of the said options. However, the Judge himself rightly observed that there was “limited” evidence available (Judgment at [62]). The Deceased had been issued 1,212 options in 2008 and 1,347 options in 2009.

</div> As Dr Foo submits, there was no evidence on <span class="font-italic">how</span> the stock options were to be issued by the employer and no evidence as to its terms or on how the value of the stock options are to be determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Therefore, the Judge’s basis for applying a multiplicand of 1000 stock options <span class="font-italic">per year</span> is, with respect, not warranted.

Since there is no evidence on how the stock options were issued by the employer, we agree with Dr Foo that this claim should be disallowed. Consequently, we set aside the Judge’s award of $556,500 for loss of inheritance in relation to the stock options.

Dr Foo carried out liposuction and fat transfer surgical procedure (“the surgical procedures”) on 28 June 2013 from 12.00pm to 2.00pm on Ms Mandy Yeong (“the Deceased”) at TCS Aesthetics Central Clinic (“the Clinic”), located at The Central, Eu Tong Sen Street. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The Deceased’s oxygen saturation level was 96% at 2.00pm. Very shortly after the surgical procedures were completed, the Deceased was in difficulty, variously described as coughing and making a gurgling sound and experiencing a shortness of breath. At 2.05pm, the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level plunged to 72% (from 96% at 2.00pm when the surgical procedures ended). The Deceased suffered a collapse in the cardiovascular sense at 2.45pm. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Dr Foo only called for the ambulance at 2.53pm. The ambulance arrived at the Clinic in just four minutes and its crew were attending to the Deceased by 3.10pm. The Deceased was conveyed to the Accident and Emergency Department at Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”); the ambulance arrived there at 3.23pm. The Deceased passed away at about 5.46pm.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The Deceased’s cause of death was pulmonary fat embolism, a condition where fat globules had entered a patient’s blood vessels and obstruct or block the continuous blood flow within the blood vessels and/or cause inflammation of the blood vessels. The net result would be an interruption to the blood bringing oxygen to the lungs, thereby causing oxygen starvation to the body. There were two forms of fat embolism syndrome (“FES”): a less serious form, known as non-fulminant FES, and a far more serious form known as fulminant FES (“FFES”), which presents as acute cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and/or embolic phenomena leading to death within a few hours of injury. The Deceased died from the latter, FFES. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Deceased was 44 years of age when she died. At the time of her death, she was the Head of Regional Market Development at Roche Diagnostics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Roche”), where she had worked for the past 20 years. Her performance appraisals showed that she was a valued officer of the company. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The first respondent was the Deceased’s husband, Mr Seto Wei Meng (“Mr Seto”), while the second respondent was Mr Seto’s father. Mr Seto and the second respondent were the administrator and co-administrator of the Deceased’s estate respectively. The action was brought by the respondents on behalf of the estate of the Deceased as well as the Deceased’s dependants. The dependants included the Deceased’s parents (her father having died some three years four months after the Deceased’s death); the two sons of the marriage (named Marcus and Melvin); and Mr Seto, who claimed for loss of support for household expenses, expenses related to the “Hilloft” condominium property which was jointly owned by the Deceased and Mr Seto (“Hilloft property”), and the loss of car expenses. Mr Seto also brought a loss of inheritance claim under s 22(1A) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 In their statement of claim, the respondents allege that Dr Foo was negligent in three respects. First, Dr Foo failed to obtain the Deceased’s informed consent and did not properly advise her on the risks and complications associated with the surgical procedures; furthermore, Dr Foo failed to explain that the surgical procedures would entail a higher risk of fat embolism, particularly as it involved a repeat procedure. Secondly, Dr Foo was negligent in carrying out the surgical procedures. Thirdly, Dr Foo was negligent in his post-operative management and care of the Deceased by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, failing to call for an ambulance in time. Dr Foo denied all three allegations. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The High Court Judge (the “Judge”) found Dr Foo liable in negligence in relation to the surgical procedures. The Judge awarded the respondents damages in the sum of $5,599,557.48 (plus coroner’s inquiry (“CI”) fees to be taxed if not agreed) together with interest and costs. The appellant appeals against the Judge’s decision on both his liability and the quantum of damages awarded.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court of Appeal’s</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The Court of Appeal dismissed Dr Foo’s appeal against liability for negligence, and allowed in part Dr Foo’s appeal on the quantum of damages awarded.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Liability</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The Court of Appeal rejected Dr Foo’s contention that, because what had occurred was FFES, the Deceased was doomed to die, even if Dr Foo had called for an ambulance at 2.05pm. This was not a conclusion anyone could draw from the evidence presented in this case as well as the expert medical evidence before the Judge. All the doctors who gave evidence held the view or agreed that Dr Foo should have called for an ambulance immediately or very soon after the onset of the Deceased’s symptoms after the Deceased’s oxygen saturation level plummeted to 72% at 2.05pm. Significantly, the first two doctors called in to help with the emergency situation that had developed, Dr Chow Yuen Ho (“Dr Chow”) and Dr Shenthilkumar s/o Sritharan Naidu (“Dr Shenthilkumar”), also came to the same conclusion upon assessing the situation. It was noteworthy that Dr Foo did not submit any specific data for FFES found in the medical literature to support his contention. On the contrary, the medical literature placed before the court even included a case of FFES which, with timely detection, survived apparently without any ill effects: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">15</span>], [<span class="font-weight-bold">21</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">29</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The Court of Appeal agreed with the Judge’s finding below that Dr Foo was not <span class="font-italic">au fait</span> with that potential problem of FES, let alone FFES, and was unable to recognise what had occurred to the Deceased when her oxygen saturation level plummeted to 72% and she was coughing, making gurgling sounds and unable to articulate what was wrong. Dr Foo had no valid excuse to delay calling for an ambulance in the critical 48 minutes (2.05pm to 2.53pm): at [<span class="font-weight-bold">19</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">21</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The Court of Appeal rejected Dr Foo’s submission that the Clinic had available medical equipment which was put to use. The specialist medical and resuscitative equipment, available medical expertise and facilities at a tertiary institution, like SGH, were unarguably superior compared to what was available at the Clinic. The fact was that the Clinic did not have the medical equipment and facilities that SGH had, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">23</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 While it was normally incumbent on the plaintiff to prove causation, here it was Dr Foo who mounted an affirmative case that, even if he was in breach of his duty, there would be no causation because the Deceased was suffering from FFES. Thus, it was incumbent on Dr Foo to make good this assertion. This was not supported by the expert and medical evidence, which was that FFES was not necessarily fatal: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">25</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The Court of Appeal found that the Judge was also right to find that FFES is a retrospective diagnosis, so the fact that FFES itself is “almost always deadly” was beside the point. The significance of a “retrospective” diagnosis was that, if a patient with FES or FFES is given prompt treatment, and the patient recovers, the case would then typically not be characterised or labelled as FFES: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">33</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 Therefore, the totality of the evidence showed that Dr Foo clearly breached his duty of care to the Deceased and this breach caused the Deceased’s death. For the foregoing reasons, Dr Foo’s appeal on liability was dismissed: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">36</span>] to [<span class="font-weight-bold">39</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Quantum of damages for estate claim</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 Dr Foo conceded that the CI fees were payable by Dr Foo. The respondents proposed a sum of $26,000 for the CI fees, which Dr Foo found not to be unreasonable. The Court of Appeal accordingly awarded the respondents $26,000 for the CI fees: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">42</span>].</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Quantum of damages for dependency claim</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The Court of Appeal reduced the damages awarded for Mr Seto’s loss of support claim from $1,400,415.93 to $697,302.96. This was because the sum of $703,112.97 awarded by the Judge to the respondents for the mortgage instalment payments should not have been awarded. The mortgage instalment payments represented the use of the Deceased’s income to acquire an asset – the Hilloft property – which Mr Seto will own at the end of the day. There would thus be an element of double counting, as Mr Seto would get not only the use of the money but also the value of the money. The parties had, since the oral hearing, agreed that the sum of $703,112.97 for the mortgage instalment payments should not be awarded. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal reduced the damages awarded by this amount: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">48</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">50</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 On the other hand, the property-related expenses (including condominium maintenance fees, property insurance, and property tax) were claimable, as they were indeed benefits which Mr Seto would have received from the Deceased, if not for her demise. Therefore, the Court of Appeal did not disturb the Judge’s award of damages for the property-related expenses amounting to $113,850: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">49</span>].</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Quantum of damages for loss of inheritance claim</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The Court of Appeal found that the Judge had erred when he applied the Deceased’s pre-tax, rather than post-tax, income to determine the appropriate multiplicand for the respondents’ claim for loss of inheritance from the Deceased’s projected income. It was settled law that claims based on loss of earnings must be net of income tax. This was because a tribunal should award the injured party such a sum of money as will put him in the<span class="font-italic"> </span>same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the injuries: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">54</span>], [<span class="font-weight-bold">57</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">59</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 The Court of Appeal agreed with the respondents that a 25% discount for the Deceased’s personal expenditure should be applied to the Deceased’s post-tax<span class="font-italic"> </span>income<span class="font-italic"> </span>of $625,335.14, rather than the pre-tax income of $754,468.13. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the Judge’s finding that the Deceased would have spent $90,000 for the Deceased’s expenditure on her dependants. This meant that the revised multiplicand for the loss of inheritance claim should be $379,001.36. The revised loss of inheritance claim for loss of projected income would thus be $2,615,109.35 instead of $3,283,372.59: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">63</span>], [<span class="font-weight-bold">65</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">66</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The Court of Appeal also found that the Judge had erred in awarding the respondents’ claim for loss of inheritance from the Deceased’s loss of various long-term stock options awarded to the Deceased by Roche. The Judge himself rightly observed that there was limited evidence available. The Deceased was not issued any new stock options from 2010 to 2013. There was no evidence on how the stock options were to be issued by the employer and no evidence as to its terms or on how the value of the stock options were to be determined. Therefore, the Judge’s basis for applying a multiplicand of 1000 stock options per year was an inference which could not be drawn from the evidence, as there was no clear pattern that new stock options would be issued every year. Consequently, the Court of Appeal set aside the Judge’s award of $556,500 for loss of inheritance in relation to the stock options. The total sum of the loss of inheritance claim would thus be $2,615,109.35 (for loss of projected income) instead of $3,839,872.59: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">68</span>] to [<span class="font-weight-bold">70</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 As such, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the quantum of damages in part as follows: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">72</span>].</div><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,217,217);color: rgb(0,0,0)"><div
