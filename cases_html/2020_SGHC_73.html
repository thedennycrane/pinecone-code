As the defendant has not satisfactorily proven that the Termination Date was varied or postponed, the original deadline must stand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the plaintiff was entitled to 20% annualised interest on the entire sum of the Loan</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interpretation of the Loan Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I next consider the question of whether the plaintiff was entitled to 20% annualised interest on the entire sum of the Loan (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$2,000,000).

F&amp;B </span><span class="font-italic">Group</span>) at [32]). However, this task is complicated in the instant case by the fact that the wording of the Loan Agreement does not seem to admit of one clear meaning. On the one hand, Clause 7(d) states that the Lender “will receive 20% of annualised interest from the placement of customer loans”. On the other hand, there is nothing in Clause 7(d)(i)(II) which purports to limit the plaintiff’s entitlement to 20% annualised interest to the portion of the Loan which was used specifically for the placement of customer loans. Clause 7(d)(i)(II) simply provides that “[i]n the event of non-conversion to equity… Lender receives 20% annualized interest”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I thus consider that the collective import of<span class="font-italic"> </span>Clauses 7(d) and 7(d)(i)(II) is <span class="font-italic">not</span> plain and unambiguous as the defendant asserts.

It is also of note that the Loan Agreement was drafted by Ms Li (a non-legal professional) in negotiation with Mr Ritenis, without the benefit of legal advice or review.

However, while s 94<span class="font-italic">(f)</span> of the Evidence Act permits the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of the circumstances surrounding a contract, extrinsic evidence of the drafter’s subjective intentions is generally inadmissible unless it can in some way be brought within the limited exceptions to the parol evidence rule under ss 97 to 99 of the Evidence Act (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [65(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For present purposes, it is critical to note that at the point of drafting, both the plaintiff and the defendant had intended for the Loan to be used solely for the purposes of micro-lending.

This, in my view, is the most logical and reasonable interpretation of Clause 7(d). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It was only subsequently, in or around January 2018, that the plaintiff agreed that the Loan could be used for the purpose of acquiring AOMOS in addition to being deployed for micro-lending. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the defendant’s obligation to pay interest on the entire Loan sum was waived or varied simply because of the change of use of the Loan. As such, the only reasonable inference is that Clauses 7(d) and 7(d)(i)(II) continued to govern the plaintiff’s entitlement to interest, such that the plaintiff remained entitled to 20% annualised interest on the entire Loan sum. After all, this was what the parties had originally intended, and the agreement between them had never changed.

In that case, Lai Siu Chiu J (as she then was) distilled the key principles relating to the provision, which were summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, s 108 of the Evidence Act applies only to circumstances where the defendant <span class="font-italic">alone </span>has knowledge of a particular fact. If any other person has knowledge of the same fact, s 108 will not apply (see <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh </span>at [217]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, s 108 of the Evidence Act operates in a “commonsense way” and the “balance of convenience and the disproportion of the labour, that would be involved in finding out and proving certain facts” must be taken into account in deciding whether the incidence of the burden of proof has shifted (see <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh </span>at [219]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the plaintiff can only invoke s 108 of the Evidence Act if it establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the fact which it asserts is true. In other words, a mere allegation will not suffice; the plaintiff must “establish facts which give rise to a suspicion” (see <span class="font-italic">Surender Singh </span>at [221]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I find that the first requirement is satisfied in the present case, since the defendant is the <span class="font-italic">only </span>party which could have been fully aware of all the details surrounding its use of the Loan.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Turning to the second requirement, the defendant alleges its usage of the Loan is not a matter which lies especially within its knowledge since “all documents relating to this issue have been disclosed”.

</div> I am not persuaded by this argument. As the plaintiff points out, the defendant’s primary evidence of how the Loan was utilised consists of the Tab 23 Document, which (for reasons outlined at [27] to [42] above) is inadmissible. Many of the source documents which allegedly form the basis of the Tab 23 Document are also inadmissible under the hearsay rule (see [41] above). In my assessment, the circumstances are such that it would be “disproportionately difficult” for the plaintiff to prove the defendant’s use of the Loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that the defendant did not use <span class="font-italic">any</span> of the Loan monies for purposes other than for micro-loans. This is especially so since the plaintiff concedes that it had authorised the defendant to use PHP 4,500,000 of the Loan for the acquisition of AOMOS.

However, as the plaintiff has correctly pointed out, the words “permanent capital” do not mean anything in isolation – their meaning necessarily depends on the context in which they are used.

</div> It bears noting that in his oral evidence, Mr Kodrowski not only increased the frequency of the alleged oral representations, but also made them sound more unequivocal than in his AEIC.

However, the terms of the Loan Agreement do not suggest that satisfaction of the plaintiff’s due diligence requirements was a mandatory precondition to the plaintiff’s exercise of the option.

One of the items on this list was the conversion of RCL into a finance corporation. In relation to this item, Mr Kodrowski stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conversion to Finance Corp – </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">- We now have a contact within SEC who can help fast track our application within January.

The plaintiff’s conversion of the Loan into equity was <span class="font-italic">not </span>one of these reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 More crucially, the defendant has not shown how the expedition of the conversion of RCL into a finance corporation caused it to incur more expenditure <span class="font-italic">than it otherwise would have </span><span class="font-italic">incurred</span> if it had proceeded with the conversion at its originally-intended pace. Its only evidence on this point is the Tab 23 Document, which (for reasons set out at [27] to [42] above) is inadmissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I therefore find that the expedited conversion of RCL into a finance corporation cannot constitute an act of “detrimental reliance” on the defendant’s part. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Second act: Incorporation of RCC </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The defendant submits that “[i]t cannot be disputed that there would have been no need to incorporate [RCC] if the Plaintiff was not going to convert to equity”.

</div> I accept that the incorporation of RCC would not have served any useful purpose if the plaintiff did not ultimately convert the Loan into equity. However, in order to establish that this was an act of detrimental reliance, the defendant must do <span class="font-italic">more</span>: It must show that the incorporation of RCC was<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">causally connected </span>to its reliance on the plaintiff’s alleged representation(s) (see <span class="font-italic">David Lam </span>([99] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [65])). I find that the defendant has not successfully proven this causal connection. Instead, it appears that the incorporation of RCC was undertaken pursuant to the defendant’s own <span class="font-italic">self-generated</span> expectations instead of any inducement by the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In the 8 January 2018 e-mail, Mr Kodrowski stated, “[a]s a result of <span class="font-italic">these developments</span>, I would like to expedite the forming of the SG entity” (emphasis added). However, none of the “developments” mentioned in the 8 January 2018 e-mail related to the plaintiff’s conversion of the Loan into equity. It is also telling that Mr Kodrowski did not explicitly seek Mr Mangalji’s or Ms Li’s input on the “forming of the SG entity”. On the stand, Mr Kodrowski conceded that RCC’s incorporation had been a recommendation on <span class="font-italic">his </span>part.

Conversely, if the promisee were guilty of improper behaviour, the balance would be tipped in favour of the promisor (see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in </span>Singapore”) at paras 4.086 to 4.087). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The defendant argues that it had expended a significant sum of money (in excess of S$300,000) on the understanding that the plaintiff would eventually convert to equity.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I first address the issue of whether the prevention principle is potentially applicable to a claim for a repayment of a debt. In my view, the prevention principle applies generally to <span class="font-italic">all </span>contracts, regardless of their nature or subject-matter. In <span class="font-italic">Chu</span><span class="font-italic">a Tian Chu</span>, Andrew Ang J described the prevention principle as a doctrine “derived from the well established legal maxim that no man shall take advantage of his own wrong” (at [60]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 (“<span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>”), V K Rajah J (as he then was) explained that the prevention principle is “wedded to notions of fair play and commercial morality” (at [51]). These are universally-applicable principles which are relevant in virtually every contractual context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 It is also noteworthy that in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, the prevention principle has been applied to various types of contracts, such as lease agreements (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Alghussein</span><span class="font-italic"> Establishment v Eton College </span>[1998] 1 WLR 587), share purchase agreements (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Nitscheke</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Foraco Australia Pty Ltd and another </span>[2014] SASC 88), and contracts for the sale of property (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Kensland</span><span class="font-italic"> Realty Ltd v Whale View Investment Ltd and another </span>[2002] 1 HKLRD 87). I can see no practical or principled justification for restricting the applicability of the prevention principle to contractual claims of a specific nature. In my view, the prevention principle is applicable to claims for the repayment of debts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Next, I consider the issue of whether the plaintiff has committed an act (or acts) of prevention in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Yap Keng Boon Sonny v Pacific Prince International Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>”) at [34], an act of prevention was defined as an act which “operates to <span class="font-italic">prevent, impede, or otherwise make more difficult</span> for a contractor to complete the works by the date stipulated in the contract”. A narrower definition was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span>, where Rajah J held (at [52]) that “[i]n order to invoke this principle it must be shown that the contractual right or benefit that a party is asserting or claiming is a direct result of the party’s prior <span class="font-italic">breach of contract</span>” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 There is nothing to suggest that the plaintiff has breached the Loan Agreement, and the defendant makes no argument to that effect. Accordingly, I find that the narrow definition in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is not satisfied in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Likewise, the plaintiff has not carried out any act(s) of prevention falling within the broader definition in <span class="font-italic">Sonny Yap</span>. In the first place, the defendant’s expenditures which were <span class="font-italic">mutually agreed upon </span>by both parties (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, expenditure on micro-finance or on the acquisition of AOMOS) cannot properly be characterised as acts of prevention on the plaintiff’s part. As the plaintiff points out, a situation where two parties have a mutual agreement to do (or not to do) something is very different from a situation where one party has <span class="font-italic">prevented</span> or <span class="font-italic">impeded </span>the other party’s ability to fulfil its obligations under a contract.

The court’s power to award pre-judgment interest is governed by s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">12.</span>—(1)  In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the recovery of any debt or damages, the court may, <span class="font-italic">if it thinks fit</span>, order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the debt or damages for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 As the literal wording of this provision suggests, the decision to award pre-judgment interest (and if so, what the appropriate interest rate should be) is a matter which lies entirely within the court’s discretion. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grains </span>helpfully set out a list of factors which courts can consider in exercising this discretion (see <span class="font-italic">Grains </span>at [140]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) in the absence of a prescribed rate, what rate of interest would be appropriate to the relevant period(s); </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) whether the claimant was dilatory in the bringing and conduct of the proceedings; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) whether the claimant had received compensation for the loss suffered from a source other than the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) whether the claimant had sought and been awarded with damages which include damages for the loss of the use of money; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) whether the debt is paid immediately after proceedings are commenced; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) whether the parties have agreed that pre-judgment interest should not be recoverable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 As a <span class="font-italic">general rule</span>, however, “claimants who have been kept out of pocket without basis should be able to recover interest on money that is found to have been owed to them from the date of their entitlement until the date it is paid” (<span class="font-italic">Grains </span>at [138]). Furthermore, if the parties do not submit on the rate of pre-judgment interest, the default rate of 5.33% interest per annum, which is prescribed by para 5 of the Supreme Court Practice Direction No 1 of 2007, will usually apply (<span class="font-italic">Grains </span>at [143]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In the present case, the claimant highlights three “special circumstances” which, it claims, justify its demand for pre-judgment interest at a <span class="font-italic">higher</span> rate of 20% per annum.

This argument is untenable. As aforementioned, the decision to award pre-judgment interest is discretionary in nature.

As the plaintiff points out, imposing an interest rate of just 5.33% would effectively convert the plaintiff’s six-month loan at 20% per annum into something roughly equivalent to a two-and-a-half year loan at 8% per annum.

</div> Such an outcome would be grossly unfair to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In the circumstances, I consider that it is fair to award interest from the date of the accrual of the loss (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>16 June 2018) to the date of this court’s judgment at a rate of 20% per annum.
