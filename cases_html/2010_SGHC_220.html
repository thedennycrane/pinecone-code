        Andrew Ang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Dante Yap Go, is a businessman
                    and a national of the Philippines. The defendant, Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG,
                    is an Austrian-incorporated bank which formerly operated branches in Hong Kong
                    and Singapore. This action was brought by the plaintiff against the defendant in
                    respect of losses suffered on the plaintiff’s investment portfolio
                    following the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 3 June 1997, the plaintiff had opened
                    two investment accounts with the defendant’s private banking department:
                    one with the defendant’s Hong Kong branch (“the Hong Kong
                    account”) and the other with its Singapore branch
                    (“the Singapore account”). A credit facility of up to US$5m
                    was granted by the defendant to the plaintiff via the Hong Kong account. Both
                    accounts were handled by one Winnifred Natasha Tong Ching Laude (“Ms
                    Ching”) who was, at that time, a vice-president in the
                    defendant’s Hong Kong branch. Subsequently, a number of investments in
                    emerging markets debt instruments were acquired under the Singapore account,
                    some of which were financed using loans that were drawn down from the credit
                    facility tied to the Hong Kong account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A few of these investments were US Dollar
                    (“USD”) denominated Indonesian corporate bonds or short-term notes
                    that were issued by the Bakrie Group of companies (“the Bakrie
                    Group”) and another company called Polysindo. These Indonesian notes were
                    acquired in the month of July 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       What transpired within the following months in
                    parts of Asia were events that became known as the Asian financial crisis.
                    During this period of financial crisis, the value of the Indonesian rupiah
                    depreciated substantially against the USD and, as a result, Indonesian companies
                    that had borrowed in USD were suddenly faced with higher costs in servicing
                    their debts. A number of Indonesian companies, one of them being the Bakrie
                    Group, ended up defaulting on their bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Also acquired under the Singapore account were
                    Rossiyskiy Kredit 10.25% Interest Notes (“the Rossiyskiy Notes”)
                    purchased on 25 September 2007. The Rossiyskiy Notes, also denominated
                    in USD, were issued by a Russian bank, Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank, and were linked
                    to Gosudarstvenniye Kratkosrochniye Beskuponniye Obligatsio
                    (“GKOs”), which were short-term rouble-denominated bonds issued by
                    the Russian Government. The Asian financial crisis triggered a knock-on effect
                    in the global economy and, as a result, the Russian Government devalued the
                    rouble against the USD and defaulted on its GKOs. Faced with circumstances
                    similar to those faced by the Indonesian companies, Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank, too,
                    ended up defaulting on its GKO-linked Rossiyskiy Notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After five years or so had lapsed, the plaintiff
                    commenced this action against the defendant on 2 May 2003 claiming
                    for, <em>inter alia</em>, losses suffered on the
                    abovementioned investments. As the defendant had ceased its operations in Asia
                    sometime in October 2001, the plaintiff applied for and was granted leave
                    on 16 May 2003 to serve the writ of summons out of jurisdiction at the
                    defendant’s registered place of business in Austria. However, the
                    Singapore Consulate in Austria encountered difficulties in effecting service on
                    the defendant, and it was only on 2 August 2005, more than two years
                    after the action was commenced, that the defendant was finally served with the
                    writ of summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The trial was then conducted over three
                    tranches: from 14 to 23 May 2007 (“the first tranche”);
                    from 25 to 27 February 2008 (“the second tranche”); and
                    from 7 to 8 July 2008 (“the third tranche”). By the
                    time parties appeared before me for the first tranche of the trial, a good ten
                    years or so had already elapsed since the happening of the events that the
                    witnesses were asked to testify on. This  had a significant bearing on
                    the quality of the evidence given by the witnesses of fact as will become
                    apparent later in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff claims that a total of 16
                    investments purchased under his Singapore account and the loans drawn down from
                    his Hong Kong account to finance those investments were not authorised by him
                    (“the unauthorised investments claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff then claims, in the alternative,
                    that even if those investments and loans had been properly authorised, the
                    defendant had breached its duty owed to the plaintiff, in contract and/or tort,
                    by failing to advise him that it was imprudent to have maintained the portfolio
                    that he was holding during the period of the Asian financial crisis (“the
                    advisory claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Witnesses of fact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     A total of six witnesses of fact testified and
                    gave evidence. Four of them – the plaintiff, Ms Ching, Dr Michael Potyka
                    (“Dr Potyka”), and Philippe Yin (“Yin”) – were
                    cross-examined before me, whereas the remaining two – Eric Chin Yeung Yin
                    (“Chin”) and Ms Lily Yeung (“Ms Yeung”) – were
                    examined in October 2009 before an examiner appointed by the Hong Kong
                    courts and they both gave evidence in the form of depositions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff struck me as an especially
                    unreliable witness over the four and a half days that he was cross-examined on
                    the witness stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I observed that he would often ask for
                    questions to be repeated needlessly despite having the benefit of those
                    questions being displayed on a monitor screen in front of him. I also noticed
                    that the plaintiff would take far too long to give direct answers or to agree to
                    matters that would have been fairly obvious to any reasonable person. There were
                    also occasions on which he would embellish his evidence by introducing new
                    explanations for the first time whenever he felt it was advantageous to do so.
                    Furthermore, some of his responses were simply incredible. Once, he adamantly
                    persisted that he had not seen the words “Hong Kong Branch”
                    which appeared, in large font, not only in the title heading but also directly
                    above his signature in a written agreement of which he had initialled every
                    single page.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I also took note of another incident which
                    further diminished the plaintiff’s credibility in my view. On that
                    occasion, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Kannan Ramesh, was cross-examining
                    Ms Ching in relation to a faxed document which the plaintiff had claimed was
                    sent by him. The plaintiff had insisted that the handwriting on the fax note was
                    his and that the name in the “From” field was his name.
                    Notwithstanding the poor quality of the copy produced in court, I could discern
                    that the name in the field appeared to be unlike the plaintiff’s name. It
                    was only later, after it had become clear from the transmission report, that the
                    fax was sent from a phone line in Singapore and could not have been sent from
                    him that the plaintiff then performed a complete turnabout and conceded that the
                    handwriting was actually not his.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Ching</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Ms Ching’s testimony was of obvious
                    importance because the plaintiff had conducted his dealings with the defendant
                    primarily through her. Ms Ching who had since returned to the Philippines to be
                    a homemaker was, initially, reluctant to appear and the defendant had to take
                    out an application for Ms Ching to be examined by way of foreign deposition in
                    the Philippines. Ultimately, Ms Ching agreed to testify on the
                    defendant’s behalf and appeared before this court for the first and third
                    tranches of the trial for cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On the witness stand, Ms Ching was oftentimes
                    defensive, given the nature of the plaintiff’s allegations against her. As
                    a result, some of her answers came across as being unnecessarily defiant and
                    were somewhat unreasonable on occasion. She took issue with Mr Ramesh every
                    time he used the word “advice” to describe her recommendations to
                    the plaintiff. However, despite her failure at times to recall events or give
                    precise answers, I did not think that she was lying on the essential point that
                    the investments were authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Potyka</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant had originally scheduled for one
                    Paul Francis Giles (“Giles”) to appear as a witness on its behalf.
                    Giles was the head of the defendant’s Hong Kong branch at the material
                    time and was in charge of overseeing the defendant’s private banking
                    services for its Asian clients from 1997 until 2000. His testimony was important
                    because he had corresponded directly with the plaintiff in the aftermath of the
                    Asian financial crisis and was also present at a number of meetings with the
                    plaintiff. However, about a month before the trial, the defendant lost contact
                    with Giles. Leave was subsequently granted for the defendant to add Dr Potyka as
                    a replacement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     At the material time in 1997, Dr Potyka
                    was the head of the defendant’s main legal department based in Austria and
                    he only became involved in this matter in early 2006. As a result, he had no
                    personal knowledge of the events that took place. Dr Potyka was cross-examined
                    before me during the first tranche of the trial and was also present throughout
                    the proceedings as the defendant’s representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Yin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Yin was the senior vice-president
                    “Operations” of the defendant at the material time between 1997
                    and 1998 and he appeared before me during the second tranche of the trial. He
                    gave evidence as to the defendant’s internal procedures relating to the
                    documenting and recording of instructions. Like Dr Potyka, Yin had no
                    personal knowledge of the events that took place between the plaintiff and the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Yeung</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Ms Yeung was an assistant vice-president with
                    the defendant at the material times and provided operational support to Ms Ching
                    and other banking officers. Although Ms Yeung’s position with the
                    defendant would naturally have made her an important witness, the evidence that
                    resulted from her deposition, however, was of limited value as she conceded that
                    she could only vaguely remember the events that had occurred nearly 12 years
                    ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the same reason, the evidence of Chin was
                    of hardly any assistance. In fact, Chin’s recollection of his time
                    with the defendant was even worse than that of Ms Yeung’s. Chin was
                    employed by the defendant from 1992 to 2002 and worked at the securities trading
                    desk at the material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Giles (who did not appear)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After the first tranche of the trial, I
                    granted leave to the defendant, who had resumed contact with Mr Giles, to
                    call Giles to testify during the second tranche. However, after he had prepared
                    his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), Giles had a sudden
                    change of heart and decided not to appear for cross-examination. The defendant
                    then took out an application to have Giles attend an examination in
                    Hong Kong but could not serve the necessary documents on him. As the
                    evidence in Giles’ AEIC was untested by cross-examination, I disallowed it
                    from being admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Expert witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I heard expert evidence from three witnesses:
                    a private banker, Ms Ng Bee Nah (“Ms Ng”) who appeared on behalf
                    of the plaintiff, and two consultants, Dr Cesar Saldana (“Dr
                    Saldana”) for the plaintiff and Mr Roman Scott
                    (“Mr Scott”) for the defendant. Much of the expert evidence
                    related to the key events of the Asian financial crisis and the scope of a
                    private bank’s duty to give investment advice during the crisis. I found
                    most of the expert evidence rather unnecessary because most of the matters
                    covered were either matters of common sense or were matters of which one could
                    not speak with much certainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Saldana</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Dr Saldana was commissioned by the Asian
                    Development Bank to write the country paper on the Philippines as part of a
                    study of the Asian financial crisis and the corporate governance issues
                    underlying the financial crisis. He was also involved in preparing the
                    consolidated report for five countries affected by the Asian financial crisis:
                    the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Korea.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Ms Ng was the vice-president of a major
                    European bank and has experience in leading and managing one of its private
                    banking units since 2005. She was previously an assistant vice-president of the
                    private banking department of another European bank from the year 2002. She gave
                    opinion evidence in relation to private banking practices in Singapore and, more
                    specifically, what was expected of a private banker during the Asian financial
                    crisis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Scott</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Mr Scott was the managing director of a bank
                    advisory and private equity company based in Singapore. He was formerly a senior
                    partner in the Singapore office of a global management consulting firm and has
                    20 years of experience in working with the private banking industry. He also
                    served as an advisor to the Indonesian Government’s key crisis resolution
                    agency and four other Indonesian banks in connection with the Asian financial
                    crisis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The introduction of Ms Ching to the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Sometime in early 1997, the plaintiff had
                    heard rumours that an “Asian financial crisis” was looming
                    and that the Philippine peso might be devalued. Up till then, the plaintiff had
                    140 million pesos deposited with two Philippine banks and also some
                    USD-denominated funds deposited in an account with the Swiss Bank Corporation
                    (later to become “UBS”). After hearing those rumours, the
                    plaintiff made the decision to transfer his funds out of the peso-denominated
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Around the same time, Ms Ching was
                    recommended to the plaintiff by one Jose Qua on the basis that she had given him
                    advice on a number of currency investments which had proven helpful. After the
                    plaintiff was told that Ms Ching was also the daughter of Alfredo Ching, a
                    reputed businessman whom the plaintiff was acquainted with, the plaintiff agreed
                    to meet her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     A meeting between the three of them was
                    arranged and this first meeting was held at the Park Lane Hotel in Hong Kong.
                    Ms Ching had arrived fully prepared to do business and, during the meeting,
                    she showed the plaintiff worksheets containing a number of peso-denominated
                    bonds. However, her recommendations were rejected by the plaintiff because of
                    his concern that the peso was about to be devalued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The subsequent meetings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The second meeting was held in Manila. In her
                    written statement, Ms Ching claimed that the plaintiff had told her at the
                    second meeting that he wanted to open an investment account but had no specific
                    investments in mind yet. She claimed also that in one of their meetings (she
                    could not recall which one) the plaintiff had told her that he wanted an
                    investment return of 10 to 12% above the rates offered by money-market
                    investments and that he was interested in investing in USD-denominated emerging
                    markets debt. Apparently, the plaintiff then expressed an interest in bonds
                    issued by conglomerates in Indonesia, Brazil and Russia after some discussion.
                    Ms Ching also provided him with a worksheet illustrating how he could use a
                    leveraging structure to finance his investments. Thereafter, Ms Ching
                    continued to liaise with the plaintiff and prepared the necessary documentation
                    for the plaintiff to open an investment account with the
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff’s evidence differed
                    markedly from Ms Ching’s in substance and in detail. He alleged that,
                    during the second meeting, Ms Ching had represented to him that the
                    defendant had total knowledge of the market and could tell between safe and
                    risky investments. Furthermore, he claimed that Ms Ching had told him that
                    one of the advantages of investing with a professional bank such as the
                    defendant was that he would not lose any of his money and his capital would be
                    preserved even in a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The opening of the investment accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As alluded to at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the plaintiff opened two accounts with the defendant
                    on 3 June 1997. It was agreed that the plaintiff’s
                    investments were to be held in the Singapore account because he was concerned
                    about the handover of Hong Kong to the People’s Republic of China and did
                    not want his investments to be held in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong account was
                    opened because the defendant required that a Hong Kong-domiciled account be used
                    if the plaintiff wished to obtain a loan facility from the defendant. The
                    Singapore account was numbered 88XXX whereas the Hong Kong account was numbered
                    85XXX.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For the Singapore account, the plaintiff
                    signed the following agreements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     an Account Opening and Custodian
                        Agreement (“AOCA”), dated 3
                    June 1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     a
                        Discretionary Investment Management Agreement (“DIMA”), dated
                        3 June 1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     an Investment Authority Instruction
                        (“IAI”), dated 3 June 1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     a Hold Mail Instruction (“HMI”),
                        dated 3 June 1997; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a>(e)     a Notice of Assignment and Charge, dated 25 June
                        1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For the Hong Kong account, the plaintiff
                    signed the following agreements:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     an AOCA, dated
                        3 June 1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     an IAI, dated 3 June 1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     an Investment Management Agreement
                        (“IMA”), dated 25 June1997;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     a Loan Facility Letter (“LFL”),
                        dated 25 June 1997; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_e"></a>(e)     a Charge Agreement, dated 25 June
                1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant contractual documents for the investment
                accounts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contractual documents for the Singapore account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The contractual documents for the Singapore
                    account are governed by Singapore law. The first agreement that was executed for
                    the Singapore account was the AOCA, which was a standard term agreement for
                    opening private bank accounts that would be used to hold funds or investments.
                    In the plaintiff’s case, he successfully negotiated for the annual account
                    fee payable to the defendant (in cl 16.01 of the AOCA) to be reduced from
                    the standard rate of 1% of total asset value per annum to 0.25% of the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The DIMA was a standard term agreement which
                    has to be read with the AOCA. It granted the defendant the power and discretion
                    to trade in securities on behalf of a client using the client’s investment
                    account without the need for the client’s specific authorisation. In
                    banking parlance, such an investment account was termed a “discretionary
                    account”. However, because the plaintiff wanted to have the final say in
                    deciding what investments to purchase, the parties executed the IAI to achieve
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the course of the trial, two nearly
                    identical documents were referred to as the IAI. This initially caused a bit of
                    confusion. However, it was clear from either document alone that the defendant
                    was required to obtain the plaintiff’s prior approval before it could buy
                    or sell any security through the plaintiff’s investment account; thereby
                    achieving the intended effect of revoking the defendant’s discretion under
                    the DIMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The HMI simply ensured that all correspondence
                    addressed to the plaintiff would be held by the defendant until the plaintiff
                    collected them personally. The plaintiff had executed the HMI for reasons of
                    privacy and out of fear that the value of his assets would be disclosed to other
                    persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contractual documents for the Hong Kong account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Hong Kong account functioned essentially
                    as a credit facility account with the defendant which would allow the plaintiff
                    to draw down loans to fund the purchases of investments in his Singapore
                    account. The contractual documents for the Hong Kong account are governed by
                    Hong Kong law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff remits funds into the Singapore account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     From the period of 11 June 1997
                    until 14 November 1997, the plaintiff remitted funds into the
                    Singapore account on 13 separate occasions. The reason for remitting his funds
                    in tranches was because the plaintiff had to wait for the various investments in
                    his two Philippine bank accounts to mature and also because he wanted to obtain
                    the most favourable exchange rates before converting the peso-denominated funds
                    into USD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     By 22 July 1997, the plaintiff had
                    already remitted a sum of US$4,009,873 into the Singapore account. Thereafter,
                    the plaintiff ceased to remit funds into the Singapore account for a few months
                    until November 1997 when the plaintiff remitted another sum of US$999,916
                    into the Singapore account. In total, the plaintiff remitted a sum of
                    US$5,009,789 or approximately US$5m into the Singapore account from the period
                    of June to November 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s risk appetite</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff claimed that, during one of his
                    meetings with Ms Ching before the accounts were opened, he had told
                    Ms Ching that he wanted to preserve his investment capital and was only
                    interested in conservative investments such as money market placements, blue
                    chip stocks and bonds with the highest credit-rating of “AAA”
                    (“the conservative investment mandate”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ms Ching, however, claimed otherwise. She
                    maintained that the plaintiff had told her that he wanted an investment return
                    of 10 to 12% above the rates offered by money-market investments (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above), although she could not recall the
                    precise moment when the plaintiff had told her that. Such a rate of return would
                    have classified the plaintiff as a high-risk investor, according to
                    Ms Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     At the trial, Ms Ching acknowledged that a
                    client’s risk appetite was an important piece of information that had to
                    be clearly documented in the client’s file. However, when asked for
                    documentary evidence of the plaintiff’s risk appetite, Ms Ching could
                    only point to her handwritten minutes of a meeting with the plaintiff in
                    June 1997. She could not recall whether she was required, as a matter of
                    protocol, to officially record the plaintiff’s assessed risk appetite in
                    his client file, which I found troubling as I would have thought an assessment
                    of a client’s risk appetite was an essential component in the
                    client’s investment profile and any prudent bank would have ensured that
                    such information was properly documented to protect its own
                position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The monthly meetings between the plaintiff and
                Ms Ching</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Ms Ching met with the plaintiff in Manila
                    at least once a month from August to November 1997, and once in
                    January 1998 in what parties have termed their “monthly
                    meetings”. At every one of those monthly meetings, Ms Ching would
                    show the plaintiff four account statements which reflected the updated status of
                    the Singapore account. The four statements were a portfolio analysis statement,
                    a security analysis statement, a currency analysis statement and a money market
                    analysis statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The portfolio analysis statement is a summary
                    of all the assets and liabilities held in the Singapore account and it furnishes
                    a percentage breakdown of the assets according to type, <em>eg</em>, bonds, equities, warrants, options, money markets and
                    metals. The currency analysis statement is a breakdown of all the assets and
                    liabilities according to currency whereas the security analysis and money market
                    analysis statements are lists of all the purchased securities and money market
                    placements for the Singapore account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s instructions to the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the course of her dealings with the
                    plaintiff, Ms Ching would receive instructions from the plaintiff either by
                    phone or personally at their monthly meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     At the trial, the defendant produced a number
                    of Ms Ching’s handwritten minutes of the meetings as evidence of the
                    plaintiff’s instructions during those meetings. I noted that her
                    handwritten minutes tended to be very brief and almost never indicated the exact
                    dates of those meetings with the plaintiff. Even Yin conceded that this was
                    unusual and not in accordance with procedure. Furthermore, Ms Ching
                    admitted that she failed to keep a complete record of all the meetings that had
                    taken place with the plaintiff. Astonishingly, for the period of 11 months from
                    June 1997 to April 1998, Ms Ching recorded minutes for only five of
                    her meetings with the plaintiff. She also confirmed that she kept no other
                    record of the plaintiff’s instructions but could remember taking rough
                    notes which may have been thrown away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As for the instructions that were given by
                    phone, the defendant inexplicably failed to produce any evidence of the phone
                    conversations between the plaintiff and the defendant. The initial explanation
                    given was that no tape recordings were found because <em>no
                        recordings had actually been made</em>. This contradicted, however,
                    Yin’s oral testimony that all phone conversations between the defendant
                    and its clients were tape recorded as a matter of practice. It was at a later
                    stage of his cross-examination that Yin suddenly remembered that the defendant
                    would dispose of tape recordings after a period of six months as a matter of
                    practice. Dr Potyka was equally incapable of shedding any light as to why
                    no tape recordings were produced. He claimed that all the plaintiff’s
                    client files had been transferred to the defendant’s head office in Vienna
                    sometime in late 2001 after the defendant’s Asian branches were closed
                    down, and that whatever had been produced in court was everything that had been
                    given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The internal documents produced by the
                    defendant as evidence of the plaintiff’s instructions were mainly Client
                    Settlement Tickets and Internal Drawdown Notices. However, the Client Settlement
                    Ticket does not reflect the client’s instructions because it was a
                    document that was generated after the completion of a trade by the
                    defendant’s Securities Trading Desk and thus only confirms that a

                    was “better protected” under the management of UBST (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above):</p>

                    account were the following:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff repays part of the loans</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In September 1997, the plaintiff promised to
                    remit US$1m to the defendant to repay part of the outstanding loans, which was
                    carried out by the plaintiff on 13 and 14 November 1997. The
                    plaintiff’s reason for making payment to the defendant was because
                    interest on the outstanding loans was accumulating and he did not wish to incur
                    more interest:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Go, isn’t it true that in fact you told Ms
                            Ching that you will send US$1 million to repay part of that
                        loan?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Why would you do that, Mr Go --</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, at that time --</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">-- if you were not responsible for repayment of that
                            loan?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, at that time, your Honour, it’s that I
                            told Ms Ching to reverse the loan, and she told me she cannot, it cannot
                            be done, simply because I have to sell off my assets first before the
                            proceed [<em>sic</em>] can pay off the
                        loan.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Based on this statement, I feel I been keeping paying high interest rate,
                        I’m paying the defendant, and I’m afraid that the interest might
                        grow bigger and bigger. Since the defendant has total control of my
                        accounts, they can just deduct the interest rate due any time they
                        want.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So in order to lessen the interest payment, I have, since I have cash
                        sitting in other banks, I decided to remit US$1 million to Bakrie (sic)
                        to pay off the loan to lessen the interest payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Court:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Go, you decided to remit US$1 million to
                            Bakrie, did you say?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I’m sorry, to the defendant, to the bank. Not
                            Bakrie, to the bank.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s meeting with Giles and Ms Ching in
                February 1998 and his participation in the Bakrie Notes and Rossiyskiy Notes
                settlements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     On 18 February 1998, the plaintiff
                    met with Giles and Ms Ching and he was informed by Giles that the
                    Bakrie Group intended to meet with its creditors to discuss a settlement as part
                    of a debt-restructuring exercise. At this meeting, the plaintiff requested
                    Ms Ching to send him more information about the Bakrie Group. Subsequently,
                    the plaintiff also signed a letter addressed to the Bakrie Group dated
                    20 October 1998 to advise them that he was the beneficial owner of the
                    Bakrie Notes. Subsequently, the plaintiff participated in restructuring talks
                    with the Bakrie Group in a bid to salvage whatever value was left in the Bakrie
                    Notes. The plaintiff himself met with the chairman of the Bakrie Group, Aburizal
                    Bakrie, sometime in May 1999 at the Shangri-La Hotel in Manila and
                    discussed the restructuring proposal that was being mooted then by the Bakrie
                    Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     After the defendant closed its Singapore
                    branch in 2001, the assets that were held by the defendant in respect of the
                    Bakrie Notes were transferred to HypoVereinsbank (“HVB”),
                    Singapore, and held in escrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Rossiyskiy Notes were sold to ING Barings
                    at a settled amount as part of a rehabilitation arrangement, which was evidenced
                    by a letter dated 8 September 2000 in which the plaintiff wrote to the
                    defendant regarding the settlement. By then, the plaintiff had already raised
                    the allegations that the investments were unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff raises the allegation that the investments were
                unauthorised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Sometime in late 1998, the defendant was
                    involved in a merger and, as a result, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff
                    requesting him to execute a new set of account documentation to reflect the
                    changes. In his reply dated 28 June 1999, the plaintiff raised,
                    for the first time, the allegation that the investments were not within the
                    conservative investment mandate (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>
                    above) and asked for documentary proof of his instructions to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     What followed was a series of exchanges
                    between the plaintiff and Giles of the defendant. In a letter dated
                    21 July 1999 to the plaintiff, Giles responded to the
                    plaintiff’s allegation with the following statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regarding the more general comments in your letter, I would remind you
                        this is a non-discretionary account, which is managed by yourself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff subsequently wrote back in a letter dated
                    11 August 1999 and alleged that the investments made in his account
                    were unauthorised:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You said that I opened a non-discretionary account with you that I managed
                        by myself. Precisely, I wanted to have the information I asked because I
                        believe that your bank invested my funds in ways that I had not authorized.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These exchanges culminated in the plaintiff’s letter dated
                    15 March 2000 threatening legal action against the defendant for its
                    “mishandling” of his investment accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The unauthorised investments claim: whether the plaintiff had
                authorised the investments in his portfolio</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">It was unlikely that the plaintiff had given the defendant a
                conservative investment mandate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiff attempted to picture himself as
                    a conservative and risk averse investor who was providing for the long-term
                    future of his family. He produced account statements from his other banks
                    claiming that, before 1997, he had only invested in conservative investments
                    such as treasury bills and promissory notes issued by the Central Bank of the
                    Philippines. However, this claim could not be substantiated because the
                    statements that he produced gave no indication as to the nature or type of
                    investments that had been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In his written statement, the plaintiff also
                    referred to the low-to-medium risk investments held in his UBS accounts in an
                    effort to demonstrate that he would <em>only</em> acquire
                    low-to-medium risk investments. However, when cross-examined, he conceded that
                    he had opened the Singapore account with the defendant because he wanted to
                    pursue a different investment strategy from the low-to-medium risk investment
                    policy which he had adopted for his UBS accounts. Therefore, the plaintiff
                    failed to produce any credible evidence before me to support his assertion that
                    he had given the defendant the conservative investment mandate. Between the
                    evidence of the plaintiff and Ms Ching, I accepted Ms Ching’s version
                    of events. My conclusion on this point is further substantiated by the accounts
                    of the plaintiff’s conduct that follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s conduct throughout the relevant period was
                completely inconsistent with his claim that the investments were
                unauthorised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     First, I found it incredible that the
                    plaintiff chose not to complain to the defendant as soon as he had found out
                    that unauthorised investments had been made on his behalf and that loans had
                    been made to his account. It was not disputed that Ms Ching had brought and
                    showed the plaintiff account statements to update him about his Singapore
                    account at their monthly meetings from August 1997 up till
                    February 1998 (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). The
                    plaintiff conceded that he had gone through the account statements for the
                    Singapore account at the monthly meetings and was, therefore, aware of the
                    securities that were held in that account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Although the plaintiff made an attempt to
                    create an issue out of the fact that he was not shown any statements for the
                    Hong Kong account, he admitted that even without the Hong Kong account
                    statements it would have been apparent to him that loans were indeed being drawn
                    down to finance the purchase of the investments. This was because by
                    August 1997 the plaintiff was already aware that a sum of approximately
                    US$7m worth of investments had already been acquired in his Singapore account
                    when he had only remitted approximately US$4m to the defendant in July 1997
                    (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above). This could only mean that
                    the balance of US$3m used to purchase the investments were financed using loans
                    drawn down from the Hong Kong account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     When questioned during cross-examination as to
                    why he did not complain to the defendant about the unauthorised investments
                    immediately after seeing the monthly statements, the plaintiff gave an excuse
                    that he thought that Ms Ching might have made an honest mistake in
                    purchasing those investments. Even if that were true, it still did not explain
                    why the plaintiff failed to register his concerns with the defendant for well
                    over a year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Another reason that was given by the plaintiff
                    for not complaining upon seeing the account statements was that he had
                    insufficient documents to lodge a proper complaint against Ms Ching. The
                    plaintiff attempted, while on the witness stand, to spin new explanations for
                    requiring more documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I put to you that if what you are saying is true
                            about all this being unauthorised, you wouldn’t need any documents
                            to prove that because you didn’t authorise; what documents can
                            there be that you need to prove that you didn’t do
                            something?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Well, I have to -- need the documents to see what is
                            my total loan exposure, when was the loan extended, what are the
                            interest rate, what are the duration, what currency is being given on
                            the loan, because I am totally blank on that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It was completely unbelievable that the
                    plaintiff thought he needed more details before he could complain that US$7m
                    worth of investments and loans had been made in his name without his
                    authorisation. The improbability of it can be likened to a victim whose house is
                    being razed by fire and yet decides to investigate the cause or measure the
                    intensity of the flames instead of calling for help to extinguish it.
                    Remarkably, the plaintiff obstinately insisted that he needed more exact details
                    despite conceding that such information was irrelevant to his ground for
                    complaint:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your response is, you need documents to check
                            certain things.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">One of the things you mentioned is

                            baht or US dollars, right, you still won’t pay?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1">What made it even clearer that all this was merely an afterthought
                    was that the plaintiff, tellingly, did not request for any documents from the
                    defendant. Ultimately, the plaintiff had to concede that, by November 1997, he
                    held, in his possession, sufficient documents to lodge a complaint against
                    Ms Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In his written statement, the plaintiff
                    provided a laundry list of reasons for not wanting to complain about
                    Ms Ching:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff did not wish to be
                        seen as complaining against Ms Ching’s father, who was not only a
                        distant relative but also a senior and venerated member of the Filipino
                        Chinese community;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiff believed that Ms Ching was acting in his best
                        interests at that time;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff did not wish to sour the new banking
                        relationship between him and the defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_d"></a>(d)     the plaintiff thought that the purchases of the
                        investments could not be reversed and that the only way forward was to
                        request Ms Ching to sell them;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_e"></a>(e)     the plaintiff was willing to drop the matter if
                        Ms Ching was able to sell the investments because he adopted a policy
                        of not being unduly confrontational and litigious in business disputes;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        plaintiff was keen in maintaining the secrecy of his investments with the
                        defendant, especially with regard to the Sugarland
                Trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I found none of these reasons credible for the
                    reason that it was extremely difficult to accept that the plaintiff was willing
                    to risk millions of dollars of his hard-earned money for such superficial
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Secondly, not only did the plaintiff choose
                    not to complain until close to two years later, his actions within that period
                    of time were completely inconsistent with his allegations that the investments
                    were unauthorised. In the month of November 1997, the plaintiff had remitted a
                    sum of close to S$1m to the defendant for the purpose of servicing part of the
                    loans in his Hong Kong account (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    above). By then, the plaintiff was already fully aware of the investments that
                    had already been acquired in the Singapore account (see <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> above). There was simply no reason for the plaintiff to
                    have repaid the loans in part if he had not authorised those investments. The
                    plaintiff’s excuse for repaying the loans on the ground that he did not
                    want interest to continue running was patently unbelievable, in my view.
                    Additionally, after the Asian financial crisis, the plaintiff personally
                    participated in the restructuring exercises and executed settlements for the
                    Bakrie Notes and Rossiyskiy Notes, which clearly showed that he accepted the
                    losses suffered on those investments. Indeed, the plaintiff’s conduct was
                    overwhelmingly consistent with that of a person who treated the investments as
                    properly authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Therefore, I could only come to the conclusion
                    that the investments that were acquired in the plaintiff’s Singapore
                    account were properly authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s failure to produce any proper records of
                clients’ instructions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     From the evidence, it was clear that there was
                    a systemic problem of abject record-keeping within the defendant’s
                    organisation. Even Yin, the senior vice-president of operations, was of the
                    attitude that he had no reason to doubt the defendant’s officers. There
                    was a worrying lack of compliance for procedural requirements, and even on the
                    occasions when procedures were complied with, it took the form of bare
                    compliance for the sake of formality with no real regard for the purpose of
                    having such safeguards in place. For example, the defendant’s internal
                    documents show that the plaintiff purportedly gave instructions at the exact
                    same time, or 9.00am, <em>on every single occasion</em>. It
                    was conceded by Ms Yeung that the times recorded in those internal
                    documents probably did not reflect the actual time that the instructions were
                    received. To provide another example, although it was standard procedure for a
                    private banking officer to fill in an order form for the trading desk whenever
                    the officer wished to transact a security, no such order forms were filled by
                    Ms Ching. Similarly, no tape recordings were produced and no proper
                    explanation was given, although phone conversations were supposed to be recorded
                    as a matter of practice (see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above).
                    However, despite these failings, it is my view that Ms Ching, in disclosing the
                    statement accounts to the plaintiff during the monthly meetings, had not acted
                    dishonestly or tried to conceal any evidence from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The plaintiff, in asking this court to draw an
                    adverse inference against the defendant and find that the defendant had failed
                    to discharge the burden of proving that the investments were properly
                    authorised, was plainly mistaken, in my view. On this point, the
                    plaintiff’s reliance on the High Court decision of <em>Surender Singh s/o Jagdish Singh v Li Man Kay</em> [2010] 1 SLR 428
                    was also misplaced. In that case, the burden of proof was placed on the
                    defendant hospital, NUH, only after the plaintiffs had <em>first</em> raised a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    (at [220]–[221]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">220    I accept the
                            plaintiffs’ submission that pursuant to s 108 of the Evidence
                            Act, the burden was on NUH to prove that the Deceased was adequately and
                            appropriately monitored in Ward 43 during the crucial period after 1430
                            hours. As Ms Jasmail only arrived in Ward 43 after 1600 hours, the
                            plaintiffs were not privy to any of the events that took place before
                            her arrival. It would be disproportionately difficult for the plaintiffs
                            to prove a negative – that the staff of NUH had failed to monitor
                            the Deceased in Ward 43. It was for NUH to show that the Deceased was
                            monitored during the period in
                            question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">221    However, a mere
                            allegation by the plaintiffs that the Deceased was not monitored while
                            in Ward 43 is insufficient to invoke s 108 of the Evidence Act. The
                            plaintiffs must first establish a <em>prima
                                facie</em> case against NUH that the Deceased was not
                            monitored. As stated in Woodroffe and Ali, <em>Law of
                                Evidence</em> (([141] <em>supra</em>) at
                            p 4225):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is not the law that the plaintiff ... has to eliminate all possible
                            evidence or circumstances which may exonerate the defendant ... If the
                            facts are within the knowledge of the defendant ... then he has to prove
                            them. <em>Of course, the plaintiff</em> ...
                                <em>has to establish a prima facie case in the first
                                instance, that is, to establish facts which give rise to a
                                suspicion</em>. If this is done, [then] by reason of [s 108 of
                            the Evidence Act], the burden is thrown on the defendant ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, I have already determined at <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> above that there was sufficient evidence of
                    the plaintiff's own conduct before me to find that the investments were properly
                    authorised. The plaintiff’s failure to raise even a <em>prima facie</em> case meant that the defendant did not have to bear
                    the burden of proving that the investments were authorised. Similarly, there was
                    no room for me to draw an adverse inference against the defendant for failing to
                    produce any tape recordings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The advisory claim: whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a
                contractual and/or tortious duty to advise him as to the investments in his

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The question whether a private bank owes a
                    duty to its clients to give investment advice has received a fair bit of
                    judicial attention lately. The judgment by Mrs Justice Gloster
                    (“Gloster J”) of the English High Court in <em>JP
                        Morgan Chase Bank v Springwell Navigation Corporation</em> [2008] EWHC
                    1186 (“<em>Springwell</em>”) conveniently
                    sets out the relevant legal principles and factors that the court has to
                    consider in arriving at its decision. <em>Springwell</em>
                    has recently been cited with approval in the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>Crédit Industriel et Commercial v Teo Wai
                        Cheong</em> [2010] SGHC 155 (“<em>CIC</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In <em>Springwell</em>,
                    the client by the same name (an investment vehicle owned by the Polemis family)
                    brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff bank, Chase, in contract and in
                    tort after it suffered losses to its portfolio as a result of the Russian
                    financial crisis. Taking Lord Hoffmann’s cue in <em>Customs

                    the high abstractions commonly used in such debates”, Gloster J
                    identified the following “lower level” factors that serve as
                    indicators of the existence or otherwise of any contractual or tortious duty of
                    care (at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">i)    the contractual context (including the terms of the
                            relevant contractual documents and disclaimers, and the absence of any
                            written advisory agreement);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">ii)    what, if anything, was said to AP [of the Polemis
                            family] by Chase representatives when he was introduced to JA in
                            1987/1988;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">iii)  the actual role played by JA (including the
                            purpose for which he was giving AP recommendations or advice) over the
                            relevant period 1987–1998;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">iv)    the actual role of the Shipping Department [of
                            Chase] in the period 1987-1990, and, subsequently, the Private Bank [of
                            Chase], in the period 1990–1994;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">v)    the extent of AP’s financial experience or
                            sophistication;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">vi)    the extent of AP’s reliance on JA [an
                            employee of Chase], CMB, CIBL and CMIL, including the extent to which it
                            was foreseeable that he would rely upon them for the investment advice
                            Springwell alleges it should have been given; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">vii)  the regulatory background.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It must first be noted that
                    Gloster J’s analysis proceeded on the basis that Springwell’s
                    claims in contract and in tort overlapped completely. Counsel for Springwell had
                    agreed that the concurrent duties alleged by Springwell were concomitant and
                    co-extensive, and as a result, Gloster J dealt with both the claims in
                    contract and tort as a single issue and held that (<em>Springwell</em> at [47]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... an analysis of the relationship between the parties, by means of an
                        objective analysis of the relevant facts relating to the dealings between
                        the parties in the relevant contextual scene, therefore informs the court
                            <em>both</em> whether a contractual duty and a
                        tortious duty of care exist. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Since the House of Lords’ decision in
                        <em>Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd</em>
                    [1995] 2 AC 145 (“<em>Henderson</em>”), it is now trite law that out of the same
                    contractual context, a general duty of care can arise as a concurrent tortious
                    duty co-existing with the contractual duty. The relationship between concurrent
                    duties owed in contract and tort, however, is a very close one. In <em>Henderson</em>, the House of Lords applied the principle
                    established in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp;
                        Partners Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465 that an assumption of
                    responsibility coupled with reliance may give rise to a tortious duty of care
                    (the “<em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle”) and
                    held that such a duty can exist concurrently with an existing contractual duty,
                    so long as the latter does not limit or exclude the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The significance of the contractual
                    relationship in determining the scope of any duty of care owed in tort was

                    tortious duties arising out of that assumption of responsibility. However, if
                    there was no assumption of responsibility by either party, the contract will
                        <em>generally</em> be completely determinative of the
                    scope of the parties’ duties. This position appears to be borne out from
                    the authorities that follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In <em>Springwell</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> <em>supra</em>), the relationship between Springwell and
                    Chase was governed by a number of contracts spanning a period of ten years.
                    Although the contractual terms found in the individual agreements did not
                    purport to cover the entire breadth and timeframe of that relationship,
                    Gloster J held, nevertheless, that the terms found in the principal
                    agreements were evidence of a wider course of dealing that governed their
                    relationship as a whole (at [477]). Gloster J cited the House of
                    Lords’ decision of <em>Henderson</em> (<a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> <em>supra</em>) and held that the contractual terms which
                    had been found to govern the entirety of dealings between the parties negated
                    any possibility of an advisory duty coming into existence
                    (at [474]–[475]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">474.  It was common
                            ground that, <b>in determining whether the circumstances

                                and to allocate risk, by contract</b>. If the parties have
                            contractually defined the terms upon which they will conduct business,
                            then that may in the normal case provide a clear and often determinative
                            indication as to the non-existence of any wider tortious duty. In
                                <em>Henderson v Merrett</em> Lord
                            Browne-Wilkinson said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘The existence of a contract does not exclude the co-existence
                            of concurrent fiduciary duties (indeed, the contract may well be their

                                extent and nature of the general duty that would otherwise
                                arise</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In my judgment, this traditional approach of equity to fiduciary
                            duties is instructive when considering the relationship between a
                            contract and any duty of care arising under the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle (of which fiduciary duties of
                            care are merely an example). The existence of an underlying contract
                            (e.g. as between solicitor and client) does not automatically exclude
                            the general duty of care which the law imposes on those who voluntarily
                            assume to act for others. <b>But the nature and terms of

                                some cases, exclude any assumption of legal responsibility to the
                                plaintiff for whom the defendant has assumed to
                            act</b></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I can see no good reason for holding that the existence of a

                            parties evidenced by the contract can modify and shape the tortious
                            duties which, in the absence of contract, would be

                            Springwell and Chase were dealing with each other on a stipulated and
                            accepted basis that, whatever advice or recommendations may have been
                            given by Chase in the course of their trading relationship (i.e. the
                            sale by CIBL/CMIL to Springwell of emerging markets securities, and the
                            financing by CMB of various of Springwell’s purchases), no
                            obligations to give appropriate investment advice, or duties of care as
                            an investment advisor, were being assumed by either the Private Bank,
                            CMB, or the Investment Bank, as the entity actually selling Springwell
                            the relevant securities, (i.e. CIBL or CMIL), whether in relation to
                            Springwell’s emerging markets portfolio or, more generally, as to
                            what Springwell should do, given the existence of that portfolio.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     An example where a contractual term excluded
                    the scope of any concurrent tortious duty can be found in the recent English
                    decision <em>IFE Fund SA v Goldman Sachs International</em>
                    [2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 449. Waller LJ, sitting in the Court of Appeal,
                    referred to the judgment of Toulson J below with approval and held that the

                    any scope for imposing a duty to advise on the bank, Goldman Sachs. In that
                    case, Goldman Sachs successfully relied on an “Important Notice”
                    which contained standard terms expressly stating that it had not independently
                    verified the information set out in a Syndication Information Memorandum and
                    that it accepted no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    [Toulson J] held
                            that there was no duty of care as alleged, and did so in these

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">63.    
                <b>The mezzanine syndication
                                    involved a number of interlocking contractual relationships

                                the terms of the SIM made plain. It was acting for the sponsors and
                                not on behalf of the recipients of the SIM. In general a party
                                involved in negotiations towards a commercial venture owes no
                                positive duty of disclosure towards another prospective party. A
                                duty of disclosure may be undertaken, but no such duty was
                                undertaken in this case either expressly or impliedly. The
                                expression ‘assumption of responsibility’ has on
                                occasions been used in cases where it would be more accurate to
                                speak of the court imposing a responsibility, but I can see no
                                ground on which it would be fair to impose on Goldman Sachs the duty

                    Steel J was of the opinion that the scope of the obligations owed by the bank to

                            professional advisers, including his accountants, lawyers and tax
                            advisors, and further that the bank does not make recommendations or
                            give advice and (b) this is borne out by the evidence of
                        conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     It is thus clear from the authorities that the
                    court will not lightly find the existence of an additional duty within a banking
                    relationship that is already governed by contract unless there is conduct
                    amounting to an assumption of responsibility coupled with reliance under the
                        <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle (<a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As the plaintiff has claimed that the
                    defendant owed concurrent and co-extensive duties in both contract and tort to
                    advise him as to the prudence of his investment portfolio, I gratefully adopt
                    the “lower level” factors formulated by Gloster J in
                        <em>Springwell</em> in so far as they are relevant to
                    the present case and list them as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     the extent of the plaintiff’s
                        financial experience and sophistication;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     the contractual context;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     the actual role played by
                        Ms Ching (including the purpose for which she was giving the plaintiff
                        recommendations); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     the extent of the plaintiff’s reliance on
                    Ms Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the plaintiff was an inexperienced and unsophisticated
                investor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The plaintiff attempted to give the impression
                    that he was an inexperienced and unsophisticated investor who relied heavily on
                    others for investment advice. He did so by calling attention to his three
                    existing UBS investment accounts, of which one was an advisory account and the
                    other two were discretionary accounts, to support his claim that he was
                    incapable of making investment decisions and managing his own investments. I
                    found this submission difficult to accept on the plaintiff’s own
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In my judgment, whether or not a particular
                    client is a sophisticated one depends on the particular factual matrix
                    concerned. In the present case, the investments forming the subject of dispute
                    were simply corporate and sovereign-linked bonds which, in my view, were simple
                    securities that could easily be understood by someone with the plaintiff’s
                    knowledge and experience. The plaintiff, who was also a successful and wealthy
                    businessman, clearly understood the types of risk involved, such as default risk
                    and exchange-rate risk. Not only that, the plaintiff was shrewd enough to move
                    his funds out of the peso in early 1997 in anticipation of its
                    devaluation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff also conceded that he had
                    sufficient knowledge of investment principles to make the investment decisions
                    for his UBS advisory account and, therefore, had no problems rejecting
                    UBS’s recommendations. Indeed, it was the plaintiff’s own evidence
                    that he relied on UBS’s recommendations simply to offset his lack of
                    knowledge of <em>the type of investments that were available in
                        the market</em>. Similarly, in his relationship with the defendant,
                    the plaintiff had no difficulty rejecting Ms Ching’s recommendations
                    when he thought that they were too risky.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I therefore find that, in the particular
                    context of the present case, the plaintiff was not an inexperienced and
                    unsophisticated client who had to rely entirely on the defendant for advice
                    relating to the management of his investment portfolio.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the contractual terms imposed a duty on the defendant to act
                as the plaintiff’s investment advisor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I begin by noting that none of the contractual
                    terms expressly provide for an advisory relationship between the parties. Mr
                    Ramesh argued that, nevertheless, a duty to advise ought to be implied into the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The first argument by Mr Ramesh for implying
                    such a duty was that the very nature of a private banking relationship ought to
                    give rise to an implied duty on the private banker’s part to advise a
                    customer on investments. The reason given was that the private banking
                    relationship is a special relationship whereby the bank holds itself out as
                    having the requisite experience to chart a successful course of judgment to a
                    high net-worth individual who entrusts a portion of his wealth to the private
                    bank and relies on the bank’s judgment and advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In my view, this line of argument was based
                    not on contract as argued by Mr Ramesh but on the twin criteria of
                    voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance, which are essential factors
                    in meeting the test of proximity for establishing a <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty of care in law (see <em>Spandeck
                        Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck
                        Engineering</em>”) at [81]), and accordingly, I will address
                    this argument in a later part of my judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The next argument by Mr Ramesh was
                    that the parties had agreed for the Singapore account to be an advisory account,
                    and thus the defendant owed a continuing duty to the plaintiff to give
                    investment advice related to his portfolio. To establish this, Mr Ramesh
                    relied on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_1"></a>(1)     there were no express terms negating
                        the duty to advise;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_2"></a>(2)     the manner in which the contractual documentation was
                        executed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_3"></a>(3)     the
                        fact that the plaintiff was charged an account fee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_98-p2_4"></a>(4)     the fact that the defendant’s
                        representatives had endorsed the existence of a duty to
                    advise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     As there are no express terms providing for a
                    duty to advise, Mr Ramesh sought to establish that there was significance
                    in the order in which the contractual documents were executed (the plaintiff had
                    executed the DIMA before executing the IAI). Mr Ramesh argued that the effect of
                    executing the DIMA first was that the defendant owed a duty to use its
                    discretion to source for and select appropriate investments on behalf of the
                    plaintiff, taking into account his risk profile and the economic circumstances.
                    The subsequent execution of the IAI merely revoked the defendant’s power
                    to make investment decisions on behalf of the plaintiff, without relieving the
                    defendant from its continuing duty to recommend suitable investments under the
                    DIMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I certainly find nothing controversial in
                    the submission that the defendant was obliged to search for and recommend
                    suitable investments. In fact, the evidence suggested that they had proceeded on
                    that very basis. But it does not necessarily follow from there that parties had
                    agreed for the defendant to continually give investment advice to the plaintiff.
                    In my opinion, it is one thing to require the defendant <em>to
                        recommend securities that were available in the market and within the
                        plaintiff’s risk appetite</em>, and it is quite another to
                    require the defendant <em>to continually give wide-ranging advice
                        with regards to the portfolio and recommend investment decisions</em>
                    such as when to trade or hold on to particular securities. The mere duty to
                    recommend securities, in my view, certainly does not, without more, give rise to
                    a further and continuing duty to give advice with regards to the management of
                    the investment portfolio. In arriving at this decision, I find some support from
                        <em>Springwell</em> (<a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [108]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… All that Springwell was being offered, through AP being given
                        access to JA, was the provision of an alternative product to time deposits.
                        Moreover, such personal recommendations, or advice, as AP was being given by
                        JA – at least at this early stage – about the products that
                        CIBL, by JA, was offering to sell (mainly ECP), <em>has to be
                            viewed, in my judgment, as no more than the recommendations of a trader
                            to a buyer as to what was available, on what terms, and perhaps also as
                            to the respective merits of the products on offer, given the
                            requirements of the particular client. It may well be that,
                            theoretically, in such circumstances, a low level duty of care would
                            arise on the part of the salesman not to make any negligent
                            misstatements, or even to use reasonable care not to recommend a highly
                            risky investment without pointing out that it was such, but a low level
                            duty along those lines is worlds away from the wide duty of care that
                            was pleaded or relied upon as having arisen at this early
                            stage</em>. In Mr. Brindle’s words, it was at the lower end
                        of the spectrum. Thus the notion that, in the context of the trading
                        relationship at this early stage, as a result of the manner in which JA was
                        introduced to AP, CIBL and/or CMB, by JA had either an obligation to
                        ascertain Springwell’s investment criteria, or to give wide ranging
                        advice, for example, about portfolio diversification or concentration
                        issues, or in relation to the general composition of the portfolio as a
                        whole, is one that, in my judgment, simply does not reflect the reality of
                        the position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Equally damaging to the plaintiff’s
                    argument was the evidence of his own conduct. Indeed, the plaintiff himself was
                    of the view that the account was to be completely managed by him, as evident
                    from his letter to the defendant dated 11 August 1999 in which he
                    conceded that the Singapore account was <em>non-discretionary</em> and that he would be managing his own
                    portfolio (see <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above). Furthermore, at
                    no point in time during the entire relationship did the plaintiff ask
                    Ms Ching for her opinion with regards to the investments that were already
                    in his portfolio. One would have thought that, in the midst of the uncertainty
                    during the Asian financial crisis, a client who had contracted for advisory
                    services would have hurriedly sought professional investment advice from his
                    contracted advisor. It was unbelievable that the plaintiff simply sat back and
                    made no request for advice had he actually contracted for advisory services from
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The plaintiff also sought to characterise
                    the account fee as being consideration for investment advice. He argued that
                    because the defendant still charged a fee, despite having executed the IAI, it
                    must have been intended as consideration for providing advisory services. The
                    plaintiff even went so far as to claim that there was no other reason for him to
                    pay the defendant quarterly fees. I was not persuaded by this argument. The
                    fee payable can be found in cl 16.01 of the AOCA, which was an agreement that
                    was executed whenever an account was opened with the defendant, regardless of
                    whether it was a discretionary account or not. This meant that the fee was
                    charged by the defendant for simply acting as the <em>custodian</em> of the assets held in a client’s account and not
                    for the management of those assets. This was evidenced in the Preamble, read
                    with cll 16.01 and 20 of the AOCA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The plaintiff] wish[es] to open accounts with [the defendant] and to hold
                        in such accounts for [himself] any cash, term deposits, securities, deeds,

                        transferred to you or to any third party nominated by [the defendant] for
                        the purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.01 A fee shall be payable to the Bank amounting to
                                <del>one</del> .25 percent per annum,
                            which fee shall be charged per quarter or part thereof, in arrear, based
                            on the total market value, as reflected in the Bank’s statement of

                            accounts on the relevant Quarter Day or the day upon which the accounts
                            are closed if other than on a Quarter Day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    … The [defendant] shall not be responsible

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[amendment in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The argument by the plaintiff that the fee was for advisory services
                    was plainly unsupported by the objective documentary evidence and I rejected it
                    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Mr Ramesh then attempted to rely on a
                    statement that was made in these proceedings by a Dr Karl Tambornino
                    (“Dr Tambornino”), general counsel for the defendant.
                    Mr Ramesh argued that the statement amounted to an admission on the
                    defendant’s part that it was under a duty to advise. This statement can be
                    found in para 6 of his affidavit filed for an earlier stay application in favour
                    of the Hong Kong courts on 24 October 2005 (“the Affidavit
                    Statement”), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The core element of the business relationship between the Plaintiff and
                        the Defendant is the rendering of investment advice and investment
                        management, respectively, in Hong Kong. While investments may have been
                        carried out on the Plaintiff’s behalf through the conduit of the
                        Singapore Account, the actual investment advice and investment services that
                        were carried out on behalf of the Plaintiff was performed by a Private
                        Banking business subsidiary of the Defendant based in Hong Kong, pursuant to
                        Articles [sic] 9 of the DIMA and IMA, respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Ramesh had also referred Yin to Dr Tambornino’s
                    Affidavit Statement during cross-examination in an attempt to extract a
                    concession that the duty to advise was a core element of a private banking
                    relationship. However, Yin pointed out that any such duty would fall to be
                    defined by the contractual documents:</p>

                            would offer investment advice and investment management services in
                            relation to his accounts?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You accept that?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That was your understanding of the relationship
                            between Mr Go and the bank?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As far as I can remember, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As far as I can remember.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You have no reason to disagree with paragraphs 6 and
                            7 of the affidavit?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I can’t remember exactly the nature of the
                            account opening.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I understand. But you would accept that, based on
                            what Dr Tambornino has said, you have no reason to disagree with what he
                            is saying is [sic] paragraphs 6 and 7?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, because I would suspect that he would have had
                            supporting documents to say what he’s saying.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In my view, the plaintiff has placed far too
                    much significance on Dr Tambornino’s Affidavit Statement. First,
                    Dr Tambornino’s Affidavit Statement must be read in the context of
                    the application for which it was made, which was for a stay of proceedings on
                    the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Furthermore,
                    Dr Tambornino had simply acknowledged that there was a duty to give
                    investment advice but he did not venture to define the scope of that duty. The
                    precise scope of the duty to advise, as correctly pointed out by Yin, falls to
                    be defined by the contract (subject to any duty arising from the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle (<a href="#p1_82">[82]</a> <em>supra</em>) which will be addressed separately below).
                    As mentioned at <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a> above, the evidence
                    suggests that parties had proceeded on the basis that the defendant was under a
                    duty only to recommend suitable investments to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Finally, Mr Ramesh sought to
                    distinguish the present case from the cases cited from <a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> to <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above on the
                    basis that the banking relationships in those cases were governed by express
                    terms and disclaimers that negated the duty to advise. For convenience, I shall
                    categorise the material contractual terms that were present in the cases cited
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_a"></a>(a)     the bank was not making any
                        recommendation or giving any advice to the client or acting as an adviser
                            (<em>CIC</em> (<a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [19]; <em>Titan Steel</em> (<a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [30]; <em>IFE
                            Fund</em> ((<a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [13]; <em>Springwell</em> (<a href="#p1_79">[79]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [210]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_105-p2_b"></a>(b)     the client would seek his own
                        independent advice (<em>CIC</em> at [19];
                            <em>Titan Steel</em>
                at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Although the plaintiff was right to point
                    out that no such terms can be found in the present case, I was not persuaded
                    that this difference was critical. Each agreement has to be construed on its own
                    terms. In the present case, the parties had executed the DIMA first before
                    subsequently executing the IAI. As the DIMA was the standard term agreement
                    for opening a discretionary account which was managed solely by the bank. It was
                    only natural that there were no disclaimers or contractual terms negating any
                    duty to advise to be found in it as there was no need to provide for
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Accordingly, my conclusion is that there was
                    no contractual duty on the defendant to continue to provide investment advice to
                    the plaintiff after it had recommended investment products that were available
                    in the market to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The actual role played by Ms Ching and the extent of reliance
                the plaintiff placed on her</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    As mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> above, the fulfilment of the twin criteria of
                    voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance will give rise to a
                        <em>prima facie</em> duty of care under the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle. To determine whether these
                    criteria have been met, it would be necessary to examine the actual role that
                    was played by Ms Ching and the extent to which the plaintiff had relied on
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    As already established, Ms Ching had
                    provided recommendations of investments to the plaintiff at the monthly
                    meetings. At most, this would give rise to the sort of low-level duty of care,
                    as defined by Gloster J, not to “make any negligent misstatements,
                    or even to use reasonable care not to recommend a highly risky investment
                    without pointing out that it was such” (at <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a> above). However, during cross-examination, the plaintiff
                    conceded that <em>he had not relied on any of
                        Ms Ching’s recommendations</em>. This was for the obvious
                    reason that any admission of reliance would fly contrary to his primary case
                    that the investments were unauthorised. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot now
                    complain that his losses were the result of the defendant’s failure to
                    take reasonable care and skill in making those recommendations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Both sides also accepted that Ms Ching did
                    not provide any other form of advice to the plaintiff. That being the case,
                    there was no ground for the plaintiff to argue that the defendant had
                    voluntarily assumed any responsibility for giving investment advice to the
                    plaintiff on an ongoing basis. The plaintiff also conceded that the investments
                    in the Singapore account during the Asian financial crisis were not held in
                    reliance upon any advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    As a result, I concluded that the defendant
                    owed no duty of care in tort to give investment advice to the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The expert evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Having concluded that the defendant owed no
                    duty in contract or tort to give investment advice to the plaintiff in relation
                    to the investments that were held in the Singapore account, there was no need
                    for me to consider the expert evidence and make a determination on the scope of
                    a bank’s duty to give investment advice during the Asian financial
                    crisis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the
                    plaintiff’s action with costs to be taxed unless agreed.</p>
