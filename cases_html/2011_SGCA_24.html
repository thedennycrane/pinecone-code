        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                Court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal from the decision of the trial
                    judge in <em>Public Prosecutor v Galing Anak Kujat and
                        another</em> [2010] SGHC 212 (the “GD”), where the
                    learned trial judge convicted Galing Anak Kujat (“Galing”) and
                    Jabing Kho (“Jabing”) (collectively “the
                    appellants”) of murder in furtherance of the common intention of both of
                    them, under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”), and sentenced them both to
                    suffer the mandatory death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The trial judge’s decision was given
                    before this Court delivered its judgment in <em>Daniel Vijay s/o
                        Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] 4 SLR 1119
                        (“<em>Daniel Vijay</em>”). It was
                    therefore necessary for us to reserve our judgment in this case in order to
                    carefully consider the trial judge’s reasons and conclusions in light of
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em>, where this Court comprehensively
                    reviewed both local and foreign case law on s 34 of the Penal Code, and
                    laid down what is required to be proved in order to make out the requisite
                    “common intention” (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>
                    and <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> below) to render two or more
                    persons jointly liable for an offence. For ease of reference, s 34 of the
                    Penal Code is reproduced here:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Each of several persons liable
                            for an act done by all, in like manner as if done by him
                            alone</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>34</b>.    When a criminal act
                            is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of
                            all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as
                            if the act were done by him alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Unless otherwise stated, the following facts are
                    undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Both appellants are from Sarawak, Malaysia.
                    Galing is 26 years of age, and was employed to load oil onto ships. Jabing is 24
                    years of age, and worked in Singapore for a rag and bone company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the afternoon of 17 February 2008, the
                    appellants agreed, together with three other Sarawakians, Vencent Anak Anding
                    (also known as “Vincent” or “Vencent”)
                    (“Vencent”), a construction worker; Anthony Anak Jaban
                    (“Anthony”); and Alan Anak Ajan (“Alan”), a
                    colleague of Jabing’s, to rob two Bangladeshi co-workers of
                    Vencent’s at a worksite at Tiong Bahru. The robbery was aborted because
                    the two targets fortuitously left the worksite with their supervisor in his van.
                    Despite this, the appellants, Vencent, Anthony and Alan remained at Tiong Bahru
                    for some time, consuming liquor known as “Narcissus Ginseng Wine
                    Tonic”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Eventually, at about 7:00 pm, the five of them
                    left Tiong Bahru and travelled to Geylang. There was some dispute as to whether
                    or not there had been a plan to commit robbery at Geylang after the earlier plan
                    was aborted. In his various statements, and during the trial, Galing maintained
                    that there was no intention to commit robbery at Geylang, and that the intention
                    (of all five individuals) in going to Geylang was to continue drinking. Jabing,
                    however, stated to the police and at trial that the intention among them all in
                    going to Geylang was to rob.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At Geylang, along Lorong 4, the appellants
                    walked some distance away from Vencent, Anthony and Alan. The appellants spotted
                    two persons, Wu Jun and Cao Ruyin (“the deceased”) (collectively
                    “the victims”), walking along a pathway in an open space near
                    Geylang Drive, and assaulted them. Wu Jun was assaulted by Galing, by means of a
                    belt wrapped around Galing’s hand or fist, with the metal belt buckle
                    exposed. The deceased was assaulted by Jabing with what was variously described
                    as a piece of wood or a tree branch (the “piece of wood”), which
                    Jabing had picked up while approaching the victims. The deceased was also
                    assaulted by Galing using the metal belt buckle. The deceased suffered severe
                    head injuries inflicted from the piece of wood (from which he died on
                    23 February 2008), and his mobile phone was taken by Galing. Wu Jun escaped
                    with minor injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The exact chain of events which occurred during
                    the assault is disputed. Galing stated that Jabing led the way in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     crossing the road (in order to reach
                        the victims);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     intimating that the appellants should rob the victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     picking up the piece of wood;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     striking the
                        deceased with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, according to Galing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     he told Jabing not to rob the
                        victims but was ignored by Jabing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     he assaulted Wu Jun (<em>after</em>
                        the deceased had already been assaulted by Jabing with the piece of wood)
                        because Wu Jun seemed to be about to attack Jabing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c_3"></a>(c)     he chased Wu Jun for some distance
                        before returning to where Jabing and the deceased were
                    located;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d_4"></a>(d)     Wu Jun
                        returned to the scene of the assault, and Jabing chased Wu Jun away a second
                        time before he (Galing) called Jabing back.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Jabing, however, stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was Galing who first crossed the
                        road to approach the victims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Galing had by then already wrapped his belt around his
                        hand;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     Galing was
                        already about to strike the deceased with the belt in his hands by the time
                        Jabing picked up the piece of wood;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     he (Jabing) chased after Wu Jun, who had fled the scene of
                        the assault;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     he
                        (Jabing) gave up the chase and returned to the scene of the assault, where
                        he saw Galing struggling with the deceased; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a>(f)     he (Jabing) then struck the deceased with the
                        piece of wood twice, after which he then fled the scene of the assault, but
                        not before noticing Galing hitting the deceased with his belt and having
                        taken the deceased’s mobile phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To complicate matters, Wu Jun’s evidence
                    in his statement was that, while walking together with the deceased at the
                    material time, he felt something hard hit him at the back of his head. He ran a
                    few steps forward, turned round, and saw a man with a tanned complexion, wearing
                    a cap, coming towards him in a menacing manner with a clenched fist, whereupon
                    he (Wu Jun) fled the scene. Wu Jun’s evidence was that he could hear the
                    deceased groaning in pain. After running for a while, Wu Jun called for the
                    police on his mobile phone, and subsequently returned to the scene of the
                    assault, where he discovered the deceased lying unconscious and vomiting blood.
                    Wu Jun also noted that the deceased’s mobile phone was missing. At trial,
                    Wu Jun stated that he noticed only one assailant that night, and was unable to
                    say whether he or the deceased was attacked first, how the deceased was attacked
                    or who attacked the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After the assault, the appellants, Vencent,
                    Anthony and Alan eventually regrouped at a coffeeshop at Lorong 24 Geylang.
                    Galing’s and Jabing’s versions of how each of them ended up at the
                    coffeeshop differed. Galing stated that, after he had called Jabing back from
                    pursuing Wu Jun (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), he and
                    Jabing subsequently met the others at the coffeeshop. Jabing, however, claimed
                    that he had become separated from the others (including Galing) after the
                    assault, and only joined them at the coffeeshop after receiving a call from
                    Vencent telling him where they were. There was also some dispute as to what
                    transpired at the coffeeshop, such as whether Jabing had been chastised by
                    Galing and the others for using excessive force against the deceased. What is
                    not disputed, however, is that Galing sold the deceased’s mobile phone to
                    Vencent for $300, and that all five individuals received $50 from the proceeds
                    (with the remaining $50 being used to buy food and drink). Galing and Jabing
                    were only arrested several days after the incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Neither appellant challenged the admissibility
                    or voluntariness of their statements. At trial, only Wu Jun and the two
                    appellants gave direct evidence as to what had transpired. Jabing was largely
                    content to stand by the contents of his statements (although there were some
                    discrepancies, such as whether he had seen Galing hitting the deceased);
                    however, Galing challenged the veracity or accuracy of various parts of his
                    statements relating to Jabing’s assault on the deceased, and his taking of
                    the deceased’s mobile phone (see [39]–[47] of the GD), claiming that
                    these had been made by him in response to suggestions made by the investigating
                    officer (“IO”). This claim was raised rather late in the day,
                    during the case for the Defence, after these statements had already been
                    admitted into evidence during the Prosecution’s case (when the relevant
                    witnesses, the IO and the interpreter, were not cross-examined on this issue)
                    and after the Prosecution had closed its case. The Defence then recalled the
                    relevant witnesses, but they rejected Galing’s allegations that the
                    recording of his statement was inaccurate or improper. The trial judge rightly
                    accepted their evidence, as Galing was unable to provide any evidence or
                    explanation as to why the statements would have been recorded in the fashion he
                    had alleged, or why he would have agreed to them if they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The trial judge identified four key issues for
                    determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether there was a common intention
                        to rob the deceased;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether the appellants knew that death was likely to be
                        caused;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether
                        the appellants had the necessary common intention under s 34 of the
                        Penal Code; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether murder was committed in furtherance of the common
                    intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In relation to the first issue, the trial
                    judge (at [54] of the GD) rejected Galing’s evidence that there was no
                    intention to rob the victims, and found that Galing was “a willing
                    participant in the robbery with Jabing”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In relation to the second issue, the trial
                    judge found (at [55] of the GD) that <em>the appellants’
                        intention was to rob the victims by the use of force</em>, and that
                    Galing knew that when he and Jabing robbed the deceased, the deceased would be
                    assaulted and serious injuries might be inflicted on him. Against this
                    background, the trial judge found (at [58] of the GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In relation to the third issue, the trial
                    judge reminded himself of the law relating to common intention as it was
                    articulated in <em>Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 447 (“<em>Lee Chez
                    Kee</em>”) (at [253]), and reiterated (at [59] of the GD) that
                    while <em>the common intention of the appellants was to rob, and
                        not to kill</em>, they knew that there was the likelihood that serious
                    injury might be inflicted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In relation to the fourth issue, the trial
                    judge held (at [62] of the GD) that Jabing’s actions satisfied
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code, and concluded
                    from this that the murder was therefore committed in furtherance of the common
                    intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The foregoing summary of the trial
                    judge’s decision reveals that he, unfortunately, fell into the same error
                    as the trial judge in <em>Public Prosecutor v Daniel Vijay s/o
                        Katherasan and others</em> [2008] SGHC 120, in that there was a
                    specific finding that the appellants did <em>not</em> have
                    a common intention to <em>kill</em> the deceased, but only
                    to rob him; and that the findings relating to the common intention of the
                    appellants were referable only to the <em>robbery</em>, and
                    not to the <em>killing</em> (see [4], [44], [45], [59], [66], [148] and [164] of
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em>). The trial judge’s
                    approach in this case was based on what was termed in <em>Daniel
                        Vijay</em> the “putative <em>Mimi Wong
                        (CCA)</em> test”, which was rejected by this Court in <em>Daniel Vijay</em> as a misunderstanding of what was truly
                    decided and/or stated in <em>Wong Mimi and another v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1971–1973] SLR(R) 412 (“<em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em>”). The putative <em>Mimi Wong (CCA)</em> test, as expressed in [35] of <em>Daniel
                        Vijay</em>, is that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[F]or the purposes of imputing constructive liability to secondary
                        offenders pursuant to s 34, there does not need to be a common
                        intention between C (the actual doer) and A and B (the secondary offenders)
                        to commit the criminal act done by C which gives rise to the offence that A,
                        B and C are charged with; all that is required is that the criminal act
                        committed by C is in furtherance of and is not inconsistent with the
                        criminal act commonly intended by A, B and C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As the trial judge’s judgment rested on
                    a misapprehension of the law, on that basis alone the convictions of the
                    appellants are unsafe. What follows, therefore, is a <em>de
                        novo</em> examination of how the appellants’ convictions ought
                    to be dealt with under the law on common intention as stated in <em>Daniel Vijay</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The main issues for our consideration
                    are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Jabing’s conviction for
                        murder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Galing’s conviction for murder, which entails a consideration
                        of:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       the criminal
                        act;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the
                            common intention;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       whether the criminal act was done in
                            furtherance of the common intention; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       whether there was the requisite
                            participation by Galing in the criminal act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jabing’s conviction for murder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We are of the view that Jabing was rightly
                    convicted of murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the
                    Penal Code, as the evidence shows that he had intentionally inflicted on the
                    deceased, using the piece of wood he had picked up, a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury which caused the death of the
                deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The requirements of s 300(<em>c</em>) are set out in the hallowed passage from [12] of <em>Virsa Singh v State
                        of Punjab</em> AIR 1958 SC 465 (“<em>Virsa
                        Singh</em>”), which was referred to by the trial judge (at [61]
                    of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, [the prosecution] must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily
                        injury is present;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely
                        objective investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or
                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds
                        further and,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described
                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in
                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective
                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the
                        offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first two <em>Virsa
                        Singh</em> requirements are clearly satisfied in this case: the
                    deceased had suffered horrific head injuries consisting of multiple skull
                    fractures, swelling of the brain, and severe haemorrhaging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In relation to the third <em>Virsa Singh</em> requirement, Jabing’s evidence throughout was
                    that he had hit the deceased (with the piece of wood) twice, and in court he
                    maintained that he had not been aiming for the deceased’s head, nor was he
                    aware of the force he had used (see [50] of the GD). Although he testified in
                    court that he could not remember where the second blow landed, this was
                    inconsistent with his statements, in which he admitted hitting the deceased on
                    the head on both occasions, and, indeed, his statements indicate that Jabing was
                    in fact aiming for the deceased’s head, or was intending to strike it. The
                    trial judge in evaluating the evidence noted that Jabing had admitted in his
                    first statement of 26 February 2008 that he swung the piece of wood towards
                    the head of the deceased and that the single blow caused the deceased to fall
                    onto the ground (see [56] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This account was confirmed by Galing’s
                    statements to the police as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[M]y friend Jabing was <em>too violent</em> when
                        hitting the Chinese man until he bled profusely. I saw him hitting the
                        Chinese man <em>several times</em> and his head
                            <em>cracked open</em>. … I really regretted
                        that Jabing hit him <em>so many times</em> until he
                        died ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Galing also stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When Jabing neared both of them, <em>he used both his
                            hands</em> and swung the wood towards the right side of the bigger
                        built male Chinese …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I gave up the chase and turned back towards Jabing who was
                        hitting the other Chinese with the wood in his hands <em>repeatedly</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although Galing later attempted to question the accuracy of these
                    statements in what appears to be a belated attempt to downplay Jabing’s
                    culpability (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), there was
                    little reason to doubt that they had been correctly recorded. Galing’s
                    statements, therefore, were evidence that Jabing struck the deceased more than
                    twice, and with considerable violence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The violent assault on the deceased was
                    corroborated by the medical evidence (summarised at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>–<a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> of the GD),
                    which was that the deceased had sustained life-threatening injuries to his head
                    and brain. There was evidence from the forensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng
                    Swee (“Dr Teo”), that there could have been more than five blows
                    to the deceased’s head, and both Dr Teo and Dr Ho Chi Long (the
                    physician who first attended the deceased at the accident and emergency room)
                    were of the opinion that at least some of the injuries required “very
                    severe” or “huge” blunt force from several blows to be
                    inflicted. Dr Teo added that one of the fractures that resulted in the
                    initial fragmentation of the skull required “severe
                force”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In light of all this evidence, as well as the
                    fact that the severe injuries found on the deceased were concentrated at the
                    region of his head, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Jabing intended
                    to, and did, inflict multiple head injuries on the deceased, and that such
                    injuries were certainly not accidental or unintentional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As for whether the injuries were sufficient in
                    the ordinary course of nature to cause death (the fourth <em>Virsa Singh</em> requirement), this was affirmed to be the case by
                    Dr Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Consequently, the trial judge found as a fact
                    that Jabing had struck the deceased on the head in order to rob him, and that
                    the blow with the piece of wood was struck by Jabing with such force that Galing
                    saw his head crack open, and concluded from this that Jabing’s actions
                    fell within s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code (see
                    [62] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Applying the <em>Virsa
                        Singh</em> test to the facts found by the trial judge, we affirm his
                    decision, and hold that Jabing was properly convicted of murder under
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code, since his
                    actions satisfied the <em>actus reus</em> and <em>mens rea</em> required by that subsection. On appeal, the
                    only arguable defence raised by Jabing’s counsel was that he was drunk and
                    therefore not responsible for his actions. We reject this and agree with the
                    trial judge that the events and Jabing’s statements to the investigators
                    clearly showed that he knew what he was doing. The defence of intoxication under
                    s 85(2) of the Penal Code applies in very narrow circumstances, for the
                    intoxication must result in the accused not knowing that his actions were wrong
                    or not knowing what he was doing, and the intoxication must either have been
                    involuntary or the accused must have been, as a result of the intoxication,
                    insane at the material time (see <em>Tan Chor Jin v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 306 (“<em>Tan Chor Jin</em>”) at [18]–[26]). Nor
                    was there credible objective evidence of Jabing’s level of intoxication at
                    the material time, and it could not be said that the surrounding facts showed
                    that Jabing was so intoxicated that he could not form the intention required by
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code, <em>ie</em>, the intention to inflict head injury. Hence, Jabing
                    could not avail himself of s 86(2) of the Penal Code by contending that he
                    was so intoxicated that he lacked the necessary <em>mens
                        rea</em> under s 300(<em>c</em>) (see
                        <em>Tan Chor Jin</em> at [27]–[29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Galing’s conviction for murder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Given the clear evidence that Jabing was the
                    one who inflicted the fatal injuries on the deceased, the trial judge did not
                    find, and the Prosecution did not argue, that Galing’s assault on the
                    deceased caused or contributed in any way to the latter’s death.
                    Consequently, the Prosecution has failed to establish that Galing’s blow
                    caused any serious injury to the deceased. Therefore, convicting him of the
                    murder of the deceased under s 302 of the Penal Code is only sustainable in
                    law if he is deemed to be constructively liable under s 34 of the Penal
                    Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The common intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is clear from <em>Daniel
                        Vijay</em> (at [93], [107], [119], [143], [176] and [178]) that, in
                    order for Galing to be convicted of murder under s 302 read with s 34
                    of the Penal Code, the common intention that Galing must have shared with Jabing
                    is <em>a common intention to do the criminal act done by the
                        actual doer which results in the offence charged</em> (what was termed
                    the “<em>Barendra</em> test” (after <em>Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor</em> AIR 1925 PC 1) in [107]
                    of <em>Daniel Vijay</em>), <em>ie</em>, a common intention to commit <em>murder</em>. This common intention can be contingent or remote (see
                    [159] of <em>Daniel Vijay</em>), can even be predicated
                    upon (or encompass) a common intention to commit robbery (see [104] of <em>Daniel Vijay</em>), and implies a “pre-arranged
                    plan” pursuant to which the criminal act was done (see [108] and [109] of
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     When murder is committed in the course of
                    robbery by two or more persons, a secondary offender is constructively liable
                    for the murder actually committed only if he has the common intention with the
                    actual doer to commit murder (as defined in s 300 of the Penal Code). Such
                    a common intention may, depending on the circumstances, be inferred if the
                    secondary offender is found to have subjective knowledge that “one in his
                    party <em>may likely</em> commit the criminal act (murder)
                    constituting the collateral offence in furtherance of the common intention of
                    carrying out the primary offence (robbery)” (see [89] and [168(f)] of
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em>). This requirement of subjective
                    knowledge derives from [253(d)] of <em>Lee Chez Kee</em>,
                    and was termed the “<em>LCK</em> requirement”
                    in <em>Daniel Vijay</em> (at [42]). Such a common intention
                    may, of course, be also found as a fact from the conduct of the secondary
                    offender on the evidence before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present case, what is clear is that
                    Jabing and Galing had a common intention to rob the two victims. This is not
                    disputed. However, the trial judge found that Galing had an intention in common
                    with Jabing to commit a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on
                    the deceased because he assaulted the deceased with his belt buckle after Jabing
                    had struck the deceased several blows to the head. It was argued by the
                    Prosecution that Galing’s conduct evinced an intention in common with
                    Jabing to kill or to inflict an s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    injury on the deceased in order to rob him. Hence, there was a common intention
                    between them to rob as well as to murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We consider that the evidence does not support
                    the Prosecution’s case on this basis for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     While Galing and Jabing had a common
                        intention to commit robbery at Geylang, there was no evidence of any prior
                        discussions or planning between the two of them as to how the robbery would
                        be carried out, whether any weapons would be used, what force should be used
                        if the victims resisted, <em>etc</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Galing and Jabing were unarmed when they decided to rob the two victims.
                        Jabing’s picking up and using the piece of wood was opportunistic and
                        improvisational and Galing’s use of his belt was equally so (<em>ie</em>, hardly part of a “pre-arranged
                        plan” (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>
                    above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     There was
                        insufficient evidence as to what kind of injury was caused by Galing using
                        his belt buckle and, unless Galing had used it to strike the deceased very
                        hard on the head (and there was no evidence that this had occurred) it could
                        not have been a s 300(<em>c</em>) kind of
                        injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     Although Galing was in a position, and afforded the opportunity, to inflict
                        more severe wounds on the deceased, the fact that he did not do so suggests
                        that his intention all along was to <em>rob</em>, as
                        well as cause hurt while doing so, and not to inflict a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     Galing did not assault the deceased in a manner which
                        would have made it easier for Jabing to cause the s 300(<em>c</em>) injury, <em>eg</em>, by distracting
                        the deceased, or restraining or incapacitating him so that Jabing would have
                        been presented with a more vulnerable victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In our view, a common intention to rob, and if
                    necessary, to inflict a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on two
                    random victims, as here, cannot be made out unless there is evidence of some
                    kind of planning or understanding between Jabing and Galing as to what they
                    would do and how they would do it in order to rob the victims. There is no such
                    evidence before us. The trial judge appeared to have held (see [55] of the GD)
                    that Galing had a common intention with Jabing to inflict a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on the deceased because “Galing had not
                    said in his statements and his evidence that he was surprised when Jabing held
                    the branch in both hands and struck the deceased with it.” This led the
                    Judge to find (at [55] of the GD) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Galing knew that when he and Jabing robbed the deceased, the deceased
                        would be assaulted and serious injuries might be inflicted on him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We do not agree that this inference, even if supportable, is
                    sufficient to satisfy the <em>Barendra</em> test. As this
                    Court has said in <em>Daniel Vijay</em> (at [65]),
                    knowledge is not intention, although it is a basis on which intention could be
                    inferred. All that can be said at the highest is that Galing failed to stop
                    Jabing from hitting the deceased so viciously on the head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Nothing we have said, however, should be taken
                    to mean that Galing’s role in this robbery-murder does not require severe
                    condemnation. Such violent crimes cannot be condoned in any civilised society,
                    and Galing was fortunate that the evidence adduced by the Prosecution was
                    insufficient to support the charge brought against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For these reasons, we agree with the finding
                    of the trial judge that Jabing committed murder, but under s 302 of the
                    Penal Code, and dismiss his appeal. We allow Galing’s appeal but
                    substitute for his conviction of murder a conviction of the offence of robbery
                    with hurt committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 394 read
                    with s 34 of the Penal Code. Galing’s conviction is remitted to the
                    trial judge for sentencing.</p>
