<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present cross-appeals arise from the
                    assistant registrar’s (“the AR”) decision in respect of the
                    first to third defendants’ (“the three defendants”)
                    application in summons no 271 of 2010 for the following orders: first, the
                    order of court dated 13 May 2009 granting the plaintiff
                    (“Global”) leave to effect service out of jurisdiction to India be
                    set aside; secondly, that Global’s service of its amended writ of summons
                    (“the Writ”) on the three defendants be set aside; and thirdly,
                    all proceedings in this suit be stayed on the ground of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The AR dismissed the application to set aside
                    the order of court granting leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction because
                    Global’s claims raised serious issues to be tried, there was no
                    non-disclosure of material facts, and Singapore was the most appropriate forum
                    to hear the dispute. The AR also dismissed the application to set aside the
                    service of the Writ <em>vis-à-vis</em> the first defendant
                    (“ITC”) since the Writ was validly served on ITC in accordance
                    with Indian law. However, the AR held that the Writ was not validly served on
                    the second and third defendants (“Deveshwar” and
                    “Vaidyanath” respectively) and that the Singapore court had no
                    discretion to cure this irregularity. Finally, a temporary stay of proceedings
                    in Singapore was ordered until such time as Global could show evidence that a
                    claim brought by Global on similar facts and grounds in the United States in
                    November 1995 had been withdrawn. ITC was ordered to pay costs to Global, and
                    Global was ordered to pay the costs of Deveshwar and Vaidyanath.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In registrar’s appeal
                    no 466 of 2010, Global appealed against the setting aside of the
                    service on Deveshwar and Vaidyanath. The three defendants’ appeal in
                    registrar’s appeal no 465 of 2010 is against the AR’s
                    refusal to set aside the service on ITC and the order of court dated
                    13 May 2009, and also his refusal to order a stay of proceedings. Both
                    sides also appealed against the consequent costs orders of the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Before me, counsel for the parties rightly
                    focused on the issue of whether Singapore was the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em>. That was an essential criterion for leave to effect
                    service out of jurisdiction, and if decided in the three defendants’
                    favour, would also justify a stay of proceedings. The other issues raised on
                    appeal were not in serious contention, <em>eg</em> whether
                    there was non-disclosure of material facts in Global’s <em>ex parte</em> application for leave. Counsel also addressed the issue
                    of whether the service effected on the three defendants were valid, which is the
                    consequent issue should Singapore be held to be the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 1992, ITC incorporated Global as a
                    commodities trading company in Singapore. ITC was incorporated in India and the
                    sole shareholder of Global.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In November 1996, Global was
                    placed under judicial management.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was put into liquidation on
                    30 November 2007. Deveshwar and Vaidyanath are directors of ITC, and
                    were based in India at the material times. They are also Indian nationals and
                    resident there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In addition to the three defendants in the
                    present appeals, there are twelve other defendants named in the suit. The fourth
                    to thirteenth defendants are implicated either as employees of ITC, or directors
                    or employees of Global at the material time. The fourteenth and fifteenth
                    defendants (“the Chitalias”) are citizens of the United States of
                    America (“USA”); they controlled a group of companies incorporated
                    in the USA and Liechtenstein (“the Chitalia Group”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Chitalia Group was one of Global’s
                    trading partners. In the course of business, Global gave loans or made advances
                    to the Chitalia Group. In the suit, Global alleges that the defendants are
                    liable for its losses which stemmed from two sets of transactions with the
                    Chitalia Group. These will be referred to as “the Trade Advances”
                    and “the Colombo Rice Transactions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In relation to the Trade Advances, Global
                    alleged that ITC, acting through one or several of the second to eleventh
                    defendants, had caused Global to grant several advances totalling US$9.1m to the
                    Chitalia Group with no commercial benefit to Global.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Trade Advances, it is alleged, were made
                    for the benefit of ITC. ITC had sold certain commodities at inflated prices to
                    the Chitalia Group which then on-sold them to other parties at substantially
                    lower prices. By doing so, ITC was able to generate paper profits, whereas the
                    Chitalia Group would book paper losses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Global’s case is that it was
                    instructed to make the Trade Advances in order to put the Chitalia Group in
                    funds for them to make payment to ITC. This was necessary because the Indian
                    foreign exchange regulations required ITC to collect payment for the invoiced
                    sales of commodities from the Chitalia Group within 180 days, and the Chitalia
                    Group lacked the means to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As for the Colombo Rice Transactions, Global
                    alleged that in 1994, ITC directed it to purchase from the Chitalia Group about
                    34,000 metric tons of rice held in Colombo, Sri Lanka. This rice was originally
                    sold by ITC to the Chitalia Group in March 1993.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Global further alleged that it derived
                    no commercial benefit from purchasing this rice, and ITC had agreed to indemnify
                    Global regarding any losses it suffered in relation to this
                        purchase.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    Global claimed it suffered losses of US$9m as a direct consequence of this
                    purchase – from the resale of the rice to third parties and from being
                    unable to trade in other profitable commodities because of having committed its
                    resources to the Colombo Rice Transactions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Global commenced this suit in November 2002
                    through its liquidators. The causes of action pleaded against the three
                    defendants arising from the Trade Advances include tort,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> contract,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> restitution,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> breach of
                    fiduciary duties<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    and breach of statutory duties under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed)
                    (“Companies Act”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Global’s claim arising
                    from the Colombo Rice Transactions is for an indemnity given by ITC for its
                        losses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on service out of jurisdiction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The requirements to be satisfied before the
                    court will grant leave for service out of jurisdiction are well-settled. First,
                    the claim must come within the scope of one or more of the paragraphs of
                    O 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“ROC”). Second, the claim must have a sufficient degree of
                    merit. Third, Singapore must be the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As indicated earlier, there was no serious
                    challenge that the first and second requirements were satisfied. Reading the
                    Writ together with Mr Neo Ban Chuan’s (“Mr Neo”)
                    affidavits filed on behalf of Global as Global’s liquidator, it was clear
                    that there is a good, arguable case that at least rules 1(<em>f</em>)(i), 1(<em>f</em>)(ii), 1(<em>o</em>), 1(<em>q</em>) and 1(<em>s</em>) of O 11 of the ROC have been made out. The
                    defendants’ objections lay mainly in what they claimed was a lack of
                    particulars regarding the offending acts, the link between those acts and the
                    defendants, and the causal link between the acts and Global’s losses.
                    These objections, however, were refuted by the obvious and consistent evidence
                    in the form of various documents provided by Nr Neo which suggested that ITC had
                    instructed Global to make the Trade Advances to the Chitalia Group<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and that ITC would indemnify Global for
                    losses it may sustain in respect of the Colombo Rice Transactions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There was also no non-disclosure of material
                    facts, contrary to what counsel for the three defendants
                    (“Mr Tong”) argued. The material fact concerned was a
                    decision made by Belinda Ang J on 30 January 2009. She had
                    refused to grant leave for service out of jurisdiction on Global’s
                    previous application for such leave because the Writ had lacked sufficient
                    particulars for the court to make out whether there was a good, arguable case.
                    Counsel for Global (“Mr Maniam”) pointed out that Belinda
                    Ang J’s grounds of decision were neither available at the time the
                    fresh application for leave was made nor at the time of the hearing of the
                        <em>ex parte</em> application. In any event, I am
                    satisfied that Mr Neo’s affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> filed on
                    9 April 2009 and the documents it exhibited have since cured the
                    defects highlighted by Belinda Ang J. It is the third requirement which
                    requires greater evaluation, to which I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Singapore is the <em>forum
                    conveniens</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The purpose of the <em>forum
                        conveniens</em> analysis is to identify the most appropriate forum to
                    hear the substantive dispute. “It is not an exercise in comparing the
                    sheer number of connecting factors which point to this or that jurisdiction.
                    What matters is the weight to be given to each connecting factor in the light of
                    all the circumstances of the case”: <em>per</em>
                    Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 3 SLR 1007 at [19]. In that decision, the Court of Appeal stated (at [8]) that the doctrine seeks to identify the
                    most appropriate forum to try the dispute, and it does not matter whether it is
                    most appropriate “by a hair or by a mile”. The main connecting
                    factors to be considered here are the parties’ and witnesses’
                    personal connections, the connections to the relevant events and transactions,
                    and the governing law of the claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The personal connections of the parties are
                    these. While Global is a company incorporated in Singapore and is placed under
                    liquidation in Singapore, ITC is an Indian company and most of the other
                    defendants are Indian nationals and ordinarily resident there. Mr Tong
                    submitted that on the whole, India would be a more convenient forum given that
                    the majority of the key witnesses are located there. I, however, do not think
                    the circumstances of this case point unequivocally towards a most appropriate
                    forum in respect of the parties’ personal connections. The fact that
                    Global is a Singapore company under liquidation, and the liquidator is in
                    Singapore, is also a factor which must be given due weight: see <em>Kaki Bukit Industrial Park Pte Ltd v Ng Man Heng and
                        Others</em> [2004] SGHC 60. Additionally, the Chitalias, who
                    are also key parties in this dispute, are located in the United
                States.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect to the witnesses required at the
                    trial, the availability of non-party witnesses does not appear to be a
                    substantial factor for consideration. Most of the relevant witnesses for the
                    defendants’ case are the defendants themselves, and I have already
                    considered the parties’ personal connections to be an equivocal factor.
                    Mr Tong has argued that non-party witnesses of fact are potentially
                    required to testify for the defence’s case. These witnesses are located in
                    India and cannot be compelled to appear before a Singapore court because the
                    Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters
                    does not apply between Singapore and India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I do not place much weight on this argument
                    simply because the three defendants have not, in their affidavits, materially
                    refuted the tenor of Global’s case which relies mainly on the available
                    documentary evidence. Global’s liquidator, Mr Neo, had produced
                    contemporaneous letters and minutes of meetings that showed that ITC had
                    procured the payment of Global’s monies to the Chitalia group for the
                    purpose of enabling ITC to receive payment on its invoices to avoid contravening
                    the Indian foreign exchange regulations. Global’s pleaded case against the
                    defendants rests on this factual situation, which is eminently supported by
                    those documents. The three defendants have not said that the documents exhibited
                    by Mr Neo actually meant something else, or that they portrayed a different
                    factual situation. Therefore, there is no basis for believing that the documents
                    mean anything other than what they purport to say. In the circumstances, the
                    witness factor (regarding the non-party witnesses) is not as significant as in a
                    case where there are substantial disputes of fact and the availability and
                    credibility of non-party witnesses are crucial to a fair determination of the
                    case. In any event, O 39 r 2 of the ROC will adequately address the
                    defendants’ concerns by providing a means of seeking the Indian
                    courts’ assistance to take the evidence of these Indian witnesses if that
                    is thought to be necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In relation to Global’s primary claim
                    against the three defendants, <em>viz</em> the Trade
                    Advances, the causes of action concerned are in tort (<em>eg</em> procuring the other defendant directors to breach their
                    contractual, fiduciary and statutory duties, conspiracy to unlawfully cause
                    Global to make the Trade Advances, and unlawful interference with Global’s
                    business); for breach of directors’ duties under common law; and statutory
                    claims under ss 157 and 340(1) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Tong submitted that the substance of
                    the torts lay in India. He argued that the three defendants were based in India
                    at the material times and many of Global’s board meetings were convened
                    and held in India. Hence, if there were any acts constituting the alleged torts,
                    they would have taken place in India and governed by Indian law. Mr Maniam
                    argued otherwise. He asserted that Global obtained the funds to make the Trade
                    Advances from Singapore banks; the Trade Advances were made out of Singapore
                    bank accounts; the procuring of breaches by other directors were of legal duties
                    governed by Singapore law; and the torts were committed against a Singapore
                    company. I am persuaded by Mr Tong on this point. There is no evidence that
                    the advances made were derived from Singapore bank accounts. Even if there was,
                    I do not think it is material because the source of the funds cannot be as
                    significant as where the tort was planned and effectively carried out. There is
                    also no evidence that the Trade Advances directly caused any damage to the
                    Singapore bank creditors of Global. Also, Mr Maniam’s argument that
                    the legal duties breached by the other directors were governed by Singapore law
                    is misplaced because the material factor must be where the three
                    defendants’ procurement of these breaches was planned and carried out
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, the other claims regarding the Trade
                    Advances brought by Global are what tip the overall balance in favour of
                    Singapore as the more appropriate forum. Global’s allegations that
                    Deveshwar and Vaidyanath are shadow directors of Global and have breached the
                    fiduciary duties which attach to these posts under the Companies Act require
                    consideration of Singapore law, especially in the light of the difficult
                    definition of a “shadow director” under the Companies Act. In this
                    case, a Singapore court is better placed to determine this issue. Furthermore,
                    Global’s claim for relief under s 340(1) of the Companies Act can
                    only be pursued in Singapore. It is important for insolvent companies undergoing
                    liquidation to be able to prosecute claims of fraudulent trading against former
                    directors of the company as a matter of discouraging abuse of limited liability
                    by irresponsible trading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The claims pertaining to the Colombo Rice
                    Transactions are also better dealt with by a Singapore court. The key wrongful
                    acts which gave rise to these transactions appear to be committed in Singapore.
                    This means that the governing law of the indemnity agreement Global asserts
                    exists is likely to be Singapore law. After considering all the factors, I find
                    that the AR had not exercised his discretion incorrectly, and that Singapore is
                    the <em>forum conveniens</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the service of the Writ on the three defendants was
                regular</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In view of my finding that Singapore is the
                        <em>forum conveniens</em>, it is necessary to address
                    the issue of the validity of service. For service to be properly effected out of
                    jurisdiction, according to O 11 r 4(2) of the ROC, the method of
                    service must comply strictly with the foreign jurisdiction’s rules and
                    laws regarding service. Additionally, O 11 r 3(2) of the ROC states
                    that the court may not make any order or direction which shall authorise or
                    require the doing of anything in which service is effected which is contrary to
                    the law of that country. The issue here is whether the manner in which the Writ
                    was served on the three defendants is in compliance with Indian
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     According to Mr Neo, after the order of
                    court dated 13 May 2009 granting leave to serve the Writ out of
                    jurisdiction was made, Global filed a request for service of the Writ out of
                    Singapore (“Request for Service”) with the Singapore Supreme
                    Court. Global specifically requested the relevant documents (a) to be sent to
                    the Court of Small Causes in Kolkata for service on ITC and that the documents
                    be served on the secretary, or on any director, or other principal officer of
                    ITC or by leaving it at the registered address of ITC; and (b) to be sent to the
                    appropriate Indian Courts and served, as if they were summons issued by such
                    courts, on the second to thirteenth defendants. Thereafter, Global played no
                    role in the service of the Writ and left matters entirely to the Singapore
                    Supreme Court Registry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the relevant Indian
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 26 January 2010, Global was
                    provided with a copy of an endorsement from the process server dated
                    15 December 2009 (“the Endorsement”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> It stated that the Writ had been served on
                    the three defendants. However, Global had not received an official certificate
                    from the Indian government or judicial authorities which, pursuant to O 11
                    r 3(5) of the ROC, would be conclusive evidence of the date of service and
                    that service was in accordance with the law of the country in which service was
                    effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The only available account of how service was
                    in fact effected in India was provided by Mr Bishwa Behari Chatterjee
                    (“Mr Chatterjee”) who is the company secretary of
                        ITC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>According to Mr Chatterjee, on 14 December 2009, a
                    delivery person (“the delivery person”) arrived at the mailing
                    department of ITC’s office and wanted to leave behind several sets of
                    binders. The delivery person was directed to ITC’s corporate secretarial
                    department. There, he informed the staff that the binders were from the High
                    Court of Calcutta, and that he wished to leave behind five sets of binders meant
                    for ITC, Deveshwar, Vaidyanath, and the fifth and tenth defendants. A sixth
                    binder was to be acknowledged and returned on behalf of the said
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     When asked to identify himself, the delivery
                    person stated he was from the City Civil Court, Calcutta. The delivery person,
                    however, refused to provide any credentials. ITC’s corporate secretarial
                    staff took delivery of three sets of the binders (for the three defendants) and
                    acknowledged the sixth binder. Each set of the binders contained (a) the Request
                    for Service (filed on 13 August 2009); (b) the Writ (re-dated
                    20 January 2003); (c) <em>ex parte</em> orders of
                    the Singapore High Court extending the validity of the Writ, the last being an
                    order dated 13 October 2008; and (d) the order of court dated
                    13 May 2009 granting leave to serve the writ out of
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Both Global and the defendants had adduced
                    expert evidence by way of affidavit on the validity, under Indian law, of the
                    service described above. The defendants’ experts are Mr Marezban
                    Padam Bharucha (“Mr Bharucha”) and Mr Prafullachandra
                    Natwarlal Bhagwati (“Mr Bhagwati”). They opined that the
                    service carried out on 14 December 2009 was invalid on four grounds.
                    First, there was no proof that the documents were delivered through the judicial
                    authorities of India. Secondly, the Writ was invalid as it had expired. Thirdly,
                    service was not effected through the Court of Small Causes in Kolkata which they
                    opined was the requirement under Indian law. Lastly, as against ITC, the Writ
                    was not served on its secretary, director, or principal officer; and as against
                    Deveshwar and Vaidyanath, the Writ was not served on them personally.
                    Global’s expert on Indian law is Mr Manish Mohan
                    (“Mr Mohan”), and he disagreed with the three
                    defendants’ experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With respect to the first ground,
                    Mr Bharucha noted that the delivery person did not provide his credentials
                    and, therefore, there was no proof that the documents were delivered through the
                    judicial authorities of India.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>
                    But Mr Bharucha did not consider all the material evidence in forming that
                    opinion. There was no analysis of the significance of the endorsement received
                    by Global on 26 January 2010. The endorsement must be treated as
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents were
                    delivered through the judicial authorities of India since Global had sent the
                    Request for Service to the Indian judicial authorities through the proper
                    Singapore channels. In the absence of rebuttal evidence, I find that the
                    documents were delivered through the rightful Indian authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the second ground,
                        Mr Bharucha<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> and Mr Bhagwati<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> were of the common opinion that on the face of
                    the Writ, it had “become stale and was, as such invalid”.
                    Therefore, it could not have been validly served. It is undisputed that on the
                    face of the Writ, it was only valid until 7 November 2009 while
                    service was effected on 14 December 2009. But it is also undisputed
                    that the Writ’s validity had actually been extended by a further order
                    (dated 26 October 2009) from the Singapore High Court to
                    8 November 2010, and that indorsement of the extension of the validity
                    of the Writ had been dispensed with.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I prefer the opinion of Global’s expert,
                    Mr Mohan. The validity of the Writ must be a matter of Singapore
                        law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> It cannot be reasonably contemplated that
                    an Indian lawyer would advise his client who receives a writ which originated
                    from a foreign jurisdiction to ignore it on the basis that it appears to be
                    stale. As a matter of commonsense, any extension of validity cannot be reflected
                    on a writ once it leaves its originating jurisdiction, and it is common
                    knowledge that serving a writ out of jurisdiction may be a very lengthy process
                    during which the writ may have to be renewed. It also bears noting that once a
                    plaintiff serves a writ out of jurisdiction, there is nothing much he can do to
                    expedite the process. It is unfair to permit conditions which are beyond the
                    control of a plaintiff to frustrate an otherwise legitimate attempt of service,
                        <em>eg</em> the unpredictable period of time before a
                    writ is served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On the issue of which Indian court must the
                    service be effected through, the parties’ experts agreed that the Indian
                    Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908)(2004 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Code”) was applicable, but differed on which are the applicable
                    provisions. The Code comprises sections, followed by orders, and each order
                    consists of various rules. The Code’s orders are ancillary to the
                        sections.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The defendants’ argument that the
                    service must be through the Court of Small Causes in Kolkata is founded upon
                    O 5 r 22 of the Code which states that: “Where a summons issued
                    by <em>any Court</em> established <em>beyond
                        the limits of the towns of Calcutta</em>, Madras [and Bombay] is to be
                    served within any such limits, it shall be sent to the Court of Small Causes
                    within whose jurisdiction it is to be served” [emphasis
                        added].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>However, Mr Mohan opined that O 5 r 22 does not
                    apply here despite its mandatory language simply because the term “any
                    court” must mean an Indian court and not a foreign court. I find in
                    favour of his opinion because there is indeed a separate provision in the Code
                    which deals with the treatment of foreign summonses. This is found in s 29
                    of the Code which deals with service of summonses and other processes of foreign
                    courts. These provisions would apply to summonses issued by Singapore courts by
                    virtue of Government of India Gazette notification dated
                        29 May 1956.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> It is agreed by the parties’
                    experts that s 29 of the Code applied in this case. Section 29(c) of
                    the Code states: “Summonses and other processes issued by any other Civil
                    or Revenue Court <em>outside India</em> to which the
                    Central Government has, by notification in the Official Gazette, declared the
                    provisions of this section to apply, may be sent to the Courts in the
                    territories to which this Code extends, and served <em>as if they
                        were summonses issued by such Courts</em>” [emphasis added].
                    Thus once the Writ is sent from the Singapore governmental or judicial
                    authorities to their Indian counterparts in an Indian court in Calcutta, insofar
                    as service under Indian law is concerned, the Writ would be deemed as a writ
                    issued by that Calcutta court which received it. There is no evidence from the
                    defendants’ experts that a writ or summons issued by any court in Calcutta
                    must be served by a process server from the Court of Small Causes in order to be
                    valid. Hence, I find that the Writ was served by the correct Indian
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendants’ last objection is that
                    the Writ was served on parties who were not entitled to receive service on their
                    behalf. A distinction must be drawn between ITC which is a corporate entity, and
                    Deveshwar and Vaidyanath who are natural persons. With respect to ITC, it is
                    agreed that this depends on whether it was served in accordance with O 29
                    r 2 of the Code. Order 29 r 2 of the Code consists of two limbs.
                    It states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to any statutory provision regulating service of
                        process, where the suit is against a corporation, the summons may be served
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) on the secretary, or on any director, or other principal officer
                            of the corporation, or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) by leaving it or sending it by post addressed to the corporation
                            at the registered office, or if there is no registered office then at
                            the place where the corporation carries on business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Both Mr Bhagwati and Mr Bharucha
                    cited the Supreme Court of India case <em>Shalimar Rope Works Ltd
                        v Abdul Hussain H M Hasan Bhai Rassiwala and ors</em> [1980]
                    3 SCR 1028 (“<em>Shalimar Rope
                        Works</em>”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> which had construed O 29 r 2 of
                    the Code. They were of the opinion that, applying <em>Shalimar
                        Rope Works</em>, the delivery person had not effected valid service
                    because he should have first attempted to serve the Writ on the
                    “Secretary or any Director or other Principal Officer” before he
                    can leave the Writ at ITC’s registered office. In <em>Shalimar Rope Works</em>, the respondent served the summons on a
                    “mere Office Assistant in the Sales Department of the [appellant]
                    company”. The office assistant was not a company secretary, director or
                    principal officer of the appellant authorised to receive summons in the suit. He
                    also did not bring the fact of the receipt of summons by him to the knowledge of
                    any responsible officer of the appellant. As a result, judgment in default was
                    obtained by the respondent and the appellant only knew of the proceedings when
                    the respondent sought to enforce its judgment. The lower court, however, held
                    that since the office assistant was an employee of the appellant found in its
                    registered office, the summons was deemed to have been duly served within the
                    meaning of the first part of limb (b) of O 29 r 2 of the Code
                        (<em>ie</em> leaving it at the corporation’s
                    registered office). The Supreme Court of India thought that this analysis was
                    wrong. It held that the first part of limb (b) (“leaving” the
                    summons at the registered office) must be read in the light of O 5
                    r 17 of the Code which applies to service of summons on natural persons.
                    Order 5 r 17 N4-N6 of the Code states that the serving officer must
                    first use all “due and reasonable diligence” to find the defendant
                    or agent empowered to accept service before he can affix a copy of the summons
                    on a conspicuous part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides or
                    carries on business or personally works for gain. Hence, to maintain consistency
                    across the Code’s provisions, the Supreme Court of India held (at 1032C-D)
                    that “if the serving peon or bailiff is not able to serve the summons on
                    the Secretary or any Director or any other Principal Officer of the Corporation
                    because either he refuses to sign the summons or is not to be found by the
                    serving person even after due diligence <em>then</em> he
                    can leave the summons at the registered office of the company and make a report
                    to that effect” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The concern of the Supreme Court of India was
                    clear; that is, if the first part of limb (b) was interpreted literally,
                    summonses might in many cases not be fairly brought to the attention of
                    defendant companies. This concern was evident from its statement (at 1032B-C),
                    “leaving the summons at the registered office of the corporation if it is
                    literally interpreted to say that the summons can be <em>left
                        anywhere uncared for</em> in the registered office of the company,
                    then it will lead to anomalous and absurd results” [emphasis added].
                    Mr Mohan opined that <em>Shalimar Rope Works</em> must
                    be understood in this context and that it can be distinguished from the facts of
                    the present case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span><sup></sup> The issue is essentially about ensuring that a defendant
                    corporation is sufficiently and fairly notified of proceedings against it. In
                    the present case, Global has adequately addressed this concern. The delivery
                    person in the present case had done more than what transpired in <em>Shalimar Rope Works</em>. Although the delivery person
                    initially turned up wrongly at ITC’s mailing department, he was directed
                    to and showed up at the corporate secretarial department. He informed the staff
                    there that the documents were for the various defendants. As a result, ITC was
                    apprised at the outset of the relevant proceedings against it. I accept
                    Mr Mohan’s opinion that this amounted to good service on a corporate
                    defendant under Indian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     With respect to Deveshwar and Vaidyanath, it
                    is not disputed that under Indian law, a defendant who is a natural person must
                    be served either personally or by an agent properly empowered to accept service
                    on behalf of such defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>Given these premises, Global must show that ITC was in fact an
                    agent for Deveshwar and Vaidyanath which was authorised to receive service on
                    their behalf. ITC denied this is the case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>and Global had produced no evidence to prove the contrary. Thus
                    the service on Deveshwar and Vaidyanath was irregular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the court has the power to cure the irregularities in
                service</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The AR thought that the irregularity of
                    service on Deveshwar and Vaidyanath could not be cured because any discretion to
                    cure the irregularity lies with the Indian authorities. By precluding these
                    breaches in service from the scope of O 2 r 1 of the ROC, the service
                    on Deveshwar and Vaidyanath is effectively treated as a nullity, and not a mere
                    irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The AR’s view is supported by the High
                    Court decision of <em>Ong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Chow Y L
                        Carl</em> [1987] SLR(R) 281 (“<em>Ong
                        &amp; Co</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff obtained leave to
                    issue a writ against the defendant and to serve notice of the writ on him at an
                    address in Malaysia. The notice of the writ was served on the defendant
                    personally by a process server employed by a Malaysian firm of solicitors. It
                    was held that, because that mode of service was not an authorised method of
                    service under the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (“the 1970
                    Rules”), the purported service was a nullity and not an irregularity
                    which could be cured under O 2 r 2 of the 1970 Rules. The High Court
                    emphasised that, following <em>Afro Continental Nigeria Ltd v
                        Meridian Shipping Co SA (The Vrontados)</em> [1982]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 241 (at 245), the service of a writ was an
                    exercise of judicial power. This judicial power cannot be extended or exercised
                    extra-territorially except with consent of the foreign state. Therefore, even
                    though the defendant in that case had actually been served and already entered
                    an appearance, and had not suffered any prejudice, the service was characterised
                    as a “nullity”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     However, the currency of this view has
                    diminished over time. It would appear that <em>Ong &amp;
                        Co</em> is no longer authoritative on this point and not all errors
                    arising in the process of service out of jurisdiction would render the purported
                    service a nullity. Rather they would constitute a mere irregularity and the
                    Singapore courts do have jurisdiction to cure such irregularities under O 2
                    r 1(2) of the ROC. The reasons are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     First, a similar situation in <em>Leal v Dunlop Bio-Processes International Ltd</em> [1984]
                    1 WLR 874 (“<em>Leal</em>”) was not
                    construed as a nullity, but an “irregularity”, albeit one which,
                    in the circumstances of that case, was too serious to be cured. In that case,
                    the plaintiff had issued and served a writ out of the jurisdiction without
                    obtaining the leave of the court. The defendant applied to set aside the service
                    and dismiss the action. By then, the limitation period had expired and the
                    plaintiff applied for the renewal of the writ and leave to serve it outside the
                    jurisdiction. The English Court of Appeal held that in the circumstances, the
                    writ could not be renewed because of the lack of exceptional circumstances. The
                    purported service also could not be cured under the English Rules of Court
                    O 2 r 1 because it was thought that if the plaintiff could not
                    properly have renewed the writ, it would be improper to make good the irregular
                    service. All three judgments of the court proceeded on the basis that the
                    mistake in service was an irregularity capable of being cured under the English
                    Rules of Court O 2 r 1, but declined to exercise their discretion to
                    cure it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Secondly, Singapore’s O 2
                    r 1(2) of the ROC, which is <em>in pari materia</em>
                    with the English equivalent, states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to paragraph (3), the Court may, on the ground that there has been
                        such a failure as is mentioned in paragraph (1), and on such terms as to
                        costs or otherwise as it thinks just, set aside either wholly or in part the
                        proceedings in which the failure occurred, <em>any
                            step</em> taken in those proceedings or any document, judgment or
                        order therein or exercise its powers under these Rules to allow such
                        amendments (if any) to be made and to make such order (if any) dealing with
                        the proceedings generally as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The House of Lords has interpreted the term “any step”
                    to include service of proceedings out of the jurisdiction: see <em>Phillips and another v Symes and others (No 3)</em> [2008]
                    1 WLR 180 (“<em>Phillips</em>”) at
                        [31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Thirdly, the strict view that service out of
                    jurisdiction is an encroachment of another nation’s sovereignty has been
                    departed from in Singapore. In <em>Fortune Hong Kong Trading Ltd
                        v Cosco Feoso (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 962,
                    the Court of Appeal opined (at [30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our writ in the present form is no longer structured in the form of a
                        command to the defendant … In its present form, the writ is more of a
                            <em>notification</em> to the defendant that an
                        action has been commenced against him in the court in Singapore than a
                            <em>command</em> to him issued by the court.
                        … In its present form, the writ has lost its meaning of a judicial
                            <em>order</em>, and it can hardly be contended that
                        the service of our writ abroad would interfere with or encroach upon the
                        sovereignty of the country in which the writ is served. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although that case was about an attempt at service out of jurisdiction
                    from England in Singapore, the above observation was one of general principle.
                    Developing the thesis of that general observation, the question whether the
                    attempt to serve the writ was or was not effective under O 11 of the ROC is
                    a question purely of domestic law, and not foreign law. The approach of
                    characterising this issue as purely a question of domestic law has also been
                    adopted by the English courts: see <em>Golden Ocean Assurance Ltd
                        and World Mariner Shipping S A v Christopher Julian Martin and others
                        (“The Goldean Mariner”)</em> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 215 and <em>Phillips</em> (both cases discussed
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the court should cure the irregularities in service</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Professor Jeffery Pinsler SC wrote in
                    Singapore Court Practice 2009 (LexisNexis, 2009) (at para 2/1/2) that where a
                    procedural rule is framed in a manner which requires strict compliance, an
                    application for the validation of a breach is very much less likely to succeed.
                    The rules governing service out of jurisdiction have often been construed as
                    mandatory in the context of the court’s assertion of extra-territorial
                    jurisdiction, <em>eg</em> in <em>Leal</em> , Slade LJ said (at 885), “most cases breaches of
                    the requirements of … Ord. 11, r. 1, … are not in my opinion
                    likely to be breaches which can be lightly disregarded.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the validation of a breach must still
                    depend on all the circumstances of the case. It is not impossible to persuade
                    the court to cure irregularities in an attempted service out of jurisdiction in
                    deserving cases. There are at least two English cases in which the plaintiffs
                    have succeeded. <em>The Goldean Mariner</em> was one of
                    them, in which there were, <em>inter alia</em>, two
                    categories of defendants where there were procedural irregularities in the
                    service upon them. The first category received wrongly addressed writs which
                    were meant for other defendants in the suit. But each writ was impeccable in
                    form, content and in every other respect. The second category of defendants was
                    only served with a form of acknowledgement of service. No writ was in fact
                    served on them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The English Court of Appeal unanimously
                    thought that the error affecting the first category was a mere irregularity and
                    cured it (with Lloyd LJ dissenting on whether to cure it). The majority judges
                    exercised their discretion that way since the defendants were all parties to the
                    relevant contract which was the subject-matter of the suit, they all knew of the
                    particulars of the incident founding the cause of action, and all of them got a
                    copy of the writ. None of them were unaware of the proceedings. In short, they
                    were not misled and did not suffer any prejudice. They also distinguished
                        <em>Leal</em> on two grounds. First, the case before
                    them concerned an irregularity which was not as grave. Second, they construed
                        <em>Leal</em> as one which did involve prejudice to the
                    defendant because the writ had expired and renewal was conditioned on
                    “exceptional circumstances” which did not exist. Furthermore, to
                    regularise the earlier service out of jurisdiction before the expiry of the writ
                    would have deprived the defendant in <em>Leal</em> of a
                    substantive defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The majority in <em>The Goldean
                        Mariner</em> also thought that the error affecting the second category
                    of defendants was an irregularity and went on to exercise their discretion to
                    cure it. But only one of them provided reasons for doing so. McCowan LJ’s
                    analysis focused heavily on the fact that the defendants who received the form
                    of acknowledgement of service reacted no differently from the defendants who
                    received the wrongly addressed writs. There was never any doubt in the minds of
                    those defendants regarding the proceedings that were initiated against them, and
                    therefore they suffered no prejudice. This was sufficient to constitute
                    “special circumstances”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     
          <em>The Goldean
                        Mariner</em> was recently followed by the House of Lords in <em>Phillips</em>. The issue before the House of Lords was
                    whether, in the light of Swiss proceedings initiated by the defendants, the
                    English court must now decline jurisdiction over similar English proceedings and
                    impose a stay. That depended on which court was first seised of proceedings
                    under the Lugano Convention. That in turn depended on whether the defective
                    service out of jurisdiction (due to incomplete documentation) by the plaintiffs
                    in Switzerland was valid. The House of Lords agreed that for the purposes of
                    both English law and the Lugano Convention, effective service of the proceedings
                    out of the jurisdiction may have been made on the defendants without any need
                    for retrospective validation by way of dispensation of service under
                    r 6.9(1) of the English Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”).
                    Instead, Lord Brown thought (at [31])
                    that it was “at least arguable” that the court could instead
                    remedy the irregularity under r 3.10(b) of the CPR which is <em>in pari materia</em> with our O 2 r 1(2) of the
                    ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Lord Brown also held that what took place in
                        <em>The Goldean Mariner</em> and in the case before
                    them raised essentially the same question, <em>viz</em>
                    whether the attempt to serve the writ was effective. It was not about
                    retrospective validation and, therefore, “[t]he question is purely one
                    for [English] domestic law” to answer (at [33]). Lord Brown went on to analyse the situation on the
                    assumption that it was necessary to invoke r 6.9 of the CPR to dispense
                    with service of the claim form before the service in fact effected can be
                    declared valid. His Lordship conceded that the invocation of r 6.9 of the
                    CPR might in one sense be regarded as “retrospective validation”
                    of ineffective service. Given that the “effect would then be to alter the
                    jurisdictional precedence under an international Convention” (at
                        [35]), Lord Brown thought (at
                        [37]) that “the power is one
                    to be exercised sparingly and only in the most exceptional
                    circumstances”. Therefore, it was clear to his Lordship that the
                    court’s discretion under r 6.9 of the CPR should be exercised, but
                    with greater circumspection than under r 3.10(b) of the CPR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Notwithstanding this high threshold, His
                    Lordship thought that the case was deserving of cure because of its
                    “exceptional” circumstances. The relevant factors were (a) the
                    defendants suffered no prejudice by the failure to serve the original claim form
                    but sought to exploit it; (b) the essential faults were those of the Swiss
                    authorities and not the plaintiffs; and (c) to deny the service effectiveness
                    would lead to part of the claims being forsaken because in that event, neither
                    the English nor the Swiss courts would have jurisdiction over the entire
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     These two English cases illustrate that
                    amongst the various factors that are relevant in considering whether or not to
                    cure the irregularity in an attempt at service out of jurisdiction, the fact of
                    whether the defendant was apprised of the proceedings is highly significant. If
                    the defendant was in fact apprised of and took steps to contest the proceedings,
                    he would have suffered no prejudice. Another factor which was considered is
                    whether the plaintiff had properly done all that he could to effect service, as
                    was the situation in <em>Phillips</em> where it was the
                    Swiss authorities who had failed. Both factors exist in favour of Global in the
                    present case, especially since it had even received a copy of an endorsement
                    from the process server indicating that the Writ had been served on the three
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Even assuming that both factors are not
                    determinative, the call on the exercise of the court’s discretion is
                    compelling here. Global and the defendants have been involved in this suit for
                    almost a decade. Yet substantive proceedings have not gotten off the ground
                    because of myriad procedural obstacles. It can be said that in the light of the
                    several assiduous attempts at service and the defendants’ knowledge of
                    such attempts and of the proceedings, the procedural defects are illusory. To
                    fail to cure the irregularities in the present case would cause undue prejudice
                    to Global by denying its right to a hearing. I will therefore exercise my
                    discretion and cure the irregularities in service on Deveshwar and Vaidyanath.
                    Accordingly, Global’s appeal in Registrar’s Appeal No 466 of
                    2010 is allowed, and the three defendants’ appeal in Registrar’s
                    Appeal No 465 of 2010 is dismissed. As the outcome requires the exercise of
                    the court’s discretion to cure irregularities of service on two of the
                    defendants, I will hear counsel on the question of costs.</p>
