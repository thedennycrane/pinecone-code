<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The accused faced two capital charges under section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs

Act for importing 3,285.8g of cannabis and 1,452.8g of cannabis mixture into Singapore on 21 April

2000 at the Woodlands Checkpoint in motor car EW 9938 E.</p>
<p align="justify">2. At the outset of the case, defence counsel Mr Ahmad Nizam indicated that the

accused had instructed him that he would not contest the charges. When the charges were read and

explained to him, the accused pleaded guilty to both charges. He was given the opportunity to

reconsider his position at the close of the prosecution case, but he maintained his plea.</p>
<p align="justify">3. In view of the severity of the charges, the prosecution was directed to prove

its case in the usual way. Defence counsel was allowed to cross-examine the witnesses called and did

question some of them.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The evidence on the arrest of the accused and the recovery of the drugs was

not disputed. At about 3.20 am on 21 April 2000, the accused and his wife Rabiah binte Ramat arrived

at the Woodlands Checkpoint in his car EW 9939 E from Johor Bahru. They were stopped for a random

check by Customs Officer Khaleelur Rahman. A plastic bag was found in the boot of the car. It

contained vegetable, fruits and food items and a slab of substance wrapped in aluminium foil and

plastic. When Customs Officer Khaleelur Rahman questioned the accused about the packet, he admitted

it was "ganja", and that there were another four slabs in the spare tyre compartment. Four

slabs of the same matter were hidden in the spare tyre compartment when the car was searched.</p>
<p align="justify">5. All five slabs were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis

and were found to contain cannabis and cannabis mixture referred to in the charges.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Subsequent to his arrest, the accused made a cautioned statement and three

investigation statements, all of which were admitted in evidence without objection. In these

statements the accused admitted that he had agreed with a person known to him as "Jo" to

bring the five slabs of "ganja" to Singapore for a payment of $300 a slab. Pursuant to the

agreement "Jo" handed to him the five slabs in Tampoi, Johor, and he kept them in the boot

and the spare tyre compartment of his car. The arrangement was that someone will telephone him to

collect the drugs after they were brought into Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The accused revealed in the statements that he had done that because he was in

need of money. He was not working, and used to earn RM400-500 a month from a prawn farm in Negri

Sembilan of which he was a part owner. Heavy rains last year damaged the dam which supplied water to

the pond. The prawns died and the farm suffered losses. To compound his problems, his wife was ill

for eight months preceding the incident and her medical expenses were about $300-400 a month.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The prosecution submitted that on the basis of the undisputed facts and the

decisions in <i>Ko Mun Cheung &amp; Anor v PP</i> <nobr>[1992] 2 SLR 87</nobr> and <i>Ng Kwok Chun &amp; Anor v

PP</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 55</nobr> that "import" in s 7 bears the same meaning it does in s 2 of the

Interpretation Act, which is to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air, the

two offences of importing cannabis and cannabis mixture were established.</p>
<p align="justify">9. In the circumstances, I found the accused guilty on the charges he faced and

imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.</p>
