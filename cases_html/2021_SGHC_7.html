</div> I did not believe Peloso’s explanation. No evidence was adduced of the solicitor’s alleged errors. Instead, Peloso’s explanation was inconsistent with his second affidavit filed in OS 1060 on 29 August 2019 (“Peloso’s 2nd Affidavit in OS 1060”). In that affidavit, Peloso attempted to explain why he had stated (in Peloso’s 1st Affidavit in OS 1060) that the <span class="font-italic">April 2018 Withdrawal </span>was wrong.

</div> Peloso did not mention any calculation or other errors by his solicitor; he also did not correct his statement (in Peloso’s 1st Affidavit in OS 1060) that the September 2018 Withdrawal was wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Further, in Peloso’s 2nd Affidavit in OS 1060, he claimed that in Peloso’s 1st Affidavit in OS 1060, he had “assumed that [the April 2018 Withdrawal] was not permitted” and that having “since had the opportunity to review [his] records thoroughly, [he] realised that [his] impression was mistaken”. However, Peloso’s mistaken assumption about the April 2018 Withdrawal was immaterial to the matter before me. It was not Peloso’s case that his admission in his 1st Affidavit in OS 1060 (that the September 2018 Withdrawal was wrong) was caused by his mistaken assumption about the April 2018 Withdrawal. In any event, according to Peloso, SEP had almost fully made up the shortfall created by the April 2018 Withdrawal.

</div> Peloso could not have thought that the September 2018 Withdrawal was wrong as a result of any shortfall created by the April 2018 Withdrawal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In my view, Peloso was not a credible witness. I found that the real reason for the September 2018 Withdrawal was as stated in the two affidavits referred to at [16] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Second, I disagreed with Peloso’s assertion that the balance amounts in the DBS Trading Account and SEP’s Operating Account could be counted as part of the Injunction Funds. The amount in the DBS Trading Account as at 26 September 2018 was $728,405.12. DBS retained a margin deposit of $89,247 from this amount, leaving a balance amount of $639,158.12. However, the balance in the DBS Trading Account would be further reduced if DBS required additional margin for either existing or new trades. It might have been different if SEP had withdrawn the balance in the DBS Trading Account and deposited the amount in either the OCBC Account or the DBS Account, but SEP did not do so. As for SEP’s Operating Account, the moneys in this account were meant for SEP’s operational expenses; the expectation must be that these moneys would be so used. I noted that Peloso did not produce statements of SEP’s Operating Account for the months after September 2018, to show what happened to the balance amount in the account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In my view, neither of the balances in the DBS Trading Account or SEP’s Operating Account could be counted as part of the Injunction Funds. The Injunction Order must be complied with both in letter and in spirit (<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement and another v Ho Chin Nguang and others </span>[2010] 4 SLR 801 at [17]). It could not be said that by making the September 2018 Withdrawal and relying instead on the balances in the DBS Trading Account and SEP’s Operating Account, SEP and/or Peloso had complied with the Injunction Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It was also telling that Peloso did not make use of the moneys in the DBS Trading Account and/or SEP’s Operating Account to make the loan to SEEAPL despite his assertion that these moneys were freely available to SEP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I agreed with Peloso that the Injunction Funds did not include the FSC Payment for April 2018 since this amount had been withdrawn before the Injunction Order was granted on 11 May 2018. This meant that the amount of the Injunction Funds was $5,444,444.60

</div> and not $6,533,333.52 (as RCMA claimed). The September 2018 Withdrawal left the OCBC Account with $4,891,635.39. This was clearly short of the amount of $5,444,444.60 that was required for the Injunction Funds. Accordingly, I found that Peloso breached the Injunction Order by causing the September 2018 Withdrawal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The question as to whether the April 2018 Withdrawal breached the February 2018 Order did not arise because the present contempt proceedings were based only on alleged breaches of the <span class="font-italic">Injunction Order</span>. The April 2018 Withdrawal would not have breached the Injunction Order since, as stated above, the Injunction Funds did not include the FSC Payment for April 2018. In any event, the O 52 Statement did not allege that the April 2018 Withdrawal breached the Injunction Order. The grounds on which committal is sought must be set out in the statement supporting an application for committal: O 52 r 2 of the Rules of Court. The supporting facts for committal must be included in the statement and there should be sufficient particulars in the statement to define the scope of the contempt: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</span> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at para 52/2/2.

It is a fundamental rule of justice that a person called upon to answer a charge must first know the precise case he has to meet and should be accorded ample opportunity to refute the allegations. To this end, the O 52 r 2(2) statement serves a crucial role in enabling the respondent to know the case that has been put forth against him. It also functions as the boundaries of the applicant’s case, such as to prevent the applicant from relying on grounds that have been omitted from the statement. This safeguards the interests of the respondent, whose liberty is at stake. … </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the DBS Transfers breached the Injunction Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 RCMA submitted that SEP was not entitled to make the DBS Transfers because the OCBC Account had been set up to receive the FSC Payments. I disagreed with RCMA. There was nothing in the Injunction Order that required SEP to keep the funds in the OCBC Account or that prohibited SEP from transferring the funds in the OCBC Account to another account; RCMA had not sought any such order. The Injunction Order merely restrained SEP, its directors, officers, employees and/or agents from “in any way disposing, dealing with or diminishing the value of” RCMA’s 70% share of the FSC Payments. In my view, the mere transfer of the funds from the OCBC Account to the DBS Account did not breach the Injunction Order. Indeed, taken to its logical conclusion, RCMA’s submission would have meant that the DBS Transfers would have breached the Injunction Order even if the moneys had remained intact in the DBS Account. This could not be correct. Any moneys in the DBS Account would have remained available to satisfy any judgment that RCMA may have succeeded in obtaining in Suit 191.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As such, I found that the DBS Transfers did not breach the Injunction Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether SEP’s actions/omissions in relation to Kashish breached the Injunction Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As stated at [13(c)] above, RCMA’s third ground in these committal proceedings was that Peloso caused SEP to dispose, deal with and/or diminish the value of its 70% share of the FSC Payments by causing SEP to: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) fail to contest the claim by Kashish;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) fail to inform Kashish and the Court hearing the garnishee application, about the Injunction Order; and/or </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) fail to inform RCMA of Kashish’s application to garnish the Injunction Funds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 RMCA’s case as set out in the O 52 Statement did not allege that the trades between SEP and Kashish were fictitious or that Kashish’s claim was a sham.

</div> Although the legal advice to SEP pointed out some technical defences, ultimately, the position remained that SEP had no defence once Kashish addressed the technicalities. In the circumstances, the decision not to contest Kashish’s claim was a reasonable one. The decision not to contest the garnishee application was also reasonable. After all, Kashish had a valid judgment in its favour. The failure to inform Kashish or the Court in the garnishee proceedings of the Injunction Order was inconsequential, as was the failure to inform RCMA about the garnishee application. The Injunction Order was not material to the garnishee proceedings. The Injunction Order did not give RCMA any proprietary rights over the Injunction Funds. Neither did it give RCMA any priority to the Injunction Funds as against Kashish in the garnishee proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 On the basis that the trades between SEP and Kashish were not fictitious, in my view, none of the above omissions by SEP could be said to have breached the Injunction Order.

</div> Instead, RCMA submitted that its case was based on a conspiracy between SEP/Peloso and Kashish to siphon away the Injunction Funds. RCMA argued that pursuant to this alleged conspiracy:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) SEP entered into fictitious trades with Kashish which created a liability on SEP’s part;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Kashish sued SEP and SEP allowed Kashish to enter judgment by not contesting the claim; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) SEP did not object to Kashish’s application in the garnishee proceedings to attach the Injunction Funds and did not inform RCMA of the garnishee proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I rejected RCMA’s submission. RCMA’s case based on the alleged conspiracy was not one of the grounds in the O 52 Statement.
