case involving cross-appeals by parties against the decision of the High Court Judge (the “Judge”) in Suit No 331 of 2018 (“Suit 331”), in which Haribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“HAP”) sued Aquarius Corporation (“Aquarius”) to recover payment for outstanding invoices, and Aquarius counterclaimed against HAP for breaches of a distributorship agreement (the “2016 DA”). The 2016 DA was entered into between the parties on 23 May 2016 for HAP to supply confectionary products and for Aquarius to distribute the same in South Korea. The cross-appeals pertain <span class="font-italic">only</span> to Aquarius’ counterclaim and not HAP’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 With regard to Aquarius’ counterclaim, the Judge found that HAP was obliged by cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA to deliver seven orders placed by Aquarius between July and December 2016 (the “Orders”) and none of the defences HAP raised applied. In failing to deliver the Orders, HAP’s breach of cl 9.3 was actionable. The Judge allowed Aquarius’ counterclaim in part, finding that HAP was liable to Aquarius for lost profits suffered by the latter until 30 April 2017, but not for Aquarius’ lost profits after 30 April 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Civil Appeal No 1 of 2022 (“CA 1”) is Aquarius’ appeal against the Judge’s decision that it is not entitled to claim for lost profits after 30 April 2017. Civil Appeal No 2 of 2022 (“CA 2”) is HAP’s appeal against the Judge’s decision that it is liable to Aquarius for lost profits until 30 April 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having considered the respective cases on appeal and having heard counsel, we are of the view that CA 1 should be dismissed. The Judge’s findings that are being appealed against cannot be said to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. As for CA 2, however, we allow HAP’s appeal as, with respect, the Judge erred in finding that Aquarius had proved the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of its alleged lost profits until 30 April 2017. In particular, the Judge failed to consider HAP’s valid objection that Aquarius’ computations of its alleged lost profits have not been established by admissible evidence and Aquarius had therefore failed to prove the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of its alleged lost profits until 30 April 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 HAP is a company incorporated in Singapore.

HAP is responsible for the sale and distribution of the Haribo Group’s products in the Southeast, West and East Asian markets. Nikolay Karpuzov (“Mr Karpuzov”) is a director of HAP and gave evidence on its behalf. On the other hand, Aquarius is a company incorporated in South Korea. It is in the business of distributing food and beverage products in South Korea.

</div> is governed by German law and lies at the heart of the present dispute. In the course of the 2016 DA, at least two issues arose as between the parties. Sometime in August 2016, Aquarius claims to have discovered that HAP’s associate in the Haribo Group, Haribo GmbH &amp; Co KG (“Haribo GmbH”), had been positively supporting and supplying parallel importers from as early as 2012 (the “Parallel Imports Issue”). Shortly after and in response to Aquarius’ requests for assistance for, <span class="font-italic">amongst others</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Parallel Imports Issue, Aquarius claims that HAP deliberately halted product deliveries and cancelled production of goods Aquarius had ordered (the “Product Delivery Issue”). This resulted in the Orders being entirely unfulfilled or, if they were partially fulfilled, delayed (the “Undelivered Portions”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7  HAP took the first step to bring their contractual relationship to an end by invoking cl 7.2 of the 2016 DA which states that parties may terminate the contract “with six (6) months’ notice to the end of a calendar month”. HAP gave notice under cl 7.2 (“HAP’s First Termination Notice”) on 25 October 2016,

On 2 February 2017, HAP, through its lawyers at the time, refuted each of Aquarius’ allegations that HAP had breached the 2016 DA. In light of this response, Aquarius exercised its right under cll 7.3 and 7.5 to terminate the 2016 DA with immediate effect on 3 February 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by issuing its own termination notice (“Aquarius’ Termination Notice”)).

Namely, that a contractual right cannot be exercised in a manner which: (i) is contrary to good morals; (ii) amounts to “unlawful chicanery” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, effected for no reason other than to cause damage to the other party); or (iii) is objectionable according to the standards of good faith and fair dealing. In particular, Aquarius claims that HAP committed contractual breaches of the 2016 DA when it failed <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> to assist it in investigating the Parallel Imports Issue. Further, HAP breached cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA, when it delayed or failed to make product deliveries (see [6] above). In response, HAP denies committing any contractual breaches. Instead, HAP submits that HAP’s First Termination Notice was valid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Flowing from HAP’s purported breaches of its obligations under the 2016 DA, Aquarius claims that it suffered damages (in the form of lost profits). According to Aquarius, had HAP not acted in the way it did, Aquarius would have continued making profits from the distribution of Haribo Group’s products for the remaining period that the 2016 DA could have run (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, until May 2021). In response, HAP disputes every aspect of Aquarius’ counterclaim. In particular, HAP claims that the quantification of Aquarius’ lost profits is based on incorrect assumptions and unsupported by evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On Aquarius’ counterclaim, the Judge found that HAP’s First Termination Notice was legally valid. HAP’s First Termination Notice is <span class="font-italic">not</span> invalidated by the application of any of the three provisions of the BGB (see [7] and [10] above). Aquarius’ claim for lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017 failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13  On HAP’s purported breaches of its obligations under the 2016 DA, the Judge found that HAP was obliged by cl 9.3 to deliver the Orders and none of the defences HAP raised applied (see [2] above). HAP’s breach of cl 9.3 was actionable. The Judge found that Aquarius suffered a loss from HAP’s failure to deliver the Undelivered Portions of the Orders. Had those deliveries been completed in a timely manner, the Judge found that Aquarius would have been able to completely sell the Undelivered Portions of the Orders, and accordingly, ought to be compensated on that basis. The Judge found HAP liable in damages for Aquarius’ lost profits until 30 April 2017 and relied on Ms Teo’s calculations to derive HAP’s liability in damages.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In CA 1, Aquarius avers that HAP’s First Termination Notice should have been ruled invalid as the notice was issued in breach of HAP’s duty of good faith owed to Aquarius under s 242 of the BGB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In CA 2, HAP appeals against the Judge’s finding that it is liable in damages for failing to deliver the Undelivered Portions of the Orders.

</div> The Judge understood Aquarius’ complaint as such and carefully analysed the complaint, ultimately finding that there was no evidence that HAP breached its duty of cooperation under the 2016 DA in respect of the Parallel Imports Issue. We do not see any reason to disturb the Judge’s finding. As the Judge had observed, the existence of a duty of cooperation cannot mean that the obligor must cooperate with all requests, whether grounded or not. This is a finding which accords with logic and common sense. In so far as Aquarius argues otherwise, Aquarius has not shown that the duty to cooperate at law requires HAP to cooperate with <span class="font-italic">all</span> requests of Aquarius regardless of the legitimacy or validity of the requests. Further, we see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that Haribo GmbH’s alleged support of parallel importers was a <span class="font-italic">bare</span> claim insufficient to engage HAP’s duty of cooperation.

</div> is unhelpful in evidencing Haribo GmbH’s alleged support of parallel importers without more. Furthermore, Aquarius’ Cure Notice to HAP did not ask HAP to investigate the support of parallel importers. Given the sparse evidence (if at all) of Haribo GmbH’s alleged support of parallel importers, the Judge’s finding that HAP’s duty of cooperation was <span class="font-italic">not</span> engaged and that HAP did <span class="font-italic">not</span> breach its duty of cooperation is not plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. For the above reasons, Aquarius’ appeal that HAP breached its duty of good faith under s 242 of the BGB when it refused to cooperate with Aquarius and investigate the Parallel Imports Issue fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Moving next to the Product Delivery Issue, although the Judge had found HAP to have been in breach of cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA, the Judge did not accept that HAP’s conduct was contrary to good morals, amounted to unlawful chicanery or objectionable according to the German standards of good faith and fair dealing. Aquarius appeals on the ground that HAP’s failure to deliver arose from improper motives. In particular, Aquarius argues that HAP’s lack of good faith can be seen from how HAP had conveyed the impression to Aquarius in early October 2016 that it was business as usual, when in actual fact, HAP was taking unilateral steps to terminate the business relationship.

</div> We disagree with Aquarius’ submission. We do not think that there is any inconsistency in HAP’s internal and external correspondence or that such inconsistency is sufficiently indicative of HAP’s lack of good faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Looking at HAP’s internal emails in early October 2016, they suggest at best that HAP was still in discussions internally as to whether to terminate the business relationship. For instance, Aquarius takes issue with certain internal emails of 3 October 2016 and 5 October 2016 in which HAP gave instructions internally that production of Aquarius’ orders and shipments to Korea should be stopped. As evident from the wording of the emails, however, these were temporary measures – “I will let you know if and when we can resume the production”

</div> suggest that these emails are equivocal, being in the nature of a review of the parties’ business relationship rather than an intentional and contumelious breach of its delivery obligations under the 2016 DA. We note HAP’s First Termination Notice was communicated to Aquarius on 25 October 2016. Consequently, even if we were to accept that the decision to terminate had been <span class="font-italic">made</span> internally some three weeks earlier in early October 2016, we do not think that much can be made of the fact that the decision to terminate was only <span class="font-italic">communicated</span> to Aquarius on 25 October 2016. In the short intervening period, we do not see it objectionable for HAP to convey the impression that it was business as usual. We also note that HAP’s First Termination Notice envisaged a six months’ notice period (see [7] above). Given that parties still had to work together for some time even after the decision to terminate was communicated to Aquarius, HAP’s external emails to Aquarius in early October 2016 may be viewed as not inconsistent with its decision to terminate the contractual relationship. In the circumstances, we do not think that the Judge’s finding that HAP’s breach of cl 9.3 was <span class="font-italic">not</span> in bad faith should be disturbed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Finally, we note that the Judge had also considered the exchanges between the parties and had expressed the view that the acrimony between the parties can, and in the Judge’s view does, explain why HAP exercised its right to terminate under cl 7.2 shortly thereafter. Having examined those exchanges, we are in agreement with the Judge’s findings. Given the acrimony between the parties, it should have come as no surprise to Mr Hahn when HAP wanted to terminate the business relationship shortly after. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Aquarius, Mr Gregory Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span> (“Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span>”), tried to explain that the language which Mr Hahn used in his emails should be viewed in the context of a long-term partnership and parties being direct with each other. However, Mr Hahn’s language goes far beyond that. Mr Hahn made broad ranging allegations, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the Haribo Group, HAP and/or its representatives had lied, were dishonest and unethical and were motivated by “uncontrolled greed and selfishness”.

</div> To say that Mr Hahn was being direct or  used strong language is a mischaracterisation. Given the acrimony between the parties, it should have come as no surprise to Mr Hahn when HAP wanted to terminate the business relationship shortly after. Rather than an internal plan to exact vengeance, we are in agreement with the Judge that the internal email in which one of the Haribo Group’s representatives described its relationship with Aquarius as having “reached the end of the road” was more an exasperated declaration that the parties could no longer continue working together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In sum, we find that Aquarius has not shown that HAP breached its duty of good faith under s 242 of the BGB. We uphold the Judge’s findings that HAP’s First Termination Notice was legally valid and that Aquarius’ claim for lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017 fails.

</div> states that “[o]ur offers are subject to change until the time that the order is confirmed”, we highlighted to counsel for HAP, Mr Chou Sean Yu (“Mr Chou”), that it is not clear from the wording whether the word “our” refers to HAP or Aquarius. In any event, one possible interpretation is that in so far as appendix 2, condition 2 of the 2016 DA is contrary to cl 6.1 of the 2016 DA in requiring written confirmation of the Orders, cl 6.2 of the 2016 DA states that the provisions of the 2016 DA shall prevail. If written confirmation is not required in the first place, HAP’s appeal on the basis that it did not provide written confirmation of the Orders does not even get off the ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Be that as it may, parties did not canvass this argument. Taking HAP’s case at its highest and even if we were to assume that written confirmation is required, we see no reason to depart from the Judge’s decision that HAP had confirmed the Orders. The Judge found that the Orders can be sub-grouped into those placed in July to October 2016, and those placed in November and December 2016. The former pertained to Orders 6 to 10 while the latter pertained to Orders 11 and 12. For the earlier set of Orders, the Judge found that they were confirmed in writing by way of HAP’s <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices. On appeal, HAP contends that its <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices were <span class="font-italic">not</span> written confirmations, and as such, they do not give rise to a binding contract for HAP to deliver and for Aquarius to make payment. The issue with HAP’s case that its <span class="font-italic">pro</span><span class="font-italic"> forma</span> invoices were <span class="font-italic">not</span> written confirmations is that it is contradicted by contemporaneous email correspondence. As the Judge had noted, in an email from Mr Karpuzov on 23 January 2017,

</div> Mr Karpuzov stated in no uncertain terms that HAP has issued <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices for the first group of orders and that HAP <span class="font-italic">will</span> deliver all the ordered quantities. In cross-examination, Mr Karpuzov himself suggested that the first group of orders were <span class="font-italic">confirmed in writing</span>, by way of the <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices.

In particular, Mr Chou highlighted that in that same email from Mr Karpuzov on 23 January 2017 (see [25] above), Mr Karpuzov stated that the second group of orders were not confirmed. As we had pointed out to Mr Chou, however, this does not bring HAP very far:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 14 December 2016, Aquarius sent an email to HAP to say that it had not received a <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoice in respect of Order 11.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 19 December 2016, HAP asked why Aquarius needed such an invoice since payment terms had changed from advance payment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Aquarius replied on 19 December 2016 to say it wanted the <span class="font-italic">pro</span> <span class="font-italic">forma</span> invoice as a sort of acknowledgement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) HAP then responded on 19 December 2016 to say that as no advance payment was required, it would not be sending such invoices. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) On 20 December 2016, Aquarius replied to say that it would accept HAP’s response as an acknowledgement of Order 11 and that for Order 12, Aquarius would not expect a <span class="font-italic">pro</span> <span class="font-italic">forma</span> invoice as HAP stated that such an invoice was no longer needed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 There was no response by HAP to Aquarius’ email dated 20 December 2016 at that time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 On 5 January 2017, HAP sent an email to Aquarius to say that the 2016 DA was coming to an end by 30 April 2017.

As for Order 12, too much time had passed for HAP to pretend that it was not “well received and acknowledged”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It was not until 23 January 2017 that HAP sent another email on the orders. We have mentioned this email above at [25] and [26].

We agree with the Judge’s interpretation of HAP’s email on 19 December 2016 (at [26(b)] above), namely that it seemed implied that the orders had been confirmed save without <span class="font-italic">pro forma</span> invoices. We add that this interpretation is supported by HAP’s further email on 19 December 2016 (at [26(d)] above) and the surrounding correspondence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In the circumstances, we see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that the second group of orders had been confirmed.

</div> As mentioned earlier (see [2] above), the Orders were placed between July and December 2016. In the cross-examination of HAP’s witness, Mr Karpuzov, he accepted that it was “a rule of thumb” for Aquarius to place its orders four months in advance of the expected delivery.

</div> It appears that HAP’s argument here is based on the second sentence of cl 9.3 which states that “[HAP] shall use reasonable best endeavours to ensure compliance with production lead times to ensure such timely delivery of the Products and shall inform [Aquarius] as soon as possible if such lead times may not be reached”. In so far as HAP’s argument is that the Judge’s finding on HAP’s delivery obligation is inconsistent with this second sentence of cl 9.3, we disagree. While cl 9.3 provides that HAP is to use reasonable best endeavours to comply with production lead times and in the event that such lead times may not be reached, HAP is to inform Aquarius as soon as possible, it does not mean that HAP cannot at the same time be under an obligation to deliver within four months. Indeed, it would appear that there must be such an obligation to deliver within a specified time in the first place, such that HAP is then obliged to use reasonable best endeavours to comply with its obligation to deliver within a specified time. Put another way, the second sentence of cl 9.3 excuses HAP’s non-compliance with its delivery obligations where HAP had used reasonable best endeavours and informed Aquarius as soon as possible once it knew it could not produce the products in time, but it does not preclude an obligation to deliver within four months from arising in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the above reasons, we do not disturb the Judge’s finding that HAP was obliged to deliver within a period of four months to the end of the month from the date on which the orders were placed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defences for its failure to deliver the Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 HAP also appeals against the Judge’s findings with regard to its defences for its failure to deliver the Undelivered Portions of the Orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, HAP argues that the Judge erred in rejecting its argument that Appendix 2, condition 7 of the 2016 DA excludes Aquarius’ claim for lost profits.

We see no reason to disturb the Judge’s findings. The Judge had considered that the plain words of condition 7 clearly excludes “<span class="font-italic">all</span> claims for damages” and this has the effect of depriving Aquarius of recourse for all remedies, not just for lost profits. To the extent that HAP maintains its argument on appeal that condition 7 should not be deemed invalid as it only excludes intangible losses, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a loss of profits, we do not agree.

</div> the Judge had carefully considered this point in two ways. First, the Judge reasoned that this argument is beside the point as HAP cannot, as a matter of law, exclude such liability in any case. Secondly, where a distributor suffers damages, it more likely than not arises from his principal’s inadvertent rather than deliberate conduct. In the circumstances, we affirm the Judge’s finding that excluding HAP’s liability for simple negligence does limit an essential right of Aquarius and accordingly, condition 7 is invalid. It therefore cannot operate as a defence to HAP’s liability to Aquarius for loss of profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, HAP argues that the Judge erred in rejecting its defence that it was under no obligation to fulfil the Orders as Aquarius would not have been able to sell the stock it had ordered before the end of the 2016 DA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 April 2017. We find that the Judge did not so err. The Judge had carefully considered and rejected HAP’s submissions below that, <span class="font-italic">under German law</span>, “where a distribution contract is coming to an end, the principal is ‘at the most’ obliged to deliver products that can be sold until this moment”. HAP argues that it had the legal right to withhold deliveries on the basis that Aquarius <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> had sufficient stock. While HAP reiterates its reliance on a case heard by the <span class="font-italic">Oberlandesgericht</span><span class="font-italic"> Frankfurt am Main </span>(the Court of Appeal of Frankfurt) to establish such a legal right, we are of the view that the Judge had rightly rejected the suggestion of HAP’s German law expert that the Frankfurt Court of Appeal case establishes such a legal right, absent more information on the facts and reasoning in that case.

</div> We are unable to accept HAP’s argument. HAP’s reliance on the text of cl 9.3, and in particular the second sentence of cl 9.3, is misplaced as the sentence plainly relates to timelines, not quantities (see [37] above). In fact, the entire provision of cl 9.3 relates to timelines, not quantities. There is no basis to read in a right to refuse to <span class="font-italic">fulfil</span> orders on the basis that the ordered quantities were “unusually high” compared to previous dealings. Instead, we agree with the Judge that once orders are accepted – and HAP did accept the Orders in this case (see [24]–[33] above) – the parties ought to be bound by their contractual obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In any event, we agree with the Judge that HAP’s defence lacks the necessary factual grounding. HAP has not proved that Aquarius ordered unusually high volumes. While HAP attempts to refer to certain sales reports of Aquarius as being evidence of the unusually high volumes, the Judge had rightly noted that it was not explained how the spreadsheets therein were to be read, whether HAP’s calculations relied on them, and if so, how. As before (see [45] above), HAP’s attempt to shore up the evidential deficiencies in its case, by explaining in its appellant’s case how HAP’s assertions of Aquarius’ usual sales volume (used to compute the percentage increases in Aquarius’ orders) correspond to the underlying figures in Aquarius’ sales reports,

With respect, this is unsatisfactory. Without the source documents and a witness of fact or the maker of the document testifying as to the authenticity and accuracy of the source documents, the summary, which was premised on the source documents, cannot be relied on. Moreover, it does not even appear to be the case that the summary was properly admitted into evidence by a factual witness from Aquarius. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 We would add that this appears to be an issue which pervades the other documents on which Ms Teo relies, as set out in section E of Appendix B to her expert report

</div> – some of these documents also appear to be summaries, and in so far as these documents are the source documents themselves, they do not appear to have been produced by way of either the maker of the document or a witness of fact. Aquarius has two responses to this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, Aquarius argues that this objection on admissibility was taken late in the day and only crystallised in HAP’s closing submissions. We are of the view that this argument cannot get off the ground. Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span> himself acknowledged that he is not submitting that Aquarius was caught by surprise. Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span> also acknowledged that it is open to Aquarius to run the objection and that Aquarius did not at any point forfeit or waive its right to raise the objection on admissibility. It is not clear therefore how this argument by Aquarius affects the issue of admissibility, even if we accept that HAP’s objection on admissibility was taken late in the day. Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span> may well characterise this objection as a tactical one, but as we had pointed out at the oral hearing, the consequences of this objection succeeding is clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In any event, we do not accept that HAP’s objection on admissibility was taken late in the day or that it only crystallised in HAP’s closing submissions. As the AEICs of the parties’ factual witnesses were only filed and exchanged on 22 June 2020, we accept HAP’s argument that it could not have taken the objection any earlier (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, at the time of the filing of HAP’s Lead Counsel Statement) and indeed, it did so just five days later, when it filed the Notice of Objections, including HAP’s Notice of Objections to Ms Teo’s AEIC, on 27 June 2020 (see [9] above). HAP’s objection was clear and unambiguous, namely that “the relevant facts, documents and assumptions relied upon by Ms Jenny Teo for her computations have not been established by admissible evidence”. Once HAP had objected to the contents of Ms Teo’s expert report, the ball was now in Aquarius’ court to meet that objection. As we had pointed out at the oral hearing, there are various ways of meeting HAP’s objection, one of which is for HAP to call a factual witness to testify on the authenticity and accuracy of the source documents supporting Ms Teo’s computations. What Aquarius could not do was to leave the objection standing and <span class="font-italic">not</span> take any step to meet HAP’s objection. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We would add that at the start of the witness conferencing sessions for Mr Nicholson and Ms Teo on 16 July 2020, counsel for HAP <span class="font-italic">reiterated</span> the point in its notice of objections, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that HAP was making the objection that “no primary evidence has been adduced from [Aquarius’] witness to support the numbers that are being put forward”.

</div>
</div>
</div> In so far as Aquarius suggests that HAP should have gone further to register its objection on the second day of the witness conferencing session on 17 July 2020 or cross-examined Ms Teo on the lack of source documents supporting her computations, we are unable to agree. By this time, HAP had already registered its objection on the basis of admissibility on no less than two occasions. As counsel for HAP pointed out and we agree, once HAP had registered those objections, HAP did not have to go further to cross-examine Ms Teo, or for that matter, Mr Hahn and in so doing, risk undermining its own objection on admissibility. It is also no answer for Aquarius to argue that HAP’s own expert witness, Mr Nicholson, had critiqued the analysis of Ms Teo on the basis of certain numbers being put forward and some of the allegedly inadmissible documents. As we had pointed out during the oral hearing, it was prudent of HAP to deal with Aquarius’ case on several levels. This includes challenging Ms Teo’s analysis on the quantum of the lost profits and the assumptions she made in reaching her conclusions, in the event that the court did not accept its challenge on admissibility. Doing so, however, did not constitute a waiver of its challenge on admissibility. We reiterate that it was for Aquarius to meet HAP’s challenge on admissibility. Despite the trial ending some one year later on 15 July 2021, Aquarius did not appear to have taken any step to meet HAP’s challenge on admissibility (see [9] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Secondly, Aquarius relies on the business records exception under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(iv) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Evidence Act”). As a preliminary point, this argument does not bring Aquarius very far. Even if we accept that Aquarius may rely on the business records exception, some of the source documents do not appear to have been produced to the court in the first place (see [51] above). If the evidence is not even before the court, there is no way the court may decide on issues of hearsay, whether the business records exception applies and rule on its admissibility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, the bigger problem Aquarius runs into with its reliance on the business records exception is that Aquarius would need to show that the documents upon which Ms Teo relied to compute Aquarius’ loss of profits were documents “constituting, or forming part of, the records (whether past or present) of [Aquarius’ business] that are recorded, owned or kept by [Aquarius]”. To prove this, Aquarius appears to be relying on the wording of the documents themselves, the description of the documents in D3SLOD and the description of the documents in Appendix B to Ms Teo’s expert report. This is unsatisfactory. As Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>himself acknowledged, he cannot prove that the documents are likely to have been prepared by Aquarius’ employees in the ordinary course of business as Aquarius does <span class="font-italic">not</span> have any employee saying that. For instance, Mr Vijayendran <span class="font-italic">SC</span> acknowledged that there was a <span class="font-italic">gap</span> in the evidence as there was no factual witness stating that some of the spreadsheets relied on by Ms Teo were taken out from the computerised system of Aquarius. As HAP has pointed out, the source documents on which Aquarius relies were not even exhibited or referred to in the AEIC of Aquarius’ only factual witness, Mr Hahn.

It is part of the Haribo Group, a group of companies in the business of manufacturing and selling confectionaries. Aquarius Corporation (“Aquarius”) is a company incorporated in South Korea. It is in the business of distributing food and beverage products in South Korea.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 On 23 May 2016, HAP and Aquarius entered into a distributorship agreement (the “2016 DA”) for HAP to supply confectionary products and for Aquarius to distribute the same in South Korea. In the course of the 2016 DA, several issues arose as between the parties. Amongst others, Aquarius claimed that HAP deliberately halted product deliveries and cancelled production of goods Aquarius had ordered. This resulted in seven orders placed by Aquarius between July and December 2016 (the “Orders”) being entirely unfulfilled or, if they were partially fulfilled, delayed. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 HAP took the first step to bring their contractual relationship to an end by invoking cl 7.2 of the 2016 DA on 25 October 2016, and given the notice period defined, the last day of the contract would have been 30 April 2017. Aquarius disputed the validity of HAP’s termination notice and issued its own termination notice on 3 February 2017.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 For some time thereafter, HAP demanded that Aquarius make payment for outstanding invoices. However, its demand was not met and HAP thus instituted proceedings in the High Court to recover payment for the outstanding invoices. By way of counterclaim, Aquarius claimed that HAP breached cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA, when it delayed or failed to make product deliveries, entitling Aquarius to damages for lost profits. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 On Aquarius’ counterclaim, the Judge found that HAP’s termination notice was legally valid and Aquarius’ claim for lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017 failed. The Judge found that HAP was obliged by cl 9.3 of the 2016 DA to deliver the Orders and none of the defences HAP raised applied. HAP’s breach of cl 9.3 was actionable. The Judge thereby found HAP liable in damages for Aquarius’ lost profits until 30 April 2017. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Civil Appeal No 1 of 2022 (“CA 1”) is Aquarius’ appeal against the Judge’s decision that it is not entitled to claim for lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017. Civil Appeal No 2 of 2022 (“CA 2”) is HAP’s appeal against the Judge’s decision that it is liable to Aquarius for lost profits until 30 April 2017. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision of the Court</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Court upheld the Judge’s findings that HAP’s termination notice was legally valid and that Aquarius’ claim for lost profits <span class="font-italic">after</span> 30 April 2017 failed. The Court dismissed Aquarius’ appeal in CA 1 (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">22]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Moving to CA 2, the Court affirmed the Judge’s decision that a binding contract had arisen, and that HAP was obliged to deliver the Orders (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">33]</span>). The Court saw no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that HAP was obliged to deliver within a period of four months to the end of the month from the date on which the orders were placed (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">36] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">38]</span>). The Court upheld the Judge’s finding that Aquarius had proved the <span class="font-italic">fact</span> of its alleged lost profits (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[4</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 However, the Court found that the Judge erred in failing to address HAP’s point of admissibility. Aquarius had not established the <span class="font-italic">quantum</span> of its alleged lost profits as the primary documents supporting its expert’s calculations were not properly admitted into evidence (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">50]</span>). The documents on which Aquarius’ expert relies appear to be summaries, and in so far as the documents are the source documents themselves, they do not appear to have been produced by way of either the maker of the document or a witness of fact (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>). Once HAP had objected to the contents of the report of Aquarius’ expert on the basis that her computations had not been established by admissible evidence, it was for Aquarius to meet that objection. There were various ways of doing so, one of which was for Aquarius to call a factual witness to testify on the authenticity and accuracy of the source documents supporting its expert’s computations. What Aquarius could not do was to leave the objection standing and not take any step to meet HAP’s objection. Aquarius did not appear to have taken any step to meet HAP’s challenge on admissibility (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[5</span><span class="font-weight-bold">4]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[55]</span>). Further, Aquarius could not establish the business records exception as it did not have any evidence to show that the source documents constituted or formed part of the records of its business (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">57]</span>).

The appeal in CA 2 was therefore allowed and the Judge’s finding that HAP was liable to Aquarius on the counterclaim for the sum of ₩2,311,179,383 (which is approximately €1.7 million) was set aside.
