Around May 2018, MB requested Shaffy to deliver a different item (“the Stuff”) which MB did not specify but Shaffy suspected were drugs as it was always sealed in blue tape. He would collect the Stuff in the vicinity of Jurong Bird Park (“JBP”) and send them to Boon Lay Mall or an address at MacPherson. On the second occasion he delivered the Stuff, he became suspicious and asked MB about its contents and MB informed him that he was transporting pills and said it was nothing serious. MB gave the contact of a Malaysian person, “M2”, to Shaffy and instructed Shaffy to place orders for the Stuff directly with M2. Shaffy would then place orders with M2 on MB’s instructions, and M2 would inform Shaffy when to collect the Stuff.

He then opened the Plastic Bag and discovered two big bundles wrapped in black tape and one small bundle wrapped in blue tape. He felt something was wrong as he had only ordered two bundles of drugs, previously the bundles were wrapped in blue tape, and the blue bundle which he received this time had an unusual texture. Hence, he unwrapped the black tape from one bundle which revealed the contents as in Exhibit A1A2 and the blue tape of the small bundle which revealed the contents as in Exhibit A1A3. He left the remaining bundle (Exhibit A1A1) intact. When he saw the contents of Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 were brown, he suspected they were heroin (or diamorphine). He knew heroin was powdery as he had previously seen white heroin and consumed heroin. He also knew that ecstasy was in the form of pills. As he suspected the drugs to be heroin, he removed a packet from Exhibit A1A3 (which bundle contained a few packets), smelt it, smashed that packet on the outside to make the contents powdery, then took a bit of the powder, placed it on a foil and burnt and smoked it. That was when he was sure it was heroin.

Shaffy wanted to meet MB and “do the exchange” of bundles because Shaffy was supposed to have received two bundles of ecstasy pills but he had received three bundles of heroin. When he placed an order for “2 packets” with M2 on 19 June 2018, he assumed that he had ordered ecstasy pills. His assumption was based on the occasion where MB had told him that he was delivering “pills” (see [20] above) and another occasion where Shaffy had assisted Wak to exchange drugs which Wak had wrongly received when Wak should have then received ecstasy pills.

The Prosecution argued that Shaffy was unable to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. Shaffy admitted that he knew Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 contained heroin and was indifferent to the contents of Exhibit A1A1. The Prosecution also argued that Shaffy had possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. This could be inferred from the large quantity of diamorphine in Shaffy’s possession which was not for his consumption and the drug trafficking paraphernalia (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Kitchen Items) seized from the Unit.

Yogaraj and Fardlie stated that Shaffy stood at the entrance of the kitchen during the search because the kitchen was small and it would have been difficult to conduct the search of it if Shaffy were present inside. I found the CNB officers had no reason to lie. Regardless, whether Shaffy witnessed the search of the kitchen was not material to the integrity of the chain of custody of the Kitchen Items much less the Drugs (which were found in the Car). Shaffy admitted that the Kitchen Items and Exhibit D1 were from the Unit and that the Kitchen Items (save for Exhibits B3 and B3A) belonged to him.

</div> It was not unusual that Au Yong had overlooked the Extra Packet as it was placed inside Exhibit A1A3D which was in turn one of four packets inside Exhibit A1A3, and the Extra Packet might have been difficult to spot just by looking through Exhibit A1A3 (which was not a big packet and which contained smaller packets). Likewise, when Sunny packed the Items into tamper-proof bags, it was unremarkable that he noticed only four packets within Exhibit A1A3 as he did not open it to verify its contents. Hence, I accepted that Sunny had, in the police report lodged on Shaffy’s arrest and exhibits seized, reported Exhibit A1A3 as containing four packets of brown granular substances, and which in any event he had based on a record of the exhibits in the Field Diary.

Similarly, Mr Almenoar had not demonstrated why the Field Diary was material and why the Prosecution’s failure to adduce it called for an explanation. Even though the various CNB officers had prepared their conditioned statements with reference to the Field Diary (which I found to be unobjectionable), the Field Diary would, at best, support the Defence’s claim that the CNB officers who handled Exhibit A1A3 believed that it contained four, rather than five, packets of granular substances. This was, however, not disputed by the CNB officers themselves. As there was also nothing to suggest that the Prosecution withheld evidence to hinder or hamper the Defence, I declined to draw adverse inferences against the Prosecution for its failure to call Haifaa or to adduce the Field Diary in evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Importantly, even if I disregarded the Extra Packet (which was subsequently analysed by the HSA and found to contain not less than 0.03g of diamorphine), the total weight of diamorphine in the other packets of drugs would nevertheless have exceeded the threshold that attracted the death penalty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For completeness, I deal with Shaffy’s contention that he did not witness the opening of the tamper-proof bags in the EMR and that the discovery of the Extra Packet by IO Neo was not brought to his attention.

She then subtracted a figure representing a 15% variation from the measurement of purity of diamorphine ascertained from the corresponding six test samples and multiplied the result by the gross weight of the contents in each of the Seven Packets.

The sampling technique was used because it was not practical to test the entirety of a pulverised drug exhibit as this would require a large amount of solvent. Merula also explained that she used two independent techniques to determine the purity of the six test samples and adopted the lower purity between the techniques. Additionally, the purity of diamorphine for each of the six samples fell within the HSA’s criteria for acceptance. I further accepted that the HSA laboratory is accredited, implements a quality assurance programme which it maintains in order to remain accredited, and that its analysis maintains a 99.9999% degree of confidence. Moreover, as the present case involved a capital charge, Merula was accompanied by a colleague who bore witness to the propriety of her analysis of the Seven Packets.

This was done because the degree of variation for drug quantitation (of more than 20 quantitative methods) ranged from 5% to 12.8%. The HSA therefore set the standard of variation higher at 15% to provide a greater allowance, with the effect that the final net value of the quantity of diamorphine reported is at the minimum level. As Merula stated, if she had not accounted for the 15% variation in calculating the amount of diamorphine present, the amount of diamorphine eventually determined to be contained in the Seven Packets would have been <span class="font-italic">higher</span>.

On this basis, I found that Shaffy knew the Drugs (including Exhibit A1A1) contained diamorphine when he saw the contents of Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 and even when he placed an order for drugs from M2 on 19 June 2018 and collected the Plastic Bag at JBP.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Shaffy’s handling of the Drugs prior to his arrest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Almenoar argued that Shaffy did not know that Exhibits A1A1 and A1A2 contained heroin because he did not open Exhibit A1A1 and he did not consume a sample from Exhibit A1A2.

In relation to this transaction, Shaffy had called Hanafiah on the night of 20 June 2018 to tell Hanafiah that he had the “stuff”, but Hanafiah did not wish to collect it then as it was late. It was not disputed that this intended transaction on 21 June 2018 was the same one that Shaffy testified to (putting aside the type of drugs he claimed he was supposed to deliver to Hanafiah) (see [23] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Mr Almenoar submitted that Hanafiah’s evidence had to be treated with caution as Hanafiah had an incentive to avoid implicating himself in a drug-related transaction.

I found no conceivable reason why Hanafiah would fabricate false testimony against Shaffy given that he would also implicate himself. Pertinently, Shaffy did not dispute that he intended to deliver some of the drugs (but merely the type of drugs) that he had collected at JBP to Hanafiah on 21 June 2018.

</div> It was undisputed that Shaffy had saved Hanafiah’s handphone numbers under the names “Scar” and “Scar2”, and Hanafiah admitted he was known as “Scar”. Pertinently, Shaffy admitted to having delivered drugs to Hanafiah previously, that he was intending to deliver a packet of drugs to Hanafiah on 21 June 2018 and that the phone communications with Hanafiah pertained to that intended drug delivery (see [65]–[66] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Finally, I observed that Hanafiah was a tentative witness in court who, at times, provided seemingly contradictory answers. He attested that he would order drugs from Shaffy when he was unable to obtain drugs from his main supplier, but then claimed to have ordered drugs from MB and that Shaffy would merely deliver them. Nevertheless, I did not find Hanafiah’s testimony in this regard to be inconsistent. He clarified that whilst he had previously ordered drugs from MB (with Shaffy doing the delivery), he had also on two to three occasions ordered drugs from Shaffy directly.

Even if Shaffy claimed not to have a supply of heroin at the material time, Shaffy’s reply to say “have” when Faliq asked if he sold “hot” showed that Shaffy dealt in heroin in that he would be able to obtain it from a third party for Faliq.

</div> Second, he did not inform M2 that he had obtained a wrong delivery of drugs as he had intended to meet MB on 21 June 2018 to do an exchange of the three bundles so that he could deliver the correct drugs to Hanafiah on the same day. Shaffy wanted to talk to MB and not M2 as that was the first occasion he had received drugs that differed from his expectations, and he wanted to inform MB about it as MB was his boss and had direct connections to M2.

Shaffy could also contact M2 directly as can be seen from the WhatsApp chats between them even on the day prior to Shaffy’s arrest.

</div> Second, Shaffy’s explanation that he could not contact M2 until M2 said “all okay” because M2 would turn off his handphone and would not reply even if Shaffy sent him a WhatsApp message, was unbelievable and unsupported by the evidence. On the contrary, the WhatsApp messages showed prior conversations between them on other matters without M2 prompting him with an “all okay” message.

</div> It was thus unclear how Shaffy’s inability to contact M2 because M2 would turn off his handphone transmuted into the Protocol which Shaffy had to “obey”. While Shaffy initially claimed that the Protocol was an unyielding one, he eventually conceded that M2 only informed him to wait for the “all okay” message before contacting M2.

</div> This formed the crux of Shaffy’s defence to the charge and went to the issue of whether Shaffy had possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. However, Shaffy’s claim that he intended to return the Drugs was not supported by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 First, as I earlier found, Shaffy did not inform M2 of the wrong delivery of drugs prior to Shaffy’s arrest. There was also no communication between Shaffy and MB to support that Shaffy intended to meet with and inform MB about the wrong delivery. As I had earlier found, contrary to Shaffy’s claim of the existence of the Protocol and his intention to meet with MB, he stated in the 2nd Statement that he intended to contact M2 after returning the Drugs to JBP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Second, when Shaffy was asked by Dadly during the recording of the 1st Statement what he intended to do with the “stuff”, he replied: “I want to deliver to someone”.  In court, Shaffy agreed that this was what he had said but explained that what he really meant to tell Dadly was that he wanted to deliver the Drugs back to the supplier, which explanation I rejected as an afterthought.

Further, Shaffy told Dr Cheow that he intended to return the drugs to his supplier because it was the wrong type of drugs. I rejected Mr Almenoar’s assertion that Dr Cheow’s Report was inaccurate. I accepted Dr Cheow’s testimony that Shaffy merely informed him that the two bundles he opened contained illicit drugs and did not mention what drugs they were, and that Shaffy also did not tell him that he intended to return the drugs.

He then claimed there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication between him and Dr Cheow, and finally claimed that he could not recall what he had told Dr Cheow.

This must be seen in the light of Shaffy’s admission that he could not recall what exactly he had said to Dr Cheow, contrary to what Mr Almenoar had put to Dr Cheow. Shaffy’s account to Dr Cheow further supported that Shaffy did not intend to return the Drugs but instead intended to deliver them onwards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Fifth, the 21/6/18 Messages showed that Shaffy had arranged to deliver some of the Drugs to Hanafiah on 21 June 2018. At 3.54pm that day, Hanafiah asked whether Shaffy could send the drugs to him, to which Shaffy replied “can” at 4.32pm. When Hanafiah asked what time Shaffy would deliver the drugs, Shaffy replied at 5.00pm to say that it would be at about 7.00pm. Shaffy’s replies were <span class="font-italic">after</span> he had purportedly discovered (at about 4.00am) the Drugs were heroin. Yet, he did not clarify with Hanafiah the type of drugs that Hanafiah had ordered or inform Hanafiah that he had received the wrong drugs which he intended to exchange for the correct ones before delivering them to Hanafiah. Instead, Shaffy arranged to deliver some of the Drugs to Hanafiah.

I thus found Shaffy’s claim that he intended to meet with MB to arrange for the exchange of the Drugs to be a fabrication, to explain why he was traveling in the eastward direction of Singapore (when he was arrested) when he had initially informed Dadly that he wanted to return the Drugs to JBP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 It was also illogical for Shaffy to rely on MB to facilitate the exchange of the Drugs between Shaffy and<span class="font-italic"> M2</span> when MB did not supply the Drugs and Shaffy could contact M2, as evidenced by the M2 Messages and the First and Second Calls made on 21 June 2018. Shaffy himself claimed in the 5th Statement that MB had previously instructed him to contact M2 directly.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the round, I found that Shaffy never intended to return the Drugs as he knew from the onset that he was to collect heroin. There were no messages between Shaffy and MB or M2 regarding any mistake in the Drugs collected or of an intended exchange to be done. On the contrary, Shaffy’s message to Hanafiah, <span class="font-italic">after </span><span class="font-italic">he claimed he discovered the Drugs were the wrong type</span>, showed he intended to deliver some of the Drugs to Hanafiah (see [104] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Shaffy’s account of events showed up his credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Finally, Shaffy’s account of events across the Statements and in court showed him to be a witness of poor credibility. He was unable to maintain a consistent story about what he believed he had ordered from M2 and what he intended to do with the Drugs that he had collected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In the 1st Statement, Shaffy claimed that he ordered ecstasy pills but instead obtained a “powdery substance” and that he intended to deliver the Drugs to someone. In the 2nd Statement, Shaffy maintained that he ordered ecstasy pills. But he then claimed that he assumed the Drugs were heroin as they were brown, he intended to return them to JBP as he had received the wrong parcels, and he would contact M2 after placing the Drugs at JBP.  In the 4th Statement, Shaffy suddenly claimed that he did not know what drugs MB had asked him to order, he realised it was heroin only at the Unit, and the only reason he brought the Drugs with him in the Car on 21 June 2018 was because he did not want his mother to know about them. Subsequently, Shaffy told Dr Cheow that he had brought along the Drugs in the Car intending to deliver them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In court, Shaffy claimed that he assumed he placed an order of ecstasy pills with M2 not only because MB had previously informed Shaffy that the Stuff he delivered for MB were pills, but also because of the Occasion. Shaffy also claimed to have told Danny in a phone call that he wanted to meet MB to arrange for the exchange of the Drugs, which story was never mentioned in the Statements. Shaffy then claimed he did not contact M2 directly about the wrong drugs because it was his first time receiving a bundle that differed from his expectations and MB was his boss and had a direct connection to M2, and because of the Protocol. That he did not intend to contact M2 but MB differed from what he had stated in the 2nd Statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Shaffy’s knowledge of the nature of the Drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Based on the totality of the evidence, I found the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Shaffy knew the Drugs were diamorphine. Alternatively, and for the same reasons, I found that Shaffy had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. In short, Shaffy knew the Drugs were diamorphine by the time he placed them in the Car on 21 June 2018. He also did not claim to have believed Exhibits A1A1, A1A2 and A1A3 contained something other than heroin (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 180 at [58]–[59]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Colour of the Plastic Bag and the number of bundles collected at JBP</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 At this juncture, I deal with Shaffy’s claim that he was supposed to have collected a red plastic bag containing two bundles of drugs at JBP to support that he had collected the wrong consignment of drugs and intended to return them. Shaffy relied on the WhatsApp messages at 9.36pm on 21 June 2018 (after Shaffy’s arrest) wherein M2 stated, “Bro there are 2 bundle”, “Red plastic”, “U say have extra u put back” and “We see hw” (“M2 Further Messages”).

</div>
</div> Shaffy also claimed that in the First Call at about 9.26pm, he had informed M2 that he had received a white plastic bag whereupon M2 asked: “It’s not red colour plastic bag” (see [90] above, and which I will call the “Missing Conversation”). I did not find these to support Shaffy’s case that he had obtained the wrong consignment of drugs; this is even if I accepted the Missing Conversation occurred and Dadly had not recorded it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 First, there was no evidence to show the colour of the Plastic Bag that Shaffy collected, as he claimed to have disposed of it and placed the Drugs in Exhibit A1A. That the Plastic Bag was white was Shaffy’s bare assertion. Next, despite purportedly having heard M2 mention the plastic bag to be red (in the Missing Conversation), Shaffy did not mention the discrepancy in the colour of the Plastic Bag in any of the Statements to support that he had obtained the wrong consignment of drugs. Instead, he told IO Neo that he felt something was wrong with the plastic bag that he collected because it contained the wrong number of bundles and because, unlike in the past, this time two of the bundles were wrapped in black and not blue tape.

</div>
</div> I therefore disbelieved that Shaffy collected the wrong plastic bag from JBP on the basis of its colour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Second, there was no evidence to show that Shaffy had received three bundles of drugs (as he claimed) instead of two. By his account, Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 had been unwrapped and he had disposed of the tapes even before the Drugs were seized.

</div>
</div> It was therefore possible that he had collected only two bundles and that Shaffy had unwrapped one bundle and which could have contained both Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In fact, Shaffy informed Dadly even in the 1st Statement that he had <span class="font-italic">two </span>parcels in his Gucci bag when Dadly asked him if he had anything to surrender.

</div>
</div> Even before he was arrested, Shaffy knew that he was collecting drugs and he claimed that he was going to meet MB to arrange for the return and exchange of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the bundles. He further told IO Neo that he brought all three Exhibits A1A1, A1A2 and A1A3 with him because he did not want his mother to know he was dealing with drugs. Hence when Dadly asked if he had anything to surrender, Shaffy knew that this pertained to the incriminating goods with him (including Exhibit A1A1) and which was why he informed Dadly about the contents in his bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I add that even in the First Call, it was Shaffy who first mentioned to M2 about “the 2 big 1 small” bundles which he claimed were the “wrong stuff”, to which M2 replied that <span class="font-italic">he did not understand what Shaffy was saying</span> (see [86] above). M2’s reply in the Second Call pertaining to “all three bundles are not yours or two bundles are yours another one not yours” (see [87] above) was a result of Shaffy having first mentioned three bundles in the First Call. This can be seen from the M2 Further Messages (which was before the Second Call) where M2 said to Shaffy that it was <span class="font-italic">Shaffy</span> who claimed there was “extra”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Third, whilst Shaffy claimed that he received two black bundles (Exhibits A1A1 and A1A2) and a blue bundle (Exhibit A1A3), there was likewise no evidence to show the colours of the tape originally wrapped around Exhibits A1A2 and A1A3 (even assuming they were separately wrapped) as he claimed to have discarded the tapes. If Shaffy was relying on the fact that he had received black instead of blue bundles to show that he had obtained the wrong consignment of drugs, this was unsupported by the evidence. No one had informed him that the drugs would be in blue bundles, and he also claimed not to have known the type of drugs MB had asked him to order, such that the colour of the tape would have assumed any significance when he first saw the bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In the round, I rejected Shaffy’s claim that he had collected a wrong consignment of drugs at JBP, and I repeat my earlier findings on this matter. Pertinently, whether the plastic bag should have been red, whether Shaffy should have received two instead of three bundles and whether the bundles should have been blue, were not material if it could be shown that even after having purportedly discovered all these discrepancies, Shaffy nevertheless knew what the bundles contained and intended to deliver them onwards. In this regard, I had found that Shaffy knew what Exhibits A1A1, A1A2 and A1A3 were and disbelieved that he intended to arrange for the return of the Drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Based on the totality of the evidence and my findings above, I was thus also satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Shaffy was in possession of the Drugs for the purpose of trafficking. It was clear from Shaffy’s evidence that the Drugs were not for his consumption. I had also rejected Shaffy’s claim that he had received an erroneous consignment of drugs and that he intended to return them. In particular, the evidence showed that Shaffy had arranged to deliver to Hanafiah some of the Drugs on 21 June 2018 (before he was arrested).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Accordingly, I found the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the charge against Shaffy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Given the quantity of the Drugs, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule, is death. Section 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA gives the court the discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (with caning), provided the accused satisfies the requirements under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and receives a certificate of substantive assistance (“CSA”) from the Public Prosecutor pursuant to s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I agreed with the Prosecution that Shaffy had failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence was restricted to the activities set out in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was merely a courier. It was not disputed that he had placed an order for drugs (which were the Drugs that he subsequently collected at JBP). I had also accepted Hanafiah’s testimony that he had ordered one “batu” of heroin from Shaffy and which formed part of the drug consignment that Shaffy collected from JBP on 20 June 2018. Hence, Shaffy’s acts were not restricted to transporting, sending or delivering the Drugs, or offering to do any of these matters. They were also not acts that were “preparatory to or for the purpose of” transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug – which must be limited to facilitative and incidental acts (<span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 449 at [91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Additionally, the Prosecution did not issue Shaffy with a CSA and hence Shaffy could not avail himself of the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA (even if Shaffy were found to be a courier). In this regard, Mr Almenoar submitted that Shaffy had substantively assisted the Prosecution and the latter’s decision not to issue a CSA was done in bad faith or with malice.

In determining whether it can exercise its discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, the court looks at whether the requirements under s 33B(2) of the MDA have been satisfied.
