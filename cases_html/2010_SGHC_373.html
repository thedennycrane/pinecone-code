<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present matter involves a Convertible Bond
                    Agreement (“CBA”) entered into between the plaintiff and the
                    defendants under which the plaintiff provided to the first defendant financing
                    of approximately $3m (referred to interchangeably by parties as
                    “$2.95m”) for a housing development project at No 25 Shelford Road
                    (“the Shelford Project”). The defendants failed to repay the
                    principal sum of $3m when it fell due a year later. The plaintiff subsequently
                    terminated the CBA and claimed for moneys owed under the CBA. The defendants
                    initially argued that the CBA was wrongfully terminated and disputed the
                    plaintiff’s rights under the CBA. Subsequently, the defendants offered to
                    resolve the disputes amicably. This resulted in a settlement agreement between
                    the parties. The main questions raised in the present matter are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the disputes which arose from
                        the CBA were finally and conclusively resolved by the settlement agreement
                        between the parties; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     if not, whether the contentions raised by the defendants
                        prior to the settlement had any merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, East Coast Properties Pte
                    Ltd, is a real estate company incorporated by the second defendant, Ng Chun Yong
                    Alvin. It is the developer of three residential projects, namely, the Whitley
                    Project at No 121B Whitley Road, the Eight@East Project at No 8 East Coast
                    Avenue and the Shelford Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The second defendant is the sole shareholder and
                    director of the first defendant and he is also a director and/or shareholder of
                    many other companies in the real estate construction and development
                    industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in October 2006, the first defendant
                    exercised an option to purchase No 25 Shelford Road for a sum of $15m. The
                    second defendant paid a deposit in the amount of $3m (“the cash
                    deposit”) upon exercise of the option. The first defendant obtained a
                    loan of $12m from Hong Leong Finance (“HLF”) to finance 80% of the
                    purchase price. The security for this loan was a mortgage over No 25 Shelford
                    Road and a guarantee from the second defendant and his father. In addition, HLF
                    agreed to make further loans to finance the development charge and the
                    construction costs in relation to the Shelford Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In order to “free up” the cash
                    deposit in connection with the purchase of No 25 Shelford Road, the second
                    defendant asked one Chan Hui-Ling Angelena (“Angelena” or
                    “Chan”) whether she was interested in investing a sum of $3m in
                    the Shelford Project. He had known her for about five years from collaborating
                    with her in other development projects where she had worked as an interior
                    designer. Sometime in January 2007, the second defendant met up with Chan and
                    one Sern Chia Lung (“Sern”), a friend and former client of Chan
                    who was also interested in investing in the Shelford Project. The second
                    defendant gave Chan and Sern particulars of the Shelford Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to the second defendant, it was agreed
                    between the second defendant and Chan in a meeting at M/s Kelvin Chia
                    Partnership’s offices in March 2007 that a loan of $3m would be granted to
                    the first defendant. The lender would be a company incorporated by Chan and
                    Sern. The second defendant offered a 100% return on the loan. At the trial, the
                    second defendant averred that the parties had agreed that the loan would be
                    repaid one year after its disbursement, as it was anticipated that purchasers of
                    units in the Shelford Project would then be paying their 20% deposit. According
                    to the second defendant, that was the time when the temporary occupation permit
                    (“TOP”) for the Shelford units was expected to be issued. The
                    second defendant explained how he had figured that he would be able to pay a
                    100% return on the loan: the profit in the Shelford Project was projected to be
                    $700 per sq ft of saleable space. Given a total saleable area of 40,000 sq ft,
                    the project was projected to bring in $28m in profit. Based on this calculation,
                    there would be more than enough money to pay the lender a 100% return on the
                    loan at the TOP stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the meantime, Chan persuaded Sern and three
                    other friends (Nina Hong, Lawrence Lim, and Steve Seah) to share in the
                    investment in the Shelford Project. The five of them came up with the $3m sum
                    and agreed on using Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd (“the
                    plaintiff”) as the vehicle to make their investment in the first
                    defendant. Chan is a director and the sole shareholder of the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Chan and Sern had discussed with the second
                    defendant about security for the investment in the Shelford Project. On
                    30 April 2007, Chan and Sern instructed Lee Ying Ying (“Ms
                    Lee”) of M/s Kelvin Chia Partnership to prepare a draft of the CBA
                    intending it as some form of security for the investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Subsequently, on 2 May 2007, the second
                    defendant had a meeting with Sern and Ms Lee at the offices of M/s Kelvin
                    Chia Partnership. According to Sern, he went through each term in the draft CBA
                    with the second defendant. Ms Lee was present when this took place. It was
                    highlighted to the second defendant that the plaintiff would have an option to
                    convert the loan into shares in the first defendant. In particular, a
                    significant change to an earlier draft was highlighted to the second defendant.
                    Under cl 12(c), instead of a fixed sum of $3m, the return would be a sum
                    equivalent to 10% of the sale proceeds of the Shelford units. The
                    plaintiff’s position is that the second defendant was told at the meeting
                    that he should consult his own lawyer on the terms of the CBA. According to
                    Sern, the second defendant replied that he did not need to see a lawyer. Sern
                    said that the second defendant had suggested amendments to the CBA, most
                    significant of which was that with respect to cl 12(g) of the CBA so that if the
                    plaintiff received a return of $3m but it subsequently turned out that 10% of
                    the sale proceeds fell below $3m, the plaintiff would have to refund the amount
                    by which 10% of the sale proceeds fell short of $3m. The second defendant was
                    allegedly content with the amendment as made. The plaintiff and the defendants
                    duly executed the CBA on the same day, on 2 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to the second defendant, Sern had
                    “briefly explained” the terms of the CBA at the meeting of
                    2 May 2007. The second defendant was “taken by surprise” that
                    cl 12 of the CBA allowed the plaintiff to benefit more than $3m. The second
                    defendant alleged that he was assured that the transaction was a loan of $3m
                    repayable within one year after disbursement of the loan and that the return of
                    a further $3m was to be paid only after the TOP was issued. The second defendant
                    asserted that he did not read the CBA in full and was unaware of the
                    consequences of all the terms in the CBA. He signed the CBA because he
                    “needed the funds urgently” and he “trusted
                    Angelena”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Terms of the Convertible Bond Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The term “Convertible Bond
                    Agreement” is a curious misnomer since the agreement did not provide for
                    any issuance of bonds. However, the commercial purpose of the CBA as a means of
                    investment in the Shelford Project is apparent from the first few clauses of the
                    CBA, the material parts of which are set out below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It can therefore be seen that the first

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It would appear that the second defendant took
                    speculative risks in the Singapore property market in the months following the
                    execution of the CBA. In or around June 2007 (one month after the execution of
                    the CBA), the second defendant paid for an option for the purchase of the
                    Dapenso Building, a nine-storey office building block in Cecil Street, for the
                    sum of $96m without the financial resources to meet even the deposit payable
                    upon the exercise of such option. The second defendant had to borrow a sum of
                    $12m from one Delia Chua (introduced to him by Chan) in order that his company,
                    East Coast (Cecil) Investment Pte Ltd, could exercise the option to purchase the
                    Dapenso Building. He borrowed a further sum of $80m from one K S Tan to pay
                    the balance of the purchase price. Subsequently, the second defendant secured a
                    sub-sale of the Dapenso building to the KOP group of companies for about $120m.
                    The second defendant admitted that he had taken a “gamble” as he
                    would have lost Delia Chua’s $12m if he had failed to borrow the $80m. He
                    admitted that he had taken this risk as the property market in 2007 was
                    “bullish”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A few months after the execution of the CBA,
                    on 12 September 2007 the first defendant exercised an option to purchase another
                    property, No 121B Whitley Road. This purchase was financed with a loan of $12.6m
                    from the United Overseas Bank which also agreed to grant further loans of $2.1m
                    for the development charge and $7.8m towards construction costs for the Whitley
                    Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 2 April 2008 (about one year after the CBA
                    had been executed), Sern reminded the second defendant of the defendants’
                    obligation to make repayment of the principal sum of $3m by 2 May 2008. Sometime
                    in April 2008, the second defendant informed Chan that the first defendant would
                    not be able to repay the principal sum by 2 May 2008. The second defendant
                    explained that the launch of the Shelford Project had to be delayed because
                    “time was required to demolish and clear the [Shelford]
                    [work]site”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 10 April 2008, the second defendant
                    unsuccessfully sought to borrow a sum of $3m from Delia Chua for the repayment
                    of the principal sum of $3m to the plaintiff. Delia Chua informed Chan of the
                    second defendant’s request for financial assistance. This was important as
                    it contributed to the plaintiff’s grounds for belief that the first
                    defendant was unable to repay the principal sum. Subsequently, the second
                    defendant asked Chan and Sern for an extension of three months to repay the
                    principal sum. In consideration of such extension, the second defendant offered
                    to pay an additional $1m over and above what would have been due upon issue of
                    the TOP. By 7 May 2008, the defendant managed to make payment of only
                    $1.2m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff then decided to terminate the
                    CBA. In a letter dated 10 May 2008, the plaintiff gave notice to the
                    defendants of the exercise of its right under cl 17 of the CBA to terminate the
                    CBA with immediate effect. It gave notice that the right of termination arose,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, under cl 17(g) as the plaintiff
                    had notice that the defendants did not have sufficient funds for the Shelford
                    Project. That, in the plaintiff’s view, provided reasonable grounds for
                    the plaintiff’s belief that the defendants might not be able to perform
                    its obligations under the CBA. The same letter informed that the following
                    amounts had become immediately due and payable:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the principal sum of the loan in the
                        amount of $2.95m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     interest in the sum of $2.95m; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     the sum of $8,051.75 being the sum of legal
                        costs in the negotiation and preparation of the CBA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The demand for payment of item (b) above was
                    based on cl 18 of the CBA which provided that 100% interest on the loan was
                    immediately due and payable upon termination of the CBA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The settlement agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Initially, the defendants adopted an
                    aggressive position against the plaintiff’s termination of the CBA. The
                    defendants’ solicitors wrote a letter dated 15 May 2008 (“the first
                    letter of 15 May 2008”) to dispute the plaintiff’s rights under the
                    CBA. The following contentions were raised by the defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     When the CBA was presented to the
                        second defendant, he thought that it looked complicated but signed it when
                        he was assured that the CBA provided for the terms as agreed [this resulted
                        in the defendants’ plea of <em>non est
                            factum</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The CBA was a sham transaction. Chan and Sern had
                        employed the plaintiff as a vehicle to effect a moneylending transaction and
                        used the CBA to mask the real intention to lend money at a prohibitive
                        interest rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     The loan given pursuant to the CBA was unenforceable as the plaintiff was
                        not a licensed moneylender under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed)
                        (“MLA 1985”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     The 100% interest rate found in cl 18 of the CBA was
                        exorbitant. Section 23(5) of the MLA 1985 capped the chargeable interest
                        rate at 20% per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff had wrongfully terminated the CBA as there
                        was no amount due and payable under the CBA, the plaintiff not having
                        exercised the first option under cl 11 of the CBA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_f"></a>(f)     The defendants, after having had the
                        benefit of legal advice, realised that cll 7 and 9 of the CBA would entitle
                        the plaintiff to own 75% of the first defendant. The second defendant did
                        not intend to confer on the plaintiff 75% ownership in the first defendant
                        for a mere $3m. This made the CBA “grossly unconscionable”

                    defendants’ solicitors wrote a “without prejudice” letter of
                    the same date to express the defendants’ intentions to negotiate in good
                    faith with a view to achieving an amicable settlement (“the second letter

                    legal costs incurred. The letter from the plaintiff’s solicitors dated 28
                    May 2008 proposed that the defendants deliver three post-dated cheques for the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The defendants’ solicitors replied in a
                    letter dated 30 May 2008 agreeing to delivery of a current-dated cheque of
                    $14,051.75 as well as to paras 3 and 4 of the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors’ letter dated 28 May 2008. However, they counter-proposed a
                    different repayment schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     An instalment payment schedule was finally
                        <em>agreed</em> between the parties. The defendants
                    delivered to the plaintiff four post-dated cheques as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     a cheque dated 31 August 2008
                        for the sum of $1,740,870.31;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     a cheque dated 31 October 2008 for the sum of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_d"></a>(d)     a cheque dated 31 March 2009 for
                        the sum of $1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In addition, the defendants sent a cheque
                    dated 10 June 2008 for the sum of $14,051.75 representing the legal costs for
                    preparing the CBA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendants then defaulted in making
                    payment under the agreed instalment payment schedule. While the cheques for the
                    respective sums of $14,051.75 and $1,740,870.31 were duly met on presentation,
                    the defendants defaulted with respect to the three remaining instalments of $1m
                    each. The plaintiff then filed a writ seeking:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     payment of $2.9m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     interest in the sum of $173,391.78 at

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     interest on the sum of $2.9m at the rate of 12% per annum
                        from the date of issue of the writ to the date of payment;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     legal costs of
                        $18,550.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendants claim that the CBA was a sham
                    and that the transaction was that of moneylending unenforceable under the MLA
                    1985 as the plaintiff was not a licensed moneylender. The defendants further
                    claim that the plaintiff was used as a vehicle to lend money at an exorbitant
                    interest rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The second defendant claims that he did not
                    read the CBA when he signed it and that he did not fully understand the
                    consequences of signing the CBA. In addition, the defendants claim that the
                    plaintiff had wrongfully terminated the CBA and that the plaintiff could not
                    rely on cll 17(a) and 17(g) to terminate the CBA. The defendants claim to have
                    had more than sufficient funds for the Shelford Project as evidenced by the
                    payment of $1.2m to the plaintiff on 7 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In relation to the settlement agreement, the
                    defendants claim that they entered into the same <em>under
                        economic duress</em>, the defendants being concerned then that the
                    threatened legal proceedings might adversely affect HLF’s financing of the
                    Shelford Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defendants also have a counterclaim for
                    moneys already paid to the plaintiff on the basis that the CBA had been
                    wrongfully terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff argues that the issues raised by
                    the defendants in relation to the CBA were irrelevant because the parties had,
                    subsequent to the CBA, entered into a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff claims that, in any event, it
                    was entitled to terminate the CBA. The plaintiff maintains that it had
                    reasonable grounds to believe that the defendants might not be able to perform
                    or comply with their obligations under the CBA. It was argued that the plaintiff
                    had come to know that the defendants did not have sufficient funds for the
                    project and might not be able to secure funds for the project on a timely
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The following issues arise for
                    determination:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the issues raised in the defence
                        form the subject matter of a valid and binding compromise
                    agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so,
                        what was the effect of the compromise agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether there was, in any event, any
                        merit or basis in the issues?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First Issue –Did the issues form the subject matter of a valid
                and binding compromise agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The overarching question in the present matter
                    is whether the issues raised by the defendants were the subject matter of a
                    compromise agreement; and, if so, what was the <em>consequence</em> of compromising those issues. In determining the
                    definition of “compromise”, reference is made to the Court of
                    Appeal decision <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence
                        Peter</em> and another appeal [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332
                        (“<em>Gay Choon Ing</em>”) where the
                    observations of David Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice of
                        Compromise</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2005)
                        (“<em>Foskett</em>”) at para 1-01 were
                    endorsed (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Compromise can be defined as <em>the settlement of dispute
                            by mutual concession</em>, its essential foundation being the
                        ordinary law of contract ... A more practical and, perhaps, more apt
                        definition would be <em>the complete or partial resolution by
                            agreement of differences before final adjudication by a court or
                            tribunal of competent jurisdiction</em>. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal (at [43]) clarified that a compromise is
                    essentially based on contract and for a compromise to be reached between two
                    parties, there must, of necessity, be “an actual or potential dispute
                    between parties that can be disposed of”. It was observed at [42]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... where parties have demonstrated that they intend to dispose of their
                        dispute by reaching an amicable resolution agreeable to both parties, this
                        compromise or settlement will be recognised and given effect to by the
                        courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The High Court decision in <em>Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore v Singapore
                        Telecommunications Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 136 was also
                    endorsed by the Court of Appeal at [44], where it was noted that Lai Kew
                    Chai J had cited <em>Foskett’s</em> following
                    observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A compromise is little more than a species of contract. What
                        distinguishes it from other contracts is <em>the requirement
                            of a dispute or differences between parties which are eventually
                            settled</em>. In Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice
                            of Compromise</em> it is written (at p 5):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Bearing in mind its essential nature, it is submitted that a
                            compromise in the true sense of the term cannot arise until some dispute
                            or difference of view exists between the parties which, by agreement,
                            they resolve. It is not necessary for there to be pending litigation,
                            but there must be some ‘actual’ or ‘potential’
                            dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the facts of the present case, it is clear
                    that the issues had been compromised by a settlement agreement between the
                    parties. The issues were first raised in the first letter of 15 May 2008 by
                    the defendants’ solicitors. Thereafter, the defendants signified in the
                    second letter of 15 May 2008 their intention to negotiate in good faith
                    “with a view to reaching an amicable settlement”. The
                    defendants’ intentions were made patently clear when, in the letter dated
                    23 May 2008, it was stated that the defendants “[did] not
                    wish” to dispute the plaintiff’s claim and wished to
                    “resolve the matter amicably”. The defendants’ letter dated
                    30 May 2008 <em>accepted</em> the terms set out in
                    paras 2 to 5 of the plaintiff’s letter dated 28 May 2008. Finally, the
                    defendants <em>affirmed</em> the compromise agreement by
                    delivering four sets of post-dated cheques in the defendants’ letter dated
                    9 June 2008; this was unequivocal acceptance of the instalment payment schedule
                    proposed by the plaintiff. Looking at the correspondence between the parties in
                    its totality, there is no doubt that a valid “compromise
                    agreement” (or “settlement agreement”) had been formed. The
                    plaintiff agreed not to pursue its claim under the CBA (forbearance to sue) in
                    exchange for the defendants’ payment of the instalment sums by way of
                    post-dated cheques delivered to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The argument on economic duress</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Based on the defendants’ pleaded case,
                    the only substantive argument against the compromise agreement was that it was
                    reached under economic duress. The defendants allege that they were forced to
                    enter into the settlement agreement under economic duress. According to the
                    second defendant, when he informed Chan in April 2008 that the defendants would
                    not be able to repay the principal sum of $3m by 2 May 2008, Chan informed him
                    that failure to do so would result in “serious repercussions”. The
                    defendants took this as a threat that legal action would be instituted against
                    them. The defendants alleged that Sern had warned the second defendant over the
                    telephone on 14 May 2008 that legal action would be taken if the defendants
                    failed to make payment of the balance of $2.75m (since only $1.2m had been
                    paid). The defendants claim that on the same day, on 14 May 2008, at around
                    10.30am, Chan told the second defendant over the telephone to settle as the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors were ready to take legal action against the
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In my view, the defence of economic duress is
                    clearly untenable. Quite apart from the fact that <em>prima
                        facie</em> the threat of legal action to enforce one’s legal
                    rights is not a wrongful threat, the evidence does not bear out the
                    defendants’ allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     First, it is clear that the offer to settle
                    was <em>initiated</em> by the defendants themselves. Given
                    that the offer to settle was made by the defendants, the attempt to avoid the
                    settlement agreement with the lame allegation of economic duress borders on the
                    frivolous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Second, I am unable to accept the
                    defendants’ assertion that Sern and Chan forced the second defendant over
                    the telephone (over two separate telephone calls on 14 May 2008) to settle.
                    If the threats had indeed been uttered on 14 May 2008 and if there had
                    been, as alleged, a series of threats made over the telephone since April 2008,
                    there was not even the slightest hint of the same in the defendants’ first
                    letter dated 15 May 2008. Neither were the alleged threats of legal
                    proceedings raised or mentioned in the defendants’ e-mail correspondence
                    of 28 May 2008 and 4 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Third, the defendants’ actions after the
                    compromise agreement was made were inconsistent with the alleged economic
                    duress. For example, instead of making protest that the settlement agreement was
                    made under duress, the defendants actually <em>requested for an
                        extension of time</em> to make the payment of the accelerated sum of
                    $3m in the e-mails dated 24 November 2008 and 9 December 2008. In
                    addition, the second defendant himself wrote an e-mail dated 25 February
                    2009 to seek an extension of time to make payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Fourth, the second defendant admitted during
                    cross-examination that throughout the period, from June 2008 (when the
                    settlement agreement had been formed) to the commencement of the action in April
                    2009, he had <em>never disputed</em> the plaintiff’s
                    rights under the settlement agreement. After showing the second defendant the
                    series of correspondence up to the e-mail dated 24 November 2008, the
                    second defendant was asked:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Do you agree that from all these actions,
                            you’ve never disputed our client’s rights under the
                            settlement agreement?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Like I said, I was forced to go into this
                        --</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No. You have not disputed our client’s
                            rights? Just answer the question.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Court:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can I just clarify. What is the
                            “no”? What does the “no” mean? ... The
                            question was “You have not disputed our client’s rights?
                            Just answer the question. Answer: No.” Do you mean you have not
                            disputed, that you agree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I have not disputed.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Fifth, it was undisputed that the defendants
                    had the benefit of independent legal advice throughout the process of
                    negotiating the terms of the settlement agreement as well as after the
                    settlement agreement had been entered into. The defendants also had a viable
                    alternative to settlement, they could have defended their claim. After all, the
                    second defendant himself admitted in court that he had told the plaintiff (and
                    had legal advice to the effect) that the defendants had “strong
                    grounds” to dispute the plaintiff’s claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">At page 226 [the second letter of 15 May 2008], you
                            agree that notwithstanding that legally, you have been advised there are
                            strong grounds to dispute the claim, you say you do not wish to do so
                            and instead want to resolve the matter amicably.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     There was even more confidence shown in the
                    defendants’ first letter of 15 May 2008 where the defendants represented
                    to the plaintiff that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    ... our clients wholly reject your claim. We are
                            instructed that if you persist in claiming against our clients, we have
                            firm instructions to vigorously defend the claim and hold you fully
                            liable for all cost [<em>sic</em>]
                        incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, there is not an iota of evidence of any form of
                    illegitimate pressure placed by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In any event, even if I were to accept the
                    defendants’ allegations that Chan and Sern had threatened the second
                    defendant that the plaintiff would take legal action if the defendants failed to
                    make payment of the principal sum, that alone is insufficient to amount to
                    “illegitimate pressure”. It has been observed in <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    30th Ed, 2009) at para 7-050 (endorsed in <em>Shunmugam Jayakumar
                        v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 658 at
                    [51] (“<em>Shunmugam</em>”); also see
                        <em>Miles v New Zealand Alford Estate Company</em>
                    (1886) 32 Ch D 266 and <em>Jayawickreme v Amarsuriya (since
                        deceased)</em> [1918] AC 869) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since recourse to law is the remedy for redress provided by the law
                        itself, it is obvious that prima facie a threat to enforce one’s legal
                        rights by instituting civil proceedings cannot be an unlawful or wrongful
                        threat. Consequently a contract which is obtained by means of such a threat
                        must prima facie be valid, and cannot be impeached on grounds of duress. So
                        an ordinary bona fide compromise is clearly a valid contract even though
                        exacted under threats to bring (or defend) legal proceedings. ... Even a
                        threat to bring proceedings where there is no ground of action in law is
                        prima facie not an unlawful threat, at least where the threat is made
                            <em>bona fide</em>, and is not manifestly frivolous
                        or vexatious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The argument on failure of consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The defendants next argued that there had been
                    a total failure of consideration to form a valid settlement agreement. The
                    argument ignores the fact that the plaintiff could have sued the defendants to
                    enforce its rights under the CBA but refrained from so doing as the parties had
                    entered into the settlement agreement. It is established law that forbearance to
                    sue constitutes sufficient consideration: see the Court of Appeal decisions of
                        <em>Ang Sin Hock v Khoo Eng Lim</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 179 at [71]; <em>Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong
                        Fook Chee Vincent</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 250; and the High
                    Court decisions of <em>Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second issue – What is the effect of the compromise
                agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     At the trial, the defendants attempted to
                    resurrect the same issues that formed the subject matter of the compromise
                    agreement. In my view, the defendants are precluded from doing so. Where parties
                    have agreed to resolve their dispute amicably by way of a validly formed
                    settlement agreement, the settlement agreement alone governs the parties’
                    legal relationship; the <em>effect</em> of the settlement
                    agreement is to <em>put an end</em> to the issues
                    previously raised by the defendants. This oft-stated principle has been regarded
                    as self-evident as its rationale has seldom been adequately articulated. It has
                    been observed in the leading commentary in David Foskett, <em>The
                        Law and Practice of Compromise</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed,
                    2010) (“<em>Foskett 2010</em>”) at paras 8-01
                    and 8-02 ([40] <em>supra</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8-01  The purpose of a compromise is to <b><em>put an end to the disputation</em></b> in which the
                            parties had hitherto been engaged. Such cause or causes of action as
                            each had, or may have had, prior to the conclusion of the agreement are
                            discharged ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8-02  Given the normal meaning, purpose and effect of a
                            compromise, the natural inference is that the common intention of the
                            parties is that <b><em>the compromise will henceforth
                                govern their legal relationship in connection with the
                                disputes</em></b> in which they had been engaged and that,
                            accordingly, those disputes would still be regarded as
                            ‘dead’ even in the event of breach of the compromise. In
                            these circumstances, recourse to the original claims will not be
                            permitted unless, upon a true construction of the compromise, it is
                            clear that this is what the parties intended. ...</p>

          <em>Foskett 2010</em>
                    makes clear that the factual and legal basis upon which the parties have entered
                    into the compromise agreement cannot be reopened, at paras 2-01, 2-16 and
                    6-01:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2-01  … a compromise in the true sense of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2-16  The assertions, denials and counter-assertions

                            provided they are made in good faith. If a party to a compromise
                            attempts to escape its consequences by alleging that the claim has no
                            legal effect or factual foundation, the court will decline to
                            investigate such an allegation. ...</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6-01  An unimpeached compromise represents the end of

                            buried beneath the surface of the compromise. The court will not permit
                            them to be raised afresh in the context of a new action.

                            [1997] SGHC 281, for example, G P Selvam J observed, as
                            follows (at [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A compromise is a settlement agreement arrived at, either in court or
                            out of court, either before or after action, for resolving a dispute or
                            settling a claim upon what appears to the parties, and in particular the
                            conceder, to be fair and equitable terms, having regard to the
                            uncertainty they are in regarding the facts or the law and facts
                            together. <em>Once concluded neither party may resile

                            unacceptable. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56 Indeed, the <em>objective</em> nature
                        of the entire inquiry has been underscored in many cases. For example, in
                        the decision of this court in <em>Aircharter World Pte Ltd v
                            Kontena Nasional Bhd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 440, M
                        Karthigesu JA noted (at [30]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Under this test [for determining whether the parties have reached an

                            the same terms on the same subject-matter, then neither can, generally,
                            rely on some unexpressed qualification or reservation to show that he
                            had not in fact agreed to the terms to which he had appeared to agree.
                            Such subjective reservations of one party, therefore, do not prevent the
                            formation of a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The same view was held in <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 8 at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts are bound to scrutinise with care any attempt by a

                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Once a valid compromise has been reached, it is not open to the party

                            that the claim was in fact invalid, provided that the claim was made in
                            good faith and was reasonably believed to be valid by the person
                            asserting it.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Based on these authorities, it is clear that
                    disputes between the parties have been resolved by a validly formed compromise
                    agreement entered into in good faith and therefore the issues that previously
                    divided them are <em>brought to an end</em>; the parties
                    are not allowed to renege on their mutual compromise for to do so would be to
                    breach the contract. The rationale behind this general principle lies in
                    contract. Where a compromise agreement has been validly formed, that puts an end
                    to the parties’ disputes. The parties are not allowed to reopen the prior
                    issues. This is not because they are <em>estopped</em> from
                    doing so, but because there <em>no longer exists</em> any
                    issues between the parties. Subject to the <em>parties’
                        intentions</em> as manifested in the language of the compromise
                    agreement, any issues between the parties have been <em>resolved</em> with the terms and conditions (express and implied)
                    found in the compromise agreement. The compromise agreement therefore
                    essentially takes over as the basis of the parties’ legal and contractual
                    relationship. In this way, save for any prior issues expressly reserved, the
                    only <em>relevant</em> disputes (if any) are those arising
                    from the <em>compromise agreement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The <em>raison
                        d’etre</em> for this principle are manifold and may well extend
                    to broader considerations concerning alternative dispute resolution and the
                    efficacy of the administration of justice. There is much public interest in the
                    final resolution of disputes; <em>interest reipublicae ut sit
                        finis litium</em> (see <em>Foskett 2010</em>
                    ([40] <em>supra</em>) at 6–02. In a sense, parties
                    with unresolved disputes ought to have better claim to the court’s time
                    and resources than those who have already settled their disputes in good faith.
                    There is in addition the sound policy in holding parties to their compromised
                    bargain to ensure commercial certainty. This consideration is especially
                    compelling when it comes to commercial transactions involving corporate men
                    acting with the benefit of legal advice. However, the general principle is
                    subject to inherent limits. It cannot be said that a compromise agreement
                        <em>is an absolute bar</em> to reopening disputes
                        <em>regardless of the circumstances</em> surrounding
                    the agreement. Lord Denning, in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Binder v Alachouzos</em> [1972] 2 QB 151
                        (“<em>Binder</em>”), cautioned against
                    possible abuse of a compromise agreement (at 157 and 158):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The judges will ... not allow a moneylender to use a compromise as a
                        means of getting round the [Moneylenders] Act. They will inquire into the
                        circumstances giving rise to the compromise. They will not allow the
                        moneylender to take unfair advantage of the borrower. Even if the borrower
                        consents to judgment being entered against him, the courts will go behind
                        that consent, if the justice of the case so requires. For instance, where
                        the interest charged was so high that it was presumed to be harsh and
                        unconscionable, the court refused to enforce a consent to judgment: see
                            <em>Mills Conduit Investment Ltd. v. Leslie</em>
                        [1932] 1 K.B. 233.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, it is important that the courts should enforce
                        compromises which are agreed in good faith between the lender and borrower.
                        If the court is satisfied that the terms are fair and reasonable, then the
                        compromise should be held binding. For instance, if there is a genuine
                        difference as to whether the lender is a moneylender or not, then it is open
                        to the parties to enter into a <em>bona fide</em>
                        agreement of compromise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In <em>Binder</em>, a
                    lender commenced action against the borrower for default in repayment of loans.
                    The borrower claimed that the loans were unenforceable as they were made in the
                    course of the business of moneylending. Before trial, an agreement was reached
                    between the parties which provided that the lender’s actions would be
                    discontinued and that the borrower should make payment of a sum of money by way
                    of instalments. It was further expressly agreed that the Moneylenders Act did
                    not apply to the loan transactions. Lord Denning (at 158) found that the dispute
                    as to whether the lender was a moneylender had already formed the subject matter
                    of a <em>bona fide</em> compromise agreement, and it
                    followed that the dispute could not be reopened unless the lender had taken
                    “undue advantage” of the borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I respectfully agree with the proposition in
                        <em>Binder</em> that a compromise agreement is not
                        <em>an absolute bar</em> to reopening issues. There are
                    indeed circumstances in which a compromise agreement could be set aside.
                    However, inasmuch as the court will not make a contract for the parties; there
                    is limited scope for the court to determine whether the terms contracted between
                    two commercial parties were “fair and reasonable”. In my view,
                    having regard to the fact that the juridical basis of a compromise agreement
                    lies in contract, the circumstances in which issues that have been resolved by a
                    compromise agreement can be reopened, <em>must necessarily lie in
                        the law of contract</em>. As such, prior issues may still be relevant
                    and may even be “live” in situations where the compromise
                    agreement was tainted by illegality or affected by fraud, duress, undue
                    influence or mistake. In circumstances such as these, there cannot be said to be
                    a resolution of issues in the true sense. The compromise agreement would
                    therefore be set aside (or depending on the circumstances, declared to be
                        <em>void ab initio</em>) and the issues that have never
                    truly been compromised would be live again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the present case, I have considered the
                    defendants’ argument based on economic duress and have found it to be
                    without basis. The issues raised by the defendants have been put to an end by
                    way of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Third issue – Whether there was, in any case, any merit or
                basis in the issues?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In any event, even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the issues were reopened, I find that the
                    defendants’ arguments in relation thereto lack merit for the reasons set
                    out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The argument on non est factum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     According to the second defendant, the signing
                    of the CBA was only a “formality” to him. He had allegedly
                    understood the transaction to be a simple loan of $3m repayable within one year
                    after disbursement of the loan, and a profit of an additional $3m was to be paid
                    only after the TOP had been issued. The second defendant contended that Sern had
                    only “briefly explained” the terms of the CBA at the meeting of 2
                    May 2007. He claimed that he did not read the CBA and was unaware of the effect
                    of all the terms in the CBA. He had only signed the CBA because he
                    “needed the funds urgently” and he “trusted
                    Angelena”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In my view, the second defendant’s
                    defence of <em>non est factum</em> was doomed to fail. He
                    is an educated person and an experienced market player used to taking risks in
                    the development and construction business. The second defendant is a
                    director/shareholder of more than five development companies and a shareholder
                    of one construction company; he had also managed several development projects at
                    the same time. Indeed, his penchant for risk-taking was evident from the fact
                    that he had managed several development projects that were highly leveraged. As
                    was earlier recounted (at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above) he
                    took a gamble with money he borrowed from Delia Chua when, through his company
                    East Coast (Cecil) Investment Pte Ltd, he exercised an option to purchase
                    Dapenso Building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The second defendant’s risk-taking did
                    not stop there. About four months after the execution of the CBA, the first
                    defendant exercised an option to purchase another property, No 121B Whitley
                    Road. As was mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                    above) this purchase was financed with a loan of $12.6m from the United Overseas
                    Bank with additional facilities of $2.1m for the development charge and $7.8m
                    for construction costs for the Whitley Project. The second defendant admitted
                    that there was an outstanding sum of around $2m required for the Whitley Project
                    (“the shortfall”) and that he used the funds reserved for the
                    Shelford Project to cover this shortfall:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So that [$]2.95 million is the amount that is the
                            difference, right, that you have to pay for the completion of Whitley
                            Road?</span></p>

                            completed the purchase of Whitley, and now because of my shortfall I
                            have to scramble for money to kick start the project till launched. I
                            have already obtain[ed] the BP [building permission] for Whitley which
                            means that once I take over the site I am able to sell the project but
                            at current market I reckon that I need to build a showflat in order for
                            any sale. I am currently managing both the projects
                            ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Meaning Shelford and

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So your shortfall is the $2 million, right, the amount that you have
                            to pay for the completion of Whitley, and the $1 million deposit?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to
                    the second defendant’s credibility as a witness. Even if the court were to
                    believe his version that the CBA was a “simple” loan agreement, it
                    was still a loan of a sum of $3m that was repayable one year later, with a
                    promised return of 100% on the loan. These are not insubstantial sums. In the
                    circumstances, it would require a lot to believe the second defendant’s
                    testimony that he virtually shut his eyes while signing the CBA:</p>

                    out of the window when he gave the contradictory testimony that he <em>had</em> indeed read a part of the CBA:</p>

                            was introduced to one Sern, Bee Im, and Kelvin Chia. [The second
                            defendant] said [the first defendant] needed S$3 million to free up
                            the cash deposit that had been put into the Shelford project. It was
                            discussed at the meetings that the loan would take the form of a payment
                            of S$3 million to [the first defendant] which could be reimbursed within
                            a year when the Shelford project was expected to be launched and a
                            further return on investment of a $1 for $1 i.e. a return of
                            $3 million would be paid when TOP for the project was expected to
                            be issued which could take 2 years or more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    At a final meeting on 2 May 2007, [Chan], Sern
                            and [the second defendant] met in Kelvin Chia’s office during
                            which Sern presented a somewhat different structure. <b><em>[The second defendant] was told and understood</em></b> it
                            to be that the 2nd tranche payment was to be equal to 10 per cent of the
                            proceeds of sale which was estimated to be about $39 million. The
                            return on investment would thus be $3.9 million instead of a $1 for
                            $1 return.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     This first letter of 15 May 2008 contains
                    an unequivocal admission that the second defendant fully understood the
                    transaction he had entered into. This undisputed documentary evidence is
                    consistent with the second defendant’s admission that at the meeting of 2
                    May 2007 Sern did direct the second defendant’s attention to cl 12(c) of
                    the CBA which would entitle the plaintiff to 10% of the sale proceeds of the
                    Shelford units:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">When Sern first brought up this 10 per cent to you,
                            he did turn your attention to clause 12(c); right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">He did explain.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Did he flip it to page 4 and show it to you? You
                            were going through the terms; right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yeah.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">If that was going to be a term of concern for you,
                            then in the final document, as you are turning and flipping to sign,
                            surely you would cast your eye back to the same place where you had a
                            problem; right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I would think so, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the reasons above, I find that the second
                    defendant’s plea of <em>non est factum</em> is
                    disingenuous.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “sham” argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendants contend that the CBA was a sham
                    to hide the true moneylending nature of the transaction which as such was
                    unenforceable under the MLA 1985, the plaintiff not being a licensed
                    moneylender. The defendants further claim that Chan and Sern had used the
                    plaintiff as a vehicle to lend money at an exorbitant interest
                rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Although the transaction originated as a loan,
                    there are features in the CBA that suggest the plaintiff’s intention was
                    to invest in the Shelford Project. Firstly, the plaintiff was contractually
                    entitled under cll 7 and 9 of the CBA to convert the loan into shares in the
                    first defendant comprising not less than 75% of the enlarged capital of the
                    first defendant. This was a valuable right exercisable at any time after the
                    First Drawdown Date which, in the event the Shelford Project was successful,
                    would enable the plaintiff to obtain the lion’s share of the first
                    defendant’s profits. Secondly, under the First Option (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) the plaintiff was able to put to the
                    second defendant $1.5m of the loan or (if already converted) 1.5 million of the
                    converted shares at a price of $3m. This effectively made the second defendant a
                    guarantor for the repayment of the $3m loan. Moreover, it enabled the plaintiff,
                    even after conversion of the loan into shares, to avoid the consequences of such
                    conversion if the first defendant suffered any set-backs in the Shelford
                    Project. Thirdly, upon exercise of the Second Option (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> to <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>
                    above), the plaintiff would obtain a return equivalent to 10% of the sale
                    proceeds (under cl 12(c) of the CBA). This return could be more or less
                    than $3m depending on the prices at which all the units in the Shelford Project
                    were sold. Essentially, the plaintiff’s return depended on how successful
                    the Shelford Project was. If the Shelford Project did well, the plaintiff could
                    hold on to the converted shares and enjoy the fruits as a shareholder. If the
                    Shelford Project did not do well, the plaintiff could exercise the put options.
                    Even though the terms of the CBA were preponderantly in favour of the plaintiff,
                    that does not preclude the plaintiff from maintaining that it had invested in
                    the Shelford Project. The defendants’ solicitor’s e-mail dated 9
                    December 2008 shows that the defendants also regarded the plaintiff as having
                    invested in the Shelford Project. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    The client [defendants] has been responsible enough
                            to repay the principal sum of $3 [million] owing to your clients [the
                            plaintiff] ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    
              <b>W</b>
<b><em>hat remains owing is only the return on your clients’ [the
                                plaintiff] investment</em></b>. But originally this was not due
                            for payment until the TOP of the Shelford project. But this repayment
                            got accelerated because of our clients’ [the plaintiff] default in
                            making the repayment of the principal sum on a timely basis.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In addition, the defendants’ solicitors
                    wrote a letter dated 4 November 2008 to request for an extension of time to make
                    payment under the settlement agreement where it was acknowledged that the
                    additional sum of $3m was the profit on the Shelford investment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly persuade your clients [the plaintiff] to be understanding having
                        regard to the present circumstances ... Your clients have recovered the
                        capital sum. The remaining $3 million is <b><em>really the
                            profit</em></b> which was to be drawn from the proceeds of the
                        Shelford project ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It can be seen therefore that the defendants
                    themselves regarded the sum of $3m as a <em>profit</em> on
                    the plaintiff’s <em>investment</em>. This was
                    unequivocally affirmed by the second defendant’s testimony under
                    cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can I turn your attention to 1AB246. That is a
                            letter dated 4 November 2008, where your lawyers then were asking for an
                            extension of time to pay under the settlement agreement.
                        Right?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Then at page 247, the second paragraph, two lines
                            down: “The remaining $3 million is really the profit which was to
                            be drawn from the proceeds of the Shelford project upon TOP which is a
                            long way off.” That's one statement that was made?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">--- sorry, I don't follow.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Page 247, the second paragraph, the third line:
                            “The remaining $3 million is really profit ...”
                            That’s what your lawyers say. Do you agree with that
                            statement?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The defendants’ contention that the CBA
                    was a sham was given a boost when Chan stated under cross-examination that the
                    plaintiff never intended to convert the loan unless the Borrower went into
                    default. That answer did not make commercial sense for if the Borrower went into
                    default, it would likely have been in poor financial health. In such a
                    situation, it is unlikely, to say the least, that the plaintiff would have
                    chosen to become a shareholder. (In so saying, I am not unaware that in
                    exceptional circumstances, it might be that a creditor would want to gain
                    control of a debtor company to bring it to even keel. Nor have I forgotten that
                    the plaintiff could extricate itself by exercise of the put options.) The notes
                    of evidence suggest that it is possible that Chan was confused when she gave the
                    answer (under cross-examination that the plaintiff never intended to convert the
                    loan into shares unless the Borrower went into default):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your conversion of the loan was never intended ...
                            that was never intended to be the case?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Only if he cannot pay us our 3
                        million?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So therefore this whole thing about convertible
                            bond is a sham, isn’t it? It was never intended for it to be what
                            it is.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No, it was intended for it to be what it is,
                            because after the first year or whichever event that happens earlier,
                                <b><em>we are allowed to basically convert the loan and
                                then we sell it back to him for the 3 million</em></b>.
                            So there was a provision there for that purpose, and <b><em>we don’t really have to convert it into shares into
                                his company</em></b>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You just said that the purpose of converting, if
                            there was a default?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Through the shares of the company. But at one year
                            I can convert the loan for payment of the 3 million.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We know all that. It was not to convert. It’s
                            to sell to Alvin. It’s not a convert. To sell either the shares
                            converted or to sell the loan, or half.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It’s not a convert ... at the end of one year

                            loan that was given. It’s no conversion at that stage. If you have
                            converted into shares, you will sell it to Alvin, which he must buy, at
                            the end of one year. If it is not converted into shares, you sell the
                            loan amount itself.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So how can it be a sham, because it’s stated

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, there is no need for conjecture. Even assuming that the CBA
                    was drafted by the plaintiff’s lawyer to forestall any allegation that the
                    loan was a moneylending transaction, we would still need to examine the facts to
                    see whether, shorn of the convertibility feature, the transaction indeed
                    breached the MLA 1985.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In this regard, it must be remembered that the
                    objective of the MLA 1985 is not to prohibit legitimate commercial transactions
                    as emphasised in the decision of <em>City Hardware Pte Ltd v
                        Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 733 at [47]
                        (“<em>City Hardware</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defence of moneylending is often invoked in Singapore by unmeritorious
                        defendants who are desperate to stave off their financial woes. Such
                        defendants should not regard the MLA as a legal panacea. It should be viewed
                        as a scheme of social legislation designed to regulate rapacious and
                        predatory conduct by unscrupulous unlicensed moneylenders. Its pro-consumer
                        protection ethos was never intended to impede legitimate commercial
                        intercourse or to sterilise the flow of money. It is not meant to curtail
                        the legitimate financial activity of commercial entities that are capable of
                        making considered business decisions. The court has always taken and will
                        continue to take a pragmatic approach in assessing situations when this
                        defence is raised. The MLA is not invariably contravened in transactions
                        where the object of the transaction is to raise money. In the final
                        analysis, the economic objective of an arrangement to provide credit should
                        not be confused with its legal nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In any event, given that the plaintiff had
                    indisputably made only one loan, there was insufficient evidence adduced by the
                    defendants to establish a “system and continuity” which one would
                    expect to see in the alleged moneylending business (see <em>Ang
                        Eng Thong v Lee Kiam Hong</em> [1998] SGHC 64 at [21];
                        <em>Mak Chik Lun v Loh Kim Her</em> [2003]
                    4 SLR(R) 338 at [11]; and <em>Agus Anwar v Orion Oil
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 6). Neither is there sufficient
                    evidence, from the mere fact of a one-time loan, to find that the plaintiff was
                    ready and willing to lend money to “all and sundry” (see <em>Litchfield v Dreyfus</em> [1906] 1 KB 584 at 589).
                    That said, there is <em>nothing in principle</em> to
                    prevent a court from finding that even a one-time loan could constitute a
                    moneylending business if there was sufficient evidence to support such a
                    finding. A single loan is sufficient to give rise to a <em>rebuttable</em> presumption that the lender is a <em>moneylender</em> under s 3 of the MLA 1985. Ultimately, whether a
                    person is a moneylender and whether there exists a moneylending business are
                    questions of fact: see <em>City Hardware</em> (<a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [24]. The arrangements involved must be
                    considered in totality to determine the substance of the transaction: see
                        <em>City Hardware</em> at [24] and <em>Nissho Iwai International (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kohinoor Impex Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 170 at [13]. On an overall view,
                    taking into account all the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that there
                    was a genuine commercial purpose for which the CBA was entered into. The
                    defendants’ contention is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendants made a further submission. They
                    argued that the sum of $3m (claimed by the plaintiff as interest) was
                    “exorbitant”. That can be readily dismissed. The plaintiff’s
                    claim for the sum of $3m as “interest” was founded upon cl 18 of
                    the CBA which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon termination of this Agreement by the Lender as aforesaid <b><em>prior to the exercise of any Option</em></b> by the Lender,
                        the Loan and all amounts and <b><em>any other sums then
                            payable</em></b> under this Agreement shall, notwithstanding anything
                        to the contrary contained in this Agreement, become immediately due and
                        payable to the Lender, together with interest on the Loan of S$3,000,000.
                        [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Clause 18 allowed for any sums
                        “<em>then</em>” payable under the CBA
                        “<em>prior to the exercise of any
                        option</em>” to be immediately due and payable. Since the
                    return based on 10% of the selling price was contingent upon the exercise of the
                    second option under cl 12(a), the plaintiff would not be entitled to the return
                    if the CBA was terminated prior to the exercise of the second option. In the
                    circumstances, the “interest” of $3m was effectively, and in
                    substance, in lieu of the estimated return on the investment that the plaintiff
                    could have obtained if it had exercised the Second Option at the TOP stage.
                    In this regard, cl 18 is in substance an express provision for the
                    plaintiff’s expectation losses, that is, what the plaintiff would have
                    obtained if the defendants performed their obligations under the CBA up to the
                    TOP stage. The second defendant could not complain about the exorbitant interest
                    as it was he who offered a 100% return on the investment based on his optimistic
                    projected profits from the sale of the Shelford units. His affidavit recounted
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.    ... It was at [the] meeting [in March 2007] that
                            it was discussed and agreed that a loan of $3 million would be given ...
                            and that in return for the loan of $3 million, the lender would be paid
                            another $3 million. ... all parties were also aware that the projection
                            of the potential receipts for the sale of the property <em>were based on the bullish market in the early half of
                                2007</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    Angelena and Kelvin Chia were also aware that the
                            1st Defendant was projecting the sale at $1,400.00 psf based on land and
                            development cost[s] of approximately $700 psf. <em>The
                                potential profit was at that time projected to be $700 psf x 40,000
                                sq ft of saleable space, [which] would have netted $28 million
                                in profit[s]</em>. Based on this calculation, the 20% that
                            would have been collected upon launch [of the Shelford units] would have
                            been $11.2 million ...</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The termination of the CBA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Following the first defendant’s failure
                    to repay the principal sum of $3m 12 months from the first drawdown date, the
                    plaintiff had the right to terminate the CBA under cl 17(a). Curiously, the
                    plaintiff failed to use cl 17(a) as an independent ground in its
                    termination letter dated 10 May 2008, relying instead on cl 17(g). In any
                    event, I find that the plaintiff was entitled to terminate the CBA under cl
                    17(g). There was more than sufficient evidence to provide the plaintiff
                    reasonable grounds for belief that the defendants were unable to make repayment
                    of the principal sum of $3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The plaintiff had, on 2 April 2008,
                    effectively given notice of its intention to demand the return of the principal
                    sum when the plaintiff reminded the second defendant to make repayment of the
                    principal sum by 2 May 2008. In response thereto, the defendants made the
                        <em>material admission</em> that the first defendant
                    would not be able to repay the principal sum of $3m by 2 May 2008. It was
                    admitted in the defence that:</p>

                            able to repay the principal sum of $3 million by 2 May 2008.
                            ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     There were also admissions in the defence to
                    the effect that the second defendant did not have the funds to repay the

                    to make repayment of the principal sum after a three-month extension was an
                    empty one as the second defendant had admitted that he had no money for
