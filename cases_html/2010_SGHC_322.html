<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant (“the Wife”) and the
                    respondent (“the Husband”) were married on 15 May 2001. An
                    interim judgment was granted on 20 August 2008 in divorce proceedings
                    initiated by the Husband. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearings in
                    Chambers on 30 October 2009, District Judge Sowaran Singh (“the
                    District Judge”) ordered, among other things, that (i) the two children
                    of the family should be held in joint custody, (ii) the Husband should have care
                    and control of the children with access to the Wife on certain terms, and (iii)
                    the Wife should transfer her rights, title and interest in the parties’
                    matrimonial flat to the Husband with the Wife to be paid $14,000 with money from
                    the Husband’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account. The
                    Wife appealed to this court under Order 55C (“O 55C”) of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of
                    Court”) in respect of these aspects of the District Judge’s
                    decision. A stay of execution was ordered in respect of the District
                    Judge’s judgment by Deputy Registrar Regina Ow-Chang Yee Lin on
                    13 January 2010. From the initiation of the divorce up to these
                    proceedings, the parties continued to live together with their two children at
                    the matrimonial flat. At the time of the hearing of this appeal, the
                    parties’ daughter is seven years old, while their son is four years
                    old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Under Notice of Appeal (Amendment No. 1), the
                    Wife sought (i) care and control of the two children, (ii) sole discretion in
                    determining issues relating to the education and choice of schools of the two
                    children, and (iii) an order of sale of the matrimonial flat with her being
                    entitled to 40% of the net proceeds of sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the first hearing of the appeal on
                    14 April 2010, the Wife was represented by a new counsel, Ms Grace
                    Malathy (“Ms Malathy”). Ms Malathy sought an adjournment
                    as she had not obtained all the documents she needed and had not prepared or
                    served the Record of Appeal and her written submissions. I granted an
                    adjournment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By the second hearing of the appeal on
                    28 June 2010, the Wife had filed an application on 15 June 2010 under
                    Summons 9958 of 2010 for leave to adduce fresh affidavit evidence. I allowed the
                    application partially. I will say more later about this
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The hearing of the main appeal then proceeded
                    but in the course of Ms Malathy’s submission, she asked for leave to
                    file an affidavit to state the Wife’s parenting plan if she was given care
                    and control of the two children. This was in response to an inquiry from me on
                    the same. I granted an adjournment for the Wife to file a further affidavit
                    on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     her parenting
                    plan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     any
                        maintenance she might be seeking for the children if she was granted care
                        and control; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the study courses she had attended were on a part-time or full-time
                        basis as this was disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I also allowed the Husband to
                    file an affidavit in reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appeal was next fixed for hearing on
                    30 July 2010. After perusing the affidavits filed I required information
                    about the daily routine of the children to be provided by the parties. I also
                    decided to interview the parents and the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The interview was conducted on 2 August
                    2010. By then some information on the daily routine of the children was
                    provided. Thereafter, the appeal was adjourned to a special date to be fixed for
                    counsel to complete their submissions, including submissions on an alternative
                    basis i.e. if the respective party did not achieve his or her primary
                    objective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the final hearing of the appeal on
                    17 September 2010, Ms Malathy applied to amend the Notice of Appeal to
                    include prayers for (i) monthly maintenance for the children in the event the
                    Wife was granted care and control of the children, and (ii) increased access to
                    the children in the event she was not granted such care and control. The
                    Husband’s counsel, Mr Mahendra S Segeram
                    (“Mr Segeram”) objected on the basis that this was a late
                    stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On the facts, it was clear that the Wife wished
                    to seek maintenance for the children if she was granted care and control. I had
                    also indicated to parties at the hearing on 2 August 2010 that I would like
                    to hear their submissions on an alternative basis. For these reasons, I allowed
                    the Wife to amend her Notice of Appeal to reflect these new
                prayers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I now come back to summons 9958 of 2010 which
                    was an application for leave to introduce fresh affidavit evidence. I add that
                    at the hearing on 17 September 2010, Ms Malathy also made an oral
                    application seeking leave to file yet another further affidavit to exhibit a new
                    letter of employment and to state when the Wife was able to return home each day
                    after work. I will address the issue of new evidence before addressing the
                    substantive issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Leave to adduce fresh evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summons 9958 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In Summons 9958 of 2010, the Wife prayed for
                    leave to adduce the following pieces of additional evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     A medical report for the Wife
                        prepared by one Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim”) (a
                        psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital) dated 24 January
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Photographs
                        of the parties’ son with bruising/redness on his
                    body.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Photographs
                        of a diaper with staples stapled into it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     A printout of the “Frequently Asked
                        Questions” (“FAQ”) section of the Singapore Institute
                        of Management website indicating general information on course
                        schedules.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     A
                        photocopy of part of the Wife’s cheque book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Court’s power to admit fresh
                    evidence at an appeal is generally controlled by the rule in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> (1954) 1 WLR 1489 (“<em>Ladd v Marshall</em>”) as applied by the Singapore
                    courts. In <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>, Denning LJ (as he then
                    was) stated the three-part rule at 1491:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…To justify the reception of fresh evidence… three
                        conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the evidence
                        could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
                        secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have
                        an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be
                        decisive; thirdly, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be
                        believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need
                        not be incontrovertible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hodson LJ (as he then was) agreed, and at 1492 referred to what was
                    then O 58 r 4 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court, which
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal shall have... full discretionary power to receive
                        further evidence upon questions of fact... Upon appeals from a judgment
                        after trial or hearing of any cause or matter upon the merits, such further
                        evidence (save as to matters subsequent...) shall be admitted on special
                        grounds only, and not without special leave of the Court. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, the Singapore Court of Appeal
                    qualified the operation of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> in the
                    context of registrar’s appeals in the case of <em>Lian Soon
                        Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 1053 (“<em>Lian Soon
                        Construction</em>”). There M Karthigesu JA,
                    delivering the grounds of judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at
                    [37]-[38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37     The position on evidence on
                        appeals from summary judgment is found in <em>The Supreme
                            Court Practice 1999</em> at para 14/4/45:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<em>The evidence on an appeal to the Judge in
                                    Chambers should ordinarily be the same as it was before the
                                    Master or District Judge; but since such an appeal is dealt with
                                    by way of an actual rehearing of the application which led to
                                    the order under appeal, and the Judge treats the matter afresh
                                    as though it came before him for the first time, save that the
                                    party appealing has the right as well as the obligation to open
                                    the appeal, it would seem that the judge in his discretion is
                                    free to admit fresh evidence, and he frequently does so in the
                                    absence of special reasons (see Evans v Bartlam
                                    [1937] AC 473 at 480; Krakauer v Katz [1954]
                                    1 WLR 278; [1954] 1 All ER 244,
                                CA)</em>.    </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">On the other hand, the Court of Appeal does not have an unfettered
                            discretion to receive further evidence on hearing an appeal against a
                            summary judgment in favour of a plaintiff in proceedings under O 14 or O
                            86 and it might do so only on 'special grounds' as provided by O 59 r
                            10(2) within the limits laid down, per Denning LJ in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pinsler, in <em>Singapore Court Practice
                            1999</em>, agrees that this distinction should be drawn. The
                        rationale behind the different thresholds employed in allowing evidence
                        before a judge in chambers as compared to the Court of Appeal may be
                        understood from an extract from <em>The Supreme Court
                            Practice 1999</em>, at para 58/1/3:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">An appeal from the Master or District Judge to the Judge in Chambers
                            is dealt with by way of an actual rehearing of the application which led
                            to the order under appeal, and the Judge treats the matter as though it
                            came before him for the first time, save that the party appealing, even
                            though the original application was not by him but against him, has the
                            right as well as the obligation to open the appeal. The Judge "will of
                            course give the weight it deserves to the previous decision of the
                            Master; but he is in no way bound by it" (<em>per</em> Lord Atkin in <em>Evans v
                                Bartlam</em> [1937] AC 473 at 478). The Judge in
                            Chambers is in no way fettered by the previous exercise of the Master's
                            discretion, and on appeal from the Judge in Chambers, the Court of
                            Appeal will treat the substantial discretion as that of the Judge, and
                            not of the Master (<em>Evans v Bartlam</em>, above;

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An appeal to the Court of Appeal also operates by way of a rehearing.
                        Although it does not mean that witnesses are heard afresh, the court
                        considers the whole of the evidence given below and the whole course of the
                        trial. It is, as a rule, a rehearing on the documents of the evidence. The
                        powers of the Court of Appeal are principally statutory, but supplemented
                        where necessary by its inherent jurisdiction as a superior court of record.
                        With regard to the adduction of fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal, O
                        57 r 13(2) specifically states that "in the case of an appeal from judgment
                        after trial or hearing of any cause or matter on the merits" further
                        evidence is not to be admitted "except on special grounds". ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38     ... A judge in chambers who hears an

                        confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge's discretion is in no way fettered by
                        the decision below, and he is free to allow the admission of fresh evidence

<p class="Judg-1">The court in <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> then
                    distinguished <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> from the case
                    of <em>Hua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 901, in which the
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> criteria were
                applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     To answer the question of whether an appeal
                    from a District Judge in Chambers to a Judge in Chambers should fall into the
                    rule governing Registrar’s Appeals in <em>Lian Soon
                        Construction</em>, I took guidance from Karthigesu JA’s
                    reasoning. He noted that Registrar’s Appeals (today governed by O 56
                    of the Rules of Court) were not governed by an equivalent of O 57
                    r 13(2) of the Rules of Court. This rule prescribes “special
                    grounds” for the admission of further evidence before the Court of Appeal
                    where the procedure below was a trial or hearing on the merits. I similarly
                    observed that O 55C of the Rules of Court, which governs appeals from
                    District Judges in Chambers to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers, does not
                    contain an equivalent of O 55D r 11(1) of the Rules of Court which
                    prescribes “special grounds” for the admission of further evidence
                    in an appeal from the <em>Subordinate Courts</em> to the
                        <em>High Court</em> after a trial or hearing on the
                    merits. O 55D r 1 specifically provides that O 55D does not apply
                    to appeals from District Judges in Chambers to a High Court Judge in Chambers.
                    In addition to reasoning from the Rules of Court, I also noted the English Court
                    of Appeal case of <em>G (formerly P) v P (Ancillary Relief:
                        Appeal)</em> [1977] 1 WLR 1376. That case involved an appeal
                    from an order of a registrar in ancillary matters proceedings for a husband to
                    pay his former wife maintenance and for a division of property. The Court of
                    Appeal found (at 1379-1380) that in appeals to a judge in chambers under both
                    r 124 of the English Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977 and O 58 r 1
                    of the English Rules of Supreme Court 1965 (both of which are similar to our O
                    55C), the practice was for the judge to treat the appeal as a first instance
                    hearing which included the freedom to admit fresh evidence. This finding was
                    cited with approval by the House of Lords in <em>Barder v
                        Caluori</em> [1988] AC 20 at 39. For these reasons I found
                    that for this case, an appeal from a District Judge in Chambers to a High Court
                    Judge in Chambers, I was not required to find special grounds (as described in
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>) to allow fresh evidence to be
                    adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Husband objected to the admission of all
                    the proposed pieces of evidence based on the case of <em>Lassiter
                        Ann Masters v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 392 (“<em>Lassiter</em>”).
                    This was a case concerning an appeal to a Judge in Chambers from a
                    Registrar’s assessment of damages. Chao Hick Tin JA, delivering the
                    judgment of the Court of Appeal, specifically distinguished that case from
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of course <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> did not
                        concern an appeal from an assessment of damages by the Registrar to the
                        judge in chambers and thus the case is not strictly determinative of the
                        present issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ultimately, in the specific context of an appeal from a
                    Registrar’s assessment of damages, the court in <em>Lassiter</em> decided that the second and third criteria from
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> would apply, but not the first
                    (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above). This decision sought to
                    strike a balance between (i) the expediency of empowering Registrars to conduct
                    assessments of damages, including the examination of witnesses, and (ii) the
                    recognition, made in <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> and
                    other cases, that an appeal from a Registrar to a Judge in Chambers is treated
                    as a fresh hearing at first instance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was in this context that Chao JA made a
                    qualifying statement at [24] of <em>Lassiter</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]e are far from suggesting that a party should be free to bring
                        in fresh evidence as he pleases. … Reasonable conditions must be set.
                        … Sufficiently strong reasons must be shown why the new evidence was
                        not adduced as the assessment before the Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Segeram relied on this statement in the context of the present
                    case. However, as I have discussed, Chao JA’s statement was made in the
                    context of an appeal from a Registrar’s assessment of damages, which falls
                    under the control of the second and third <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> requirements. Fresh evidence in appeals from such
                    procedures is treated more strictly because parties would normally have had
                    sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence before the Registrar. In contrast, the
                    present facts fall under the less restrictive regime described in <em>Lian Soon Construction</em>. Mr Segeram’s citation
                    of <em>Lassiter</em> was therefore not on
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the case of <em>WBG Network
                        (S) Pte Ltd v Sunny Daisy Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1133
                        (“<em>WBG Network</em>”) the Court of
                    Appeal elaborated on its position in <em>Lassiter</em>.
                    Choo Han Teck J gave the Court’s reasoning at [13]-[14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13     <em>Lassiter</em>
                        thus recognised a distinction between the standard to be applied in appeals
                        where there had been the characteristics of a full trial or where oral
                        evidence had been recorded (for example, in proceedings of inquiries or, as
                        in <em>Lassiter</em>, in an assessment of damages) and
                        those that were interlocutory in nature. As a result, one might not
                        unreasonably conclude that there is a distinction between the standard to be
                        applied for the adducing of fresh evidence in cases which are similar on the
                        facts with <em>Lassiter</em> (for example, in
                        assessments of damages or inquiries), in which the second and third
                        conditions of <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> should strictly
                        apply and those which are similar to <em>Lian Soon
                            Construction</em> (for example, interlocutory matters), in which
                        the court would be allowed to exercise its discretion more liberally. The
                        existence of a wider discretion in the latter situation however, does not
                        mean that <em>Ladd v Marshall cannot</em> apply in such
                        circumstances. Instead, the existence of such wider discretion would mean
                        that it would be left to the court hearing any particular matter to decide
                        whether the facts justified the application of <em>Ladd v
                            Marshall</em> (and if so, to what extent).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14     A party wishing to adduce further evidence
                        before the judge in chambers in cases where the hearing at first instance
                        did not possess the characteristics of a trial might still have to persuade
                        the judge hearing the matter that he had overcome all three requirements of
                            <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> if he were to entertain
                        any hope of admitting the further evidence because the judge was <em>entitled</em>, though not <em>obliged</em>, to employ the conditions of <em>Ladd
                            v Marshall</em> to help her decide whether or not to exercise her
                        discretion to admit or reject the further evidence. In such a case, if the
                        appellant could not persuade the judge that the conditions, if applied,
                        would result in his favour, then it would be unlikely that the judge would
                        allow his application to adduce the fresh evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the facts, I was of the opinion that the
                    medical report prepared by Dr Lim could reasonably have been obtained and
                    adduced at an earlier stage of the proceedings, referring to the first condition
                    of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test. However, applying
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction</em>, this did not prevent
                    me from admitting the report. Following the case of <em>WBG
                        Network</em>, although the second and third <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> criteria were not strictly applicable, I took reference
                    from them as follows: the Wife’s mental health was in issue from an early
                    stage in the ancillary matters hearings below; the report was therefore
                    potentially of great importance in this case, meeting the second criterion.
                    Dr Lim’s credentials as a psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital were
                    also not in dispute, meeting the third criterion of credibility. For these
                    reasons, I permitted the medical report to be adduced in evidence. I add that
                    Mr Segeram did not then apply to have the Wife’s mental condition
                    assessed by a psychiatrist of the Husband’s choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, concerning the other pieces of
                    evidence I came to a different ruling. The two sets of photographs (see
                        <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>(b) and (c) above) lacked sufficient
                    context and thus did not prove anything of significant relevance to the appeal.
                    Similarly, the FAQ from the Singapore Institute of Management did not address
                    the Wife’s specific degree, but rather covered courses at the university
                    in a very general way. This did not have enough probative value. Finally, the
                    Wife submitted that the photocopy of her chequebook would prove a certain
                    payment for the matrimonial flat was made by her rather than the Husband.
                    However, this evidence and submission gave an incomplete and misleading picture
                    of the payment situation in the light of contrary evidence provided in the
                    Husband’s affidavits. As such I found that the photocopy of the
                    Wife’s chequebook lacked credibility. For the reasons stated I did not
                    permit the Wife to adduce any piece of fresh evidence under Summons 9958/2010
                    other than Dr Lim’s medical report.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Oral application on 17 September 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As intimated above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>, Ms Malathy made an oral application on
                    17 September 2010 for leave to adduce in evidence a letter of employment
                    dated 29 July 2010 from the Wife’s new employer and the time when she
                    would be able to return home each day after work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     This evidence could certainly have been
                    adduced earlier rather than only on 17 September 2010. However, as stated
                    above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>, this did not preclude me from
                    admitting it. The Wife’s present working hours were a relevant factor in
                    this case. In addition, no issue was raised as to the authenticity of this
                    evidence. However, Mr Segeram objected that this evidence was only the
                    latest of the Wife’s many changes of position, some of which were in
                    response to the Husband’s assertions. This presented him with a moving
                    target, making it difficult for him to submit effectively. Although I had some
                    sympathy with the objections, in light of the relevance of the additional
                    information I permitted the same to be adduced in evidence by way of a fresh
                    affidavit to be filed and served by 5.00pm on 20 September
                2010.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The parties’ daughter was born on 4 February 2003, while
                    their son was born on 25 December 2005. After the birth of the younger
                    child the Wife was a homemaker until late 2007, when she obtained employment as
                    a secretary. From that time to the present day she has been in full-time
                    employment with intermittent breaks in between employers as well as holding
                    additional part-time work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Husband’s evidence was that he
                    served as the family’s sole breadwinner throughout the period when the
                    Wife was not in employment. The Wife showed evidence that she had sought an
                    order of maintenance under s 69 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    1997 Rev Ed) against the Husband, with an order by consent signed by
                    District Judge Edgar Foo on 27 December 2007. Under that order, the Husband
                    agreed to pay monthly maintenance of $450 to the Wife plus “all other
                    reasonable outgoings and expenses, including children, maid and
                    household” (MO [xxx]/2007). The Wife’s evidence was that before
                    this order she was single-handedly paying the expenses of the children’s
                    upkeep for almost a year. In his Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, the Husband
                    averred that the application for maintenance was unfounded and that he had been
                    all along doing everything stated in the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In an affidavit filed in support of a Summons
                    for variation of the District Judge’s order (Summons [xxx] of 2010), the
                    Wife’s evidence was that she served as the primary caregiver for the
                    children even as she attended courses from 2003 to 2005. She went on to perform
                    this role full-time between 2005 and 2007 including making herself available to
                    breastfeed her son until he was 1½ years old in mid-2007. She described
                    herself as a “stay-home mum” who cared for the children day and
                    night, taking care of them during illness, tutoring them and transporting them
                    to and from school or nursery. The Wife’s affidavit further stated that
                    she had continued as the children’s primary caregiver up to the date of
                    deposition (31 March 2010), feeding them, supervising their education and
                    giving piano lessons to her daughter. The Wife provided evidence at the hearing
                    below that the children slept with her nightly. Ms Malathy’s
                    submission stated that this was still the case at the time of the appeal, though
                    there was no recent evidence given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Husband’s evidence contended that
                    the Wife was a full-time student between 2003 and 2005. Mr Segeram
                    submitted that based on this fact, the Wife was not in a position to be the
                    primary caregiver during that period. Concerning the present childcare
                    arrangements, Mr Segeram submitted that the children were in school or
                    childcare for most of the day, and at other times either the Husband or his
                    employed domestic helper would care for them. The Husband did not deny that the
                    children continued to sleep with the Wife. The Husband contended that as of July
                    2010 the Wife was at work from 8.30am to around 9.00pm, including her
                    commitments in part time work. From her latest letter of employment dated
                    29 July 2010, the Wife stated that her new job allows her to accompany her
                    younger child to kindergarten at about 7.50am each day before going to work at
                    about 8.15am. After work she takes the company transport to reach home by
                    6.00pm. In an earlier affidavit filed on 12 July 2010, she indicated that
                    she was working as a part-time financial consultant on a commission basis. In
                    submissions filed for the Wife on 7 May 2010, she described herself as a
                    “property agent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The parties also raised evidence on a few more
                    general matters relating to care and control. Regarding the parents’
                    respective discipline methods, the Husband pointed to the Social Welfare Report
                    dated 25 August 2009 submitted at the trial below. The Child Welfare
                    Officer preparing the report regarded the Wife’s disciplinary methods as
                    “harsh”, including the use of objects like a belt, a bamboo tube
                    and toys to discipline them. Red marks were also reportedly visible on the
                    children for a few days after she punished them. The report recommended that the
                    Wife attend counselling to learn more appropriate disciplinary methods. The
                    District Judge relied heavily on the report, which included other matters.
                    Ms Malathy submitted that there were extenuating circumstances to explain
                    the Wife’s harsher disciplinary actions, such as an incident where her
                    daughter shook free of her grip and dashed across a road. In any event, in the
                    Wife’s evidence under Summons [xxx] of 2010 she denied having struck the
                    children except with her bare palms. The Wife indicated that she was willing to
                    attend workshops and receive counselling on parenting issues. The
                    Husband’s evidence stated that he would occasionally discipline the
                    children by spanking them with his hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Husband mentioned that he was able to call
                    upon his sisters-in-law and a domestic helper to assist with childcare. The Wife
                    initially stated that her mother would be able to come to Singapore and care for
                    the children while she was at work. However, it later emerged in the
                    Wife’s affidavit filed on 12 July 2010 that her mother was not
                    presently in Singapore and had no right to remain here, although the Wife was in
                    the process of applying for a 5-year dependent pass to allow her to live in
                    Singapore temporarily. If her mother is not available to help long-term, the
                    Wife stated that her alternative was to have the children put in professional
                    childcare or be cared for by a domestic helper while she was at
                work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The parties gave conflicting evidence
                    concerning the Wife’s mental health, which was a major issue. The Husband
                    stated that on 28 February 2007 the Wife threatened to commit suicide with
                    their two children. The context of this threat was not provided in his
                    affidavits; however, in the Husband’s Statement of Particulars it was
                    stated that the incident happened after the family was returning from a cruise
                    holiday. After a long wait for a taxi, there was an argument between him and the
                    Wife. Upon returning home, the Wife made the alleged threat. The Wife’s
                    Defence added that the parties slapped each other in the taxi during the
                    argument and stated that the Wife stated a wish to commit suicide, but did not
                    mention the children. The Husband’s position was that the Wife’s
                    mental health should count against her on the issue of care and control.
                    Singapore Police Force records show that the Wife was arrested on
                    28 February 2007 and given a stern warning on 30 April 2007 for
                    attempting suicide. A report by one Dr Goh Yen-Li of the Institute of
                    Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 3 November 2008 indicates that
                    the Wife was referred to their care on 1 March 2007 and diagnosed with
                    reactive depression, stating that “the main stressor was marital conflict
                    with her husband. She felt entrapped in an unhappy marriage.” According
                    to this report, she was not given medication or admitted as a stay-in patient
                    but she defaulted from follow-up appointments from that time until
                    2 November 2007. She was seen at IMH as an outpatient until 9 January
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> the Wife successfully applied to adduce a medical report by
                    Dr Lim dated 24 January 2010. Dr Lim elaborated on Dr Goh
                    Yen-Li’s diagnosis of reactive depression, saying:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term “Reactive” qualifying the diagnosis of Depression
                        is critical in that it has unequivocally related the cause of Depression to
                        external stressful events which the report did mention as “marital
                        conflict with her husband and felt entrapped in an unhappy
                        marriage.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What seem [<em>sic</em>] certain from the IMH report
                        was that the patients [<em>sic</em>] did <b>not</b> suffer a major psychiatric disorder such as
                        “PSYCHOSIS”. It is also implied that Reactive Depression is
                        usually temporary in its manifestation and with the resolution of the
                        etiology which in this case is the “unhappy marriage,” the
                        mental impairment would resolve.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Lim had conducted a mental state examination on the Wife on
                    1 December 2009 and stated his opinion as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on my evaluation of her mental condition, I am of the opinion that
                        she does not suffer from any psychiatric impairment that would be
                        contra-indicated in her responsibility to care for her children. All the
                        psychological tests administered did not suggest any evidence of mental
                        disability or disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This medical report also mentioned that at some point during her IMH
                    follow-up appointments the Wife was prescribed antidepressants but she did not
                    comply with her prescription due to the side-effects of the medication.
                    Nevertheless, Dr Lim concluded that the Wife did not need any form of
                    psychiatric follow-up as of the time of the report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Husband also relied on the fact that the
                    Wife has a previous criminal conviction. In submission, his evidence was used in
                    connection with the Wife’s mental stability generally rather than with any
                    issue about her moral character. On 9 December 2007 the Wife left a
                    department store with unpurchased items. She was convicted of theft in dwelling
                    under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 225, 1985 Rev Ed) and
                    sentenced to a fine of $400. The Wife’s explanation was that the day
                    before the incident she had received news that her brother in China was
                    critically ill. While she was at the department store, she received a call and,
                    fearing bad news, rushed out without realising she had unpurchased items with
                    her. She said she later pleaded guilty without realising the consequences of
                    doing so. Mr Segeram’s submission pointed to inconsistencies in the
                    Wife’s various explanations of this incident and suggested that her
                    account was untruthful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Husband alleged that the Wife had
                    threatened to remove the children from Singapore and bring them with her to
                    China. On her part the Wife stated her belief that the children would be better
                    brought up in Singapore and that their citizenship would be for them to decide
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Husband also mentioned that as a Singapore
                    PR, the Wife was not eligible to apply for public housing without a family unit.
                    He suggested that the Wife was seeking care and control of the children only for
                    the purpose of facilitating her obtaining of public housing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Wife’s evidence was that if granted
                    care and control she intended to buy or rent a 3-room flat in the Jurong West
                    area for herself and her children. She gave evidence that her sister was willing
                    to give her about $45,000 in financial assistance to help pay for the down
                    payment for a flat if necessary, or for any other similar need.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Wife asserted that the Husband was
                    indifferent to their children’s education and, unlike her, did not take
                    pains to ensure that they entered good schools. As an illustration, the Wife
                    indicated that she had wanted to use an alternative address near the primary
                    school of her preference to increase their daughter’s chance of being
                    admitted into that school. Their daughter is now studying in primary school
                    while their son is about to enter primary school. This was among the reasons the
                    Wife sought sole custody at the hearing below, although in this appeal she
                    limited herself to seeking an order for her to have sole discretion in the
                    children’s education and choice of school (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Effect of decision of a District Judge in Chambers on appeal to a
                Judge in Chambers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Segeram cited the Court of Appeal case
                    of <em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 690 (“<em>CX v CY</em>”)
                    as authority suggesting that in child welfare cases as in all others, an
                    appellate court should be slow to overturn an exercise of discretion by the
                    judge below. In that case Lai Siu Chiu J said at [17]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...We must stress that an appeal should not automatically succeed simply
                        because the appellate court preferred a solution which the judge had not
                        chosen. In other words, similar to the principles that apply to general
                        appellate intervention, the appellate court should only reverse or vary a
                        decision made by the judge below if it was exercised on wrong principles, or
                        if the decision was plainly wrong, as would be the case if the judge has
                        exercised his discretion wrongly. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>
                    above, I noted the Court of Appeal’s finding in <em>Lian
                        Soon Construction</em> that a Judge in Chambers hearing a
                    Registrar’s Appeal is free to admit fresh evidence without special
                    grounds. Karthigesu JA stated the rationale for this at [37] of that case which
                    I have set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     
          <em>CX v CY</em> was an
                    appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of a Judge in Chambers. From my
                    reading, I find that <em>CX v CY</em> as cited by
                    Mr Segeram is part of a line of authority stating that the Court of Appeal
                    will not readily interfere with the exercise of discretion of a judge. Based on
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction</em>, this is not applicable
                    to Registrar’s Appeals as such appeals are treated as hearings at first
                    instance before a Judge in Chambers unfettered by the decision below. As I have
                    found above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>, an application of
                        <em>Lian Soon Construction</em> and interpretation of
                    the Rules of Court show that appeals from a District Judge in Chambers to a High
                    Court Judge in Chambers are not subject to special rules for the adducing of
                    fresh evidence. From the material cited above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, the reason for this is that such appeals are treated as
                    first instance hearings in the same manner as Registrar’s Appeals.
                    Following from this, the rule cited by Mr Segeram in <em>CX
                        v CY</em> is similarly inapplicable to such appeals and to the present
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The High Court decision of <em>Louis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 402 (“<em>Louis Pius
                    Gilbert</em>”) states a contrary view. In that case the High Court
                    Judge in Chambers hearing an appeal from a District Judge in Chambers took the
                    view (at [15]) that sitting as an appeal court, he “should not not
                    interfere with the decision of a court of first instance unless it is so far out
                    of line as to be perverse, or unless the lower court has clearly gone wrong on
                    principle.” This statement was in turn taken verbatim from <em>Soh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock</em> [1998] SGHC 204
                        (“<em>Soh Chan Soon</em>”) at [4] per
                    Warren Khoo L H J. However, unlike <em>Louis Pius
                        Gilbert</em>, that appeal was from a District Court to a High Court
                    (not a Judge in Chambers) under Order 55D of the Rules of Court and not
                    O 55C. Such appeals are <em>not</em> treated as fresh
                    first instance hearings. I therefore distinguish the present case from <em>Soh Chan Soon</em> and I decline to apply <em>Louis Pius Gilbert</em> on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any event, I find that there are sufficient
                    grounds for me to depart from the District Judge’s decision. This is
                    partly based on the evidence before this court that was not available at
                    proceedings below, which I will elaborate on in my findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on custody</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In <em>CX v CY</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal firmly endorsed the view that joint custody should be the norm
                    in custody orders. Quoting Lai Siu Chiu J at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would emphasise that recent decisions have been inclined towards making
                        joint or no custody orders due to the need to ensure that the child becomes
                        attached to both parents. The idea behind joint or no custody orders is to
                        ensure that neither parent has a better right over the child and that both
                        have a responsibility to bring the child up in the best way possible.
                        Similarly, the child has a right to the guidance of both his parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In light of this principle, I do not think the
                    Wife should be granted sole discretion on the children’s educational
                    matters and choice of schools. I see no reason to exclude the Husband from
                    participating in those decisions. The Wife strikes me as a stubborn and
                    determined individual, willing to go to great lengths to pursue what is best in
                    her own opinion. Her willingness to rely on a false address to register her
                    daughter for primary school (<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) and
                    her flexibility with the truth before this court (noted below at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>) gives me the impression that she is
                    accustomed to doing as she pleases without much sense of restraint. The
                    Husband’s views should apply to act as a balance. In any event the
                    Husband, as the father, should have his say.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the reasons stated I find the children
                    should be held in joint custody by both parties without
                qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on care and control </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The District Judge granted care and control to
                    the Husband based on two factors: (i) the harshness of the Wife’s
                    disciplinary methods and (ii) concerns that the Wife’s mental health made
                    her an unsuitable caregiver. He recommended that both parties attend the
                    Parenting Workshop organised by the Family Courts to improve their parenting
                    skills. The District Judge also allowed the issue of care and control to be
                    reviewed after six months, but this was unnecessary as there was a stay on his
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Generally speaking, a mother’s bond with
                    young children is stronger than that of a father’s. This was described by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che
                        Chye</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 (“<em>Soon Peck Wah</em>”) at [45] per Yong Pung How CJ:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All other things being equal, a very important factor to bear in mind was
                        that we were dealing with an extremely young infant. We felt that the
                        maternal bond between the appellant and the infant was a pivotal
                        consideration here. The bond between the natural mother and her child is one
                        of the most unexplainable wonders of human nature. It should never be taken
                        for granted or slighted. We have all heard of the story of the mother who
                        fought a tiger with her bare hands to save her child from the ferocious
                        beast. Such is the love and sacrifice of the maternal instinct. Since the
                        beginning of civilisation to this age of consumer materialism, the mother's
                        love for her child remains just as strong and unchanging. This court would
                        be doing a disservice to justice and humanity if it turned a blind eye to
                        the most fundamental bond of mankind - between a mother and her child, by
                        taking the child away from the mother. ...It is only a natural conclusion
                        that, by reason of his very tender, young age, the infant would be most
                        dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. In the
                        best interest of the child's welfare, we should not deprive him of his
                        mother's love and care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Soon Peck Wah</em>, the child in question
                    was four years old. The parties’ son in this case is also four years old,
                    with the daughter being seven years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I understand from the parties that the current
                    childcare arrangement involves some division of responsibility between both
                    parents. However, I accept the Wife’s evidence that she had been the
                    primary caregiver for the children from the start of the marriage to the time of
                    these proceedings even though I accept the Husband’s assertion that when
                    the Wife was attending study courses she did so as a full-time student. I find
                    that the Wife prepares many of the children’s meals, helps them with
                    schoolwork and takes them out for leisure and enrichment activities. As for the
                    evidence that her latest full-time job allows her to return home to her children
                    at around 6.00pm, I am not unaware that her part-time work (such as financial
                    consultancy or property agency work) may cause her to return later on occasion.
                    I note that the children continue to sleep with the Wife even after the divorce
                    proceedings had been initiated. This suggests that separating the children from
                    the Wife would be more traumatic and disruptive for them than separating them
                    from the Husband. I also note that the Wife has carried out her primary
                    caregiving role since the District Judge’s decision on 30 October
                    2009 without repeating any threat of suicide, which is significant as her mental
                    health was a major issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I now address the issue of mental health,
                    which was the main issue at the hearing below. It was not in dispute that the
                    Wife did threaten to commit suicide at least once. The District Judge below made
                    the finding that she had done so at least three times. In coming to this
                    conclusion the District Judge relied on the confidential Social Welfare Report.
                    In light of this reliance, I will say that in the report the Welfare Officer
                    received information that the Wife had threatened suicide on three separate
                    occasions from the Husband himself. In my view, even if the Wife had threatened
                    only once to commit suicide alone, that would already be a factor against the
                    granting of care and control to her. It follows that if she had threatened to
                    commit suicide more than once and/or threatened the children as well that would
                    be even more troubling. I accept that it is likely that she did threaten to
                    commit suicide more than once, and at one time, her threat included the
                    children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     However, having regard to the report by
                    Dr Lim, I do not think her mental health is so precarious as to swing the
                    issue of care and control in favour of the Husband. As quoted above (at
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), Dr Lim’s report stated
                    that even at the time of her initial diagnosis at IMH it was implied that the
                    Wife’s reactive depression was temporary and would be resolved by the
                    resolution of her marriage. Very importantly, Dr Lim examined the Wife on
                    1 December 2009 and stated that in his opinion she did not suffer from any
                    psychiatric impairment that would inhibit her from caring for her children. He
                    also said she did not require any psychiatric follow-up at the
                moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I was guided by the Court of Appeal’s
                    decision in <em>Soon Peck Wah</em> (cited above at
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>). In that case, the judge at the
                    first <em>inter partes</em> hearing did not grant the
                    mother interim custody, care and control of the child in part because she was
                    suffering from post-natal depression coupled with thyrotoxicosis, conditions
                    which caused her to be emotionally unstable; she had frequent outbursts,
                    initiated arguments and on one occasion threatened to use a knife against the
                    father’s family if he failed to return the child to her (<em>Soon Peck Wah</em> at [13](a)). About a year and a half
                    later, the mother applied to the same judge for variation on the basis of a
                    change of circumstances, namely that her medical reports showed that her
                    depression and thyrotoxicosis had been successfully treated, with the symptoms
                    of the latter reduced to “mild hand fine tremors and mild
                    tachycardia” (at [14]). The judge refused to grant variation partly on
                    the basis that the mother’s thyrotoxicosis was controlled by medication
                    rather than being cured altogether (at [17]). The Court of Appeal disagreed with
                    this finding, and found that the favourable reports of both her doctors showed
                    that her conditions had been successfully treated notwithstanding that she was
                    still on follow-up medication (at [38] and [40]). Partly on this basis (at
                    [42]), the Court was willing to grant her interim custody, care and control. On
                    the present facts, the Wife has also produced a medical report by Dr Lim
                    declaring that she has no mental disorder. In fact, Dr Lim opined that the
                    Wife does not require medication or follow-up in relation to her condition
                    unlike the mother in <em>Soon Peck Wah</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I also found the case of <em>Cheok Wah Jin v Guo Xiao Ying (m.w.)</em> [2003] SGDC 72
                        (“<em>Cheok Wah Jin</em>”) persuasive. In
                    that case, the mother was diagnosed with acute psychosis and was treated at IMH
                    between 16 August 1997 and 31 October 1997. Subsequently, she was
                    examined by a doctor on 7 and 11 March 2002 and pronounced to be free of
                    psychotic features, having made a satisfactory recovery. District Judge Koh Juat
                    Jong “saw no reason to doubt the assessment of the doctor” (at
                    [40]) and on the basis of the doctor’s report found the mother capable of
                    taking care of the children. I note that in <em>Cheok Wah
                        Jin</em>, despite the father’s allegation, District Judge Koh
                    did not find that the mother had actually attempted suicide. In contrast, the
                    Wife’s attempted suicide in this case is on the public record. Another
                    difference is that the mother in the <em>Cheok Wah Jin</em>
                    case had a history of psychosis, while the Wife in this case was diagnosed by
                    IMH as having reactive depression. However, like the mother in <em>Cheok Wah Jin</em>, the Wife was medically examined by a
                    doctor and was not assessed to have any mental disorder. In both <em>Cheok Wah Jin</em> and on the present facts, the patients
                    were assessed not to require further treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I accept Dr Lim’s psychiatric
                    assessment of the Wife. Based on all the evidence I am of the view that the
                    Wife’s present mental health does not prevent her from caring for the
                    children well. This is supported by her conduct in childcare from 2007 to the
                    present proceedings, during which time she did not threaten suicide or threaten
                    to harm the children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Concerning the Wife’s theft conviction,
                    I find it hard to believe the Wife’s explanation that the circumstances
                    she mentioned caused her to take unpurchased items and then to plead guilty to
                    committing theft. I think that she was not being forthcoming with the court, a
                    fact that does not reflect well on her at this appeal notwithstanding that her
                    offence was a one-time incident. The Husband also argued against her explanation
                    that the incident was triggered by stressful circumstances. However, as I do not
                    find that the Wife’s acts were triggered by the particular incident she
                    mentioned, I do not find the episode indicative of any instability on her part,
                    though her character is called into question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On the other general childcare issues, I find
                    based on the Social Welfare Report that the Wife’s methods of discipline
                    are somewhat harsher than the Husband’s. In fairness, the Husband also
                    disciplines the children by spanking them with his hands; but I am of the view
                    that the Wife is more ready to resort to harsher methods. Nevertheless, this
                    difference did not weigh heavily in my decision even when considered together
                    with allegations about her mental condition. I note from his Grounds of Decision
                    that the District Judge ordered both parents to attend a Parenting Workshop to
                    improve their parenting skills. It will be in the interest of the children that
                    the parties build up their parenting abilities regardless of whether they have
                    care and control or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In terms of care-giving arrangements, the Wife
                    holds both full-time and part-time work (whether in one or two part-time
                    occupations is not clear). In her submissions, she stated that her job afforded
                    her more flexibility to care for the children compared to the Husband, who is
                    self-employed. However, I note that as of 12 July 2010, her proposal is to
                    rely on childcare and/or a domestic helper to care for the children for most of
                    the hours of the day. As such I find that her suggested care arrangements are
                    basically similar to the Husband’s, who also proposes to engage a domestic
                    helper to care for the children. Both parties also propose to rely on extended
                    family for help: the Husband on his sisters-in-law and the Wife on her mother.
                    However, the Wife indicated that her mother currently has no right of permanent
                    residence in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Husband asserted that the Wife had
                    threatened to permanently remove the children from Singapore to China. I presume
                    he was also suggesting that granting care and control to the Wife would somehow
                    facilitate the children’s removal. Parties are reminded that if either of
                    them attempts to subvert any order granted by the court it will result in
                    adverse consequences for that party. I do not think that the risk that the Wife
                    might remove the children from the jurisdiction is a weighty factor against
                    granting care and control to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Husband also argued that the Wife was
                    seeking care and control only to facilitate an application for public housing.
                    This point was based on the Wife’s evidence in affidavits filed for the
                    ancillary matters hearing below, wherein she sought the transfer of the whole of
                    the matrimonial flat into her sole name. The Wife did not pursue title to the
                    matrimonial flat in this appeal. While a grant of care and control to the Wife
                    might allow her access to certain housing arrangements that she might not
                    otherwise have had, I find that this does not of itself suggest that she is
                    seeking care and control for a collateral purpose at the expense of the
                    children’s welfare.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On the whole, I find the Husband to be a
                    person of better character and more integrity than the Wife. As noted in this
                    judgment, the Wife proved herself dishonest in the course of these proceedings
                    in some ways. However, in spite of all this the children seem closer to their
                    mother than to their father (although this is not to say that they are not also
                    close to their father).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It seems the present childcare arrangement
                    involves some role for both parents and frequent contact between the children
                    and parents. I attempted to persuade the parties to continue the current living
                    arrangements with joint care and control granted to both, but the Husband found
                    the idea of continuing to live under the same roof as the Wife intolerable. This
                    being the case, for the reasons noted above and in consideration of all the
                    evidence I find it in the best interest of the parties’ two children that
                    the Wife be granted care and control. However, the Husband should be granted
                    liberal access, the details of which I will discuss below. Regarding the
                    Wife’s intended childcare arrangements, in my opinion childcare may not
                    suffice for the children’s needs in light of the Wife’s possibly
                    long working hours (in both full-time and part-time work). A domestic helper
                    would seem to provide a more sustainable solution; but ultimately the Wife is to
                    make the decision as the person with care and control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings on access</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Segeram submitted that in the event
                    that the Husband did not get care and control, he seeks the following
                    access:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     weekday access on Monday,
                        Wednesday and Friday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     in the event that he cannot accommodate the
                        children overnight, weekend access every Sunday from 9.00am to
                        8.00pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     in the
                        event that he can accommodate the children overnight, weekend access in a
                        two-week cycle from 6.00pm on Friday to 8.00pm on Saturday on one week and
                        from 9.00am on Saturday to 9.00am on Sunday for the other
                    week;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     access for

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_e"></a>(e)     access on every public holiday from 9.00am to 2.00pm,
                        except for every first day of the Chinese New Year, during which access
                        should be from 9.00am to 8.00pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Based on the fact that
                    the children are close to the Husband and that they are used to him playing an
                    active part in caring for them, I grant the Husband liberal access on the
                    following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     weekday access on Monday, Wednesday

                        to 8.00pm on Saturday if he can. This is simpler than alternating weekend
                        access and will allow the Wife to take the children to church on
                        Sundays;</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial flat</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual background </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The parties’ matrimonial flat is a
                    5-room Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat in Jurong. It
                    was purchased in their joint names for $186,900 with ownership passing to them
                    on 1 October 2003. This was about two and a half years into their marriage. The
                    estimated gross value of the flat as of 20 October 2008 was about $370,000
                    and the outstanding mortgage loan was $135,591.51, giving an estimated net value
                    of $238,955 (although these figures will have changed since that time). It was
                    undisputed that by the time of this appeal the Husband had paid approximately
                    $115,000 in direct financial contributions to the acquisition of the flat,
                    including payments towards the mortgage by cash or from his Central Provident
                    Fund (“CPF”) account as well as the price of renovation and
                    fittings. However, the Wife added that she had paid the sum of $8,000 towards
                    renovations, a fact the Husband disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The parties’ evidence diverged more in
                    the area of indirect contributions to the household. The Wife stated that she
                    was a “full-time housewife and mum and undertook studies on a part-time
                    basis” from the beginning of the marriage to around September 2007, when
                    the family engaged a domestic helper. She indicated that during this period the
                    Husband was engaged in full-time employment and only assisted with household
                    tasks when she was attending classes or studying for exams. As part of her role
                    she claimed to have done marketing, cooking and cleaning in the household. As
                    part of her argument on indirect contribution, the Wife also claimed to have put
                    her career on hold to take care of the household. Contrary to the Wife’s
                    account, the Husband stated that it was he who did all household marketing,
                    cleaning and cooking. He denied that the Wife could have made a large indirect
                    contribution to the household as she was engaged in full-time education for four
                    or five years of the marriage and was also twice pregnant. He also contested the
                    Wife’s claim to have sacrificed her career for the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Husband stated in evidence that he had
                    paid substantial amounts of money to finance the Wife’s education.
                    Furthermore, he said that he transferred about $51,000 to the Wife to be
                    remitted to her family in China in August 2005 to purchase a house there.
                    Regarding this particular payment, the Husband provided in evidence two
                    completed contracts for the sale of the Husband’s shares dated 1 and 2
                    August 2005 respectively, two bank books showing withdrawals from two of his
                    accounts on 10 August 2005 and finally two statements from a remittance agency,
                    Hanshan Money Express, showing the Husband’s remittances to one [A] in
                    Heilongjiang, PRC and [ACU] in Tianjin, PRC dated 25 July and 10 August 2005
                    respectively. The Husband stated that in total, including the abovementioned
                    education fees and remittances, he had paid about $104,000 to the Wife or for
                    her expenses during the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Wife’s evidence contradicted this,
                    stating that she paid $20,000 for her own studies with the Husband contributing
                    only about a third of her expenses. The Wife did not address the issue of the
                    remittance in her submissions for this appeal, but in the hearing below she said
                    that the remittance to her family in China was funded entirely with her own
                    money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Generally, the Husband claimed that the Wife
                    had withheld a true account of her means and assets from the court, for instance
                    only providing bank account statements for selected time periods. In addition
                    the Husband pointed to a large unexplained withdrawal of $27,000 from her POSB
                    savings account on 12 September 2007, which was the day after her
                    application for a maintenance order (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Under s 112(2) of the Women's Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed), many issues can be considered by the court in
                    exercising its discretion to divide matrimonial assets. Among the statutory
                    factors that I considered were the parties’ direct financial
                    contributions, their indirect contributions to the welfare of the household, any
                    (material or non-material) support given by one party to the other and the needs
                    of children of the marriage. Based on an estimated gross value of $370,000, the
                    net value of the matrimonial flat as at 20 October 2008 was roughly $238,955.
                    Assuming the same monthly mortgage payment rate and accounting for interest, the
                    net value as of October 2010 is roughly $243,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Concerning direct financial contribution
                    towards the matrimonial flat, the Wife’s claim to have paid $8,000 towards
                    home renovations was not supported by evidence. As such I do not find that she
                    had made this contribution. In contrast, the Husband was able to provide
                    receipts from the renovation contractors substantiating his payment of various
                    sums. The parties did not dispute that all mortgage payments were paid by the
                    Husband either by way of cash or by CPF contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On the question of indirect contribution, I
                    find that the Wife was not a full-time homemaker for the whole of the marriage
                    before September 2007. Although I did not accept the Husband’s submission
                    that the Wife was continually studying for four or five years of their
                    seven-year marriage, I believe that at least from 2003-2005 she was
                    substantially engaged in studying. During that time she was not making a
                    full-time contribution to the welfare of the household. I also find that the
                    Wife had not sacrificed her career for the sake of the household, contrary to
                    Ms Malathy’s submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I agree with the District Judge below in his
                    finding that the Wife had received substantial monetary benefit from the
                    marriage, including the financing of her education and the remittance of a sum
                    of money to her family in China to purchase a house. I regard the Wife’s
                    evidence that she had financed this remittance herself as convincingly disproven
                    by the Husband’s documentary evidence (as stated at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above). Although the Husband estimated his
                    total transfers of money to the Wife as being in the realm of $104,000, the
                    District Judge below appeared to accept that his evidence established only that
                    $60,000 had been transferred to the Wife’s family in China of which she
                    had repaid him $9,000. From the evidence provided by the Husband, I also find
                    there is no sufficient basis for making a finding that there were substantial
                    transfers to the Wife other than those for her education and the $60,000 of
                    remittances he made to China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I took note of the Husband’s evidence
                    that the Wife had withdrawn the sum of $27,000 from her POSB savings account on
                    12 September 2007, which was the day after she made an application for a
                    maintenance order against the Husband. This was raised as an issue at the
                    hearing below but appears not to have been considered by the District Judge. The
                    Wife has had sufficient opportunity to address this evidence, but she did not do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Ms Malathy cited the case of <em>Lee Nyuk Lian v Lim Nia Yong</em> [2007] 2
                    SLR(R) 905 (“<em>Lee Nyuk Lian</em>”) as
                    relevant to the facts of this appeal. In that case Sundaresh Menon JC granted
                    the wife 40% of the value of the matrimonial properties on the basis of her
                    indirect contributions. However, that case involved facts very different from
                    the present case. In <em>Lee Nyuk Lian</em>, the parties
                    were married for 15 years, during which time the wife was the primary caregiver
                    to the children and the home. She also assisted the husband in his business for
                    four years by doing administrative work. In contrast, in the present case the
                    Wife and the Husband were married for about seven years, out of which the Wife
                    was studying for some years. This means that her indirect contribution was less
                    than that of the wife in <em>Lee Nyuk Lian</em>. It is also
                    true that unlike that wife, who supported her husband’s business, the Wife
                    was the one who received substantial financial support and money from the
                    Husband during their marriage. She has also taken the sum of $27,000 as
                    mentioned above at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For the reasons stated above, I find that the
                    Wife’s claim for 40% of the value of the matrimonial flat should not be
                    granted. I find that that the Wife’s share of the matrimonial flat should
                    not be more than the $14,000 granted by the District Judge below. I asked the
                    Husband if he would nevertheless consider allowing the Wife to continue living
                    in the matrimonial flat with the children, but he said that his financial
                    situation dictated that he sell the same and move to a smaller flat. In light of
                    the circumstances, I find it appropriate to order the sale of the matrimonial
                    flat, with the Wife being paid the sum of $14,000 out of the net proceeds of
                    sale and the remainder being paid to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual background </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, the Wife sought a monthly maintenance payment from the
                    Husband for the children in the event she got care and control. In her earlier
                    affidavit filed on 12 July 2010, the Wife stated that her gross salary from her
                    full-time job was $2,400. She earned an additional sum of about $300 a month
                    from her part time work. She estimated that the children’s expenses would
                    be about $1,350 a month, while her own expenses were $800 per month. Finally,
                    her estimated monthly mortgage payments came up to $1,000, which could be paid
                    for through a combination of CPF moneys and cash. This gave a total income of
                    $2,700 and a total expenditure of $3,150 per month. In her latest letter of
                    employment dated 29 July 2010 (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above), her current gross salary as a full-time Operations Executive was given
                    as $2,275 but she did not ask for a higher maintenance from the Husband for the
                    children even though her full-time income fell from $2,400 to
                $2,275.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In his affidavit of assets and means filed on
                    2 December 2008 the Husband estimated his income from his own business to be
                    $2,229.17 monthly as of 2008. He assessed his monthly personal and household
                    expenses at that time to be $2,984.01. However, it was undisputed that at
                    present he is paying the salary, levy and medical expenses for a maid which
                    amount to $510 a month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Findings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I find it fair for the Husband to pay the Wife
                    $800 monthly in maintenance for the children. This roughly corresponds to the
                    Wife’s estimated fees for childcare or a domestic helper, which is an
                    expense that the Husband would save since he does not have care and control, a
                    point which his counsel did not dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     At <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>
                    above I mentioned that an order for maintenance (MO [xxx]/2007) had been made
                    against the Husband on 27 December 2007. I do not know if that order still
                    applies in the light of the orders made by the District Judge below in the
                    ancillary matters. If so, that order will be superseded by the order on
                    maintenance I have made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I note that the Wife did not ask for the usual
                    $1 per month nominal maintenance for herself to keep alive the option of
                    claiming maintenance for herself in the future, should circumstances warrant
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     For all the reasons stated above, I allow the
                    appeal in part. I summarise and elaborate on my decision as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     For the two children of the
                        parties’ marriage, both parties to have joint custody with care and
                        control to the Wife and liberal access to the Husband as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       weekday access on Monday,
                            Wednesday and Friday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       in the event that he cannot
                            accommodate the children overnight, weekend access every Saturday from
                            9.00am to 8.00pm; but in the event that he can accommodate the children
                            overnight, weekend access every week from 6.00pm on Friday to 8.00pm on
                            Saturday;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       access on alternate public holidays, except
                            Chinese New Year, from 9.00am to 2.00pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       access on Chinese New Year on an
                            alternate basis i.e. on the first day of Chinese New Year from 9.00am to
                            8.00pm in one year and in the next year on the second day of Chinese New
                            Year from 9.00am to 8.00pm; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_76-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       access for half of every school holiday with the
                            details to be agreed between the parties, failing which they are to make
                            an appointment to address me on this issue before the extraction of the
                            order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     The parties are to agree on arrangements for taking the children on
                        holidays overseas or to make an appointment to address me on this issue
                        before the extraction of the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Husband is to pay the Wife $800 monthly as
                        maintenance for their children with effect from the first day of the month
                        after she moves out from the matrimonial flat with the children and
                        thereafter on the first day of every month.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_d"></a>(d)     For the avoidance of doubt, no maintenance is to
                        be payable to the Wife for herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_e"></a>(e)     The matrimonial flat is to be sold in the open market
                        within six months from the date of the order with the cost and expense of
                        the sale being paid by the Husband and the proceeds of sale divided between
                        the parties with $14,000 to the Wife and the remainder to the Husband after
                        the outstanding loan is paid. The Husband is to have an option to purchase
                        the Wife’s interest in the matrimonial flat for
                    $14,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_f"></a>(f)     I also
                        allow both parties liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_g"></a>(g)     Both parties to bear their own
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     As decided by the District Judge below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     Both parties are to attend the
                        Parenting Workshop arranged by the Family Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both parties are to keep all other
                        assets in their own names.</p>
