However, even where a legitimate proprietary interest is shown, the court will ensure that the covenant in restraint of trade goes no further than what is necessary to protect the interest concerned (<span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [79]).

In that case, the defendant ex-employer brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff ex-employee for breach of a non-competition undertaking. The court found that the ex-employee had strong connections with the ex-employer’s customers (at [86]), and that given his knowledge and influence over them, he could have easily diverted business from the ex-employer to himself or his new employer (at [87]). The ex-employer therefore had a legitimate interest in protecting its trade connections by way of the non-competition undertaking from interference by the ex-employer post-resignation (at [87]). Although the nature of the relationship between the ex-employee and the ex-employer’s customers in <span class="font-italic">Itochu</span> appears to have borne a personal element (see [86] of <span class="font-italic">Itochu</span>) that does not appear to be present between the first defendant and the plaintiff’s clients and suppliers, I do not find that to be a relevant distinguishing factor.

However, there are evidently other departments to the plaintiff: for instance, Mr Ambrose’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief draws a distinction between the plaintiff’s sales team and its engineers.

</div> The plaintiff has not shown that the first defendant possessed influence over <span class="font-italic">all non</span>-sales employees to any significant degree. The plaintiff has also not shown that <span class="font-italic">all </span>of its employees were integral to its operations or difficult to replace.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Therefore, I find that the plaintiff has not shown that the Non-solicitation Obligation was reasonable as between the parties. It follows that the Non-solicitation Obligation is not valid or enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Turning to the Non-compete Obligation, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the period of restraint of one year is reasonable as an estimate of how long it would take for the plaintiff to rebuild its trade connection. However, the prohibition on any employment or engagement which “by the nature of the employment or engagement will be detrimental or may be perceived to be detrimental to the best interest of the Company” goes well beyond what is necessary to protect the plaintiff’s interest in maintaining its trade connection. I note that the breadth of “best interest of the Company” is qualified with the words “by reference to the Company’s Intellectual Property Rights, credibility, stature, profitability or business or put such Confidential Information and Confidential Materials at risk of exposure or unauthorized use”. However, “credibility, stature, profitability or business” are each still extremely broad; each of them ostensibly encompasses matters which do not relate to the plaintiff’s trade connection. To give just one example: say the first defendant joins a competitor in a non-sales capacity – for instance, as an engineer. He does not engage his prior knowledge relating to the plaintiff’s trade connection. The plaintiff and the competitor then compete in a tender for a project from a <span class="font-italic">new </span>client. The first defendant works on the tender in his capacity as an engineer, and the competitor wins the tender. In so doing, he affects the profitability and business of the plaintiff – in defiance of the prohibition of the Non-compete Obligation – but has not interfered with the plaintiff’s trade connection, in the sense of its existing client base. That the Non-compete Obligation extends beyond such a scenario to employment which may be <span class="font-italic">perceived</span> as detrimental only emphasises the point. I therefore find that the Non-compete Obligation was not reasonable as between the parties, and that it is not valid or enforceable either.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Severance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At this juncture, the issue of severance arises: can the Non-solicitation Obligation and the Non-compete Obligation be severed in such a way as to preserve some enforceable remnant? The plaintiff appears to have been content to rest its case on the enforceability of these obligations as they are and did not make any submissions on severance. Nonetheless, where a restraint of trade clause is found to be unreasonable, the court should still consider whether the doctrine of severance could apply so that the reasonable part of the clause can be upheld (<span class="font-italic">CLAAS Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng Boon Ching</span> [2010] 2 SLR 386 at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The prerequisites for severance are (<span class="font-italic">Lek Gwee Noi v Humming Flowers &amp; Gifts Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2014] 3 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Humming Flowers</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [155]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The unenforceable provision must be capable of being removed without adding to or modifying the wording of what remains with the remainder continuing to make grammatical sense.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The remaining contractual terms must continue to be supported by adequate consideration.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The severance must not change the fundamental character of the contract between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 For the Non-solicitation Obligation, the prohibition on soliciting “any employee” is not susceptible to the “blue pencil” test in any way. As for the Non-compete Obligation, the words “or may be perceived to be detrimental” are an obvious candidate for the “blue pencil” test, leaving the prohibition on employment “which would by the nature of the employment or engagement will be detrimental to the best interest of the Company”. However, as I have already noted at [42] above, this would still go well beyond what is necessary to protect the plaintiff’s interest in maintaining its trade connection. I should also note that the “notional severance” approach – whereby the court is entitled not just to delete the parties’ words but also to alter or even insert words – has not been accepted into Singapore law (see <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2012] 4 SLR 308 at [32]–[35] and <span class="font-italic">Humming Flowers</span> at [174]–[186]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I therefore find that the doctrine of severability does not apply to the Non-solicitation Obligation and the Non-compete Obligation. Thus, while these obligations protect legitimate proprietary interests, the unreasonableness of these obligations renders them unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first defendant’s alleged breaches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Given my analysis above, only the Confidentiality Obligation, the Non-conflict Obligation and cll 5 and 7 of the Conduct Guide remain to be considered. Therefore, I now turn to consider whether various instances of misconduct alleged against the first defendant have been made out, and whether these constitute breaches of the remaining contractual clauses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As alluded to above, there are two broad categories of alleged misconduct. The first category relates to the first defendant’s alleged involvement with the second defendant, encompassing the first defendant’s assistance in setting up the second defendant; the first defendant’s solicitation of the plaintiff’s employees; and the first defendant’s diversion of the plaintiff’s customers. The second category of alleged misconduct relates to other misdemeanours during the first defendant’s employment with the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first defendant’s activities concerning his side business, JMPL/Beesket; and the first defendant’s manipulation of records and payments relating to himself and other employees of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assistance in setting up the second defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I begin with the first defendant’s assistance in setting up the second defendant. The primary instance of alleged wrongdoing in this regard concerns the first defendant’s preparation and communication of business plans for setting up the second defendant. On 6 October 2017, the first defendant sent Mr Sng a document titled “Business Plan Proposal” accompanied by a spreadsheet setting out various figures and projections relating to the proposed business. The first defendant followed these up with emails on 17 October 2017, 16 November 2017 and 7 December 2017, elaborating on various aspects of the business plans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The first defendant does not deny that he prepared and sent the business plans to Mr Sng.

</div> The first defendant obliged with an expanded spreadsheet sent on 17 October 2017. The names which were provided were the names of the plaintiff’s employees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, the plans also contained details of the clients envisioned for the business. While these clients were not explicitly referred to by their names, and were instead given only abbreviations as well, they were sorted by their historical sales from the financial years between 2013 to 2017. Copious projections were also given as to the income which could be derived from these clients. A forensically recovered version of the plans, with full names attached to the clients rather than abbreviations, showed that these were the plaintiff’s clients as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In other words, this was no mere pie-in-the-sky proposal. The level of detail and specificity involved in the proposal undermines the plaintiff’s suggestion that he was simply writing whatever he felt like. If he was merely spinning a tale from thin air, the details given in the proposal would have been unnecessary, and indeed counterproductive. Anyone can paint a picture of a financially viable business plan by conjuring a fictitious successful team and positive figures. Such a portrait proves only the painter’s imagination and not his business acumen. The only way the proposal could have been meaningful in the least is if the details were backed up by reality – that is, if the plan involved an existing team with a proven client base and established incomes and expenditures. As the evidence showed, what the plan disclosed was the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s </span>team, with the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s </span>client base and the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff’s</span> incomes and expenditures. Information on all of these items falls comfortably within the restrictions of the Confidentiality Obligation, which prohibits the first defendant from revealing “any information concerning the products, organization, business, finances, transactions or affairs of the Company”. I find, therefore, that the preparation and communication of the business plans to Mr Sng was a breach of the first defendant’s Confidentiality Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further, the first defendant’s preparation and communication of business plans that explicitly contemplated the poaching of his colleagues and subordinates plainly disclosed a conflict of interest. I therefore find that the first defendant also thereby breached the Non-conflict Obligation, as set out in cl 10 of the Employment Letter and cll 2 and 3 of the Conduct Guide:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">Employment Letter cl 10</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">10.

</div>
</div> At this juncture, the first defendant, Ms Chua and Ms Tan were still employed by the plaintiff. Notwithstanding the fact that Ms Chua did not ultimately join the second defendant, it is plain that in actively assisting the second defendant’s solicitation of Ms Chua and Ms Tan, the first defendant breached the Non-conflict Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In respect of the remaining seven Former Employees, the plaintiff invites me to find that the first defendant had assisted the second defendant in soliciting them, by primarily making the following arguments: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, these seven Former Employees were all named within the business plans which the first defendant provided to Mr Sng. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, a number of them – namely, Mr Yeo, Mr Liau, Mr Lim and Ms Lee – had been providing assistance since January 2018 to the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the explanations which the defendants provided for how these Former Employees came to be hired by the second defendant were not believable: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The advertisements on the Jobstreet.com website which had supposedly led to the hiring of Ms Lee, Mr Kurniawan, Mr Lim and Mr Yeo had only been put up to obscure the fact that these individuals had been directly solicited; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Mr Samuel Tan had lied when he testified that he could not recall the supposed middleman who had referred Ms Woo, Mr Liau, Mr Tay and Ms Lee to the second defendant; in truth, the plaintiff submits, this middleman was the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Even if I were to take the plaintiff’s arguments at their highest, it is important to note that unlike with Ms Chua and Ms Tan, no direct documentary evidence was furnished by the plaintiff for the involvement of the first defendant in soliciting these remaining Former Employees. In the absence of such evidence, only circumstantial observations are left: for instance, that each of these remaining Former Employees had been named in the first defendant’s business plans. While, as I have found, the preparation and communication of those business plans constituted a contractual breach on the first defendant’s part, I find that the circumstantial observations made by the plaintiff do not suffice to discharge its burden of proof in demonstrating that the first defendant played a direct role thereafter in procuring the departure of these remaining Former Employees for the second defendant. In other words, I find only that the plaintiff breached his Non-conflict Obligation through assisting in the second defendant’s solicitation of Ms Chua and Ms Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The plaintiff’s case in breach of contract against the first defendant in relation to the solicitation of the Former Employees is therefore dealt with. However, it is convenient to consider, at this juncture, whether the seven Former Employees, apart from Ms Chua and Ms Tan, had been solicited to join the second defendant. It is the second defendant’s position that these seven individuals each approached the second defendant of their own accord. Mr Samuel Tan’s evidence was that in his previous employment with the plaintiff, he had made the acquaintance of each of these seven individuals, with the exception of Ms Lee.

These employees were listed in the business plans which the first defendant prepared. Moreover, a number of these Former Employees were providing assistance to the second defendant even before their departure from the first defendant, as I have already discussed. The majority of these Former Employees also joined the second defendant within mere days of their last day of employment with the plaintiff. In the circumstances, it appears likely that there was some form of connection between the second defendant and these employees prior to their respective dates of departure from the plaintiff. The question is whether it was the second defendant who initiated this connection, or whether, as is the second defendant’s case, it was the Former Employees themselves who approached it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In this regard, I do not find the second defendant’s explanations for how these seven Former Employees came to learn of openings in the second defendant to be believable. As I have alluded to, it is the plaintiff’s case that the Jobstreet.com advertisements were manufactured. I am of the view that this is likely to be true. Although the recruitment efforts of the second defendant had begun as early as January 2018, it was not until May 2018 that the Jobstreet.com advertisements were put online.

</div> It was the testimony of Mr Samuel Tan that in the interim, the second defendant had been relying on recruitment agencies. If that had indeed been the case, why did the second defendant turn to Jobstreet.com? The plaintiff points out that two days before the second defendant purchased an advertisement package from Jobstreet.com, the plaintiff’s solicitors had sent a cease-and-desist letter to the second defendant, citing the defendant’s efforts to solicit the plaintiff’s employees (though without further details) and demanding an end to such efforts.

It should also be noted that although the summary report provided by Jobstreet.com showed that around 500 job applicants had responded to the advertisements taken out by the second defendant,

In particular, one would have expected Mr Samuel Tan to bear some gratitude to the person who supposedly introduced four worthy applicants to him, making up a full 20% of the employees hired by the second defendant in 2018.

</div> Although I do not agree with the plaintiff that I should infer that this middleman was the first defendant, I am of the view that the evidence as to this supposed middleman is utterly unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Taking all of the evidence into account, I find that on a balance of probabilities, it is likely that the second defendant did solicit these seven Former Employees.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Diversion of customers and opportunities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The plaintiff also alleges that the first defendant provided assistance to the second defendant with the aim of diverting customers, opportunities and resources from the plaintiff. Although a litany of such diversions was set out in the pleadings, by the time of closing submissions, the plaintiff’s case had sharpened to focus on a select few of its customers. These were: Singapore Power (“SP”), Professional Testing Services (“PTS”), Leap Networks Pte Ltd (“Leap Networks”), Acoustic &amp; Lighting System Pte Ltd (“A&amp;L”), CWT Limited (“CWT”) and AT&amp;T Worldwide Telecommunications Singapore Pte Ltd (“AT&amp;T”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Singapore Power</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The plaintiff’s pleaded case against the first defendant in relation to SP was as follows. From April to May 2018, the first defendant, together with some of the Former Employees, compiled a list of equipment and services which the plaintiff had provided to SP, as well as projects undertaken by the plaintiff for SP. This list, referred to as the “SP Inventory List”, was disclosed to the second defendant. Through the use of the plaintiff’s confidential information therein, and through leveraging the knowledge of the plaintiff’s Former Employees, the first defendant assisted the second defendant in securing a number of projects from SP, in breach of his Non-conflict Obligation and Confidentiality Obligation. These projects are referred to as the “SCADA 227 Project”, the “OEM2 Project”, the “Remote Access Solution Project”, and the “Cisco ESA and SMA Servers Maintenance Project”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff also submitted that by much the same means, the first defendant assisted the second defendant in obtaining another project from SP in breach of his Non-conflict Obligation, namely the “SCADA 216 Project”. However, this claim was not set out in the plaintiff’s pleadings. I therefore do not allow this claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Returning to the plaintiff’s pleaded narrative, I note that it suffers from a number of flaws. First, as the second defendant points out, the plaintiff did not ultimately adduce any evidence to show that the first defendant had assisted with the compilation of the SP Inventory List.

The second defendant therefore approached Pulse Secure, who provided the second defendant with a quote in April 2018. Simultaneously, Pulse Secure provided the plaintiff’s Mr Yeo with an updated quote with higher prices than had previously been provided in February 2018. Mr Yeo, who was later to join the second defendant as well, did not question Pulse Secure about this increase in prices, and simply instructed his colleague to prepare the quote to SP using this updated quote.

</div> Once again, there is no further elaboration as to how the <span class="font-italic">first defendant </span>was specifically involved in diverting this opportunity to the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In other words, apart from the SCADA 227 and OEM2 projects, the plaintiff has not illustrated how the first defendant had <span class="font-italic">personally</span> played a role in using its confidential information and diverting its opportunities. After the second defendant pointed this out in its closing submissions, the plaintiff’s response was simply to argue that these diversions were but some of the conspiratorial acts committed in the conspiracy between the defendants to solicit the plaintiff’s employees and to leverage them to solicit the plaintiff’s customers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff’s allegations against the first defendant in relation to supposed breaches of contract to do with SP are therefore only that (a) he solicited the plaintiff’s Former Employees, and (b) he divulged confidential information concerning the SCADA 227 and OEM2 projects to the second defendant. I have already dealt with the former allegation, and in the absence of concrete evidence on the first defendant’s involvement thereafter, I do not think that the actions of the Former Employees may be imputed to him for the purposes of the plaintiff’s contractual claim. I therefore find only that the first defendant has breached the Confidentiality Obligation in relation to the SCADA 227 and OEM2 projects.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Professional Testing Services</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The second customer which the plaintiff claims the first defendant assisted the second defendant in procuring is PTS. In support of this allegation, the plaintiff points to the second defendant’s possession of two sets of key documents: the “PTS Inventory List”, which contained information on the equipment and services supplied by the plaintiff to PTS; and the “PTS Infrastructure Documents”, which comprised the plaintiff’s documentation on the infrastructure installed on PTS’ behalf. The plaintiff further notes that the second defendant admitted to utilising the PTS Inventory List to prepare its quotes to PTS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Once more, the issue with the plaintiff’s arguments is that it is not clear how any of the above constitutes a breach of the first defendant’s contractual obligations. It is not the plaintiff’s case that the first defendant had a direct hand in connecting the second defendant to PTS, or in conveying the key documents to the second defendant. Rather, the plaintiff’s case is pitched at a more general level: that the first defendant had solicited the Former Employees, who then went on to contact PTS and to disclose the plaintiff’s confidential information to the second defendant. Similar to its case in respect of SP, this aspect of the plaintiff’s pleaded claim against the first defendant for the diversion of customers is in truth a claim for the solicitation of employees. I have already dealt with the plaintiff’s claim in this regard. It suffices for me to note that the plaintiff’s claim in breach of contract concerning events surrounding PTS is not made out against the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Leap Networks Pte Ltd</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The third customer which the plaintiff claims the first defendant assisted the second defendant in procuring is Leap Networks. In this regard, the plaintiff provided clear documentation of the first defendant’s involvement. Leap Networks sought quotations for Cisco products from the second defendant in January and February 2018. The second defendant then turned to the first defendant and Mr Yeo, as it was not, at the time, a registered reseller of Cisco products, and had no access to the price list of Cisco products. The first defendant then prepared a set of quotations for the second defendant’s use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 At trial, the first defendant admitted that in doing so, he had been undertaking services for the second defendant. This was plainly a breach of the Non-conflict Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Acoustic and Lighting System Pte Ltd</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Similarly, it is equally plain that the first defendant had assisted the second defendant with procuring the business of A&amp;L. On 7 March 2018, A&amp;L sought a quotation for certain products from the second defendant. This was forwarded to the first defendant, who responded with the appropriate prices to be quoted.

The first defendant was kept updated when the second defendant sent CWT a quotation on 21 March 2018.

</div> Furthermore, the first defendant was listed in the second defendant’s records as the account manager for CWT on 9 April 2018, even before he had left the plaintiff. Each of these circumstances individually suggests the involvement of the first defendant in the business of the second defendant in breach of the Non-conflict Obligation; together, they paint a compelling picture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) AT&amp;T Worldwide Telecommunications Services Singapore Pte Ltd</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn to the final key customer that the plaintiff has identified, namely AT&amp;T. Once again, that the first defendant has breached the Non-Conflict Obligation is difficult to dispute. The plaintiff exhibited an email chain between 29 and 30 March 2018 between the first defendant and Mr Samuel Tan, where the first defendant responded substantively to the latter’s inquiries. This was plainly in breach of the Non-conflict Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 A far more substantive aspect of the plaintiff’s claim in this regard, however, has to do with what is referred to as the “IBM Sony Project”. This was a project undertaken by AT&amp;T as the main contractor, with the plaintiff as the sub-contractor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In January 2018, the IBM Sony Project was due for renewal. A proposal and quote for the renewal were prepared by an employee of one of the plaintiff’s affiliated companies and sent to the Global Accounts team, including the first defendant, who was at the time the team’s head. However, this quote – a yearly figure of US$930,000

</div> It should be noted, however, that this admission came in the face of a much more serious charge levelled by the plaintiff: that the first defendant had <span class="font-italic">intentionally</span> sabotaged the plaintiff’s renewal of the IBM-Sony Project, so that the second defendant would have the opportunity to step in and make a bid itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The key piece of evidence which the plaintiff brings to bear in this regard is a spreadsheet containing confidential information relating to the plaintiff’s work on the IBM-Sony Project, including the plaintiff’s cost for its work (the “Costing Spreadsheet”). According to its metadata, the Costing Spreadsheet was created on 5 February 2018. The plaintiff’s Yeo Choon Sheng admitted to having created it. Notably, it was discovered on Mr Samuel Tan’s laptop. Mr Samuel Tan could not provide an explanation for this and denied having seen the Costing Spreadsheet, but ultimately admitted that he must have received it.

It is true that the quick succession of these two egregious events seems to be an unlikely coincidence and calls for an explanation. Intentional sabotage, however, is a serious allegation demanding proof more substantial than the circumstantial evidence the plaintiff has offered. The plaintiff has not (a) shown that the first defendant was responsible for the conveyance of the Costing Spreadsheet to Mr Samuel Tan; or (b) pointed to any documentation attesting to a more nefarious intent behind the first defendant’s failure to submit the plaintiff’s quote. It follows that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proof in its ultimate case that the first defendant’s failure to submit the plaintiff’s quote was in service of the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) Other customers and opportunities</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As I have mentioned, the customers I have considered were the ones which the plaintiff focused on in its closing submissions.

</div> However, no reference was made to these entities in the plaintiff’s submissions. I take this to mean that the plaintiff has abandoned its claims in respect of these customers.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In summary, it is plain that in the weeks and months leading up to his departure from the plaintiff, the first defendant had been in constant contact with the second defendant, providing information and answering queries in relation to a number of the first defendant’s customers. The first defendant thereby breached the Non-conflict Obligation in respect of Leap Networks, A&amp;L, CWT, AT&amp;T, Fortinet and the Infocomm Leaders Golf competition. It is equally plain that in disclosing the plaintiff’s pricing strategy in relation to the SCADA 227 and OEM2 Projects, the first defendant breached the Confidentiality Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 What should also be noted is the <span class="font-italic">density</span> of the first defendant’s work for the second defendant. This is not a case where – for instance – a sales executive performs a one-off favour for a friend at a rival company. This is a case where such work was apparently <span class="font-italic">routinely</span> and <span class="font-italic">constantly</span> performed. Coupled with the first defendant’s preparation and communication of business plans for the second defendant, this suggests that the first defendant was much more deeply involved with the second defendant than he sought to portray on the stand.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Beesket</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I turn now to the second category of contractual breaches, namely those involving instances of misconduct from earlier in the first defendant’s tenure with the plaintiff, which do not relate to the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Chief amongst these is the first defendant’s running of his personal Beesket business while he was employed with the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the first defendant conducted business on behalf of Beesket during his working hours with the plaintiff, as evinced by various dated and timestamped emails. In addition, in one specific instance between 29 June 2015 to 3 July 2015, the first defendant arranged a “team-building activity” for the plaintiff’s employees, wherein the plaintiff’s employees were tasked with selling fruit juice for Beesket and preparing marketing materials for Beesket.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The first defendant responds that the plaintiff had known of his personal Beesket business since in or about June 2015, but had not raised any issue with him until the commencement of this suit.

</div> This, however, is neither here nor there. An employer’s knowledge of – and even implicit consent to – an employee’s activities outside of their work is very different from consent to such activities being performed during working hours, or to the resources of the employer being diverted for such activities.

</div> The implicit argument was that his mobilisation of the plaintiff’s employees did not interfere with his duties, but was instead in conformity with them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I reject this argument. There is no evidence that this supposed benefit to the plaintiff’s staff materialised. I also find that the first defendant never intended this supposed benefit in good faith.

</div> However, I do not find it necessary to make any pronouncement on the nature of the relationship between the first defendant and Ms Gwee in order for me to determine the plaintiff’s claims, save that – as I shall canvass below – it is apparent that the first defendant acted at various junctures with Ms Gwee’s interest firmly in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The first aspect of these wrongfully procured payments has to do with Ms Gwee’s sales commissions. The term used by the plaintiff in respect of these sales commissions was “On-Target Earnings”, or “OTE”. The OTE payable to a sales employee was based primarily on two components: the extent to which the employee met their target for purchase orders received from customers, and the extent to which the employee met their target for the value of invoices issued to customers. In respect of each primary component, if a sales employee did not reach 75% of their assigned target, they would not be entitled to the OTE attached to that component. Conversely, if they reached the 75% mark or beyond, they would be entitled to a correspondingly pro-rated 75% or more of the OTE attached to that component.

As the plaintiff’s then-Group Financial Controller, Michael Wong (“Mr Wong”), testified, the actual order fulfilled on a blanket purchase order might be lower than the face value of the order. Because of this, the approval of the CEO was needed to determine whether a blanket purchase order should be counted towards an employee’s purchase order component, and the weight that should be attributed thereto.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 On 11 May 2015, Mr Wong sent the first defendant an email setting out calculations for the OTE of four sales employees, including Ms Gwee. Ms Gwee’s purchase order target for that year was US$20,000,000. Mr Wong’s email contained two sets of figures for the purchase orders which Ms Gwee received: one which was inclusive of two blanket purchase orders (US$21,774,543), and another which excluded these orders (US$16,576,623). As for the sales invoice component, Ms Gwee was recorded as having issued US$13,048,378 of invoices, against her target of US$16,000,000.

</div> However, in the context of his contractual obligations, this argument is irrelevant. Clause 7 of the Conduct Guide sets out an obligation to honestly and accurately record and report information. I find that the first defendant’s truncation of Mr Wong’s 11 May 2015 email to paint a more favourable picture of Ms Gwee’s purchase order component amounted to a breach of this obligation. It is also plain that in so favouring Ms Gwee’s interests over his own duties to the plaintiff, the first defendant breached the Non-conflict Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The second aspect of the alleged wrongful payments to Ms Gwee has to do with reimbursements said to have been wrongfully made to her, for which the first defendant gave approval.

to 15 – which I shall refer to as Ms Gwee’s miscellaneous claims – have no ostensible link to the business of the plaintiff. The first defendant was not able to give any coherent account as to why he nonetheless approved these claims; his sole response, again, was that the CEO was the one who would finally approve the claims. In the absence of explanation, and in light of the first defendant’s admitted closeness with Ms Gwee, I find that it is more likely than not that in approving these claims, the first defendant intentionally favoured Ms Gwee’s interests over his own duties to the plaintiff, and so breached the Non-conflict Obligation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 As for the claims for overseas trips, the plaintiff’s case is that item 4 was in fact a trip taken by the first defendant and Ms Gwee together for the predominant purpose of meeting Ms Gwee’s father. In support of this, the plaintiff referred to messages between the first defendant and Ms Gwee, referring to Ms Gwee’s father’s birthday on 8 September. As acknowledged by the plaintiff, however, those same messages also referred to a meeting with one of the plaintiff’s customers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I find that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proof in showing that the claim for item 4 was wrongfully made and that the first defendant was therefore remiss in approving the claim. The mere fact that the messages between the first defendant and Ms Gwee referred more to the personal aspects of the trip and less to the business aspects is perhaps understandable, given their admitted closeness; it does not necessarily reflect a corresponding prioritisation of personal affairs over business on the trip itself. In the absence of more concrete proof that the first defendant and Ms Gwee did not tend to the business of the plaintiff to the customary level required for the plaintiff to authorise reimbursement, I am unable to find that the claim for item 4 was wrongfully made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Similarly, the claims for items 1, 2, 3 and 5 are asserted to have been incurred not for the purpose of Ms Gwee’s work duties for the plaintiff.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In May 2015, when calculating the amount of OTE – if any – due to Andrew Tan, Mr Wong noted that Mr Tan did not have a commission plan on record, and therefore took the targets for the Singapore office from September 2014 to March 2015 as the appropriate targets for Andrew Tan. However, in September 2015, the first defendant sent an unsigned commission plan to Mr Wong. Notably, whereas Andrew Tan’s performance from September 2014 to March 2015 would not have qualified him for OTE when measured against Mr Wong’s initial targets, the lower targets in the first defendant’s unsigned commission plan offered a much more favourable backdrop to Andrew Tan’s performance, and would allow Andrew Tan to meet the thresholds needed for the claiming of OTE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Mr Wong informed the first defendant that the discrepancy would have to be flagged to the CEO. However, when the first defendant sent the CEO the email seeking his approval for the payment of OTE, he did not raise this issue. He simply stated that Andrew Tan had attained “97.45% and 81.35% respectively on PO and Revenue”.

Much as with Ms Gwee, I find that in relation to Andrew Tan, the first defendant breached the Non-conflict Obligation, and his obligation under cl 7 of the Conduct Guide to keep honest and accurate records.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I therefore find that the first defendant breached the Non-conflict Obligation and cl 7 of the Conduct Guide through his manipulation of records in respect of the payment of OTE to Ms Gwee and to Andrew Tan, as well as through his approval of reimbursement for Ms Gwee’s miscellaneous claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As a final note, I observe that the plaintiff’s pleaded case in relation to this manipulation of records and payments was premised on a breach of cl 5 of the Conduct Guide as well. However, I do not see how that clause – which prohibits harassment and discrimination – is relevant in the least. Indeed, the plaintiff made no effort in its written submissions to further its pleaded case on cl 5 of the Conduct Guide. I find that cl 5 of the Conduct Guide was not breached by the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of implied duties of good faith and fidelity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I turn now to the plaintiff’s claim that the first defendant breached his implied duties of good faith and fidelity. It is well-established that there is an implied term that the employee will serve his employer with good faith and fidelity (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [193]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I am satisfied that each breach of the first defendant’s express contractual obligations as I have found above constitutes a breach of the first defendant’s implied duties of good faith and fidelity as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Conversely, where I have found that the plaintiff’s case as to breach of the first defendant’s express contractual obligations to be insufficient, it has been primarily for the reason that the plaintiff has been unable to prove the first defendant’s involvement. For that same reason, the plaintiff’s case as to breach of the first defendant’s implied duties of good faith and fidelity therefore fails. I make special mention of the plaintiff’s case in relation to the first defendant’s failure to submit the quote for the IBM-Sony Project (see [89]–[94] above). Although I accept that there was plainly a failure on the first defendant’s part, I do not find that it amounts to a breach of the first defendant’s implied duties of good faith and fidelity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of fiduciary duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The plaintiff also submits that there was in fact a fiduciary relationship between the first defendant and the plaintiff, owing to the first defendant’s seniority and the scope of his duties, and that the first defendant’s conduct amounted to a breach of the fiduciary duties he owed under this relationship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The test for whether such a fiduciary relationship arises in the context of an employment relationship is whether the employee has been placed in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer (<span class="font-italic">Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and others</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 1 SLR 163 at [273]). I find that, in the broadest of strokes, the first defendant was in precisely such a position. Although he was not a director, he was in a position of substantial seniority, reporting only to the CEO. His oversight of the day-to-day and sales operations of 3DN meant that he was in a position to act in his own interests at the expense of the interests of the plaintiff. There was therefore a fiduciary relationship between the first defendant and the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 However, the mere existence of a fiduciary relationship is not enough. As was noted in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab </span>at [273]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Once a fiduciary relationship is found on the facts, there is further inquiry on whether it is engaged on the matters relied on by the plaintiff. There is no wholesale importation of every kind of fiduciary duty into each case, as that disregards what exactly it is about the particular employee’s situation that makes him a fiduciary. Even if the facts do bear a fiduciary relationship, it must be examined, in the particular circumstances, what are the fiduciary duties that arise. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In other words, in order to succeed in a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must show that a defendant owed specific fiduciary duties arising out of particular circumstances, and that the defendant acted contrary to those duties: see <span class="font-italic">Clearlab </span>at [279]–[282]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I note that the plaintiff did not plead the contents of the fiduciary duties supposedly owed by the first defendant under this relationship. Its statement of claim merely pleads “fiduciary duty” as one of the various duties said to be owed by the first defendant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In my view, the failure of the plaintiff to plead the specific fiduciary duties owed by the plaintiff was fatal to its claim in this regard. In the absence of particulars on the specific duties and the circumstances giving rise to them, the first defendant is put at a disadvantage in marshalling his evidence and arguments. In such a scenario, the court should not venture to impute upon the first defendant, fiduciary duties against which the first defendant’s conduct is to be measured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I therefore dismiss the plaintiff’s claim in breach of fiduciary duty against the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fraudulent misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The plaintiff further claims that through his manipulation of records and payments (see [110]–[132] above), the first defendant is liable for fraudulent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The elements of fraudulent misrepresentation are as follows (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 363 at [238]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there must have been a representation of fact made by words or conduct.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the representation must have been made with the intention that it be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which included the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the plaintiff has acted upon the false statement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the plaintiff has suffered damage by doing so.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the representation must have been made with knowledge that it was false, either made wilfully or in the absence of any genuine belief that it was true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I find this claim to be made out in relation to the payment of OTE to Ms Gwee (see [112]–[117] above) and Andrew Tan (see [127]–[132] above). In those instances, it is plain that the first defendant had made representations of fact relating to Ms Gwee’s sales performance and Andrew Tan’s sales targets. OTE was paid to each of them based on these representations, which would otherwise not have been paid. It is also clear that the first defendant knew that his representations were untrue: his report of Ms Gwee’s sales figures had knowingly elided any mention that part of those figures comprised blanket purchase orders, while his report in relation to Andrew Tan deliberately presented as settled sales targets which had not in fact been approved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 I also find that the plaintiff has made out its case in fraudulent misrepresentation in relation to the first defendant’s approval of Ms Gwee’s miscellaneous claims (see [118]–[119] above). Given that the miscellaneous claims plainly had nothing to do with the business of the plaintiff, I find it more likely than not that the first defendant was aware that the claims were illegitimate. His implicit representation that those claims were in fact legitimate resulted in reimbursements to Ms Gwee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 However, the plaintiff has not made out its case in fraudulent misrepresentation in respect of the remainder of the reimbursement claims. As I have noted above, the plaintiff has not shown that those claims were illegitimate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Breach of confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I turn to consider the plaintiff’s claim in breach of confidence. The approach to breach of confidence claims was most recently set out in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1130 at [61]. The court is to consider whether the relevant information had the necessary quality of confidence about it, and if it was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Upon satisfaction of these prerequisites, an action for breach of confidence is presumed. This presumption can be displaced where the defendant proves that its conscience was unaffected (at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The information which the first defendant communicated to the second defendant included the voluminous details as to the plaintiff’s clients and financial information contained within the business plan he prepared (see [54] above), the plaintiff’s internal manuals (see [56]–[57] above) and the plaintiff’s pricing strategy on the SCADA 227 and OEM2 Projects (see [75] above). It is plain that this information bore the necessary quality of confidence. I am also satisfied that this information was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The first defendant made no attempt whatsoever to suggest that his conscience was unaffected. I therefore find that the first defendant has not displaced the presumption of an action for breach of confidence, and is so liable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The plaintiff’s closing submissions also appear to extend its claim in breach of confidence to the second defendant.

</div> is pleaded only in the section against the first defendant. This was reinforced in Mr Ambrose’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, which summarised the plaintiff’s claims as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37.  In summary, the Plaintiff’s claim against the 1st Defendant is for breach of his contractual obligations under the Employment Contract and breach of his Employee Duties owed to the Plaintiff by reason of the following:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">c.

Inducing the Plaintiff’s employees to breach their employment contracts with the Plaintiffs and accept employment with the 2nd Defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. Unlawful and/or lawful conspiracy in conspiring to injure the Plaintiff’s interests by diverting the Plaintiff’s customers, business and resources away from the Plaintiff and/or leveraging on the Plaintiff’s former employees and Confidential Material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 An amendment was made to the statement of claim on 21 May 2021 (by consent).

The 2nd Defendant received and came into possession of the Plaintiff’s Confidential/Proprietary Information, including those particularised above, that were wrongfully disclosed and misused the same for its own benefit and to the detriment of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I do not think that this late amendment was sufficient to put the second defendant on notice that a claim in breach of confidence was being brought against it. Having been appended to the existing section on breach of confidence – which, it bears repeating, was squarely under the header of “Claims against the 1st Defendant” – the natural interpretation of this paragraph was that this was not meant to ground a distinct claim against the second defendant in breach of confidence, but was rather a coda to the plaintiff’s existing case against the first defendant. In the circumstances, the plaintiff should not be allowed to extend its claim in breach of confidence to the second defendant now through its written submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inducement of breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I turn now to consider the plaintiff’s claims against both defendants, starting with the claim that the defendants induced the Former Employees to breach their contracts with the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The legal principles in this regard are well established.

In the particulars served pursuant to the second defendant’s request, the plaintiff specified that the obligations which had been breached were the Former Employees’ Non-compete Obligations and Confidentiality Obligations.

It follows that this aspect of the claim must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The plaintiff has also made copious submissions on supposed inducements of breach of contract in relation to matters other than those listed at [160] above – for instance, in relation to the Remote Access Solution Project (see [76]–[78] above) and to PTS (see [82] above). However, I do not think that these submissions have an adequate foundation in the pleadings. As may be seen in the extract of the statement of claim reproduced above, for the purposes of its claim in inducement of breach of contract, the plaintiff chose to repeat only a subset of its overall allegations. The natural understanding of this is that the plaintiff is only pursuing its claim in inducement of breach of contract in respect of that subset. The plaintiff should not be allowed to belatedly broaden the scope of its case through its written submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 What remains, then, is the plaintiff’s claim that the defendants had, in relation to the acts set out at [160] above, induced the Former Employees to breach their Confidentiality Obligations.

I shall therefore focus on the setting up of the second defendant’s business and website, the solicitation of Leap Networks and A&amp;L, and the disclosure of the SP Inventory List.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Setting up of the second defendant’s business and website</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Unfortunately, the plaintiff’s submissions did not make clear what exactly it was taking grievance with in relation to the assistance rendered by the first defendant, Mr Yeo, Mr Lim and Mr Liau in the setting up of the second defendant’s business and website, for the purposes of its claim in inducement of breach of contract. In the absence of such elaboration, I shall consider whether the feedback provided by these individuals as to the second defendant’s logo, name cards and website (see [56] above) indicates that the defendants had induced these Former Employees to breach their Confidentiality Obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 In examining the feedback highlighted by the plaintiff, it is plain that no confidential information was disclosed. The feedback centred on purely the colour of the second defendant’s name cards. No reference was made to any information belonging to the first defendant. I therefore do not consider there to have been a breach of the relevant Former Employees’ Confidentiality Obligations in this regard. It follows that the plaintiff’s claim for inducement of breach of contract is not made out in relation to the setting up of the second defendant’s business and website.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Solicitation of Leap Networks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I turn now to the solicitation of Leap Networks, in relation to which I have already found the first defendant liable for breach of his Non-conflict Obligation, based on clear documentary evidence (see [84]–[85] above).

His disclosure had also been prompted by Mr Samuel Tan, and it therefore has to be said the second defendant had procured Mr Yeo’s breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The sole remaining question is whether, in procuring Mr Yeo’s breach of contract, the second defendant was aware of the contract and intended for it to be breached. In dealing with Mr Yeo when he was in the employ of the plaintiff, the second defendant must surely have known that Mr Yeo was subject to an employment contract. That they might not have been aware of the precise terms of the employment contract – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the employment contract contained the Confidentiality Obligation – is immaterial: <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 (“<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment</span>”) at [17]. While there is no indication that the second defendant had intended the breach of the Confidentiality Obligation either as an end in itself or a means to an end (see <span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore </span>at [90], citing <span class="font-italic">OBG Ltd v Allan</span> [2008] 1 AC 1), it suffices for the element of intention that a defendant “is reckless as to the consequence of his actions in the sense of being indifferent whether or not a breach happens” (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment </span>at [18]). I find that the second defendant was reckless in this manner. The entire point of consulting Mr Yeo and the first defendant when faced with a request for a quote by Leap Networks was that the second defendant did not have access to Cisco’s prices. Mr Samuel Tan knew that this information was in the possession of the plaintiff – indeed, he acknowledged in cross-examination that it “belong[ed]” to the plaintiff

</div> I find that it is more likely than not that Ms Lee had in fact sent the SP Inventory List to Ms Foo. I therefore accept the factual narrative set out by the plaintiff in relation to the disclosure of the SP Inventory List.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I further find that Ms Lee’s disclosure of the SP Inventory List to Ms Foo constituted a breach of the confidentiality clause in her employment contract (which was slightly different from the corresponding clauses for the first defendant and Mr Yeo). The SP Inventory List was composited from information concerning equipment and services which the plaintiff had provided to SP, as well as projects that were undertaken by the plaintiff for SP. It was therefore “Confidential Information”, as defined in Ms Lee’s employment contract, being “information … possessed by, used by, or under the control of [the plaintiff] that [was] not generally available to the public”.

</div> If there was no inducement, that means that Ms Foo had been charged with this matter, and at or around the same time, Ms Lee <span class="font-italic">happened </span>to breach her Confidentiality Obligation by disclosing to the second defendant <span class="font-italic">the exact information </span>that Ms Foo required. This is, to say the least, an unlikely series of events. I therefore find that it is more likely than not that the second defendant had induced Ms Lee to breach her Confidentiality Obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 However, I do not find that the first defendant played a part in inducing this breach. The extent of the first defendant’s participation in this disclosure, on the plaintiff’s own case, is that he intended for the second defendant to poach SP from the plaintiff, as indicated in his business plans. Without further evidence of the first defendant’s direct involvement in procuring Ms Lee’s breach of her Confidentiality Obligation, it is difficult for me to find that he had a hand in this, as opposed to the alternative of the second defendant initiating this inducement on its own.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 I further reiterate my analysis above and find that the elements of awareness of Ms Lee’s contract and intention are satisfied as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I therefore find the second defendant to be liable in inducement of breach of contract in respect of Ms Lee’s breach of her Confidentiality Obligation in disclosing the SP Inventory List.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 Finally, the plaintiff claims against both defendants in both unlawful means conspiracy and lawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unlawful means conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Unlawful means conspiracy is constituted when two or more persons combine to commit an unlawful act with the intention of harming the plaintiff’s economic interests. The claimant must show (<span class="font-italic">Bluestone Corp Pte Ltd v Phang Cher Choon and others and another suit</span> [2020] SGHC 268 at [254]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those acts; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the acts were unlawful; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In the present case, I find that on a balance of probabilities, it is likely that the defendants worked together to set up the second defendant at the expense of the plaintiff, namely through obtaining the plaintiff’s confidential information, diverting the plaintiff’s customers and hiring the plaintiff’s employees. The second defendant sought to portray the first defendant’s actions in this regard as a sort of overzealous assistance, the details to which the second defendant was not privy. I am inclined to disagree. As Mr Sng admitted on the stand, he sought elaboration from the first defendant at various junctures as to the proposed business plan. His position that this was merely to check that the first defendant had some basis in reality for the plan, as the level of detail in the plan had apparently been not at all expected. He therefore sought to throw the first defendant a “curve ball” by asking for more details. However, I do not find this to be a credible tale. Multiple rounds of “curve balls” were apparently thrown, which does not strike me as necessary if all Mr Sng wanted to do was to verify the plaintiff’s mettle and credibility. Further, as I have already alluded to (at [103] above), the density of the first defendant’s work for the second defendant suggests a much more tight-knit relationship, as well as the existence of a shared plan. I therefore find it more likely than not that there was in fact an underlying combination between the defendants for the first defendant to assist in the setting up for the second defendant through the transmission of confidential data belonging to the plaintiff, the solicitation of the plaintiff’s employees and the diversion of the plaintiff’s customers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I have found that the first defendant breached his contractual obligations through providing assistance to the second defendant in (a) setting up the latter, (b) soliciting Ms Tan and Ms Chua and (c) the second defendant’s efforts to divert from the first defendant various customers and opportunities (see [102] above). Further, I have found that the second defendant induced Ms Lee’s breach of her Confidentiality Obligation in her disclosure of the SP Inventory List, and that both defendants should be held liable for inducing Mr Yeo’s breach of his Confidentiality Obligation in respect of Leap Networks. These constitute the unlawful means by which the conspiracy was undertaken. It is also likely that the plaintiff has suffered loss by these acts, though the extent of the loss is not an issue that is presently before me. I find, therefore, that the defendants are liable in unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lawful means conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The plaintiff further makes a claim under lawful means conspiracy, which is constituted by (<span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another</span> [2020] 5 SLR 354 at [114]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a combination of two or more persons and an agreement between them and amongst them to do certain acts; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the predominant purpose of the combination being to cause damage or injury to the claimant; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the claimant suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Once more, I find that there was a combination between the defendants for the first defendant to assist in the setting up for the second defendant through the transmission of confidential data belonging to the plaintiff, the solicitation of the plaintiff’s employees and the diversion of the plaintiff’s customers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The alleged conspirators in a lawful means conspiracy will be taken to possess the necessary predominant purpose if they undertake actions knowing that any gain to themselves cannot be brought about without a corresponding loss to the plaintiffs (see <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span> at [115] and <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others and other appeals</span> [2013] 1 SLR 374 at [63]). In the present case, given that the core of the combination appears to have been to take advantage of the resources and work invested by the plaintiff in its business to jumpstart the second defendant, it can be safely said the defendants’ gain could only have come about with a corresponding loss to the plaintiff. The defendants therefore possessed the necessary predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 As an aside, I note that in a situation involving the poaching of an employee – a fairly common business practice – the gain to the hiring company necessarily entails a corresponding loss to the company from which the employee was hired from. It would then appear to follow that whenever such poaching is agreed upon between multiple parties and executed, a cause of action in lawful means conspiracy results. Whether the tort of lawful means conspiracy should capture such situations is not a question that is before me, nor one on which the parties in the present case have made submissions, but it is perhaps a question worthy of future consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 I turn to the acts performed in furtherance of the agreement. In addition to those acts which I have found to constitute unlawful means for the purposes of unlawful means conspiracy (see [190] above), I find that the second defendant’s solicitation of the Former Employees apart from Ms Chua and Ms Tan (see [63]–[67] above) was also performed in furtherance of the agreement. It is also likely that the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of these acts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I therefore find that the plaintiff’s claim in lawful means conspiracy has been made out as well.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reliefs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In summary, I make the following findings as to liability:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first defendant is liable for breach of contract and his implied duties of good faith and fidelity for:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Preparing and communicating business plans for setting up the second defendant (at [54]–[55] above), providing feedback on the second defendant’s name cards (at [57] above) and disclosing the first defendant’s internal manuals (at [57] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Assisting in the second defendant’s solicitation of Ms Chua and Ms Tan (at [60] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Disclosing the plaintiff’s pricing strategy in relation to the SCADA 227 and OEM2 projects (at [81] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Assisting the second defendant in procuring the business of Leap Networks (at [85] above), A&amp;L (at [86] above) and CWT Limited (at [87] above;.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Responding substantively to the second defendant’s inquiries in relation to AT&amp;T (at [88] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) Working for Beesket during his working hours with the plaintiff, and misusing the plaintiff’s employees for the “team-building exercise” (at [109] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) Manipulating records in order to obtain higher payments of OTE to Ms Gwee (at [117] above) and Andrew Tan (at [132] above); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) Approving reimbursement claims from Ms Gwee with no ostensible link to the business of the plaintiff (at [119] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The first defendant is liable in fraudulent misrepresentation for manipulating records in order to obtain higher payments of OTE to Ms Gwee (at [117] above) and Andrew Tan (at [132] above) and approving reimbursement claims from Ms Gwee with no ostensible link to the business of the plaintiff (at [119] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The first defendant is liable in breach of confidence in relation to the business plans he prepared for the second defendant and his disclosure of the plaintiff’s internal manuals and the plaintiff’s pricing strategy on the SCADA 227 and OEM2 Projects (at [151] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The second defendant is liable for inducing Ms Lee’s breach of her Confidentiality Obligation in her disclosure of the SP Inventory List (at [186] above), while both defendants are liable for inducing Mr Yeo’s breach of his Confidentiality Obligation in respect of Leap Networks (at [173] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Both defendants are liable in unlawful means conspiracy for the plaintiff’s contractual breaches and the inducements of breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Both defendants are liable in lawful means conspiracy for the plaintiff’s contractual breaches, the inducements of breach of contract and the solicitation of the Former Employees apart from Ms Chua and Ms Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The plaintiff seeks the following reliefs:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) damages to be assessed, or in the alternative, at the election of the plaintiff, an account of profits;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an order that the defendants deliver up to the plaintiff all hard and soft copies of the plaintiff’s trade secrets, confidential and/or proprietary information and any of the plaintiff’s trade secrets, confidential and/or proprietary information that has been obtained, modified or adapted by the defendants and destroy all copies of the same in their custody, power and control; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an injunction to restrain the defendants from using or dealing in any way with the plaintiff’s trade secrets, confidential and/or proprietary information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I have found that there have been numerous instances where confidential information was conveyed to the second defendant, whether by the first defendant or by others.
