There is a two-stage inquiry to determine whether vicarious liability should be imposed, both of which must be fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 First, the relationship between the primary tortfeasor and defendant must be sufficiently close so as to make it fair, just and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on the defendant for the primary tortfeasor’s acts (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> at [42]) (“the First Inquiry”). The classical situation in which vicarious liability is recognised is the employer-employee relationship. However, the law does not confine vicarious liability to employment relationships: <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts </span>(Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 23rd Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell</span> 23rd Ed”) at para 6-01. Vicarious liability may be imposed in relationships which are closely analogous to employment relationships, and in which context it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for the tortious acts of the primary tortfeasor (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng </span>at [62]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Second, there must be a sufficient connection between the defendant and the primary tortfeasor’s relationship on the one hand, and the commission of the tort on the other (“the Second Inquiry”). The defendant must in some way have created or significantly enhanced, by virtue of that relationship, the very risk that in fact materialised in order to be held vicariously liable for the primary tortfeasor’s wrongful acts (<span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The First Inquiry is satisfied by virtue of an admission in Zenwan’s pleadings.

In my view, such negligent driving was so closely connected to his employment with Zenwan that it is fair and just for the latter to be vicariously liable.  This is because on 31 August 2016, Chuah was negligent when performing the task he was employed to do – transporting passengers safely from one destination to another. For context, I surmise that Zenwan owned buses and employed bus drivers to service various routes, including routes between Singapore and Malaysia.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In addition, Zenwan created, by virtue of its employer-employee relationship with Chuah, the very risk that materialised. By employing Chuah to drive its buses on designated routes, including from Genting Highlands to Singapore, Zenwan created the risk of Chuah’s negligent driving causing a road accident, thereby injuring passengers on board its bus. Zenwan also failed to persuade me that all precautionary measures within its power had been taken (see [40] below). Accordingly, there is nothing to displace the inference that the Bus passengers were vulnerable to Chuah’s negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In these circumstances, I find that the Second Inquiry is satisfied. I need not go further to examine Zenwan’s submission that Chuah’s conduct was an unauthorised mode of doing an act authorised by Zenwan, rather than an act outside the scope of his employment. The need to prove the former no longer forms part of the test for vicarious liability in Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch</span><span class="font-italic"> v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2011] 3 SLR 540 (“<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>”)  at [66]–[68], [71] and [75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Zenwan further argues that vicarious liability should not be imposed because the policy considerations of victim compensation and deterring employers from causing future harm do not apply. I deal with each policy consideration in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The policy of victim compensation is the law’s recognition that the “employer is usually the person best placed and most able to provide effective compensation to the victim”: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> at</span> [77]. For instance, the employer may redistribute the cost of providing compensation for his employee’s torts through mechanisms such as insurance. However, having noted that vicarious liability is a form of “strict” liability which is imposed anomalously by the law without requiring any fault on the defendant’s part, the Court of Appeal went on to remark that “vicarious liability can only be justified if the victim of the tort is himself not at fault, or is less at fault than the blameworthy party and/or the ultimate defendant”: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span> at [78]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Zenwan submits that the Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent (for reasons described at [18] above) and are therefore precluded from claiming it is vicariously liable. However, as I later explain, I am not satisfied that the Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent (see [63] and [79] below). This objection, therefore, does not negate the interest in victim compensation in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I turn next to the policy of deterrence of future harm. This was described by McLachlin J in the Canadian Supreme Court’s decision of <span class="font-italic">The Children’s Foundation, the Superintendent of Family</span><span class="font-italic"> and Child Services in the Province of British Columbia and Her Majesty The Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia as represented by the Ministry of Social Services and Housing v Patrick Allan Bazley </span>[1999] 2 SCR 534 at [33] (affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span> at [79]) as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Beyond the narrow band of employer conduct that attracts direct liability in negligence lies a vast area where imaginative and efficient administration and supervision can reduce the risk that the employer has introduced into the community. Holding the employer vicariously liable for the wrongs of its employee may encourage the employer to take such steps, and hence, reduce the risk of future harm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span> explained that this policy rests on the fundamental premise that the employer is best placed, relative to everybody else, to manage the risks of his business enterprise and prevent wrongdoing from occurring. In many cases, this premise may hold true. However, in some cases, the person better placed to prevent the tort may well be the victim himself or a third party (at [80]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This may occur, for example, where an independent contractor or some other third party independent of the employer supplies all the equipment required to perform a job which is part and parcel of the employer’s business enterprise. In yet other cases, the type of tort that occurs is, realistically speaking, uncontrollable and, therefore, not amenable to deterrence. This is particularly relevant to torts committed in the course of excessively risky business enterprises, spur-of-the-moment torts and intentional torts. In such situations, it may well be possible to find that the employer has done <span class="font-italic">all that is reasonable to deter the tort and yet has failed to prevent the commission of the tort</span>. In such situations, deterrence as a justification for imposing vicarious liability loses much of its force. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Zenwan argues that it has done everything within its power to ensure the safety of its passengers, including by training Chuah and providing him with a vehicle which was in proper working order, regularly serviced, and included seatbelts. Its point is that driving on roads “poses such unlimited circumstances and situations which cannot be foreseen” and that accidents may happen “no matter how much precautionary measures are taken”.

I am satisfied that Zenwan, being the owner of the Bus and Chuah’s employer, was in the best position to reduce the risk of negligent driving causing road accidents and injury to passengers. Although Zenwan insists that it has taken all precautionary measures within its power, this contention is unsupported by the evidence. For one, as I later explain at [63] below, there is insufficient evidence to prove that the Bus was fitted with seatbelts for its passengers. In addition, besides the fact that Chuah was employed in 2004 and is alleged to have had “years of experience ferrying passengers to and from various parts of Malaysia”,

</div> there is no evidence of the nature of the training which Zenwan had provided to Chuah, or which Chuah had received before joining Zenwan. Finally, Zenwan has not furnished evidence pertaining to how much rest Chuah was afforded before embarking on the fateful journey back to Singapore, the schedule of Zenwan’s buses and how often Chuah was rostered to drive for Zenwan. For these reasons, the policy of deterrence of future harm applies with full force. Bus owners and employers in Zenwan’s position should be incentivised to effectively manage the risks posed to their customers or passengers in the course of their business activities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In all these circumstances, it is just, fair and reasonable to impose vicarious liability on Zenwan for Chuah’s negligence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As set out at [19] above, the Plaintiffs raise several objections to the contention that they were contributorily negligent. Two of which are that: (a) the defendant who is vicariously liable cannot raise contributory negligence if the primary tortfeasor has not (“the Primary Tortfeasor Argument”); and (b) Zenwan is prevented from re-litigating the issue due to issue estoppel arising from the judgment against Chuah (“the Issue Estoppel Argument”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I will assume, without deciding, that the Primary Tortfeasor Argument and Issue Estoppel Argument are resolved in Zenwan’s favour (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Zenwan is not barred from raising the issue of contributory negligence). Even if this is correct, in my judgment, Zenwan is unable to prove the elements of contributory negligence. I begin by outlining some basic principles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Contributory negligence is a partial defence which is statutorily enacted in the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 (2020 Rev Ed) (“Contributory Negligence Act”). Section 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">3.</span>—(1) Where any person suffers damage as the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">result</span> partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In essence, the claimant must have failed to take due care for his own safety and thus <span class="font-italic">caused</span> loss to himself: <span class="font-italic">Asnah</span><span class="font-italic"> bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin </span>[2016] 2 SLR 944 (“<span class="font-italic">Asnah</span>”) at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The defendant bears the burden of establishing the defence of contributory negligence: <span class="font-italic">Munshi Mohammad Faiz </span><span class="font-italic">v Interpro Construction Pte Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2021] 4 SLR 1371<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]; <span class="font-italic">Asnah </span>at [113] and [178]. To establish contributory negligence, the defendant must prove that the plaintiff owes himself a duty to take care of his own safety in the prevailing circumstances of the case and that the plaintiff breached the requisite standard of care (<span class="font-italic">Asnah</span> at [19]–[20]). As a general rule, the standard of care expected of the plaintiff is measured against a person of ordinary prudence, corresponding in most cases to the standard of care in negligence (<span class="font-italic">Asnah</span> at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 If the plaintiff is found to have been contributorily negligent, the court proceeds to determine the appropriate reduction in the plaintiff’s damages for his contributory negligence. To re-iterate, s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act requires the damages to “be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.” Amongst the many considerations that may fall to guide the exercise of the court’s discretion, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asnah</span> at [118] highlighted two in particular: (a) the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct; and (b) the relative moral blameworthiness of the parties’ conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Plaintiffs failed to wear seatbelts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Zenwan submits that all of the Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent for failing to wear their seatbelts at the time of the Accident. It argues that the Bus had seatbelts and that Zenwan had made this a term of their booking. In particular, it blames Manokaran’s family in Suit 1044 for not noticing this term in the Booking Form given that Priyatharsini’s job as a Patient Assistant Specialist required her to explain the terms and conditions of consent forms for medical procedures to patients.

</div> In any case, the ST Article does not clarify whether the Bus was fitted with seatbelts which the Plaintiffs negligently failed to use.

As Zenwan was the registered owner of the Bus, it would have had knowledge of this information. Alternatively, it could have led evidence from Tan on this issue. As the Plaintiffs observe, Tan would have been privy to whether the Bus had been fitted with seatbelts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The relevant issue is one of causation. If Wee’s act of standing up did not cause or contribute to the injuries of which he now complains, he cannot have been contributorily negligent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Proving causation is a necessary element to establishing the defence of contributory negligence. It is statutorily provided for in s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act, which requires the damage suffered by the plaintiff to “result” partly from his own fault. In my view, the presence of causation should be determined before the court apportions liability by weighing factors such as the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct. I regard the factor of relative causative potency as going to the comparative <span class="font-italic">strengths</span> of the causal links from each party’s conduct to the injury sustained by the plaintiff. This factor therefore presupposes the existence of a causal link between the plaintiff’s conduct and his injury.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee and another v Yoong Weng Ho Robert</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 751 (“<span class="font-italic">Fong Maun </span><span class="font-italic">Yee</span>”) at [59] endorsed the proposition, in <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts </span>(Margaret R Brazier gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 1995) at para 3-13, that the principles governing whether the plaintiff’s own fault contributed to his injuries should be the same as those governing whether the defendant caused those injuries. Further, broad common sense should be used to judge cause and effect on the facts of each particular case. These same principles are re-iterated in <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> 23rd Ed at para 3-62.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 To establish the tort of negligence, both factual and legal causation must be proved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Court of Appeal’s classic statement of the requirement of factual causation in <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span>”) reads as follows (at [52]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Causation in fact is concerned with the question of whether the relation between the defendant’s breach of duty and the claimant’s damage is one of cause and effect in accordance with scientific or objective notions of physical sequence.

Where it can be established that a <span class="font-italic">novus actus interveniens</span> has broken the chain of causation, the defendant will be freed from liability. The requirement of legal causation assists the court to determine “how best to <span class="font-italic">attribute responsibility </span>for the claimant’s damage” [emphasis in original] based on convenience, public policy and a rough sense of justice:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span> at [54]–[55].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It follows from <span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell</span> 23rd Ed that these principles also govern the determination of causation in contributory negligence.

</div> Wee’s Malaysian Police Report suggests that Wee was still standing when the Accident occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the version of events in Wee’s Oct 2020 AEIC (1307), Wee was sitting down by the time the Accident occurred. If this is true, even if Wee had stood up at some point, Wee would still have suffered the same type and severity of injuries. Any additional danger or risk he placed himself in by standing could have extinguished by the time the Bus collided with the centre divider.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Conversely, in the version of events in Wee’s Malaysian Police Report, Wee’s act of standing up would have a causal link to the extent or nature of his injuries. But for Wee’s act of standing up after the Bus had begun to swerve and remaining standing as the Bus overturned, Wee would have suffered less severe injuries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I have reservations about the credibility of the Malaysian Police Report. Wee testified that his Malaysian Police Report was not accurate and challenged the completeness of, at least, one part of the report. With regards the latter challenge, Wee claimed to have told the Malaysian police officers that he “stood up and take a look”, but the report only recorded that he had stood up.

There are several possible outcomes: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If Grassland is an <span class="font-italic">agent for Zenwan</span>, and Zenwan is a disclosed principal, the Contracts are contracts of carriage to which only the Plaintiffs and Zenwan are parties.

If so, the Plaintiffs were entitled to elect to sue the agent under the Contracts (as they have done under this contractual claim).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Zenwan would have been an undisclosed principal because the Plaintiffs and Grassland did not contract with each other on the basis of Grassland being an agent of Zenwan. This is for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, cl 19 indicates to a reasonable reader that Grassland <span class="font-italic">was not</span> an agent for Zenwan (or transport suppliers in general). Although Grassland took pains in cl 19 to state that it acted “only in the capacity of <span class="font-italic">agent</span> for passengers” [emphasis added], the same clause <span class="font-italic">does not</span> confine Grassland’s role to that of a mere agent for the transport “supplier”. The logical inference is that Grassland undertook to perform the transportation service itself and was merely sub-contracting the work to another party. Importantly, Grassland still remains liable if the sub-contractor performs the service in a manner which breaches Grassland’s contract with its customer. The fact that the supplier of services may under the contract arrange for some or all of them to be performed by others does not absolve the supplier from his contractual obligation: <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span> at 750; <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”) at paras 22-084 and 22-087. Thus, an objective reading of cl 19 conveys the impression that a customer is contracting <span class="font-italic">with Grassland</span> <span class="font-italic">alone </span>for the provision of transportation services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Second, as I later explain, the evidence does not establish that Zenwan issued bus tickets (separate from Grassland’s Booking Form) to the Plaintiffs (see [197]–[201] below) at the time that the Contracts were formed or thereafter. The upshot is that the Booking Forms functioned as the tickets which the Plaintiffs used to board the Bus.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 From the Letter of Appointment, there is also no basis for finding that GET has the implied actual authority to act as Zenwan’s ticketing agent for the Genting Route. Implied actual authority may arise in several ways. First, an agent has authority to do things incidental to the fulfilment of tasks he is expressly authorised to do. Second, an agent has the authority to do things a person in such a position usually does. Third, a corporate agent may be given implied authority by the acquiescence of his superiors (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6 (LexisNexis, 2021) at para 70.084). None of these grounds apply in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Further, GET does not have the ostensible authority to act as Zenwan’s agent for the Genting Route. To establish ostensible authority, three elements must be proved (<span class="font-italic">Millenia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd) v Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">(formerly known as Dragages et Travaux Publics (Singapore) Pte Ltd) and others (Arup Singapore Pte Ltd, third party)</span> [2019] 4 SLR 1075 at [512(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">Banque Nationale de Paris v Tan Nancy and another</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 726 at [67]–[69]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the principal represented that the agent has authority to act for the principal;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the agent acted within the scope of the authority which the principal represents that the agent has; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the third party relied on the representation.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Letter of Appointment does not at all refer or allude to the Genting Route and there is no evidence that Zenwan represented to the Plaintiffs that GET or GE had the authority to act for it in respect of the Genting Route. Accordingly, the first requirement for ostensible authority is unfulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The LTA Email does not take Grassland’s case any further. This is because it is silent on the issue of whether Grassland was appointed as Zenwan’s authorised ticketing agent for the Genting Route. It does not, without more, provide a sufficient ground to infer that Grassland’s authority in the Letter of Appointment had been extended to other routes by Zenwan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Finally, Grassland did not plead any other bases for their purported agency in respect of the Genting Route. For instance, it did not allege that the scope of its agency, originating from the Letter of Appointment, was widened to include other routes by virtue of the parties’ subsequent dealings or agreement. No evidence was led in these regards either.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For these reasons, Zenwan is either: (a) an undisclosed principal, in which case the Plaintiffs are well within their rights to select to sue Grassland <span class="font-italic">qua</span> agent; or (b) not Grassland’s principal for the Genting Route, in which case the Plaintiffs can only sue Grassland in contract. In both situations, it falls on me to determine whether Grassland breached the Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Grassland undertook to provide the bus transportation service itself</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Since Grassland was not an agent for Zenwan, I am satisfied that Grassland is a party to the Contracts which are alleged to have been breached. However, it still remains to be seen what the nature and scope of Grassland’s undertaking under the Contracts is. The issue, as crystallised by the Plaintiffs, is whether Grassland had (a) merely agreed to assist them to get in touch with a third-party transport provider, or (b) agreed to transport the Plaintiffs to Genting Highlands and back.

</div> I will deal with this issue of privity of contract at [237]–[244] below. For now, I focus on the issue of incorporation of contractual terms.

The court went further to explain that “[r]egardless of whether the terms sought to be incorporated [are] standard or non-standard terms, the onus [is] always on the [party signing the contract] to ascertain what those terms were before agreeing to them” (at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 However, the Plaintiffs submit that <span class="font-italic">even </span><span class="font-italic">if a contract has been signed</span>, “a condition which is ‘particularly onerous or unusual’ will not be incorporated into the contract, unless it has been fairly and reasonably brought to [the signatory’s] attention” [emphasis in original omitted].

</div> as was recognised in <span class="font-italic">Higgins &amp; Co Lawyers Ltd v Evans </span>[2019] EWHC 2809 (“<span class="font-italic">Higgins</span>”) at [77]. Like Saini J in <span class="font-italic">Higgins</span>, I find Andrew Popplewell QC’s exposition of the relevant case law in <span class="font-italic">Do-Buy 925 Ltd v National Westminster Bank plc</span> [2010] EWHC 2862 to be helpful: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91. I agree with [counsel for the defendant] that such principles have no application to cl 21.2 in the present case. He rightly points out that it remains an <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">undecided question</span> whether the Interfoto principle can ever apply to a signed contract. In that case the Defendant was held not to be bound by a term in a printed set of conditions which had been provided to him in the form of a delivery note, but which he had neither signed nor read. In <span class="font-italic">Ocean Chemical Transport v Exnor Crags Ltd</span> [2000] 1 Lloyd's Rep 446, [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 519, Evans LJ, with whom Henry and Waller LLJ agreed, was prepared to assume that the principle might apply to onerous and unusual clauses in a signed contract “in an extreme case where a signature was obtained under pressure of time or other circumstances”. In <span class="font-italic">HIH v New </span><span class="font-italic">Hampshire</span>[2001] EWCA Civ 735, [2001] 2 All ER (Comm) 39, [2001] 2 Lloyd's Rep 161, Rix LJ doubted whether the principle was properly applicable outside the context of incorporation by notice (see para 209). In <span class="font-italic">Amiri Flight Authority v BAE Systems </span><span class="font-italic">plc</span>[2003] EWCA Civ 1447, [2004] 1 All ER (Comm) 385, 392, [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep 767, Mance LJ, with whom Rix and Potter LLJ agreed, noted the doubts of Rix LJ in <span class="font-italic">HIH v New Hampshire</span> and stated that it was <span class="font-italic">unnecessary to decide whether the principle could ever apply to signed contracts</span>. He envisaged that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it might do so where for example a car owner was asked to sign a ticket on entering a car park or a holiday maker asked to sign a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">long small print document when hiring a car which in either case proved to have a provision of “an extraneous or wholly unusual nature”; but that such cases might be ones where the application of the provision was precluded by an implied representation as to the nature of the document</span>. He reiterated the normal rule that in the absence of any misrepresentation, the signature of a contractual document must operate as an incorporation and acceptance of all its terms. This is a reflection of the well known principle whose existence and importance was recently emphasised by Moore-Bick LJ in <span class="font-italic">Peekay v Australia and New Zealand Banking </span><span class="font-italic">Group</span>[2006] EWCA Civ 386, [2006] 2 Lloyd's Rep 511, 520 at para 43:: </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">‘It was accepted that a person who signs a document knowing that it is intended to have legal effect is generally bound by its terms, whether he has actually read them or not.

This is not an extreme case, nor one in which there is any reason to depart from the principle that a party should be bound by a contract he has signed. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The signature on the Application Form was immediately below an acknowledgement that the signatory had read the General Terms and Conditions</span> which came at the end of a section headed “Important-you should read this carefully”. Ms Searle accepted that she was provided with the General Terms and Conditions and had had an opportunity to read them; and that the Bank were entitled to assume that she had done so. I see no room for the application of the <span class="font-italic">Interfoto</span> principle in this case, even were it capable of applying to some signed contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 As I understand the Plaintiffs’ submission, they argue that the <span class="font-italic">Interfoto</span> Principle should apply to a signed contract when the clause is onerous and unfair.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I reject the Plaintiffs’ submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 First, the Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Binta</span><span class="font-italic">i</span> at [58] that only “fraud or misrepresentation” will free a party from the terms of a <span class="font-italic">signed</span> contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Second, this question was squarely considered by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology Pte Ltd v Trans-Link Exhibition Forwarding Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 712 (“<span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology</span>”). Prakash J refused to extend the <span class="font-italic">Interfoto</span> Principle to signed contracts and held that the principle only applied to cases in which there was no signed contract (<span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology</span> at [39] and [40]). In my view, this position holds true even for contracts between businesses and consumers. It is telling that Prakash J declined to follow the Canadian case, <span class="font-italic">Tilden Rent-A-Car Co v Clendenning</span> [1978] 83 DLR 3d 400. In the context of a business-consumer contract, the Canadian court held that a signature can only be relied on as manifesting assent to a document when it is <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> for the party relying on the signed document to believe that the signor really did assent to its contents. This does not represent the law in Singapore. Prakash J’s holding and analysis at [39] and [40] of <span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology</span> were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bintai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I am guided by the Court of Appeal’s endorsement of Prakash J’s reasons, two of which bear highlighting. First, as Prakash J cautioned, “[c]ontracting parties must have a care for their own legal positions by ascertaining what terms are to be part of a contract before signing it” (<span class="font-italic">Press Automation Technology</span> at [40]). Second, she cited Hobhouse LJ’s remark in <span class="font-italic">AEG (UK) Ltd v Logic Resource Limited</span> [1996] CLC 265 that recourse against onerous terms is already statutorily provided for in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (c 50) (UK). Therefore, it is no longer necessary to introduce additional strict criteria to prevent particular terms from being incorporated into a contract. Third, and in addition to Prakash J’s views, it would result in unacceptable levels of uncertainty if signatories to a contract were allowed to disclaim terms which they find to be onerous or unreasonable. In these premises, I see no practical need to extend the <span class="font-italic">Interfoto </span>Principle to signed contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Returning to the present case, the Booking Form has been signed by Wee and Manokaran. In addition, it is <span class="font-italic">twice</span> stated on the front of the Booking Form that the Contract is subject to the Booking Form Terms and Conditions on the reverse side of the Booking Form.

</div> The natural inference is that Manokaran and Wee were booking tickets in their personal capacities and for their families. Second, GET and GE entered into the Contracts in the course of a business. This much is evident from the fact that Xing Lina and Lye, a supervisor and Front Desk Officer with GE and GET respectively, were tasked to “make seat bookings for customers for bus transport between Singapore and Malaysia”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The answer to the first question cannot depend on the proper construction of the contract. If this was so, the reasonable expectations of an aggrieved party would be circumscribed by the impugned term itself: <span class="font-italic">Zockoll</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at 395. Thus, in considering this question, the courts have not been confined to the four corners of the contract: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 07.119. Additionally, the reasonable expectations referred to in s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UCTA are those which would have been formed at the time the contract was made: <span class="font-italic">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc</span><span class="font-italic">. and another v Maclaine Watson &amp; Co. Ltd., J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd and others </span>[1989] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 570 at 612.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I agree with the Plaintiffs’ submission. The following factors illustrate the reasonableness of the Plaintiffs’ expectation that Grassland would be providing the transportation service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 First, the Booking Form (less cl 19) objectively gives one the impression that Grassland is the provider of the bus transportation service. As I later explain when determining the nature of Grassland’s contractual undertaking, the visual design of the Booking Form, the information conveyed on the front page, and the Booking Form Terms and Conditions (less cl 19) are consistent with Grassland being the transport provider (see [204]–[218] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Even if cl 19 is part of the Contracts, I accept that lay persons like the Plaintiffs may remain under the impression that Grassland is the transport provider. The statement that Grassland is only an “agent for passengers in making all arrangements for transportation …” is inconclusive. This is because the label “agent” is not determinative of the person’s status, even in law: Tan Cheng Han, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) at para 01.003. In fact, there are at least two meanings of the word agent. The first is a technical legal meaning entailing all the powers and duties associated with agency. The second is a non-technical meaning which refers to any form of intermediary who simply performs functions for others: <span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency </span>(Peter Watts gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 22nd Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Bowstead and Reynolds</span>”) at para 1-023; John Nelson-Jones &amp; Peter Stewart, <span class="font-italic">A Practical Guide to Package Holiday Law and Contracts </span>(Fourmat Publishing, 2nd Ed, 1989) at 164. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I doubt that the word “agent” will be understood by a lay person in a legal sense. It is entirely possible that a lay person would construe “agent” as a short-hand for travel agency. The word “arrangements” is also vague and, on a plain reading, is not necessarily inconsistent with Grassland being the transport supplier. I maintain this view even though the second sentence of cl 19 references a third-party “supplier”. A possible reading is that Grassland sub-contracted the provision of transport to a third-party (who could be an independent contractor) but remains, vis-à-vis its own customer, the transport provider. I find support for this last-mentioned reading of cl 19 in <span class="font-italic">Inghams Travel </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span> (see [169(b)] below). Clause 19 is, in my judgment, not sufficiently clear to bring home to the reasonable reader that Grassland is not the transport supplier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 In addition, the evidence reveals that Xing Lina (who served Wee) and Lye (who served Manokaran, Barvathi and Priyatharsini) did not draw specific attention to or explain cl 19. Xing Lina admits that if a customer does not ask about cll 18 and 19, she will not explain them.

Other terms and conditions are equally important but [she] would just get the customers to read through other terms and conditions themselves.”

</div> For the reason canvassed at [145], I agree. It would be wholly unrealistic to expect customers in the Plaintiffs’ position to seek legal advice before completing their purchases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Based on the foregoing, Grassland has failed to prove that it is fair and reasonable for cl 19 to be included in the Contracts. The clause is therefore unenforceable under s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UCTA for the purpose of proving that Grassland’s contractual undertaking was merely to act as an agent for the Plaintiffs. Given my conclusion, it is unnecessary to examine the Plaintiffs’ case under ss 2(1) and 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the UCTA in relation to cl 19. I do, however, briefly consider s 2(1) of the UCTA in relation to cl 18 at [234] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Although the Plaintiffs appear to take the view that cl 19 must be a clause which excludes or restricts liability before s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UCTA applies, and make submissions to support such a characterisation of cl 19, this is unnecessary. While s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) only applies to terms of such a nature, s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is not similarly circumscribed. Section 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the UCTA applies where a party, by reference to any contract term, claims to be entitled to either render performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i)) or in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no performance at all (s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii)): <span class="font-italic">The Zockoll Group Limited v Mercury Communications Limited and Another </span>[1997] Lexis Citation 15, upheld in <span class="font-italic">Zockoll (CA)</span>; The Law Commission and The Scottish Law Commission, <span class="font-italic">Exemption Clauses: Second Report</span> (Law Com.

The question is whether Grassland agreed to provide the transportation service itself, or merely to arrange for the provision of the transportation service by a third party as the Plaintiffs’ agent. The distinction between the two situations was outlined by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Craven </span>at [16] (cited affirmatively by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan </span>at 750): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a person agrees to perform some work or services, he cannot escape contractual liability by delegating the performance to another.

He is not responsible if that contractor is negligent in the performance of the actual work or service, for the performance is not part of his contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The Plaintiffs submit that Grassland’s role was to transport the Plaintiffs, and not merely to link them up with a third-party transport provider.

The deceased had bought the tour package from the first defendant, a Hong Kong travel company. The tour guide accompanying the deceased and the boat captain at the material time were not employees of the first defendant (at 748). On appeal, it was not in dispute that the tour guide and boat captain had been negligent (at 749). The issue on appeal was whether the first defendant was liable for the negligence of the tour guide and boat captain. This turned on a question similar to that at [155] above – did the first defendant agree to arrange for services to be provided by others as their agents, or to supply the services itself (at 749)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The Privy Council (“PC”) held that the first defendant “undertook to provide … all the services included in the programme, even if some activities were to be carried out by others” (at 754). It reached this conclusion by considering the contract as a whole. In particular, Lord Slynn, delivering the judgment of the PC, made the following observations (at 753–754): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the terms of the first defendant’s brochure, which was part of the contractual arrangements, there were “<span class="font-italic">no clear statements</span> that the first defendant was doing no more than arranging the tour as agent for the travellers” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The heading of the brochure, “Kwan Kin Travel Tours–everything more comprehensively and thoughtfully worked out”, indicated that the first defendant was undertaking the task of supplying the package tours. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The detailed itinerary always stated that it was “we” who would do things, including board the bus, go for lunch, live in a hotel. The court found that “we” included the first defendant and “integrate[d] the company into each stage of the tour”. For instance, there was nothing indicating that the tour guide was not the first defendant’s employee. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The “all-in price” included “[t]ransportation as specified in itinerary”. “Transportation” encompassed the fateful boat trip.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 In support of the PC’s decision, Lord Slynn also outlined the following policy considerations (at 754): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It must, however, be borne in mind that the tour operator has the opportunity to seek to protect himself against claims made against him in respect of services performed by others by <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">negotiating suitable contractual terms</span> with those who are to perform those services. He may also provide for <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">insurance</span> cover. He may include an appropriate <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exemption clause</span> in his contract with the traveller. It also has to be borne in mind, in considering what is 'tolerable' or reasonable between the parties, that a traveller in the position of [the deceased] could have <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no influence on the terms</span> negotiated by the tour operator with third parties, and if injured by their lack of care would, if having no right against the package tour operator, be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">obliged to pursue a claim in a foreign country</span>. The difficulty involved in doing so does not need to be elaborated. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I pause here to highlight that in <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span>, the first defendant’s brochure had <span class="font-italic">no clear statement</span> that it was only acting as agent for the travellers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 In <span class="font-italic">Inghams Travel</span>, the plaintiff was on a skiing holiday organised by the defendant, a holiday tour operator (at [2]). She was injured while on a snowmobile excursion. The snowmobiles (referred to as “skidoo”) were provided by a third party, Adriano Tantera, who both instructed the tour group in their use and led the excursion. The original contract for the skiing holiday did not include the snowmobile excursion (at [22]). After arrival at the ski resort, the claimant had asked the defendant’s resort representative to arrange the snowmobile excursion (at [12]). The claimant sued the defendant for damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The court held that the defendant undertook to supply the snowmobile excursion (at [27]). The court reached this conclusion despite the defendant’s event list stating that the snowmobile excursion was provided by the defendant’s “supplier” (at [11]). Its reasons included the following. First, the defendant's information pack stated that “we” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant) could offer snowmobiling at the resort (at [24]). Second, the event list distributed to the plaintiff upon arrival at the ski resort made clear that the defendant would make arrangements for the snowmobile excursion (at [24]). Third, the receipt for payment for the snowmobile excursion bore the defendant’s logo (at [25]). Further, “[t]here was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no suggestion</span> … that [the defendant’s resort representative] was acting as agent for [Adriano Tantera]” [emphasis added] (at [25]). In addition, the defendant’s resort representative also gave evidence that she would normally have asked the skidoo excursion participants to sign the defendant’s disclaimer, but that she did not have the defendant’s forms with her at the time (at [14]). The court observed that this practice “could only be consistent with her contracting with the customers for the supply of the skidoo excursion on behalf of [defendant]” (at [25]). Fifth, Adriano Tantera testified that members of the snowmobile excursion were the defendant’s customers (at [16] and [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Once again, in <span class="font-italic">Inghams Travel</span>, the contractual documents did not suggest that the defendant acted as the agent for the third-party service provider (or as agent for the plaintiff). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In <span class="font-italic">Victor </span><span class="font-italic">Chea</span>, the plaintiff was injured while on a tour to Taiwan organised by the defendant. A double decker tourist bus he was on fell down a hillside and overturned (at [3]). Although a term of the contract stated that the transport which was “arranged by [the defendant] for the tour members [was] not owned, managed or operated by [the defendant]” (at [10]), the court said in <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> that the defendant was the service provider, and not merely the plaintiff’s booking agent (at [18]–[19]). In reaching this view, the court endorsed the reasons of the judge below, which included the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was significant that there was “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no reference anywhere</span> to the defendant being the agent of the plaintiff in contracting with these third parties, nor [was] there any mention of the names of the third parties” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The contract as a whole made clear that the tour was organised and arranged by the defendant using third parties to carry it out. The court said that this was clear from the following statement in a contractual document: “The transport, accommodation, places for meal, sightseeing or entertainment programmes <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">arranged</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by our company</span> for the tour members are not owned, managed or operated by our company.” [emphasis added] (at [10] and [19]). The defendant decided the itinerary and which airline to use. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Other terms in the contractual documents were also consistent with the defendant being the organiser and provider of the tour rather than simply the plaintiff’s agent making a booking or bookings on the plaintiff’s behalf. These terms included the defendant’s right to refuse to accept any application, to adjust the price before departure, to change the accommodation, meals or sightseeing programmes and even to cancel the tour if there were insufficient participants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Similar to both <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span> and <span class="font-italic">Inghams Travel</span>, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal highlighted the significance of the contract not stating that the defendant was acting as an agent for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Finally, in <span class="font-italic">First Choice Holidays</span>, the plaintiff was injured on a quad bike excursion while on holiday in the Dominican Republic. She sued her tour operator, First Choice Holidays and Flights Ltd (“FCHF”), even though the excursion was provided by a third party, Dominican Quad Bike Adventure (“DQBA”) (at [1] and [3]). She claimed that FCHF was either the principal to the excursion contract or an agent for an undisclosed principal. The court held that FCHF was agent for DQBA, and that the latter was an undisclosed principal (at [22]). FCHF was therefore liable for DQBA’s wrongs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The court found the following facts relevant: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant’s welcome pack and front page of its booking form gave the impression that the excursion was provided by FCHF (at [21]). There was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no reference</span> within the defendant’s welcome pack that excursions which were “supplied” by FCHF were operated or provided by another company (at [20] and [22]). The booking form stated that all tours operated by FCHF complied with stringent “health and hygiene checks” and passed a rigorous safety test (at [20]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) DQBA was not mentioned in any documents given to the plaintiff (at [22]). These documents had the logos of FCHF and other entities, such as FCHF’s local agent in the Dominican Republic. However, the logo of DQBA was not displayed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The documents provided by FCHF used language such as “On behalf of First Choice” and “All tours operated by First Choice” (at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 I distil some salient points from these authorities: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The courts in all four cases found it significant that the contract between the tour operator and its customer lacked a clear statement that the former was merely acting as an agent for the customer (or the third-party service provider). As observed by David Grant &amp; Paul Urbanowicz in “Tour operators, package holiday contracts and strict liability” (2001) JBL 253 (“Grant &amp; Urbanowicz”) at 256, <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan </span>“seems to confirm the possibility that if a tour operator words his brochure and other contractual documents appropriately then he will be able to avoid liability for the negligence of his subcontractors”. The same can be said about the other decisions cited by the Plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Even though the tour operator’s contract states that certain activities are provided by third party suppliers (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Inghams Travel</span>), this does not preclude the tour operator from having, in law, undertaken to provide the service itself. In my view, in such situations, the tour operator has merely sub-contracted the supply of the service to the third-party. The tour operator “may be liable if the service is performed without the exercise of due care and skill on the part of the sub-contractor just as he would be liable if the sub-contractor failed to provide the service or failed to provide it in accordance with the terms of the contract” (<span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan </span>at 750). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court examines all the terms of the contract in totality, and the relevant context, to arrive at a decision. As a result, each decision is resolutely grounded in its own facts: Grant &amp; Urbanowicz at 256.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The four authorities cited by the Plaintiffs may be contrasted to cases in which the contractual documentation <span class="font-italic">did</span> contain an express statement which was inconsistent with the relevant entity having undertaken to provide transportation itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 In <span class="font-italic">Craven</span>, the plaintiffs booked a tour to Colombia operated by the defendant. In Colombia, the bus in which they were travelling overturned due to the driver’s negligence, injuring the plaintiffs (at [2]–[3]). Under Colombian law, the defendant had to arrange for transportation services through an appointed government travel agent and was not allowed to deal directly with local transportation companies (at [7]). The issue was whether the defendant was liable for the bus driver’s negligence. The defendant’s brochure, which formed part of the contract with the plaintiffs, contained a clause which stated (at [6]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Strand Companies make <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">arrangements</span> with airlines, cruise lines, coach companies, transfer operators, shore excursion operators, hotels, and other <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">independent parties</span>, to provide you with the travel services and other services you purchase. Although the Strand Companies take great care in selecting these suppliers, the Strand Companies are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unable </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and do not have any control over them and therefore cannot be responsible for their acts or omissions</span>. The travel services and other services provided are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">subject to the conditions imposed by these suppliers</span> and their liability is limited by their tariffs, conditions of carriage, tickets and vouchers and international conventions and agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The court held that the defendant never undertook to perform the bus transfers but merely to arrange for this service by a third party (at [19]). Significantly, it reasoned that the explicit statement in the contract that the defendant’s responsibility was to arrange with “independent parties” for the provision of travel “cannot be interpreted as imposing a personal obligation upon [the defendant] to perform those services” (at [21]). It went on to say that the excerpted disclaimer in the defendant’s brochure was “<span class="font-italic">inconsistent with an agreement or an intent to assume any implied obligation for the safety of the transportation</span>” [emphasis added] (at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 <span class="font-italic">Craven</span> was cited affirmatively by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan </span>at 750 for the proposition set out at [155] above and was referred to in <span class="font-italic">Victor Chea</span> at [12] for the same purpose. <span class="font-italic">Craven</span> has also been applied in subsequent Canadian cases, including <span class="font-italic">Bridges v Classic Sports Tours Ltd </span>[2004] BCPC 366 (“<span class="font-italic">Bridges</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Garofo</span><span class="font-italic">li and another v Air Canada Vacations</span> [2012] ONSC 4698.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 In <span class="font-italic">Bridges</span>, the plaintiff claimed damages for breach of a golf holiday contract which he entered into with the defendant. The defendant’s brochure stated that the package price included air fares (at [2]). However, the flight on which the plaintiff was booked on was grounded and he had to rebook his flight through other carriers (at [4] and [5]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The express terms of the contract printed on the brochure included the following clause (at [11]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Responsibility and Waiver:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pertaining to Classic Sports Tours Ltd. and Pro Team Classic, the passenger waives and releases Classic Sports Tours Ltd. and Pro Team Classic from any loss, damage, expense, cost or injury, from any clause (sic) except the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Classic Sports Tours Ltd., incurred by the passenger on any part of the tour. Classic Sports Tours Ltd. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">shall not be responsible for any actions or inactions of its contracted suppliers</span>. Classic Sports Tours reserves the right to cancel, or modify in its sole discretion any part of the tour and will, when it reasonably can do so, give notice to the passenger of any material change in the tour. In the event that the tour is cancelled, Classic Sports Tours Ltd. will repay to all passengers pro rata all monies returned to Classic Sports Tours Ltd. by contracted suppliers in respect of the cancelled tour Classic Sports Tours Ltd. reserves the right to charge for increases in land or air costs that arise due to currency fluctuations or airfare increases that occur between tariffs in effect as of January 31, 2001 and the final payment of the tour cost.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The court held that the aforementioned “limiting clause” in the brochure supported the interpretation that the defendant “did not assume liability if the contractor defaulted in the provision of the goods and services”. The defendant had agreed to “put together a holiday package for golf enthusiasts <span class="font-italic">by contracting </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">as their agent</span><span class="font-italic"> with various suppliers</span>. It is likely that the defendant charged for this service which was incorporated in the price of the package” [emphasis added] (at [15]). In this case, it was indeed one of the defendant’s contracted suppliers, Canada 3000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the airline which was grounded), which failed to provide transportation to Mexico. However, the court held that the defendant had fulfilled its obligation to “retain a competent carrier and is not responsible under contract law for the loss caused to the Claimant due to the grounding of Canada 3000 airplanes” (at [17]). The court expressly noted that its analysis was supported by <span class="font-italic">Craven</span> (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In light of the foregoing authorities, the question is whether, on a contextual interpretation of the Contracts, Grassland merely undertook to exercise due care in selecting a competent carrier, and not to provide the transportation itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Contracts between the Plaintiffs and Grassland </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 To recapitulate, Grassland relies on cl 19 of the Booking Form Terms and Conditions to prove that it was the Plaintiffs’ “booking agent” and is therefore not liable for Chuah’s negligent driving. However, I have found that cl 19 is unenforceable under s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UCTA. I will therefore examine the remaining terms in the Contracts to ascertain the nature of Grassland’s contractual undertaking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The contextual approach to contractual interpretation proceeds in two broad steps (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</span> [2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”) at [28]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first step requires consideration of whether the extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced in aid of interpretation is admissible. This is a matter governed by the procedural rules of the law of evidence, which governs what and how facts may be proved.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The second step is the task of interpretation itself, which involves ascertaining the meaning of expressions used in a contract, taking into account the admissible evidence. The rules which govern this process may be found in the substantive law of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The following principles summarised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S</span><span class="font-italic">. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd)</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1187 and re-iterated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [30] are also relevant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In gist, the purpose of interpretation is to give effect to the objectively ascertained expressed intentions of the contracting parties as it emerges from the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language. Embedded within this statement are certain key principles: (a) first, in general both the text and context must be considered (at [2]); (b) second, it is the objectively ascertained intentions of the parties that is relevant, not their subjective intentions (at [33]); and (c) third, the object of interpretation is the verbal expressions used by the parties and so, the text of their agreement is of first importance (at [32]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Admissible extrinsic evidence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I turn now to the first step in contextual contractual interpretation. Under s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Evidence Act, extrinsic evidence of the surrounding circumstances accompanying the conclusion of a contract may be admitted, even in the absence of any ambiguity, to aid in the exercise of the interpretation (as distinguished from the contradiction, variation, addition or subtraction) of the expressions used by the parties (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”)<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>at [132(c)], cited in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [41]). However, the general admissibility of extrinsic evidence is subject to several restrictions which may be found in the Evidence Act and the common law (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38] and [65(b)]), cited in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> at [42]). In the main, these are: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The pleading requirements set out at [73] of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>, which require the nature, particulars, and effect of the extrinsic evidence sought to be used to be pleaded with specificity.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The exclusionary provisions of the Evidence Act, chiefly those found at ss 95 and 96, which act as an absolute bar to the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in certain cases (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [65(c)]) </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The continued bar against the admissibility of parol evidence of the drafters’ subjective intentions at the time of the conclusion of the contract outside situations in which there is latent ambiguity (see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp </span>at [59] and [65(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The general requirement that the extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear or obvious context (see <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [132(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 With these principles in mind, I now consider each piece of extrinsic evidence sought to be admitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 First, the Plaintiffs argue that the design of the entrances of GET’s Boon Lay Office and GE’s Golden Mile Office supports the contention that Grassland undertook to provide the transport service. They argue that this is because there was no reference to Zenwan on the entrances to both offices.

</div> Instead, they say that the entrance of the Boon Lay Office had GET’s name and Grassland’s logo “printed on the front of the office in a large font” while the entrance of the Golden Mile Office had GE’s name and the Grassland logo similarly displayed. Although this extrinsic evidence would strengthen the Plaintiffs’ case (see [136] above), I cannot take it into account for the purpose of contractual interpretation because the pleading requirements laid down in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are not met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73] outlined four requirements of civil procedure which must be satisfied by parties seeking to rely on extrinsic evidence for the purpose of contractual interpretation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) first, parties who contend that the factual matrix is relevant to the construction of the contract must plead with specificity each fact of the factual matrix that they wish to rely on in support of their construction of the contract;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) second, the factual circumstances in which the facts in (a) were known to both or all the relevant parties must also be pleaded with sufficient particularity;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) third, parties should in their pleadings specify the effect which such facts will have on their contended construction; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) fourth, the obligation of parties to disclose evidence would be limited by the extent to which the evidence are relevant to the facts pleaded in (a) and (b).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The requirements in (a) and (c) are not met in this case. In respect of the requirement in (a), the Plaintiffs’ pleadings in both actions, comprising a Statement of Claim and Reply, <span class="font-italic">do not </span>make averments as to the design of the office entrances and no mention is made of Zenwan. Naturally, in respect of the requirement in (c), there is also no explanation as to the effect of such facts on the Plaintiffs’ contended construction of the Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 In general, extrinsic evidence which is placed before the court in a manner that is not consistent with the above requirements will not be accorded any weight when a court is construing a contract:<span class="font-italic"> Sembcorp </span>at [74]. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span> summarised three key benefits which accrue from adherence to the pleading requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> at [73]: (a) it reduces the practical burdens of litigation; (b) it ensures procedural fairness and substantive justice; and (c) it allows matters to proceed more expeditiously (at [49]). For present purposes, the second benefit – procedural and substantive justice – assumes particular importance. As the Plaintiffs failed to plead their reliance on the design of the office entrances, Grassland was not given a fair opportunity to adduce countervailing evidence. In theory, this could have included promotional material (other than the Poster) displayed in the offices which mention Zenwan or other third-party transport suppliers. Grassland may also have led evidence as to the location in which the Poster was displayed in the Boon Lay Office and Golden Mile Office and its size so as to shed light on how prominent it was to customers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In this light, I am not prepared to admit the evidence relating to the appearance of the entrances of the Boon Lay Office and Golden Mile Office for the purpose of interpreting the Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Second, I am also not minded to admit evidence of the get-up of the Bus under s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Evidence Act. The Plaintiffs rely on this evidence to establish that Zenwan’s involvement was not brought to their attention (see [108] above). I regard this as evidence of subsequent conduct as there is no proof that Grassland knew, at the time the Contracts were entered into, that Zenwan would be using a bus with a particular design. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [132(d)] stated that there “should be no absolute or rigid prohibition against evidence of … subsequent conduct, although, in the normal case, such evidence is likely to be inadmissible …”. The Court of Appeal subsequently confirmed in <span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals</span> [2019] 2 SLR 837 (“<span class="font-italic">MCH International</span>”) at [20] that it has not expressed a definitive view as to the admissibility of parties’ subsequent conduct for contractual interpretation. Nevertheless, in <span class="font-italic">MCH International</span> at [18]–[19], the court identified some “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">provisional</span> parameters” [emphasis in original in bold italics] for when evidence of subsequent conduct is admissible. Namely, the court must bear the following criteria in mind: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the subsequent conduct must be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear and obvious context;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual intention(s) remains paramount; and accordingly,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the subsequent conduct must always go toward proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 In this case, the evidence of the Bus’s exterior does not relate to a clear and obvious context. Evidence relates to a clear or obvious context if it would “allow the court to objectively ascertain a clearly defined or definable intention held by both parties with respect to how the contractual term in question should be interpreted” (see <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental</span><span class="font-italic"> Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart</span> [2012] 4 SLR 308 at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In my judgment, it is fatal that the evidence adduced does not even prove that the Bus did not feature <span class="font-italic">any</span> words or logos referencing Zenwan. All of the Plaintiffs’ AEICs, in both suits, contain the same stock paragraph stating that Grassland’s name, logo and website were painted on various parts of the Bus’s exterior:

Namely it appears to me that Grassland does not control the day-to-day operations of at least <span class="font-italic">some</span> of its third-party suppliers. Zenwan is obviously one such supplier. From Abdul Ghani’s evidence, I surmise that it is Zenwan who controlled the delivery of the bus transportation. Abdul Ghani’s 24 Sep AEIC states that Grassland sold seats to passengers “on buses <span class="font-italic">owned and operated</span> by Zenwan” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> This <span class="font-italic">could</span> be a factor weighing against the conclusion that Grassland undertook to provide the transportation service itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 However, I decline to admit the foregoing evidence under s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) for two reasons. First, the second pleading requirement formulated in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> requires that “the factual circumstances in which the [facts sought to be relied on] were known to <span class="font-italic">both or all </span>the relevant parties must also be pleaded with sufficient particularity” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span> at [73(b)]). While Grassland’s Defence in both actions does allege that the Bus and Chuah were owned and employed respectively by Zenwan, there is no evidence that the Plaintiffs knew this at the time the Contracts were formed. Neither did Grassland plead that this was so. Second, Grassland has not, in its Defence, specified the effect which such facts have on its contended construction of the Contracts. Grassland’s control (or lack thereof) over Zenwan is hence inadmissible for the purpose of construing the Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Interpretation in light of the admissible extrinsic evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 I now commence the task of interpretation itself. Given my conclusions in the preceding sub-section, I am unassisted by any admissible extrinsic evidence, subject to one observation I make at [218] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 First, since cl 19 is unenforceable, there is no express statement in the Contracts that Grassland was acting as a mere agent for the Plaintiffs. I note, however, that cl 18(i), states that the Company shall not be liable for “[a]ny cause beyond the reasonable control of [Grassland], the Travel Services and/or its principal(s)”. Clause 18(j) also states that Grassland shall not be liable for “[a]ny cancellation or alteration of the tour itinerary, hotel accommodation or tour services as a result of any of the aforementioned event or as a result of any decision, act or omission of the Company principal(s), their agents and servants or any of them.” However, I do not regard cll 18(i) and 18(j) as an undertaking by Grassland to act merely as an agent for the Plaintiffs or third-party suppliers. In fact, cl 18(i) specifically contemplates Grassland contracting as a principal, while recognising that it may act for a third-party principal in certain transactions. In this vein, the natural reading of cl 18(j) is that it simply elaborates on Grassland’s exclusion of liability in the situation where Grassland is not itself the principal to the contract with its customer. However, none of this amounts to an undertaking that Grassland acts purely in the capacity of an agent in all of its dealings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Immediately, this distinguishes the Contracts from those in <span class="font-italic">Craven </span>and <span class="font-italic">Bridges</span>. The contractual documents in those cases had express language which confined the defendant’s role to <span class="font-italic">arranging</span> for transportation by independent suppliers or that excluded the defendant’s responsibility for the conduct of its suppliers. In contrast, there is no similar language in the Contracts which precludes Grassland from undertaking to supply the transportation service itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Second, from the front page of the Booking Forms, a reasonable reader would obtain the impression that Grassland was supplying the coach transportation itself. My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 For one, the visual impact of the front page of the Booking Form is that there are no third parties involved in providing the bus transportation under the Contracts. In the header of the Manokarans’ Booking Form, only GET’s name and Grassland’s logo (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an image of a running horse) are featured.

</div> There is, conspicuously, no mention of third-party bus companies like Zenwan in the header, and, for that matter, any other part of the Booking Forms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Next, the language on the front page of the Booking Form is consistent with Grassland being the transport supplier. This is because Grassland is objectively seen to have a high degree of control over the deployment of buses and passengers’ seating on the buses. Under “Remark:” at the top half of the front page, it is stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1) There are no Toilet [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in 35 seater Super-VIP coach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2) Super-VIP can either be a Single Decker 26 seater Or a Double Deck 35 seater coach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3) If change to Double Decker coach, Seat No. subject to change without prior notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These “remarks” suggest that Grassland could determine the type of bus which the Plaintiffs would be carried on (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, single decker or double decker) and passengers’ seat numbers thereon. Absent the mention of third-party suppliers, the likely impression is that Grassland operated these buses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The information provided on the front of the Booking Form also suggests that it was a bus ticket issued by Grassland. The Booking Form is described as a “Two Way Tkt”. The seat numbers, type of bus on each leg of the two-way trip (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Super VIP-D/366)

</div> and relevant dates, times, pickup and alighting points pertaining to the journey are also stipulated. What is of particular significance is that the prescribed pickup location for the Manokarans and Wees on their Booking Forms was the Boon Lay Office and the Golden Mile Office respectively. Put another way, a reasonable reader would infer that he is reporting <span class="font-italic">to Grassland</span> on the departure date to board the bus bound for Genting Highlands. There is also a confirmation of “FULL PAYMENT” on the Booking Form to reflect, I presume, that Manokaran and Wee had handed Grassland’s representatives the necessary payment. Allied to this last-mentioned point is cl 16 of the Booking Form Terms and Conditions, which states that the “price paid to [Grassland] is solely for the <span class="font-italic">ticket</span> and does not include any other costs”

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> [emphasis added]. Viewing this information in the round, a reasonable reader would understand Grassland to be issuing a ticket for bus transportation which it is providing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Third, the Booking Form Terms and Conditions fortify, from an objective standpoint, the sense that Grassland is the bus transport supplier. These terms are consistent with Grassland having undertaken to provide the transportation itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 To begin with, I agree with the Plaintiffs that the following terms are inconsistent with Grassland being a mere booking agent. Clauses 7 and 11 state that “two-way coach tickets” and “[a]ll tickets / receipts / vouchers” will become invalid if the passenger is deported or refused entry by immigration or if the passenger fails to check in half an hour before departure respectively. However, if Grassland was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the carrier, but a true agent for the Plaintiffs (or Zenwan), the contract of carriage would exist between the Plaintiffs and Zenwan. In this counterfactual, I fail to see how Grassland would have a right to declare the tickets issued by Zenwan invalid. That the Booking Form Terms and Conditions set out rules of invalidity adds to the objective impression that the Booking Form is a ticket issued by Grassland. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Clause 6, however, does not objectively point to Grassland being the carrier. Limb (b) states that no <span class="font-italic">refund</span> shall be provided if a passenger is refused entry into Malaysia or Singapore. Even if it was a mere booking agent, it is understandable if Grassland had inserted this term out of the abundance of caution to pre-empt claims by dissatisfied customers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 I am also careful not to place too much weight on cl 12, which allows Grassland to replace the “Super-VIP Coach” with other types of coaches in the event of a breakdown. The PC in <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span> appears to have suggested that the first defendant (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tour operator) having the right to “change the means of transport provided for in the itinerary” was a factor weighing in favour of the first defendant undertaking to provide transportation services (at 754). However, Andrew Phang (as he then was before his elevation to the bench) in “On the Liability of Travel Agents: Construction, Implied Terms and Vicarious Performance” (1996) 11(1) Denning L.J. 91 (“Phang’s Article”) at 94–95 opined that this last-mentioned factor in <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee Wan</span> “does not … necessarily entail the full assumption of responsibility the Board attributed to the first defendant”. I agree. Even if Grassland was a mere booking agent, it would be in its commercial interests to take steps to ensure that its customers are not stranded <span class="font-italic">en route</span> to their final destination, or denied transportation <span class="font-italic">in toto </span>on account of a faulty bus. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Nonetheless, in addition to cll 7 and 11, the Booking Form Terms and Conditions depict Grassland as exercising control over the operation of the buses and the use of tickets. For instance, Grassland prohibits the transferability of tickets (cl 2) and re-arranging of seats (cl 13), limits each passenger to 10 kg of carry-on luggage (cl 10), requires passengers to fasten their safety belts once on the highway (cl 1) and confines the use of the bus toilet (if any) to urinating only (cl 14). In my judgment, these are operational decisions connected to the journey on the bus which a reasonable reader would expect the party providing the transportation service to determine, rather than a booking agent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 Further, the following clauses suggest that Grassland is assuming responsibility for the provision of the transportation service. Clause 9(a), for instance, states that Grassland “shall not be liable for any loss or damage to the passenger’s personal belongings and luggage (kept in the luggage compartment of the coach) <span class="font-italic">during the entire journey</span>” [emphasis added]. Clause 18(d) excludes liability for “[t]raffic congestion, vehicle breakdown, obstruction of any public / private road or highway”. I accept, however, that when these clauses are read in isolation, they are not unambiguous assumptions of responsibility to provide a transport service. Even a booking agent may contract on the basis of such clauses out of caution. As Lord Hoffman noted in <span class="font-italic">Beaufort Developments (N</span><span class="font-italic">.I.) Ltd v Gilbert-Ash N.I. Ltd</span> [1999] 1 AC 266 at 274, “[t]he fact is that even in legal documents (or, some might say, especially in legal documents) people often use superfluous words. Sometimes the draftsmanship is clumsy; more often the cause is a lawyer's desire to be certain that every conceivable point has been covered.” However, when cll 9(a) and 18(d) are read in the context of the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> Booking Form, I am satisfied they reinforce a reasonable reader’s understanding that Grassland undertook responsibility to provide transportation and was simply attempting to exclude its liability in certain respects through, among other clauses, cll 9(a) and 18(d). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 As such, while cll 18(i) and (j) show that Grassland does not always act as a principal, the information provided on the front of the Booking Form, and the clauses which portray Grassland as exercising close control over the operation of the bus (see [215] above) weigh more strongly in favour of showing that Grassland undertook to provide the bus transportation itself under these specific Contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 In sum, on an objective reading of the Contracts, Grassland undertook to transport the Plaintiffs from Singapore to Genting Highlands, and back, by bus. As intimated at [204] above, there is a final piece of extrinsic evidence, whose admissibility I have not yet determined. The Plaintiffs rely on this evidence to show that they were not informed by Xing Lina or Lye that they would be travelling on a bus that was not owned by Grassland at the time they had entered into the Contracts.

These “other ways” include where the parties contemplated the issue but chose not to: (a) provide a term for it because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had adequately addressed it; or (b) provide any term for it because they could not agree on a solution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 In the present case, the Plaintiffs submit that there is a gap in the Contracts insofar as they do not deal with “the liability and compensation of damages” in the event an accident occurs and the Plaintiffs sustain personal injuries, as in the present case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 However, I am not prepared to find that both parties failed to contemplate the issue of Grassland’s liability for failure to provide the transportation service with reasonable care. In their submissions, the Plaintiffs have not directed me to evidence that <span class="font-italic">Grassland</span> failed to contemplate this issue. In fact, in my judgment, cl 19, while unenforceable for the purpose of demonstrating that Grassland was merely an agent, prevents a true gap from arising. It is likely that Grassland contemplated (albeit erroneously) that cl 19 would prevent it from assuming any duty to provide the transportation service, including to provide such service with reasonable care. I regard this as an instance where the drafter of the contract mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract adequately addressed the issue. My finding in this regard is reinforced by cl 18, which attempts to exclude Grassland’s liability for, among other things, “accidents”. Although, whether cl 18 is enforceable for the purpose of excluding liability for negligence is a matter I return to later at [234] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 As I am unable to imply a term in fact, although the following was not argued by the Plaintiffs, I now consider whether it is appropriate to imply the following term in law: if a tour operator or an entity selling tours and/or tickets (“Retailer”) undertakes to supply a service, it is contractually obliged to provide such service with reasonable care (“the Implied Term in Law”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Cheng and Others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Cheng</span>”) summarised the principles on implied terms in law as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68  The ‘implied term in law’ is a peculiar feature of contract law, in that the law is concerned with considerations of <span class="font-italic">fairness and policy</span> rather than the intentions of the parties <span class="font-italic">per se</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span>, vol 9(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1998) (‘<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span>’) at para 778; [<span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>, vol 1 (Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (‘<span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>’)] at para 13-003. In <span class="font-italic">Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board</span> [1992] 1 AC 294, Lord Bridge drew the distinction between an implied term in fact and in law in the following manner (at 307):</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">A clear distinction is drawn … between the search for an implied term necessary to give business efficacy to a particular contract and the search, <span class="font-italic">based on wider considerations</span>, for a term which the law will imply as a necessary incident of a definable category of contractual relationship. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69  By implying a term in law, the court is laying down a general rule in law that certain terms will be implied in all contracts of a defined type, unless it is contrary to the express words of the agreement: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> at para 13-003. Indeed, some of the rules which the courts had previously implied have later become codified in statutory form: see for example, ss 10–15A of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). In short, the court is really “deciding what should be the content of a paradigm contract … [and] is in effect imposing on the parties a term which is most reasonable in the circumstances”: Andrew Phang Boon Leong, <span class="font-italic">Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston’s Law</span><span class="font-italic"> of Contract</span> (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 2001) at pp 263–264. However, this does not mean that any reasonable term will be implied in a contract: see <span class="font-italic">Liverpool City Council v Irwin</span> [1977] AC 239 at 262 (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Salmon). Indeed, a court should ordinarily exercise considerable restraint in implying a term in law, given that such a term extends and applies to all future like cases, rather than to the particular contract at hand and the immediate parties only as in the case of terms implied in fact: see [<span class="font-italic">F</span><span class="font-italic">orefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927] at [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 The test for whether a term should be implied in law is whether it is a necessary incident of a definable category of contractual relationship: <span class="font-italic">Scally </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Southern Health and Social Services Board and another</span> [1992] 1 AC 294 (“<span class="font-italic">Scally</span>”) at 306–307. The test of necessity in this situation is based on “wider considerations” than those for implied terms in fact (<span class="font-italic">Scally</span> at 307). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 It is apposite to refer to the House of Lord’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Liverpool City Council v Irwin and another</span> [1977] AC 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Liverpool</span>”). In that case, the defendants were the tenants of a maisonette on the ninth floor of a 15-floor tower block owned by the plaintiff. There was no formal tenancy agreement. However, in a list of tenants’ obligations prepared by the landlord and signed by the tenant, there were no express undertakings by the plaintiff (at 252–253). The lifts of the building were out of order, staircases unlit and the general conditions were appalling as a result of, among other reasons, vandalism. The defendants withheld payment of rent, alleging that the plaintiff had breached certain implied terms of the tenancy agreement. The plaintiff disputed the existence of such implied terms, but the House of Lords rejected the plaintiff’s arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Of particular interest is the court’s implication in law of a contractual duty on the part of landlords to take reasonable care to maintain the stairs, lifts and rubbish chutes, referred to as the “common parts” the building (at 254– 256). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Lord Wilberforce found that it was necessary to imply a duty on the landlord to maintain the common parts of the building because these were (at 256): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… an <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">essential means of access</span>, retained in the landlord's occupation, to units in a building of multi-occupation, for unless the obligation to maintain is, in a defined manner, placed upon the tenants, individually or collectively, the nature of the contract, and the circumstances, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">require</span> that it be placed on the landlord. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 Lord Wilberforce added that to leave the landlord “free of contractual obligation … and subject only to administrative or political pressure, is, …, inconsistent totally with the nature of [a landlord-tenant] relationship” (at 254). In a similar vein, Lord Salmon reasoned that if the landlord did not have a duty to at least use reasonable care to keep the lifts working properly and the staircase lit, the whole transaction becomes “inefficacious, futile and absurd” (at 262).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">230 As regards the standard of this duty of maintenance, Lord Wilberforce went on to clarify that the test of necessity only required the landlord to take reasonable care to keep the common parts in reasonable repair and usability. He explained as follows (at 256): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the test of the existence of the term is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">necessity</span> the standard must surely not exceed what is necessary having regard to the circumstances. To imply an absolute obligation to repair would go beyond what is a necessary legal incident and would indeed be unreasonable. An obligation to take reasonable care to keep in reasonable repair and usability is what fits the requirements of the case. Such a definition involves - and I think rightly - recognition that the tenants themselves have their responsibilities. What it is reasonable to expect of a landlord has a clear relation to what a reasonable set of tenants should do for themselves. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">231 In my view, if a tour operator or Retailer contractually undertakes to provide a particular service to its customers, it is indeed a necessary incident of this relationship that the former parties are required to take reasonable care in the provision of the service. It is wholly inconsistent with such a relationship, where customers place a degree of trust in the tour operator or Retailer to provide a service safely, often in a foreign land, that the tour operator or Retailer is completely free from obligation to exercise at least reasonable care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">232 I, like the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Liverpool</span>, also do not go so far as to require the tour operator or Retailer to, in absolute terms, provide the service safely. This would exceed what is necessary in the relationship. However, I consider it absurd if the service provider is not subject to an implied duty to at least take reasonable care in the performance of the service. That would allow the tour operator or Retailer <span class="font-italic">who has contractually undertaken</span> to provide the service to do so with wanton disregard for its customers’ safety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">233 As such, I am satisfied that Grassland, having undertaken to provide the bus transportation service under the Contracts, is subject to an implied term in law to provide such service with reasonable care. I also find support for such an implied term in law in the following commentaries. Phang, for instance, argued that there is no real obstacle in recognising such an implied term in law if one accepts the distinction between merely “arranging” and “wholly undertaking” to provide a service. The distinction, I surmise, is that the Implied Term in Law will only feature in the former type of undertaking: Phang’s Article at 98–99. He notes, further, that <span class="font-italic">Wong Mee </span><span class="font-italic">Wan</span> likely involved an implied term in fact (and is therefore of little assistance here) (at 98). Jack Beatson, Andrew Burrows &amp; John Cartwright in <span class="font-italic">Anson’s Law of Contract</span> (Oxford University Press, 29th Ed, 2010) at 154–155 also recognise the existence of such an implied term in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">234 I make three additional observations to place beyond doubt the appropriateness of recognising the Implied Term in Law. First, in my view, the Implied Term in Law does not contradict any of the express provisions of the Contract. This is significant because an implied term in law applies to all contracts of a defined type <span class="font-italic">unless</span> the implication of such a term would be contrary to the express words of the agreement: <span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Cheng </span>at [69]. Clause 19, being unenforceable by virtue of s 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the UCTA for the purpose of establishing that Grassland’s contractual undertaking was merely to act as an agent for the Plaintiffs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not to provide the transportation service itself), does not prevent the Implied Term in Law from arising. Clause 18 is similarly unenforceable by virtue of s 2(1) of the UCTA for the purpose of excluding Grassland’s liability for “death or personal injury resulting from negligence”. As such, cll 18 and 19 do not bar the implication of the Implied Term in Law in the Contracts. This outcome must be correct since I loathe to think that a party is able to avoid liability for breach of terms implied in law by the simple expedient of planting unenforceable clauses in the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 Second, while the Plaintiffs did not specifically plead an implied term in <span class="font-italic">law</span>, this does not prevent me from recognising one: <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 at [93].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">236 Finally, as explained at [90] above, the fact that Grassland sub-contracted the transportation service to Zenwan does not absolve Grassland from its contractual undertakings to the Plaintiffs. Therefore, even though it was Chuah who drove the Bus negligently, Grassland still breached the Implied Term in Law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the plaintiffs, other than Wee and Manokaran, were privy to the Contracts?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 Grassland finally submits that the Plaintiffs who did not sign the Contracts are not privy to the Contracts and therefore have no legal basis to recover damages under the Contracts.
