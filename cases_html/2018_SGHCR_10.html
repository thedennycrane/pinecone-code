It arises out of an action in oppression brought by the Plaintiffs under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2005 Rev Ed) (“CA”)) on behalf of the estate of the late Mr Mustafa s/o Majid Khan (the “Mustafa Estate”), in relation to the affairs of the 6th Defendant, Mohamed Mustafa &amp; Samsuddin Co. Pte Ltd (“MMSCPL”). The 1st to 5th Plaintiffs are the five younger children of the late Mr Mustafa while the 6th Plaintiff is his widow. The 1st Defendant is the eldest son of the late Mr Mustafa, the managing director of MMSCPL, and the sole administrator and trustee of the Mustafa Estate. The 2nd to 5th Defendants are the other directors of MMSCPL and they are, respectively, the 1st Defendant’s wife, his two children, and his brother-in-law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Defendants’ application is founded on three grounds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, they submit that the Plaintiffs do not have standing to commence this action, as they are merely the beneficiaries and not the personal representatives of the Mustafa Estate. While they accept that beneficiaries may, in special circumstances, take proceedings on behalf of an unadministered estate (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy (</span><span class="font-italic">administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Khim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>”)), they contend that the so-called “<span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception” does not apply here, as it <span class="font-italic">only </span>permits a beneficiary to “institute proceedings (on behalf of the estate) to <span class="font-weight-bold">recover assets </span>(as opposed to pursuing a cause of action <span class="font-italic">simplicitor</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[sic]) of an unadministered estate” [emphasis in original].

To this end, Mr Mustafa and Mr Shamsuddin (the 1st Defendant was away in India at the time of MMSCPL’s incorporation) executed the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of MMSCPL (“MMSCPL Constitution”) to govern their commercial relationship. Article 7 of the MMSCPL states, among other things, that unless otherwise provided by special resolution, all unissued shares must first be offered for subscription to all shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholding before being issued.

[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 After careful consideration of the competing arguments, I reject the first and second grounds put forward by the Defendants but accept, in part, the arguments they made in relation to the third ground.

However, s 216(7) of the CA grants standing to persons to whom “shares in the company have been transmitted by operation of law”, even if they are not registered members of the company. This is significant here because when a grant of administration is made, the whole of an intestate’s estate, including all shares and all choses in action, vests in the person to whom the grant is made (see s 37(4) of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) and the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ingall</span><span class="font-italic"> v Moran </span>[1944] 1 KB 160 at 167–168).  This dual transmission – of the title to the shares and the cause of action in oppression – by operation of law confers upon the personal representative of a deceased aggrieved member standing to bring an action in oppression (see <span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon on Company Law</span> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Woon</span><span class="font-italic"> on Company Law</span>”) at para 5.57).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 However, the difficulty here is that none of the Plaintiffs are the personal representatives of the Mustafa Estate. Instead, they are mere beneficiaries and do not, as such, have standing to sue on behalf of the Mustafa Estate (see the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Fong </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Lyn Carolyn v Kao Chai-Chau Linda </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1020 (“<span class="font-italic">Carolyn </span>Fong”) at [7]). This general rule is subject to the exception is that the courts will, in “special circumstances”, permit an action to be brought by a beneficiary on behalf of the estate (at [8]).

This suit was commenced before the appellant had extracted the grant of letters of administration for the estate and the respondent applied to strike the suit out on the ground that the appellant lacked standing. The suit was struck out by the High Court but reinstated on appeal. The Court of Appeal first began by affirming the general principle that the beneficiaries of an intestate estate have no equitable or beneficial interest in any particular assets comprised in an estate which is under administration, but only a right to have it administered properly. Thus, the court held that the appellant had no <span class="font-italic">personal </span>right to bring the action to seek the declaration in question (at [11]).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Against this background, two questions arise for consideration. The first is whether the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception entitles a party to bring an action in oppression on behalf of the estate or whether it is restricted only to actions for the recovery of property. The second question is whether there are “special circumstances that entitle the Plaintiffs to rely on the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The scope of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Wong Moy </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The rule that <span class="font-italic">only</span> the personal representative (which includes both executors and administrators) can take action on behalf of the estate is one of long standing. In <span class="font-italic">Bickley</span><span class="font-italic"> v Dorrington </span>(1737) 25 ER 877, a bill was filed by the creditors and a residuary legatee of a testator seeking the recovery of money owing to the estate. Lord Hardwicke LC held that the action was “totally improper” and “inconsistent with the principles of law and the rules of the court” (at 879). His Lordship explained his decision in the following way (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… No action or suit can be brought against a debtor to the estate but by the executor or personal representative of the testator. <span class="font-italic">The whole management of the estate belongs to him</span>. The right of it is vested in him, and cannot be taken away by creditors or legatees. If he release a demand and is solvent, it is a <span class="font-italic">devastavit</span> in him, and he is personally answerable for the sum released. <span class="font-italic">In cases of collusion or insolvency it may be proper to come here for satisfaction against the debtor; but there must always be some special case … Many inconveniences would attend this method of proceeding, except in cases particularly circumstanced …</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Carolyn Fong</span>, it was explained that confining the right of action to the personal representative has the salutary effect of avoiding a multiplicity of actions, which would not only subject the estate to the costs of divergent actions, but also result in the vexation of third parties, who might otherwise be subject to multiple actions (at [9]). The duty of a personal representative is to call in the assets of the deceased and distribute them according to law, and to that end he is empowered to take such proceedings as might be necessary to discharge this duty (see G Raman, <span class="font-italic">Probate and Administration in Singapore and Malaysia </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2012) at pp 157 and 165 and <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks on Executors, Administrators and Probate</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks</span>”) at para 55-08). This includes the commencement of such proceedings as the deceased could have taken in order to maximise the value of the estate, such as the taking of timely action to call in debts, and a personal representative may be liable if the estate suffers loss as a result of his failure to do so (see <span class="font-italic">Williams, Mortimer and </span><span class="font-italic">Sunnucks </span>at para 57-20). Thus, it has always been assumed that the interests of the beneficiaries are adequately protected against the adverse acts of third parties through actions instituted by personal representatives (see the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Alexander v Perpetual Trustees WA Limited </span>(2004) 204 ALR 247 at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The principal recourse for disgruntled beneficiary in the face of inaction by the administrator was to bring an administration action. In exceptional cases, however, beneficiaries could sue in the Court of Chancery to either (a) compel the administrator to take action or (b) to seek leave to sue in his name (see <span class="font-italic">Sharpe v San Paulo Railway Co </span>(1873) LR 8 Ch App 597 at 609 and the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in <span class="font-italic">Ramage</span><span class="font-italic"> v Waclaw </span>(1988) 12 NSWLR 84 at 89–93). Later, to avoid a multiplicity of actions, beneficiaries were permitted to bring both the leave application and the substantive suit itself in a single action (see the decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <span class="font-italic">Porker v Richards &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Ors </span>[2016] SASC 98 at [88]). In the United Kingdom (see the decision of the United Kingdom Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Roberts v Gill &amp; Co and another </span>[2011] 1 AC 240 (“<span class="font-italic">Roberts v Gill</span>”)) and New Zealand (see the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Cowan v Martin </span>[2014] NZAR 1197 at [53]), this is now known as a “beneficiaries’ derivative action”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The use of the expression “derivative” is helpful because it makes it clear that the beneficiaries are not exercising any right of action personal to them, but are instead bringing an action on behalf of the estate. As Lord Collins of Mapesbury JSC explained, “the beneficiary [in a derivative action] <span class="font-italic">stands in the place of the administrator and sues in the right of the estate,</span> and does not enforce duties owed to him rather than to the administrator” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Roberts v Gill</span> at [22]). In the seminal decision of the Privy Council (on appeal from the High Court of Australia) in <span class="font-italic">Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan Livingston </span>[1965] AC 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Livingston</span>”), Viscount Radcliffe put the point as follows (at 714A–C):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The basis of such proceedings is they are <span class="font-italic">taken </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">on behalf of the estat</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">e</span> and, if they are successful, they can only result in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the lost property being restored</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to the estate</span> for use in the due course of administration. <span class="font-italic">Thus, while they assert the beneficiary’s right of remedy, they </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">assert the</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">estate’s right of property</span><span class="font-italic">, not the property right of creditor or legatee</span>; indeed, the usual situation in which such an action has to be launched is that in which the executor himself, the proper guardian of the estate, is in default and thus his rights have to be put in motion by some other person on behalf of the estate. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Mr Yuen submitted that the use of the expression “lost property being restored to the estate” implies that the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception relates only to actions for the recovery of assets.

However, the widow herself passed away before the estate could be wholly administered and a question then arose as to whether, at the time of her death, she had a <span class="font-italic">beneficial</span><span class="font-italic"> interest</span> in the testator’s estate such as would attract the payment of succession duty under the relevant taxing statute. The Privy Council answered this question in the negative, affirming the long-standing principle that a beneficiary has no proprietary interest in any specific asset in an unadministered estate (see [22] above). In the course of his speech, Viscount Radcliffe addressed several criticisms that had been advanced against this principle, one of which was that it seemed to ignore cases where beneficiaries were permitted to bring a derivative action to “follow and recover assets which have been improperly abstracted from an estate” (at 714A). He explained that these cases did not in fact contradict the general principle because the beneficiaries in those cases were never exercising any cause of action <span class="font-italic">personal </span>to them, but were instead exercising the <span class="font-italic">estate’s </span>right of action (at 714B). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Viscount Radcliffe had referred specifically to cases involving actions for the recovery of lost property because his intention was to make it clear that they did not contradict the general proposition that beneficiaries have no proprietary interest in any specific asset in an unadministered estate, which was the principal issue in that case. The issue of the scope of the beneficiaries’ derivative action was <span class="font-italic">never </span>within his contemplation (indeed, the cases on a beneficiaries’ derivative action were only referred to in passing in a single paragraph of his Lordship’s speech). When seen in their proper context, therefore, it seems to me to be clear that the words “lost property restored to the estate” imply focus rather than exclusion, and cannot be used to justify any sort of limitation on the scope of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, such a reading would be contrary to principle. As I explained at [25]–[27] above, the whole point of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception is to allow beneficiaries to do what the personal representatives ought to have done to ensure that “the assets are properly dealt with and the rights that they hope will accrue to them in the future are safeguarded” (see <span class="font-italic">Livingston </span>at 713B <span class="font-italic">per </span>Viscount Radcliffe). To accomplish this, it is not enough that beneficiaries be allowed to take action to recover lost property, because this would limit the scope of a beneficiary’s derivative action only to the <span class="font-italic">preservation </span>of assets which are already in the estate. It would not allow them to take action to take steps to call in and realise the full value of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the estate (see [26] above). There does not appear to be any principled reason to permit beneficiaries to bring the former category of actions (that is, actions for the recovery of lost property), but not the latter category (actions to collect and realise the full value of the estate) when both types of action result in the realisation of property to the estate “for use in the due course of the administration” (see <span class="font-italic">Livingston </span>at 714B). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This view finds support in the decision of the Privy Council (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong) in <span class="font-italic">Joseph </span><span class="font-italic">Hayim Hayim v Citibank NA </span>[1987] AC 730 (“<span class="font-italic">Joseph </span><span class="font-italic">Hayim</span>”), where Lord Templeman summarised the position in the authorities as follows (at 748F–G):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These authorities demonstrate that <span class="font-italic">a beneficiary has </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no cause of action</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>against a third party <span class="font-italic">save in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">special circumstances</span> which embrace a failure, excusable or inexcusable, by the trustees in the performance of <span class="font-italic">the duty owned by the trustees to the beneficiary to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">protect the trust estate</span><span class="font-italic"> or to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">protect the interests of the beneficiary in the trust asset</span><span class="font-weight-bold">.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Two observations should be made about this passage. The first is that Lord Templeman clearly contemplates that a derivative action is to be brought in order that the beneficiaries can do <span class="font-italic">whatever</span> the personal representative/trustees ought (but failed) to do. This includes, among other things, the taking of timely action to call in debts (see [26] above) even though his cannot be characterised as an action for the recovery of estate property. The second is that he emphasises that actions may be taken not only to “protect the<span class="font-italic"> </span>trust estate”, but also the “interests of the beneficiary in the trust asset”. The latter is a wider category that would appear to embrace all actions which have as their object the realisation of the full value of the estate through, among other things, actions to recover possession of property (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Heslop</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Burns and another </span>[1974] 3 All ER 406) or actions to set aside void or voidable dispositions, such as those made by the deceased while under undue influence (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">In re Craig</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1971] Ch 95).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Third, the defendants’ proposed reading runs against the grain of contemporary authority. While earlier authority limited the beneficiary’s right of action only to equitable claims, this is no longer the modern position (see the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Lidden</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Composite Buyers Ltd and others </span>(1996) 67 FCR 560 at 552 and 553, followed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lamru</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Kation Pty Ltd </span>(1998) 9 BPR 16,571 at 16,574–16,15757 and the Australian Central Territories Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">John Patrick Davey v Valerie </span><span class="font-italic">Herbst, Adam Richard Herbst and Eric Malcolm Bray (No 2)</span> [2012] ACTCA 19 at [80]). Instead, it has been judicially recognised in Australia that the beneficiaries’ derivative action is not confined to any particular causes of action. In <span class="font-italic">Chahwan</span>, Brereton J held that (at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... the doctrine <span class="font-italic">is available in respect of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all causes of action</span><span class="font-italic"> which a trustee may have against third parties. </span>However, it must always be borne in mind <span class="font-italic">the action brought by a beneficiary in such a case is no more and no less than the action that the trustee would and could have brought against the third party.</span> It is a claim brought, albeit by the beneficiary, in the right of the trustee. … [emphasis in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 This is not to say that beneficiaries have <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>to pursue whatever causes of action they wish. The requirement of “special circumstances” serves as a fine mesh filter that sieves out actions which are properly brought by way of a derivative action and those which are not (see [47] below). This also appears to be the position in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Paul </span><span class="font-italic">Ching</span>, Steven Chong J (as his Honour then was) held that a beneficiary bringing a derivative action can “claim any reliefs on behalf of the estate” (at [58]). The limiting principle is that “a beneficiary allowed to take proceedings cannot be in a better position than a trustee carrying out his duties in a proper manner” (see <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>at [14]), citing 747C of <span class="font-italic">Joseph </span><span class="font-italic">Hayim</span>). This is entirely logical, for the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception only allows a beneficiary to exercise the estate’s right of action and cannot be invoked to confer upon the beneficiary a cause of action which even the administrator, acting on behalf of the estate, would not have.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Vivek Sudarshan Khabya </span>[2017] SGHC 120, which Mr Yuen cited, is instructive in this regard. The plaintiff was the wife of a man who died intestate. She commenced an action on behalf of her late husband’s estate against the defendant, who was the chief executive officer of a company of which her late husband was the sole shareholder. She claimed, among other things, that the defendant had misappropriated rental income which properly belonged to the subsidiaries of the company and sought (a) “an account of all money due to the beneficiaries of the Estate which was received by the defendant” and (b) “a declaration that the defendant is personally liable to make good all sums received by him as trustee or agent for the beneficiaries of the Estate” (at [54]). At the time she commenced the suit, the plaintiff had applied for, but not yet received, letters of administration but she argued, relying on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, that she had standing to bring the suit. The action was struck out by the Assistant Registrar at first instance, and the decision was upheld on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 George Wei J explained that while the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception would entitle the plaintiff to exercise <span class="font-italic">the estate’s </span>right of action, this was of little use in this context because the estate did not – as a mere shareholder – have any standing to bring an action to recover <span class="font-italic">the company’s</span> income or assets, let alone those of the company’s subsidiaries. At [55], he observed that “what stands between the beneficiaries of the Estate and the [rental income, among other things] themselves is not a trust but the corporate forms of [the company] and the 22 subsidiaries”. Any action against the defendant would therefore have to be taken by the aggrieved companies themselves. However, as I pointed out to My Yuen during the hearing, there is no such difficulty in this case as it is not disputed that the action in oppression is one which the personal representatives of the Mustafa Estate would have standing to bring (see [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 By reason of the foregoing, I was prepared to conclude that there was no reason, either in authority, principle, or policy, to conclude that the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception does not extend to the bringing of a claim in oppression. However, after the hearing, and after a draft of this judgment had been prepared, Hoo Sheau Peng J released her grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun v Yong Wah Poh (Sia Tze Ming, non party) </span>[2018] SGHC 142 (“<span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun</span>”), where she held that <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception only permitted a beneficiary to bring “proprietary claims to protect and preserve the assets of an estate” (at [50]). Given that <span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun </span>appeared to be directly relevant to the present issue, I invited the parties to tender further written submissions to address the case, and they both did. I record my appreciation to counsel for their assistance. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Sia</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Chin Sun</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 <span class="font-italic">Sia Chin Sun </span>concerned an action commenced by a testator while he was still alive. The precise nature of the testator’s case was, in the words of the Hoo J, “somewhat confusing”, but in gist the action was centred on two principle allegations. The first was that the defendant had misappropriated a total of $1.2m from the testator’s bank account as well as the account of his sole proprietorship. The second is that he had exercised undue influence to persuade the testator to transfer his share of a property in Emerald Garden to the defendant at an undervalue. The testator sought, among other things, an order that the defendant account to him for all “loss and damage” and an injunction prohibiting the defendant from disposing of his assets (at [13]). Less than a year after the action was commenced, the testator passed away. Probate proceedings were then commenced to determine, among other things, the question of who had the right to represent his estate. Before the probate proceedings could run their course, the testator’s daughter (who was a beneficiary under the testator’s will) applied, relying on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, for leave to intervene in the application to seek an interim injunction, on behalf of the estate of the testator, against the defendant to prevent him from disposing of his assets. This was resisted by the defendant on the ground that the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception only allowed a beneficiary to institute proceedings “where there were claims of a proprietary nature”, and that there was “no legal basis to permit a beneficiary to intervene pursue purely pecuniary claims” (at [23(a)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hoo J agreed with the defendant’s submissions on the scope of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception but disagreed that the present claim was one which concerned only pecuniary claims. At [27] of <span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun</span>, Hoo J held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With that in mind, I turn to the first point made by Mr Yong’s counsel that based on <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> a beneficiary does not have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to pursue purely pecuniary claims on behalf of an estate. It bears noting in this regard that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Omar</span> cited the following remarks from <span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson, deceased </span>[1971] VR 612 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson</span>”) at 700 to explain that the basis for such proceedings by a beneficiary is that “they are taken on behalf of the estate and if they are successful, they can only result in the lost property being restored to the estate for use in the due course of administration. Thus, while they assert the beneficiary’s right of remedy, they assert the estate’s right of property…” <span class="font-italic">Therefore, I agreed with Mr Yong’s counsel’s contention that a beneficiary would not have locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi to pursue a personal claim with pecuniary reliefs on behalf of the estate. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Any proceedings must be grounded in the need to protect and preserve the assets of the estate.</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Turning to apply this to the facts, Hoo J first rejected the contention that a claim for the return of money could not be a proprietary claim, observing that “[m]oney belonging to an estate is as much an asset … as any other asset of the estate” (at [29]). On this basis, she held that the claim for the return of money was a proprietary claim because a tracing order had been prayed for (at [30]). Likewise, she held that the claim in relation to the Emerald Garden property was also a proprietary claim, as the gist of the testator’s claim was that no consideration had in fact been provided for the transfer (at [31]). Thus, she concluded that “the action [was] one giving rise to both personal and proprietary claims in relation to the money belonging to the estate”, and was therefore properly brought under the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>exception (at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The crux, as I see it, is the dichotomy between “proprietary claims” and “purely pecuniary claims”. Hoo J did not explain precisely what she meant by this, but as a starting point, it seems to me that her Honour could not have in mind the distinction, applied in the conflict of laws, between (a) proceedings against a <span class="font-italic">res </span>concerning title to property and (b) purely <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam </span>claims (see, generally, <span class="font-italic">The Republic of the Philippines v </span><span class="font-italic">Maler Foundation and others and other appeals </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1389 at [64]–[66] and [84]<span class="font-underline">)</span>. This is because Hoo J held that the claim for the return of the $1.2m, and the Emerald Garden property claim were <span class="font-italic">both</span> proprietary claims even though neither of them related <span class="font-italic">per se </span>to the question of title (at [30]–[31]). It is also equally clear that Hoo J did not mean that a proprietary claim must be one for the <span class="font-italic">return of estate assets</span> because the action was commenced when the testator was still alive and his estate had not been constituted yet. Furthermore, the claim for arising out of the $1.2m allegedly misappropriated is plainly framed as an <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> action against the defendant for breach of trust in respect, as the testator had sought the remedies of equitable compensation and an account of profits, both of which are personal, and not proprietary, remedies (see the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span> <span class="font-italic">Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 at [34] and [101]). (Tracing is neither a cause of action nor a remedy, but an evidential tool: see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 at [114].) </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 What, then, did Hoo J mean by a “proprietary claim”? It seems to me that the answer is given in the final sentence of [27]: it is a claim which has as its <span class="font-italic">object</span> the protection and preservation of the assets of the estate. By this measure, the present action in oppression passes muster since its whole purpose is to protect the value of the Mustafa Estate’s shares in MMSCPL (and to realise their full value) by seeking redress for the harm caused by the defendants’ allegedly oppressive acts. To this end, the Plaintiffs seek, among other things, an order that the 1995 and 2001 Share Allotments be reversed and that MMSCPL be wound up in order that the value of the Mustafa Estate’s shareholding can be realised.

</div> It is plain that any judgment obtained here would not merely be a “monetary judgment flowing from a successful claim for personal relief”, which Hoo J held cannot be brought under <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> (at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, I am mindful that what is before me is an application for striking out. As the Court of Appeal cautioned in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati 5 </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [76], “knotty points of law requiring serious argument … should not be decided by a court exercising summary jurisdiction”. Given the novelty and importance of the point in issue, I am satisfied that this is a case where this principle should apply, and it is sufficient that I consider that it is at least arguable that the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception would allow a beneficiary to bring an action in oppression on behalf of an estate. My view would not change even if it were held that I was wrong in my interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun</span>. As Choo Han Teck J held in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation </span><span class="font-italic">Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2015] SGHC 44, even if the law were settled (which I do not think it is), it would still be open for a party “to try and unsettle it” and it would not be proper for such an attempt to be stymied at an interlocutory stage through an application for striking out (at [11]–[14]). This is subject, of course, to the caveat that it must not be “plain and obvious” that its attempt is doomed to fail, but for the reasons set out above, I do not think that is the case here. With that, I turn now to consider the issue of whether there are “special circumstances” that entitle the Plaintiffs to rely on the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> exception.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there are special circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Mr Yuen contends that the Plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception because they have not “exhausted all possible means to protect the estate”.

</div>
</div> With respect, I cannot agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, the Court of Appeal said that in deciding whether a beneficiary should be permitted to institute proceedings on behalf of the estate “all the circumstances of the case should be considered”, and in the course of that inquiry it “may<span class="font-italic"> </span>be pertinent to see whether the circumstances made it ‘impossible, or at least seriously inconvenient for the representatives to take proceedings’” (at [28]). In <span class="font-italic">Carolyn Fong</span>, Chong JA explained that the list of “special circumstances” is not closed and the courts would have to consider a wide range of factors, including “the executor’s unwillingness or inability to sue, the merits of the case, and the potential loss to the beneficiaries” in determining whether the test is satisfied (at [8] and [9]). The short point is that while the availability of alternative avenues of redress is certainly a relevant factor, Mr Yuen has not pointed me to any authority which states that the exhaustion of alternative remedies is a <span class="font-italic">condition precedent</span> to the availability of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception. Indeed, any such submission would appear to be untenable in light of <span class="font-italic">Sia</span><span class="font-italic"> Chin Sun</span>, where the beneficiary was permitted to bring a claim even though there were ongoing probate proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the facts, there is at least one factor which weighs strongly in favour of the plaintiffs’ position, and it is that the administrator of the estate – the 1st Defendant – is himself one of the defendants in this suit. On the authority of    <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, this is a “pertinent” factor that weighs in favour of the grant of relief.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Of course, this alone is not determinative, and the court will have to consider matters in the round before deciding whether to allow the Plaintiffs recourse under the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>exception, but it is not for me, at this interlocutory stage, to perform this exercise. It is sufficient for me to conclude, which I have no hesitation in doing, that it is not “plain and obvious” that the Plaintiffs’ attempt will fail.

Before I turn to the substantive arguments, I will first deal with a preliminary point. The corporate claims argument was only raised for the raised time in the reply affidavit which was filed by the 1st Defendant on 16 May 2018. It was neither raised in the body of the summons nor in the supporting affidavit which was filed by the 3rd Defendant in support of this application on 4 April 2018. Ms Rai objected strongly to the way in which this ground had been raised, arguing that her clients were prejudiced in not being able to reply to it.

</div> The second, which is prayed for in the alternative, is that only the paragraphs in the SOC listed in Schedule 1 of the Summons, all of which which relate to the Wrongful Share Allotments claim, be struck out. There is <span class="font-italic">no</span> indication of the paragraphs that ought to be struck out if it were found that the Wrongful Misappropriation claim cannot be brought in this suit.

</div> In my view, this omission is fatal. It is settled law that if a party wishes for the court to strike out any part of a pleading, it is incumbent upon that party to state, in clear and unambiguous terms, “the exact words or passage[s] or lines in the pleadings that are sought to be struck out” (see the decision of the Malaysian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Leela Ratos &amp; Ors v Anthony Ratos s/o Domingos Ratos &amp; Ors </span>[1996] 3 MLJ 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Leela Ratos</span>”) at 179). It is no answer to this objection to say, as Mr Yuen did during the hearing, that it would suffice for me to make an order that “all paragraphs relating to [the Wrongful Misappropriation claim] be struck out”.

</div> In this regard, the following extract from the judgment of Kamalanathan Ratnam JC in <span class="font-italic">Dr </span><span class="font-italic">Leela Ratos </span>is instructive (at 179–180): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Buckley J held in <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss </span><span class="font-italic">Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd &amp; Ors (No 3)</span> [1970] Ch 506 that where a party sought to strike out some part of his opponent's pleading, he had to indicate clearly exactly what it was he wanted struck out; if the allegation objected to was not in express terms, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it was not sufficient merely to ask that it be struck out 'in so far as it may contain' such an allegation</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>I am of the view that the duty of an applicant to strike out a paragraph or part thereof is to identify that which is sought to be struck out. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It does not behove an applicant to be vague and ambiguous in his application as to the prayers he wants, and to rely on such prayers on matters averred to in his affidavit. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An affidavit is to support the application, not vice versa.

The danger, as I see it, is two-fold. First, an order that a pleading be struck out “in so far as” it relates to a particular claim is so vague as to be thoroughly unhelpful, and will just lead to more downstream litigation over the precise terms of compliance with the order. Second, it places both the respondent and the court in an invidious position as it would be difficult, if not impossible, to defend or decide the application when the precise scope of it has not been properly defined and is liable to be enlarged through further material put forward on affidavit. In my view, this is sufficient to dispose of this ground of the application. However, in the event that I am wrong on this, and in deference to the extensive arguments advanced by counsel on this issue, I will give my reasons for why I would not have allowed the application on this ground even if it had been properly brought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The distinction between personal and corporate wrongs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee v Sim City Technology Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 723 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Kek Wee</span>”), the Court of Appeal explained that there were two main reasons why s 216 of the CA cannot be used to “vindicate essentially corporate wrongs”. First, it would undermine the legislative scheme which contemplates that corporate claims should be pursued by way of a derivative action under s 216A of the CA, for which leave is required, instead of an oppression claim under s 216 of the CA, in respect of which there is no leave requirement. Second, it would result in an “improper circumvention” of the proper plaintiff rule (at [63]–[65]). In its recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings and other appeals </span>[2018] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae (CA)</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out the following analytical framework to assist parties in distinguishing between personal and corporate wrongs in the context of s 216 of the CA (at [116]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 … In our judgment, the appropriate analytical framework to ascertain whether a claim that is being pursued under s 216 is an abuse of process is as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) <span class="font-weight-bold">Injury</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the real injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  Is that injury distinct from the injury to the company and does it amount to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff?</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) <span class="font-weight-bold">Remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) What is the essential remedy that is being sought and is it a remedy that meaningfully vindicates the real injury that the plaintiff has suffered?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Is it a remedy that can only be obtained under s 216?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In cases involving a miscellany of different complaints, the proper approach is to proceed in two steps (see the decision of the Newfoundland Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Pappas v </span><span class="font-italic">Acan Windows Inc </span>(1991) 2 BLR (2d) 180<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [110] and [111], approved by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Eck Hong v </span><span class="font-italic">Maxz Universal Development Group Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 309<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]). First, the court should examine if the derivative and personal claims are so “‘intermingled’ and ‘inextricably woven’ that the cause of action is of an essentially derivative character. If this is the case, the action cannot be allowed to proceed. If, however, the “personal claims can be clearly separated from the derivative claims as to permit their continuance while discontinuing the derivative claims”, then the court should move to the second step, which is to consider whether to exercise its discretion in the plaintiff’s favour. With these points in mind, I turn to characterisation of the Wrongful Misappropriation claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The characterisation of the Wrongful Misappropriation claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mr Yuen’s argument is a short one. He submits that the Wrongful Misappropriation claim is, on its face, plainly a corporate claim, as it is one which seeks redress for a wrong done to the company – the misappropriation of company funds. He accepts that the usurpation of corporate assets for personal purposes can, in some cases, amount to minority oppression. However, he contends that in all the cases where such an argument was accepted, there was something <span class="font-italic">more </span>than the mere act of misappropriation or breach of fiduciary duty (almost invariably, this comes in the form of a legitimate expectation between the shareholders) which transmuted the corporate wrong into a personal one. However, he submits that this critical ingredient is missing here.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I was initially persuaded by Mr Yuen’s argument. At first blush, the Wrongful Appropriation claim appears to be a quintessential example of a corporate claim, as the injuries (the lost funds, the exposure to possible criminal and civil liability etc.) were sustained solely by MMSCPL. The Mustafa Estate’s losses, it would appear, arise solely out of the diminution of the value of its shares, which makes it reflective loss that cannot found an independent cause of action. It would therefore seem to follow that if the alleged misappropriations are to be seen not only as a corporate wrong against MMSCPL, but also as a separate and distinct wrong committed against the late Mr Mustafa, then <span class="font-italic">something more</span> must, but has not, been shown. On reflection, however, I consider that this is not the right approach to adopt. In this regard, I found the following remarks of Millett J in the decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) </span>[1990] BCLC 760<span class="font-italic"> </span>to be instructive (at 783<span class="font-italic">f</span>–<span class="font-italic">h</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Counsel for the petitioners asked: 'If misconduct in the management of the company's affairs does not without more constitute unfairly prejudicial management, what extra ingredient is required?' <span class="font-italic">In my judgment the distinction between misconduct and unfairly prejudicial management does not lie in the particular acts or omissions of which complaint is made, but in the nature of the complaint and the remedy necessary to meet it.

[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The phrase “not a supermarket trolley but a hologram” is piquant and evocative. The proper approach is not to ascertain whether the individual acts or omissions would<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, in and of themselves, be characterised simply as corporate wrongs, before then considering whether they can nevertheless be said to have been oppressive because of some additional factor. Instead, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the court ought</span> to ascertain the true nature of the plaintiff’s complaint in the context of the pleadings as a whole, having regard both to the “real injury” sought to be vindicated and the “essential remedy” sought (see <span class="font-italic">Sakae (CA) </span>at [116(a)(i)], cited at [52] above), in order to determine the true character of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Reading the SOC in its totality, the constant refrain which is repeated throughout is that the Defendants had abused their directorships and conducted MMSCPL’s affairs with the principal purpose of benefiting themselves at the expense of the minority shareholders. For instance, it is pleaded the 1995 and 2001 Share Allotments were “devised by [the 1st Defendant] and/or [the 2nd Defendant] for [the 1st Defendant’s] own benefit, and consequently for [the 1st Defendant’s] own family”.

The essential remedy the Plaintiffs seek is that MMSCPL be wound up, which is relief that is only available under s 216 of the CA.

While the Mustafa Estate was only formed after many of the events which are complained of happened, this is quite beside the point.

Given that there is no question that the late Mr Mustafa would have been able to bring a claim in respect of the 1995 Share Allotment while he was alive, anyone clothed with the authority to act on behalf of his estate would likewise be able to bring such a claim today.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factual sustainability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Next the Defendants contend that the claim is factually unsustainable because<span class="font-italic"> </span>the 1995 and 2001 Share Allotments were – contrary to what was pleaded in the SOC – authorised by the Resolutions in accordance with the MMSCPL Constitution and therefore cannot be said to be oppressive (see [15] above).

                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-d209830c-d5be-4261-ba5e-5f803c35583e" data-toggle="modal" type="button">66</button></sup>

In this regard, they point to, among other things, the fact that (i) neither of them could read or write English and therefore could not have known the purpose of the Resolutions; (ii) both of them routinely “sign[ed] documents blindly”; and (iii) in 1995, Mr Mustafa was already ailing and accepted whatever the 1st Defendant told him as he trusted him implicitly.

</div> For instance, the issue of the authenticity of the signatures on the Resolutions is not one that can be resolved by the speculations of laypersons, however familiar they might be with the handwriting of the purported signatory. Instead, it is a matter that must be given proper forensic treatment, and it is possible that expert evidence might have to be led. Likewise, the allegations that Mr Mustafa lacked mental capacity must be tested by reference to the testimony of persons familiar with Mr Mustafa’s condition at the relevant time. It is not possible for this to be resolved on the basis of affidavit evidence alone, without the benefit of further discovery and cross-examination. The problem, however, is that that <span class="font-italic">none </span>of the allegations have been pleaded. This poses a particular difficulty in this context as the allegations – which raise, among other things, arguments of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum </span>and forgery – are serious and must be specifically pleaded (see O 18 r 8 of the Rules and <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”) at para 18/8/26).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In these circumstances, and putting aside for now the question who is to blame for the absence of these points from the RDCC (the Plaintiffs contend that blame lies at the Defendants’ door because of their late disclosure of the shareholders’ resolutions),

</div> I would have thought it quite unarguable that the proper way forward would be to order an amendment, since the general approach of the courts in such cases is to save rather than destroy (see the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and another appeal </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [12]). It is for this reason that I invited the Plaintiffs to amend their pleadings. However, the Plaintiffs declined the invitation and submitted instead that no amendment was necessary nor should one be ordered, because even without the additional material introduced in the reply affidavits, the present application would have been bound to fail because a claim in oppression can be brought even if the plaintiff had signed a shareholders’ resolution approving the impugned act.

</div> With respect, I cannot agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As a starting point, I accept that a claim in oppression can be brought even if the plaintiff had signed a shareholders’ resolution approving the impugned act. However, this alone is not sufficient to save the SOC from being liable to be struck out. The issue, as I see it, turns on the burden of proof. In order to explain this, it is useful to start by considering the three cases cited by Ms Rai. In <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bonvests Holdings Ltd </span>[2010] 2 SLR 776 (“<span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over</span>”), the Court of Appeal found that a share transfer was oppressive even though the minority shareholder had consented to it, because the circumstances were such that the majority shareholder had contrived to give the minority little choice but to agree (at [102]–[105]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Sakae Holdings Ltd v Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corp Pte Ltd and others (Foo </span><span class="font-italic">Peow Yong Douglas, third party) and another suit </span>[2017] SGHC 73 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakae (HC)</span>”), the High Court found that an act was oppressive even through it had been approved by a shareholders’ resolution signed by the chairman of the plaintiff’s board of directors (Mr Foo). Critical to the court’s reasoning was its finding that Mr Foo had signed the resolution without paying heed to its contents as he trusted one of the defendants (Mr Ong) unquestioningly because he saw their interests as being completely aligned (at [154]–[156]). By contrast, the opposite result was reached in <span class="font-italic">Thio</span><span class="font-italic"> Syn Kym Wendy and others v Thio Syn Pyn and others</span> [2017] SGHC 169 (“<span class="font-italic">Wendy </span><span class="font-italic">Thio</span>”). The issue before the court there was whether the act of the defendant-brothers in procuring the payment of performance bonuses to themselves as reimbursement for legal fees which they had incurred in defending themselves in a personal suit commenced against them by their father was oppressive. The court held that it was not, because the evidence was that plaintiffs were fully aware of the purpose of the performance bonuses “and had in fact knowingly facilitated them” (at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 What unites <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sakae</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> is that the plaintiffs had led cogent evidence to show they had not <span class="font-italic">freely and knowingly </span>consented to the acts in question. This was a critical part of their case. If they had not done so, their claims in oppression would have failed, for it does not lie in one’s mouth to complain that the acts which one has approved are oppressive. This was precisely where the claim in <span class="font-italic">Wendy </span><span class="font-italic">Thio </span>faltered. Prakash JA held that while it was not “good corporate practice for directors to take money from the company to fund personal litigation … [their doing so could not constitute] commercial unfairness since all the plaintiffs were complicit in it” (at [93]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The gravamen of the Plaintiffs’ complaint in the Wrongful Share Allotments claim is that the Defendants had contrived to allow the 1st Defendant to “acquire further shares in MMSCPL at a steep discount, thereby diluting the Mustafa Estate’s shareholding in MMSCPL in the process.”

If they are unable to attack the Resolutions by showing that Mr Mustafa and/or Mr Shamsuddin had not <span class="font-italic">freely and knowingly </span>consented to the 1995 and 2001 Share Allotments – as the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sakae </span>had done but which they would not be able to, if they do not raise this in their pleadings – then it does seem to me that they can make good their case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Furthermore, it is plain that there are parts of the SOC which cannot stand in the light of the material which has been put forward. The most obvious is the statement that the defendants had “disregarded” certain terms of the MMSCPL Constitution because they “did not obtain” any shareholders’ resolutions authorising the Share Allotments.

</div> Given that the Defendants have now produced the Resolutions, this statement is either factually incorrect or critically ambiguous, because it is not clear if the Plaintiffs’ position is that the documents are forgeries or do not comply with the terms of the MMSCPL Constitution or otherwise. On the one hand, the Plaintiffs state that they “do not admit to the authenticity” of the Resolutions because they do not accept that the signature on the 1995 Resolution was Mr Mustafa’s; on the other hand, they say that even if the signature was Mr Mustafa’s, he “would not have understood” what he was signing (see [64] above).

</div> These are clearly alternatives that are mutually exclusive, and while they might plausibly be pleaded in the alternative, this must be stated clearly in the pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The next concerns the statement that the 5th Defendant was complicit in the 1995 Share Allotment. At the material time, the 5th Defendant was <span class="font-italic">not </span>a director of MMSCPL, and was only its company secretary. As a matter of law, company secretaries exercise <span class="font-italic">administrative</span>, and not <span class="font-italic">executive</span> functions and have no power to make commercial decisions such as those involving the placement of new shares (see <span class="font-italic">Woon</span><span class="font-italic"> on Company Law </span>at para 7.5–7.6 and Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) at paras 08.097). Furthermore, there is nothing in the affidavits which suggest that the 5th Defendant was involved in the passing of the 1995 Resolution. In fact, the only evidence is to the contrary. The 1995 Resolution records that the decision to approve the 1995 Share Allotment was taken by the 1st and 2nd Defendants and Mr Mustafa and Mr Shamsuddin. The 5th Defendant’s only role, as far as it appears from the face of the 1995 Resolution, was to file the necessary forms with the Registry of Companies.

</div>
</div> Thus, I agree with Mr Yuen that the paragraphs alleging the complicity of the 5th Defendant in the 1995 Share Allotment must either be amended or struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In any event, I note that the court always has the power to order an amendment of the pleadings of its own motion. In this regard, O 20 r 8(1) of the Rules provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amendment of certain other documents (O. 20, r. 8)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8.—(1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties to any proceedings, or of correcting any defect or error in any proceedings, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings and either of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings order any document in the proceedings to be amended on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It has been said that in an adversarial system of justice such as ours, this power will rarely be exercised. However, it is one which is always available to allow the court “to raise the real point at issue between the parties, and to ensure that [the] proceedings are free from errors and defects” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at paras 20/8/4 and 20/8/5). I am satisfied that this a fitting case for this power to be exercised because the Plaintiffs themselves admit that the crux of the issue is whether Mr Mustafa had freely and knowingly approved the 1995 Share Allotment, and that in order to decide this, the court must (but presently cannot, because they have not been pleaded) consider all the points raised at [64] above.

</div> Thus, even if the Wrongful Share Allotments claim were not liable to be struck out without an amendment, I would nevertheless have been minded to order that the pleadings be amended to ensure that all the allegations made in the affidavits which ought to be specifically pleaded are included.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 This brings me to the form of the order. I am mindful that it is not for the court force upon the parties amendments which they do not ask for (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 20/8/4). Thus, I propose to grant the Plaintiffs leave to amend their SOC and RDCC to address the matters set out at paragraphs [63]–[74] above without specifying the precise form that the amendments should take. If necessary, I will review the proposed amendments and hear arguments on their propriety at a separate hearing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the reasons set out above, I decline to strike out the SOC, whether in whole or in part, and instead order that both the SOC and RDCC be amended.
