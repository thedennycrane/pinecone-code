There is, therefore, no obstacle in this case to this court assessing the plaintiff’s claim for the USD 465,099.50 Invoices and the claim for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice separately. During the hearing, the defendant’s counsel, Ms Charmaine Chan-Richard, also separated the treatment of the plaintiff’s claims in her submissions in a similar fashion. I will therefore consider each of these claims in turn, but before I do so, I first touch on the applicable legal principles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The legal principles governing an application for summary judgment are well-settled. The plaintiff has to first demonstrate a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for summary judgment. If he cannot do so, the application ought to be dismissed. Once the plaintiff has crossed that threshold, the tactical burden then shifts to the defendant opposing the application (<span class="font-italic">M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko </span>[2015] 1 SLR 325 (“<span class="font-italic">M2B</span>”) at [17]-[18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In order to obtain leave to defend, a defendant must “establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence” (<span class="font-italic">M2B</span> at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Our courts have repeatedly emphasised that leave to defend would not be granted if “all the defendant provides is a mere assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the basis of his defence” (<span class="font-italic">M2B </span>at [19], citing <span class="font-italic">Prosperous Credit Pte Ltd v Gen Hwa Franchise International Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[1998] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [14]). Therefore, bare assertions in an affidavit will not get a defendant very far in resisting an application for summary judgment against him. The assertions must be supported by some evidence, whether direct or indirect, and the evidence itself must be reasonably capable of belief (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 20</span><span class="font-italic">20, vol 1 </span>(Chua Lee Ming editor-in-chief) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2019) (<span class="font-italic">“Singapore Civil Procedure”</span>) at para 14/4/5).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Following from the principles above, the court will not grant leave if the assertions in the affidavit are equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements from the same deponent, or inherently improbable in themselves (<span class="font-italic">M2B</span> at [19] citing <span class="font-italic">Bank Negara Malaysia v Mohd Ismail</span> [1992] 1 MLJ 400). As pointedly noted by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam”</span>) at [39], whilst a summary judgment application is not to be dealt with as if it were a trial on affidavits, it does not mean that anything stated in the affidavits is to be accepted without rational consideration to determine if there is a fair or reasonable probability of a real defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The approach to be adopted in determining whether summary judgment ought to be ordered where there is a subsisting counterclaim is helpfully summarised in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 14/4/10 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Whether a summary judgment ought to be ordered where there was a subsisting counterclaim will be decided based on a practical framework. First, if the counterclaim was plausible and second, if the plausible counterclaim amounted to a defence of set-off (legal or equitable), then unconditional leave to defend would be granted in respect of the entire claim. On the other hand, if the counterclaim did not amount to a defence of set-off and it was clear that the claim must succeed, and that the plaintiff would only be put to expense in proving his claim, then judgment ought to be given to the plaintiff in respect of the entire claim. Nevertheless, where the plausible counterclaim was sufficiently connected to the claim and where there were grounds for a stay of execution in light of the connected and plausible counterclaim, the court may exercise its discretion to stay the execution on the judgment until the counterclaim had been tried (<span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid Pte</span><span class="font-italic">.

Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden) </span>[2018] 3 S.L.R. 34 at [97]–[98])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Where a counterclaim is not sufficiently plausible as to amount to a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence, the court can nevertheless consider whether it would be appropriate to grant conditional leave to defend. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Akfel Commodities Turkey Holding Anonim Sirketi v Townsend, Adam </span>[2019] 2 SLR 412 (“<span class="font-italic">Akfel”</span>) held at [41] that where “what the defendant has shown does not amount to a fair probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence, but only that the defence raised is not hopeless, it is warranted for the court to impose conditional leave to defend”. The court would “reserve the grant of conditional leave to cases where the defendant’s evidence has <span class="font-italic">not yet reached </span>the level of showing a reasonable probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence, a fair case for defence, reasonable grounds for setting up a defence or a fair probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence” (<span class="font-italic">Akfel </span>at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As held in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam </span>at [44] and affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Akfel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]<span class="font-italic">, </span>a “condition is appropriate when the court has the sense that although it cannot be said that the claimed defence is so hopeless that, in truth, there is no defence, the overall impression is such that some demonstration of commitment on the part of the defendant to the claimed defence is called for”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The USD 465,099.50 Invoices Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Having set out in the foregoing paragraphs the principles germane to this appeal, I turn now to the plaintiff’s claims.

Nor did the defendant dispute the amount claimed by the plaintiff under the USD 465,099.50 Invoices at any material time (leaving aside the counterclaims raised by the defendant in this action by way of set-off). On this score alone, I was satisfied that the plaintiff had demonstrated a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment. The tactical burden therefore shifted to the defendant to satisfy me that there existed a fair or reasonable probability of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In relation to its delay counterclaim, the defendant submitted that the parties had an oral agreement in place as to when the memory cards should be delivered. The defendant’s case was that the cards would be delivered within seven to ten days of the plaintiff receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafers. The defendant contended that, in breach of this agreement, the plaintiff did not deliver the memory cards under the USD 465,099.50 Invoices on time.

</div> The plaintiff also exhibited certain Powerpoint slides which it claimed had been sent to the defendant containing the plaintiff’s business proposal. One of the slides contained the statement “Delivery- From 7 days after receiving materials”. Notwithstanding this, the parties understood that delivery would in fact commence within 7 to 10 days after it received the materials because the plaintiff would only purchase the ASolid flash controllers after receiving the Hynix semi-conductor wafers, which process took an additional two to three days.

</div> Given that the defendant pleaded that time of delivery was of the essence, it would follow that the defendant should have raised objections with the plaintiff to the late shipments or to the payment of invoices had there in fact been delays in delivery by the plaintiff and/or any losses thereby suffered by the defendant, as now asserted by the defendant. None of the affidavits filed by the defendant to resist the summary judgment application contained any evidence of any objections, whether by way of correspondence or otherwise, being raised by the defendant.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and My Decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In my view, both the delay and shortfall defence and counterclaims do not raise triable issues that would warrant granting the defendant leave to defend. The evidence with the greatest probative value in the present case would be the contemporaneous communications and correspondence exchanged at the material time. The primary question that the defendant left unanswered was why the defendant did not at any time, in any of the contemporaneous correspondence, raise any complaints or protests about delays in delivery and/or shortfalls in quantities delivered, or bring the alleged defence and counterclaims to the plaintiff’s attention in some shape or form. This silence was, in my view, telling and significantly undermined the defendant’s attempts to demonstrate that either alleged defence and counterclaim was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or plausible. It also did not assist the defendant that there was no credible or plausible explanation for the defendant’s silence. Whilst Mr Shanmugam attempted, in his further affidavit filed for the appeal (see [3]), to provide an explanation, the reasons given in that affidavit not only lacked credibility but were also, in my view, commercially implausible. I return to this affidavit a little later in these grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The underlying claim documents such as invoices and packing lists, and even the Powerpoint slides referenced by the parties were, in my view, equivocal. They did not support or conclusively prove either side’s case. In respect of the delay counterclaim, the defendant’s documents that established the quantities and dates of Hynix’s delivery of semi-conductor wafers and the plaintiff’s delivery of memory cards to the defendant did not provide proof of any agreement between the parties as to when the memory cards should have been delivered. The Powerpoint slides relied on by the plaintiff, as well as the Kakao conversations which the plaintiff used to evidence the defendant’s knowledge that ASolid flash controllers were required in the manufacturing process, similarly did not record any agreed delivery timeframe. To some extent, the Kakao conversations exhibited by the plaintiff assisted the plaintiff in showing that there was some level of flexibility between the parties as to when the memory cards were to be delivered, but did not record whether there were any delays in delivery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In respect of the shortfall counterclaim, the Powerpoint slides relied upon by the plaintiff indicated various percentages apart from 99.6%. The slides assisted the plaintiff somewhat in showing that the expected contract yield did not appear to be 100%, but again did not indicate whether there were any shortfalls in delivery or a contract yield which parties had agreed upon. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 However, the contemporaneous Kakao conversations and email correspondence exchanged by the parties’ representatives in relation to payment, are, in my view, material in determining the plausibility of the defendant’s delay and shortfall defence and counterclaims. As I observed at [40], serious questions arise as to why the defendant did not raise even a single objection or protest in the face of repeated payment requests and demands from the plaintiff. The Kakao conversations and email correspondence referred to above (at [33] and [35]) show quite clearly the plaintiff constantly chasing the defendant over several months, spanning a period before, during, and after the Time Period, for payment of outstanding sums due to the plaintiff. If indeed there had been delays or shortfalls in deliveries over such an extended period of time (bearing in mind the defendant’s case that time of delivery was of the essence), one would expect the defendant to have protested to the plaintiff in writing, or even if not in writing, in some form. In a commercial business context, the defendant’s silence throughout the material time in the face of the repeated requests and demands by the plaintiff for payment was, to my mind, strongly indicative that no such <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence and counterclaims existed. It bears emphasising that the exchanges between the parties spanned across several months from sometime in May 2018 right through to June 2019 when the defendant received the plaintiff’s solicitors’ legal demand. During this time, the defendant had any number of opportunities to bring issues or complaints with regard to delays or shortfalls to the attention of the plaintiff but did not do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is, however, not just a question of the defendant remaining silent. Not only did the defendant not object to the plaintiff’s requests or demands for payment, the defendant <span class="font-italic">positively acknowledged</span> its obligation to pay and repeatedly requested for more time to make payment (see [32] - [35] above). Further, a partial payment amounting to USD 50,000 was also made by the defendant in January 2019. This was, to put it bluntly, not the type of conduct one might expect from a commercial business which is alleged to have suffered substantial losses as a result of continuing breaches of contract by its counterparty. Viewing the evidence as a whole, it appeared to me that the defence raised by the defendant by way of the delay and shortfall counterclaims was implausible and an afterthought.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I had, at [3] and [40] above, referred to Mr Shanmugam’s further affidavit filed for the appeal. The purpose of this affidavit was to explain the reasons for the defendant not raising the counterclaims and the losses it alleged it had suffered in any of its communications or correspondence with the Plaintiff at the material time.

The defendant had not yet verified that there were delays and/or shortfalls in the quantity of memory cards delivered by the plaintiff, nor had it ascertained the period of any such delays and/or shortfalls, and the amount of losses it suffered as a result.

The defendant had not exhibited any internal communications to evidence that these investigations had taken place, and the findings of these investigations were also not adduced. The table purporting to show profits and losses was an internal document and did not prove that any losses were occasioned by the plaintiff.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As mentioned at [4], I allowed SUM 479/2020 and granted the defendant leave to file Mr Shanmugam’s further affidavit. This was primarily to afford the defendant the full opportunity to present its case during the appeal. Nevertheless, the further affidavit left many important questions unanswered. It also contained only bare assertions not backed up by any direct or indirect evidence. Most importantly, it failed, in my view, to provide a plausible or credible explanation on why the defendant did not raise any objections to the plaintiff’s claim earlier or give the plaintiff even a hint of the alleged counterclaims the defendant contends it has. Let me explain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 First, the defendant did not explain why it would be particularly difficult or impossible to check for delays and/or shortfalls, such that it was unable to give the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">an</span><span class="font-italic">y</span> indication of the defendant’s concerns or potential claims at any time prior to the commencement of proceedings by the plaintiff. The defendant stated that it “took time to go through [its]records in detail and to analyse all the documents and information collected” from the investigations.

</div>
</div> Notwithstanding that specific details of the delays and/or shortfalls were not yet available or that all the information had not yet been threaded together, it could at least have raised <span class="font-italic">some</span> protest or objection during the period the investigations were alleged to have been undertaken, even if the objection could not yet be fully particularised. Even a preliminary protest or intimation of potential claims with a reservation of rights would have put down a marker on record that the defendant had potential counterclaims, and, in the interim whilst the defendant’s investigations were ongoing and pending quantification of the counterclaims, that they would not be in a position to pay the plaintiff’s claims.  If such a protest or complaint had been raised, that might have lent some credence to the counterclaims now being asserted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Even if it is accepted that the investigations took time, then by June 2019 when the defendant received a legal demand from the plaintiff’s solicitors, the  prospect of legal action if the plaintiff’s claim was not paid would have been plain as day. It must have been apparent to the defendant by then that the defendant had potentially suffered losses on account of its alleged delay and shortfall counterclaims. If there were indeed investigations carried out by the defendant, those investigations would have already been ongoing for some five to six months by the time the defendant received the plaintiff’s legal demand. Yet, even then, there was no intimation at all from the defendant of any alleged counterclaim. In these circumstances, the purported explanation given by the defendant for its silence simply does not, in my view, sit well at all with commercial plausibility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I also agree with the plaintiff that the defendant did not produce any supporting evidence to show that any such internal investigations had indeed taken place. The fact that the evidence on the alleged internal investigations was not disclosed or mentioned by the defendant prior to the appeal did give rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant had come up with this explanation in an attempt to plug a fatal gap in its case, in response to the assistant registrar’s decision below. The plaintiff, in its affidavit filed on 18 September 2019 supporting the application for summary judgment, had already raised the point that none of the allegations raised in the defendant’s counterclaim had been raised by the defendant at any time prior to the commencement of legal proceedings and were “absurd” to the plaintiff.

From the tenor of the letter, it was apparent that this sum was sought by T.T.L to resolve the matter amicably without having to resort to legal recourse. According to the defendant, its customer T.T.L had cancelled certain orders for memory cards and claimed compensation from the defendant as the defendant had been unable to deliver the memory cards to T.T.L on time. As a result, the defendant suffered a loss of profit which it quantified at USD 36,300, and was also liable to compensate T.T.L in the amount of USD 43,271. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The defendant submitted that it was entitled to set-off these amounts against the plaintiff’s claim as the delay was occasioned by the plaintiff’s breach.

</div> because of alleged delays and was now seeking compensation from the defendant. This claim did not need investigation and even if it did, it would have been almost immediately apparent if the delay that caused those orders to be cancelled by T.T.L was occasioned by the plaintiff’s failure to deliver on time. Again, bearing in mind the defendant’s contention that time of delivery was of the essence, that the defendant did not at any time protest to the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">even on this specific claim</span>, is, to my mind, incredible and simply implausible from a commercial viewpoint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I make one last point on this. In the defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1) (“DCC”) filed on 6 November 2019, the defendant pleaded that in addition to T.T.L, <span class="font-italic">other</span> customers of the defendant also cancelled their orders for memory cards placed with the defendant due to the defendant’s inability to deliver the memory cards within the contractually stipulated time. The defendant asserted that its inability to meet their customers’ orders was in turn due to the plaintiff’s delay in delivering the manufactured memory cards to the defendant, which in turn caused the defendant to suffer loss and damage including loss of profits.

Nor was any evidence of claims or complaints by other customers exhibited to the affidavit. I made reference to the filing dates of the DCC and the show cause affidavit because the DCC was filed approximately a month <span class="font-italic">after</span> the show cause affidavit. Nevertheless, the point remains that by the time the show cause affidavit was filed, the evidence pertaining to the cancellation of orders by other customers, if it existed, must have already been available. Even if it was not available then, it certainly would have been by the time the appeal was heard by me. However, there was nothing in the show cause affidavit or the further affidavit filed for the appeal making even the slightest reference to other orders having also been cancelled by other customers on account of delays in delivery occasioned by the plaintiff. In the circumstances, I could not help but form the impression that the delay and shortfall defence and counterclaims were afterthoughts raised by the defendant in an attempt to stave off summary judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte ltd v Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden </span>[2018] 3 SLR 34<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Kim Seng </span>Orchid”) at [101], the “essence of the inquiry” with regard to whether a counterclaim was <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>was the plausibility of the counterclaim. Based on all of the evidence, including the contemporaneous evidence that was placed before me, I was not satisfied that the delay and shortfall counterclaims asserted had the requisite degree of plausibility to give rise to a fair or reasonable probability of a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The defendant raised two other points in support of its position that the delay and/or shortfall counterclaims amounted to a defence of legal and/or equitable set-off, such that it should be granted unconditional leave to defend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, it argued that it would require expert evidence to be adduced on the prevailing market prices for memory cards on the day the defendant should have received the cards from the plaintiff, and the day on which the defendant in fact received the cards. According to the defendant, the difference between the prices would be the loss and damage suffered by it in respect of the delay counterclaim.

</div> In my view and as elaborated below, this submission did not quite address the issue the defendant was confronted with in the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 While an equitable set-off may operate when the sums claimed are not liquidated sums, the loss nevertheless has to be quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith (<span class="font-italic">Hiap Tian Soon Construction Pte Ltd and another v Hola Development Pte Ltd and another </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 667<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Pacific Rim Investments Pt</span><span class="font-italic">e ltd v Lam Seng Tiong and another </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 643 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Rim</span>”) at [27]). In this case, no such assessment was made or presented to the court, even on a rough and ready basis for the purpose of defending a summary judgment application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The quantum of an asserted counterclaim is relevant to whether summary judgment ought to be granted. As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific </span><span class="font-italic">Rim</span> at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co Ltd v Molena </span><span class="font-italic">Alpha Inc </span>[1978] QB 927<span class="font-italic">, </span>cross-claims can only be deducted when they “go directly to impeach the plaintiff’s demands, that is, [if they are] so closely connected with his demands that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking into account the cross-claim”. Without even an estimation of the quantum of the asserted counterclaim, how would the court be in any position to make informed decisions on (i) whether, and to what extent, the quantum of the asserted counterclaim exceeds that of the claim, (ii) the appropriate order to be made, and (iii) whether it would be manifestly unjust for any summary judgment granted to be enforced or otherwise, for its execution to be stayed? These questions cannot be answered by applying guesswork but must be grounded on some credible evidence that is before the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For example, it is an established principle that even where a counterclaim amounts to a defence, but the sum of the claim exceeds that of the counterclaim, summary judgment may be granted for so much of the claim that exceeds the counterclaim. Further, should summary judgment be granted over the whole or part of the claim, the quantum of the counterclaim is also a factor for the court to take into consideration in deciding whether to grant a stay of execution (see <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid </span>([58] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [98]). As stated in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 14/4/10:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since, if the amount of set-off or counterclaim exceeds the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant is (all things being equal) entitled to leave to defend or a stay of execution, as the case may be, in respect of the whole claim, while if it is less, the plaintiff is entitled (all things being equal) to judgment for the difference, <span class="font-italic">it behoves the defendant to particularise the amount of his set-off or counterclaim or to specify or indicate how it is made up or calculated, so that the court has material on which to make the proper order</span> (<span class="font-italic">Si</span><span class="font-italic">lberline Asia Pacific Inc v. Lim Yong Wah Allan </span>[2006] S.G.H.C. 27). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Further, in the context of a summary judgment application, a party’s ability (or inability as the case may be) to present an estimation of the quantum of an asserted counterclaim may also point to the plausibility (or lack thereof) of the alleged counterclaim. As succinctly summarised by the authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at para 14/4/10, the “jurisdiction to give leave to defend or to stay execution is essentially a discretionary matter and the defendant who invites the court to exercise the discretionary power must produce sufficient material for the court to justify a decision in his favour”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On the defendant’s own case, its internal investigations (assuming any had taken place) lasted for about six months (see [46] above). As such, it had ample time to obtain or compute at least an estimate of its asserted counterclaim. Given that the defendant operates in this business, it should have been able to provide evidence of at least an estimate of the prevailing prices and its losses due to the delays alleged. If, as Ms Chan-Richard submitted, there was a concern that any evidence from the defendant itself would be self-serving,

</div> the defendant could have engaged an expert to provide expert evidence for the purposes of the summary judgment proceedings. Such evidence could have assisted to at least provide an estimate of the value of the defendant’s counterclaim and how it was arrived at. However, none of these steps was taken by the defendant. I disagreed with the defendant’s argument that the quantum of the counterclaim was a triable issue for which expert evidence would only be adduced at the trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The second point raised by the defendant was that where a dispute relates to an oral agreement, summary judgment should generally not be granted. In support of this argument, the defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Naughty G Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Fortune Marketing Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1208 (“<span class="font-italic">Naughty G</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">M2B </span>([16] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). However, the court is required to consider all of the evidence available before it in totality and critically. The court will not deprive the plaintiff of its entitlement to summary judgment if it finds that the defence is not credible after having regard to its consistency with contemporaneous documents, its inherent plausibility, and other compelling evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Kim Seng Orchid</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([58] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) <span class="font-italic"> </span>at [37]). Therefore, the mere existence of an alleged dispute over the terms of an oral agreement in and of itself is not sufficient for the defendant to obtain leave to defend. In <span class="font-italic">Naughty G </span>(at [56(a)-(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">ARS v ART </span>[2015] SGHC 78 at [53])<span class="font-italic">, </span>the court observed that in “ascertaining the existence of an oral agreement, the court will consider the relevant documentary evidence (such as written correspondence) and contemporaneous conduct of the parties at the material time”, and “where possible, the court should look first at the relevant documentary evidence”. <span class="font-italic">Naughty G</span> was not a case involving summary judgment but a decision rendered after trial, and the issue before the court revolved around determining the terms of an oral agreement. Nevertheless, applying the observations above by analogy, in light of the contemporaneous documents and other available evidence before me, including the contemporaneous conduct of the parties which I referred to earlier in these grounds, I saw no basis on which to grant the defendant leave to defend this part of the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Accordingly, I ordered the summary judgment granted by the assistant registrar in respect of the plaintiff’s claim amounting to USD 465,099.50 to stand. I rejected the defendant’s submission that it should be granted unconditional leave to defend this claim and also rejected its alternative submission for a stay of execution of the judgment pending the determination of the delay and shortfall counterclaims. I return to the point on stay of execution below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The USD 25,343.92 Invoice Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice claim, the defendant’s defence was that the plaintiff was not entitled to USD 21,284.95 as the goods supplied by the plaintiff were faulty/ defective.  In addition, the defendant submitted that it had a counterclaim amounting to USD 14,625.52 for lost profits due to the supply by the plaintiff of the defective goods, which it could raise by way of set-off.

</div> The plaintiff submitted that it had asked the defendant, in a telephone conversation, to send some of the faulty/ defective Ink Die Cards to the plaintiff for it to investigate, but the defendant did not do so. The defendant also did not mention that the Ink Die cards were defective at any other point in time thereafter, such as in further emails or Kakao chat messages. As the defendant did not make any further requests for a return or replacement of the allegedly faulty Ink Die Cards, the plaintiff assumed the issue had been resolved.

The defendant’s silence buttresses the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant had merely asserted that the Ink Die cards were faulty/defective, but provided little evidence in support of its claim.  However, at the same time, the assertion by the plaintiff that its representative had (in a telephone conversation) spoken to the defendant about this after receiving the defendant’s email is also not corroborated by any evidence. The defendant also did not provide any basis for the quantification of its counterclaim. It merely asserts that its loss of profits is quantified at USD 14,625.52 without providing any details as to how such a precise amount was arrived at. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Overall, while I did not think that the threshold of a fair probability of a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>defence had quite been met by the defendant based on the (at best) minimal evidence adduced, I ultimately found that this part of the claimed defence was nevertheless not so hopeless that the defendant should be shut out from defending it altogether. Following the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Akfel</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) <span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [21]–[22] above)<span class="font-italic">, </span>this was, in my view, an appropriate case where the defendant should be given leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claim but on condition that security be furnished by it as a demonstration of its commitment to its claimed defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I therefore granted the defendant conditional leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claim<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the sum of USD 25,343.92.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I was conscious that the sum claimed by the plaintiff of USD 25,343.92 spanned <span class="font-italic">both</span> the defendant’s faulty/defective cards <span class="font-italic">defence</span> and its faulty/defective cards <span class="font-italic">counterclaim</span>. I wish to make it clear that in granting the defendant conditional leave to defend this part of the plaintiff’s claim, I was not acknowledging the viability of the defendant’s faulty/defective cards counterclaim. As it stands, the faulty/defective cards counterclaim is also based on not much more than a bare assertion and one email from the defendant to the plaintiff. Rather, I considered that the defendant had pleaded its case such that the faulty/defective cards defence and the faulty/defective cards counterclaim, <span class="font-italic">taken together</span>, constituted its response to the plaintiff’s claim for the USD 25,343.92 Invoice. Further, the defendant’s defence and counterclaim on the USD 25,343.92 Invoice claim are clearly interlinked, in that the counterclaim is contingent upon the success of the defence. Given that I have found the faulty/defective cards defence to be not so hopeless as to warrant summary judgment, I decided to grant the defendant conditional leave to defend the entire sum claimed by the plaintiff under the USD 25,343.92 Invoice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stay of Execution </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having granted the defendant conditional leave to defend the claim in relation to the USD 25,343.92 Invoice, the question remains whether the revised judgment granted in relation to the USD 465,099.50 Invoice should be stayed pending determination of the defendant’s shortfall and delay counterclaims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The defendant argued that if the court upheld the judgment, it should be stayed pending the hearing and disposal of its counterclaims, for the following reasons: first, there was a close degree of connection between the plaintiff’s claim in the suit and the defendant’s counterclaims; second, the defendant had <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and strong counterclaims; and third, that the plaintiff’s financial status meant that it was unlikely to be able to satisfy any judgment, if granted, on the counterclaims.

If the counterclaim is <span class="font-italic">not </span>plausible, then its presence ought not to stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment of its whole claim, without any stay pending the determination of the counterclaim, and the court should so rule.

Leave to defend was granted on the condition that the defendant furnished security in the sum of USD 25,343.92 by way of a payment of that sum into court or by such other mode of security as may be agreed by the parties.  The security was to be furnished by the defendant within 21 days of the date of my order, and parties were given liberty to apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The judgment below in respect of the plaintiff’s claim for<span class="font-italic"> </span>the sum of USD 465,099.50 was to stand with no stay of execution.

In accordance with the costs guidelines set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions, I ordered costs of the appeal to be fixed at $4,000 inclusive of disbursements to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.
