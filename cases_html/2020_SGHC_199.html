</div> I do not accept this. First, it is axiomatic that damages for fraudulent misrepresentation include all consequential losses suffered by the claimant in reliance upon the fraudulent misrepresentation. This is regardless of whether or not such loss was foreseeable (see <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town</span><span class="font-italic"> Corp </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 909 (“<span class="font-italic">Wishing Star</span>”) at [21] and [28]; <span class="font-italic">East v Maurer </span>[1991] 1 WLR 461).

</div> Therefore, the loss of interest and commission is recoverable.

</div> There are two broad categories of constructive trusts that are potentially applicable here – the institutional constructive trust (“ICT”) and the remedial constructive trust (“RCT”). The difference between the two was explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 at 714–715, as cited by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 856 (“<span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong</span>”) at [35]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under an institutional constructive trust, the trust arises by operation of law as from the date of the circumstances which give rise to it: the function of the court is merely to declare that such trust has arisen in the past. The consequences that flow from such trust having arisen (including the possibly unfair consequences to third parties who in the interim have received the trust property) are also determined by rules of law, not under a discretion. A remedial constructive trust, as I understand it, is different. It is a judicial remedy giving rise to an enforceable equitable obligation: the extent to which it operates retrospectively to the prejudice of third parties lies in the discretion of the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 None of the circumstances giving rise to an ICT are present in this case (see the decision of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2013] SGHC 249 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [141], citing <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Khng, deceased) </span>[2011] SGHC 184 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53]). Although <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy </span>refers to “fraud” as one of the facts that can found an ICT, this does not refer to fraud <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span>, but to cases where the “defendant fraudulently relies on the informality of a transaction to deny the beneficial interest of the claimant” (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGee QC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2014)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 26-011). Further, although the appeal against Prakash J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>was allowed in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1097, the Court of Appeal did not expressly comment on Prakash J’s decision at [141].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As such, it remains to consider the RCT. The RCT was first considered in Singapore in <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and subsequently explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna</span>”) at [172] and [184]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">172 … The basis of an RCT in Singapore law at its present stage of development therefore appears to be founded on fault … predicated on a state of knowledge which renders it unconscionable for the recipient to keep the moneys. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">184 The fact giving rise to the court’s discretion to impose an RCT was therefore … the <span class="font-italic">knowing retention </span>of the moneys in a way that affects the recipient’s conscience. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Although the RCT “is still in its developmental stages in Singapore”, the abovementioned principles have been consistently reiterated in the few cases concerned with whether to impose an RCT (see <span class="font-italic">Philip Antony Jeyaretnam and another v Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal and others (Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pamabayan, third party; Pramela d/o Govindasamy and another, non-parties) </span>[2020] 3 SLR 738 at [23]). Nevertheless, the courts in those cases declined to impose an RCT for various reasons. In <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at [172] that there was no fraud on the part of the deceased to establish an RCT. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong </span>at [37] found an RCT inappropriate because there had been “no dishonest conduct” on the part of the payee.<span class="font-italic"> </span>In <span class="font-italic">Zhou Weidong v Liew Kai Lung and others </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1236 (“<span class="font-italic">Zhou Weidong</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82], Audrey Lim JC (as she then was) declined to impose an RCT because the claimant had not carried out the “precursory step of tracing”. I also bear in mind Vivian Ramsey IJ’s caution in <span class="font-italic">CPIT Investments Ltd v Qilin World Capital Ltd and another </span>[2017] 5 SLR 1 at [199] that the RCT in Singapore “is only to be imposed sparingly”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, this case is one in which an RCT should be imposed. I have found that the Defendants were part of a conspiracy to fraudulently induce the NBO to disburse the Loans and thereafter dissipate the moneys received from the NBO. Thus, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong</span>, there is clearly fraudulent and dishonest conduct involved. Furthermore, as regards tracing, my finding on the conspiracy <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> establishes an indirect link between the NBO’s moneys and the moneys and/or assets received by the Defendants. The circumstantial evidence indicates that at the time each of the Defendants received these moneys and/or assets, they knew that these moneys and/or assets had been obtained fraudulently arising from their conspiracy to defraud the NBO. This state of knowledge makes it unconscionable for the Defendants to keep the moneys and/or assets. For these reasons, I impose an RCT on the moneys and/or assets received by the Defendants which are traceable to the NBO’s moneys, operating from the time that the Defendants first received these moneys and/or assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Knowing receipt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The NBO claims that Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu are liable to account to the NBO for US$3,697,324, US$2,918,296.87 and US$35,000 respectively for knowing receipt. The requirements of a claim in knowing receipt are (a) a disposal of the claimant’s assets in breach of trust/fiduciary duty; (b) the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the claimant; and (c) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets received are traceable to a breach of trust/fiduciary duty, such knowledge being such that it is unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit of the receipt (see <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another </span>[2010] 2 SLR 589 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Relfo Ltd (in liquidation) v Bhimji Velji Jadva Varsani </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 657 at [21]).

Secondly, the Defendants received moneys and/or assets which are<span class="font-italic"> </span>traceable to Kismat FZC’s breach of its duties as constructive trustee.

</div> First, the defendant has been enriched or benefitted. Secondly, the enrichment is at the claimant’s expense: the claimant must prove that (a) the defendant received an immediate benefit from the claimant, thus establishing a direct personal link, or (b) the defendant received a benefit traceable from the claimant’s assets, thus establishing an indirect link through the value in the defendant’s hands that once belonged to the claimant. Thirdly, the enrichment was unjust. The relevant unjust factor in this case is total failure of consideration, which involves an inquiry as to the basis for the transfer in respect of which restitution is sought, and whether this basis has totally failed (see <span class="font-italic">Benzline Auto Pte Ltd v Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 239 at [46]). Finally, there are no applicable defences available to the defendant. Notably, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna </span>observed at [184] that the facts giving rise to an RCT may arise subsequent to or concurrently with a claim in unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59  There is no real need for me to determine this point given that I have found all the Defendants liable for the entire sum of Damages, as well as liable as constructive trustees and for knowing receipt (see [50], [55] and [57] above). Nevertheless, for completeness, I find that all the requirements for unjust enrichment have been established. Here, the first and fourth requirements are uncontroversial. As regards the second requirement, I have found that there is, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, a link between the NBO’s moneys and the moneys received by Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu (see [55] above). As regards the third requirement, there was a total failure of consideration as the basis of the Loans was that they were to be used for discounting invoices issued by Kismat FZC to BP Singapore and the Total-related company. However, the evidence<span class="font-italic"> </span>suggests that the moneys were not used for such transactions. Rather, Prakash, Bikash and the Defendants attempted to dissipate the moneys after deceiving the NBO into granting them the Loans. Thus, I find that the elements of unjust enrichment have been <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The court is satisfied that the evidence adduced by the NBO is credible and reliable. The NBO’s case is also not inherently incredible or out of common sense. Furthermore, circumstantial evidence relied on by the NBO leads to a reasonable and logical inference that there was a conspiracy amongst the Defendants and others to defraud the NBO. Faced with these allegations from the NBO, the obvious and sensible response from the Defendants would have been to rebut these allegations. However, the Defendants elect not to give evidence and submit that there is no case to answer. Bearing this in mind, I make the following findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I find that the NBO has established, on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, that Kismat FZC is liable for fraudulent misrepresentation. Bikash and Prakash as directors of Kismat FZC represented to the NBO that they had contacts with several real McCoys that are multinational oil companies and that there were trade receivables owed to Kismat FZC by BP Singapore and a Total-related company. This induced the NBO to grant the Credit Facilities and disburse the Loans. It was intended that the NBO would act upon the representations and Bikash and Prakash knew that the representations were false. Kismat FZC defaulted on the Loans and caused the NBO to suffer damage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I reject the Defendants’ allegation that the NBO, through Mr Khalid and Mr Johnson, had colluded with the Defendants to incorporate BPCPL and TSPL to impersonate the real McCoys. The evidence shows that Kismat FZC, in its various applications to the NBO for the Loans to be disbursed, complied with all the formal requirements under the Credit Facilities save for the condition that the original invoices be countersigned by BP Singapore’s representative office in the UAE. I accept Mr Navin’s evidence that the disbursement of the Loans despite this procedural irregularity was due to a genuine oversight. Moreover, even if there was collusion, Mr Khalid’s and Mr Johnson’s knowledge should not be attributed to the NBO. Therefore, the NBO has <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established its fraudulent misrepresentation claim against Kismat FZC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I also find that the NBO has <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>established its unlawful means conspiracy claim. I address the evidence against each Defendant separately:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Kismat FZC: Based on the same facts as in the fraudulent misrepresentation claim, it is clear that Kismat FZC, through its directors and shareholders, Bikash and Prakash, played a critical role in the conspiracy to induce the NBO to disburse the Loans and thereafter, dissipate the moneys received.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Zu Lwin: I reject her defence that she was unaware of the purpose of incorporating BPCPL and TSPL. She was engaged in a pattern of incorporating companies with names similar to multinational companies, despite her experience in the oil and petrochemical industry and having been advised of such similarities. She was the director of BPCPL and TSPL when the forged and/or fraudulent documents were issued to the NBO. She was also an employee, director and 10% shareholder of Kismat Singapore. She rented the Safe Deposit Boxes to store the gold bars obtained from Joshi Trading and attempted to remove them the day she was alerted of the Second Mareva Injunction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Kismat Singapore: Not only were Bikash and Prakash the only shareholders and directors of Kismat Singapore at the material time, Kismat Singapore remitted and received significant sums of money to and from persons/companies associated with Bikash and Prakash. The frequency and value of the transfers by Kismat Singapore significantly increased immediately after the First Mareva Injunction was granted, suggesting an attempt to dissipate moneys.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Joshi Trading: Joshi Trading’s director and sole shareholder is Bikash’s and Prakash’s nephew. Joshi Trading also received and remitted significant sums of money to and from persons/companies associated with Bikash and Prakash, including Kismat Singapore, Zu Lwin and Madhu. Joshi Trading also purchased the gold bars using the funds received from Kismat Singapore, and later issued an invoice for the purported sale of these gold bars to Zu Lwin and Madhu.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Madhu: Madhu is Prakash’s wife. She received the invoice from Joshi Trading for the gold bars and was also listed as the second additional licensee for the Safe Deposit Boxes. In addition, she received a sum of money from Joshi Trading after Joshi Trading received certain sums from Kismat Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Based on all the above circumstantial evidence, I find that the NBO has <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>established that Bikash, Prakash and the Defendants conspired to fraudulently induce the NBO to disburse the Loans and thereafter dissipate the moneys received, with the intention of thereby causing damage or injury to the NBO. These acts were unlawful and carried out in furtherance of the fraudulent conspiracy, thereby causing the NBO to suffer loss. The fact that Joshi Trading was incorporated after the scheme to defraud the NBO had already commenced is not a bar to liability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Thus, the Defendants are jointly and severally liable for the Damages sought by the NBO, being the principal sum disbursed under the Loans amounting to US$14,665,972.86, as well as the loss of profits amounting to at least US$3,891,741.96, less the part-payment of AE$250,000 repaid to the NBO on or about 19 June 2017, and less the sum of US$5,933,826.56 which was recovered from the sale of the gold bars. Although the NBO must account for any other benefits received, there are none here because the NBO’s claim is limited to the four Loans.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Further, I find that there is an RCT over the moneys and/or assets received by the Defendants pursuant to the conspiracy. Their involvement in the conspiracy not only establishes the requisite state of knowledge making it unconscionable for them to retain the moneys and/or assets, it also establishes <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>an indirect link between the NBO’s moneys and the moneys and/or assets received by them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I also find that the requirements of knowing receipt are <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>established. The moneys received by Kismat FZC from the NBO were subject to a constructive trust. Kismat FZC breached its duties as constructive trustee when it transferred these moneys to the Defendants. Given their involvement in the conspiracy, Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu knew that the moneys they received were traceable to Kismat FZC’s breach of its duties as constructive trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Thus, Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu are liable to account to the NBO for US$3,697,324, US$2,918,296.87 and US$35,000 respectively. The NBO is entitled to trace the assets or proceeds into which these sums have been converted, if any. If these sums have been converted into other traceable assets, the NBO is entitled to trace its claim into those assets and maintain a proprietary remedy subject to any applicable legal limitations (see <span class="font-italic">Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and another v Lim Swee Lian Sylvia and others and another suit </span>[2019] SGHC 241 at [633]; <span class="font-italic">Bhavika Manohar Godhwani v Manohar Hargun Godhwani and others </span>[2020] SGHC 147 at [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Finally, I find that the NBO has <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established its claim in unjust enrichment. Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu have been enriched by the moneys they received. The evidence suggests that there is an indirect link between the NBO’s moneys and the moneys received by Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu. Further, there was a total failure of consideration and no defences apply. Therefore, the requirements for unjust enrichment are satisfied and Kismat Singapore, Joshi Trading and Madhu are liable to the NBO for US$3,697,324, US$2,918,296.87 and US$35,000 respectively. Strictly speaking, however, this finding is superfluous given my findings on the NBO’s claims in unlawful means conspiracy, constructive trust and knowing receipt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For the above reasons, I find that the NBO has<span class="font-italic"> prima facie</span> established its claims against the Defendants. As such, I reject the Defendants’ submission of no case to answer and find for the NBO. The Defendants are to pay costs to be agreed or taxed to the NBO.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Cong Yen Lionel (Chen Congren), Nora Jessica Chan Kai Lin, Beatrice Mathilda Yeo Li Hui (Yang Lihui) and Chua Yi Ling Ilene (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kanthosamy Rajendran (RLC Law Corporation) for the second, fourth, tenth, fourteenth and fifteenth defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Prasanna d/o T V Prabhakaran (Raj Prasanna &amp; Partners) for the first and third defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth defendants absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
