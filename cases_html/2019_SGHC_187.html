Contrary to his client’s instructions and without his client’s knowledge, the respondent contacted Mr Suresh with a view to resolving the matter amicably. After meeting with Mr Suresh, the respondent spent the time between the months of August and November 2016 deceiving his client into believing that bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Suresh were in progress, when in reality, there were no bankruptcy proceedings afoot. In the course of deceiving his client, the respondent prepared one fictitious court document and two fictitious affidavits, forged the electronic seal of the Supreme Court and forged the signature and stamp of a Commissioner for Oaths. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 10 November 2016, a complaint was made by Mr Suresh against the respondent. This complaint eventually led to disciplinary proceedings against the respondent. At these disciplinary proceedings, the respondent faced five charges of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty under s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA. The respondent pleaded guilty to the third and fifth charges, but contested the first, second and fourth charges. On 31 December 2018, the Disciplinary Tribunal (“the DT”) comprising of Mr Francis Xavier SC and Mr Tan Kay Kheng found that the third, fourth and fifth charges (collectively “the three charges”) were made out beyond a reasonable doubt. The DT further determined that there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA in respect of those three charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The three charges are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">3. Third Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, G B Vasudeven, are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court within the meaning of Section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) in that you, on or about September/October 2016, prepared a fictitious court document entitled “Requisition to Registrar for Payment into Court pursuant to Directions of Court” and in doing so, you forged the electronic seal of the Supreme Court by electronically extracting the said seal from another court document and affixing the same to the document in question.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">4.

Fifth Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You, G B Vasudeven, are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court within the meaning of Section 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) in that you, between the months of August 2016 and November 2016, while acting for your client, one Shanmuganathan Sinniah, did falsely represent to him that bankruptcy proceedings had been commenced against one Suresh Kumar R when no such bankruptcy proceedings had been commenced and you knowing at all material times that the said representation was false.<span class="font-weight-bold font-underline"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Law Society submits that due cause has been shown for the respondent to be subject to sanction pursuant to s 83(1) of the LPA, on the basis of the conduct disclosed in the three charges set out above. The Law Society also submits that the respondent should be struck off. The respondent accepts that his conduct surrounding the three charges gives due cause for disciplinary action to be taken against him. He also accepts that he has been dishonest in his dealings with his client and agrees with the Law Society that he should be struck off.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 There are two issues before us:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether there is due cause for the respondent to be subject to sanction pursuant to s 83(1) of the LPA; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if so, the appropriate sanction to be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there is due cause</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The respondent admits to secretly acting contrary to his client’s instructions, deceiving his client for a prolonged period of time and forging various documents in furtherance of his deception (see [2] above). We thus find that the three charges have been made out beyond a reasonable doubt. In our judgment, the respondent’s shocking conduct easily crosses the threshold of “grossly improper conduct” within meaning of s 83(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA and there is due cause for the respondent to be subject to sanction. Indeed, in our view, the respondent’s conduct also falls within the rubric of “fraudulent conduct” within the meaning of that same provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sanction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 We note that both the Law Society and the respondent agree that the respondent should be struck off. As a preliminary observation, we highlight that the fact that parties agree that a particular sanction is appropriate or the fact that the respondent accepts that he should be struck off is by no means determinative of the eventual sanction imposed by the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In the context of criminal proceedings, it is well established that sentencing is ultimately a matter for the court and while parties can assist the court in the task of sentencing, it is ultimately for the court to assess and determine what sentence would be just in light of all the circumstances before it (see <span class="font-italic">Janardana</span><span class="font-italic"> Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1288 at [12]). This principle extends similarly to disciplinary proceedings. This court is entrusted with the task of deciding on the appropriate sanction, and while the court can take into account the parties’ submissions, the court is not bound by these submissions and will decide on what is appropriate after considering all the relevant circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Nevertheless, based on a holistic consideration of all the facts of this case, we agree that the respondent should be struck off. In <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang </span>[2018] 5 SLR 1068 (“<span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang</span>”) at [16] and [18], we reiterated that misconduct involving dishonesty on the part of a solicitor would be viewed with utmost gravity and generally be met with the most severe consequences. We also highlighted three broad categories of cases where dishonesty will almost invariably lead to an order for striking off (see <span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang</span> at [19]). The respondent clearly falls within the second and third categories identified in <span class="font-italic">Chia Choon Yang</span>. The respondent acted in a strikingly dishonest manner in deceiving his client for a prolonged period of time and gravely violated the relationship of trust and confidence between solicitor and client. Further, he also blatantly violated his obligations as an officer of the court by creating fictitious court documents and by forging various means of authentication including the seal of the Supreme Court and the stamp and signature of a Commissioner for Oaths. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the circumstances, the respondent’s egregious conduct warrants the most serious sanction available and we order that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 We award the costs of the present proceedings to the Law Society.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong       Judith Prakash        Belinda Ang Saw Ean<br/>Judge of Appeal        Judge of Appeal        Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">M K Eusuff Ali and Joseph Tham Chee Ming (Tan Rajah &amp; Cheah) for the applicant;<br/>Christopher Anand Daniel and Harjean Kaur (Advocatus Law LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
