</div>
</div>
</div> The only dispute in the court below and on appeal is whether the claim and consequently the statement were false. The District Judge (“the Judge”) found against the Appellant on both scores. The convictions therefore turn entirely on one factual issue – is there any reasonable doubt that the Appellant fell from the ladder thereby injuring his back while working on the Block on 17 May 2015?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Judge convicted the Appellant of both charges and sentenced him to two terms of imprisonment of six weeks and four weeks for the first and second charges respectively and ordered both sentences to run concurrently. The Judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and found the Appellant’s evidence to be “inconsistent, incoherent or incredible” (see the Grounds of Decision (“the GD”) at [71]). In particular, the Judge accepted the eye witness account of a fellow Bangladeshi worker who saw the Appellant walk up to the ladder area and sit down before lying down on the floor (see the GD at [41]–[45]). This is diametrically contrary to the Appellant’s claim that he fell off a ladder while working on the Block. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 For this appeal, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Anil Narain Balchandani, raises many arguments to challenge the Judge’s findings. I find two of the arguments particularly troubling not just because they were not raised during the trial below but also because they allege serious impropriety against the prosecution witnesses, their two employers, and the Shipyard without having put these allegations to them and without any evidential foundation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 First, in his zeal to advance the Appellant’s best case, Mr Balchandani alleges that the prosecution witnesses had <span class="font-italic">colluded</span> with each other to provide false testimony to wrongly implicate the Appellant, an innocent man. His submission went so far as to suggest that the collusion involved the Shipyard, Wee Seng, and another sub-contractor, OUS Pte Ltd (“OUS”). Not only was this collusion theory not formally put to the witnesses during the trial, there is simply no evidential basis for such serious allegations to be made in the first place. The second argument which troubles me concerns some videos and photographs (Exhibits D3 to D8 – collectively, “the Exhibits”) which the IO received from the Shipyard

</div> and which were brought to the attention of the Judge just before the close of the Prosecution’s case. Their existence emerged in the course of the IO’s cross-examination. The Prosecution explained that it was not relying on the Exhibits as it took the position that the Exhibits were at best neutral to the two charges. The Judge nevertheless gave the Appellant sufficient time to consider the Exhibits and thereafter allowed him to recall several witnesses following an interval of some four months. Despite Mr Balchandani’s submission that the Exhibits, in particular the videos, were exculpatory of the Appellant, the Judge found that the Exhibits did not assist the Appellant but instead undermined the Appellant’s defence (see the GD at [83]). What is especially disturbing is that for this appeal, without any factual or expert evidence, Mr Balchandani maintains the same submission he made before the court below that it is “plausible” that the videos had been<span class="font-italic"> tampered </span>with or at least edited by the Shipyard.

</div> The very nature of such an allegation cries out for substantiation. Yet this was not even put to any witness in the court below.

</div> His belated <span class="font-italic">personal</span> assessment of the videos offers no excuse for his misconceived pursuit of such a serious allegation without any <span class="font-italic">independent</span> factual foundation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 While it is the duty of every counsel to put forward all <span class="font-italic">available</span> arguments in the best interest of his client, it is equally important for counsel to recognise his overarching duty as an officer of the court (see <span class="font-italic">Public Trustee and another v By Products Traders Pte Ltd and others </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 449 at [26] and [35]). The balancing of these twin duties requires counsel to make submissions in a <span class="font-italic">responsible</span> manner. This is especially so if the submission suggests either impropriety (such as evidence-tampering) or the commission of a crime (which in this case would be perjury alleged against the prosecution witnesses with the connivance of the Shipyard, Wee Seng, and OUS). In my view, submissions of such gravity should never be made by counsel without any legitimate evidential basis and without putting the serious charges to the relevant witnesses to afford them an opportunity to respond.

When a trial judge makes finding of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he has had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion which the trial judge has formed unless the appellate court is “convinced” that the trial judge’s decision was wrong (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Poh Oh Sim</span> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 408 at [8]). The decision of the Judge was largely based on his assessment of the witnesses whom he heard over a nine-day trial. His findings (which were painstakingly set out in a 51-page GD) must be examined against the conspicuous absence of any bruising or swelling to the Appellant’s back. Given the Appellant’s description of the severity of the pain he endured, one would have expected there to be bruising or swelling or some form of physical appearance of the injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence, I find that there is plainly no reason for me to disturb the Judge’s assessment of the witnesses.

</div> In my view, Exhibit D8 does not assist the Appellant. On the contrary, it confirms Safikul’s evidence that the Appellant had to bend down before he could lie down on the ground next to the ladder, which was under the Block. Exhibit D8 also shows that Safikul’s line of vision was not completely blocked. The mere fact that there were other objects in his line of vision did not prevent Safikul from observing the Appellant’s behaviour. There is no reason for me to doubt the Judge’s assessment that Safikul was well able to observe the Appellant’s movement towards the ladder and thereafter his lying down next to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Next, in an attempt to challenge Safikul’s eye witness account, the Appellant relies on Sujon’s testimony that he did not notice any lifting operations or any person standing at Safikul’s position at the time of the alleged incident.

Sujon explained that the reason he did not notice the lifting operations was because he was “underneath … the [B]lock doing [his] work” whereas lifting works are normally done outside the [B]lock.

</div> That Ashek does not know Safikul is irrelevant to the inquiry as to whether Safikul’s evidence is to be believed. After all, they worked for different companies – Safikul worked for OUS while Ashek worked for Wee Seng. I should add that the fact that Ashek did not know Safikul reinforces my finding that Safikul had no reason to collude with Ashek and the other prosecution witnesses to falsely implicate the Appellant (this is elaborated at [20]–[22] below). Further, Safikul’s evidence was consistent throughout the trial. Even after he was recalled and the videos were disclosed, his evidence remained unshaken. He confirmed that his view of the ladder was not obstructed

On either account, his evidence was that he was instructed to do so. Therefore, on the Appellant’s own case, the two inquiries are inextricably connected. If he was not instructed by Hasmot or Ashek to do any work on the second level as he claimed, it stands to reason that the Appellant, by his own evidence, had no reason to use the ladder and consequently did not fall while climbing up the ladder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Ashek, who is the Appellant’s supervisor, testified that the Appellant had no reason to use the ladder at the material time.

However, when probed, he conceded that this was never put to Hasmot in cross-examination. Leaving aside for the moment the Appellant’s conflicting evidence as to the nature of work he was tasked to do on the second level, I agree with the Prosecution and, in particular, the Judge’s finding that there was no reason for the Appellant, “in his ‘stricken’ condition”, to do any work on the second level of the Block at the time of the incident (see the GD at [32]). Not only was the Appellant allegedly unwell, Hasmot had specifically told him that he had “no need to work” as Hasmot was already calling for a replacement for him.

</div> It would be too much of a coincidence that the Appellant would use the ladder to climb to the second level to do work which he was not instructed to do at the precise moment when Hasmot had his back turned away from the Appellant while calling Ashek for the replacement worker. It is therefore difficult to imagine how Hasmot would not have noticed the Appellant climbing and falling from the ladder if that had actually happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The prosecution witnesses’ observations of the Appellant’s behaviour and reaction after the alleged fall also support the Judge’s finding that the Appellant did not fall while climbing up the ladder.

Even if I am prepared to give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt that he might have provided inconsistent answers about the task he was asked to do on the second level because he did not fully understand the questions asked of him in cross-examination, it is important not to lose sight of the real significance of this line of questioning. Its significance lies in establishing whether the Appellant had any reason to use the ladder in the first place. It should not be overlooked that the Appellant was assisting Hasmot with his work that day. It is the Appellant’s own evidence that he was instructed by Hasmot to go up to the second level to “cut the support”.

</div> while the objective evidence suggests otherwise. In Exhibit D3, one of the persons in the Appellant’s vicinity when he was on the ground can be heard repeatedly asking the Appellant, “where is your helmet?” Further, Exhibits D4 and D7 show the Appellant’s position on the ground after the fall but no helmet could be seen in the vicinity. However, the materiality of the Appellant’s conflicting accounts lies in the reason for his vacillations and not the factual inquiry <span class="font-italic">per se </span>as to whether he was in fact wearing a helmet.

It is not disputed that no one saw the Appellant in an unconscious state.

</div> The Appellant claims that he lost consciousness after the fall and experienced pain at the maximum level of 10. However, the evidence shows that there was no bruising or swelling and that the X-rays and CT scans were unremarkable and did not reveal any fresh injury. In my view, such severe pain is entirely inconsistent with the complete lack of objective evidence such as bruising, swelling, or tenderness. Mr Balchandani relies on the two pain killer injections given to the Appellant at the Shipyard’s clinic before he boarded the lorry in his effort to explain why the Appellant was able to board the lorry without assistance. However, as the Judge noted at [55] of the GD, the Appellant claimed that the pain was still at the maximum level of “10” even<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">after</span> the injections. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Further, having reviewed the video evidence, I find that the videos are entirely inconsistent with the fall as described by the Appellant.

When Dr Ding was asked why he thought the Appellant’s back injury was most likely consistent with the alleged fall, he explained “[b]ecause I mean from the <span class="font-italic">history</span> it says that he fell from the ladder and landed on his back and there is a ladder and then he’s shown on his back in the video” [emphasis added].

</div> From my assessment of their evidence as a whole, it is clear that their diagnoses of <span class="font-italic">possible</span> back injury were based on the Appellant’s account of the alleged incident together with the Appellant’s indication of the location of the pain. What is noteworthy is that none of the doctors testified that they would have arrived at their diagnoses or concluded that the Appellant’s back injury was due to a fall from a ladder <span class="font-italic">without</span> the Appellant’s oral history.

At trial, two brothers were convicted of murder on the basis that both were present in the deceased’s flat although the trial judge was unable to conclude which of them actually murdered the deceased (see <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [35(f)]). Mr Loh’s evidence was there was only one person other than himself and the deceased in the deceased’s flat throughout the incident. His statements consistently stated that there was only one intruder present in the flat (see <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [5]). His evidence could therefore exculpate at least one of the two brothers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In the present case, however, the Exhibits cannot by any stretch be exculpatory of the Appellant.

He claims that the Exhibits show that he had to climb up the lorry unassisted because he was forced to help himself. The Appellant also submits that the photographs were exculpatory because they evidence several things: (a) his proximity to the ladder during the incident; (b) his inability to roll either side as he was confined between the ladder and certain objects on the left; (c) that Safikul’s line of sight had been obstructed; and (d) that there was a pool of water near his head, consistent with his testimony that he had had his helmet removed so that water could be poured on his head.

Instead, what they show is that the Appellant could walk to and climb onto a lorry unassisted.

Hence, they were marked D3 to D8. The tampering allegation was however never raised at the trial.

Mr Balchandani also claims that the Appellant’s application to recall Hasmot and Ashek was denied by the Judge. This is strictly incorrect.

Thus, it would appear that it was Mr Balchandani who decided not to recall Hasmot, Ashek, or any other witness; it is therefore disingenuous and unfair to criticise the Judge for failing to recall them on his own motion.

The witnesses were recalled on 2 February 2017, after a period of almost four months <span class="font-italic">following</span> the disclosure of the Exhibits on 12 October 2016. It is clear that the Appellant had more than enough time to consider the steps that he wished to take, including recalling more witnesses or applying to admit expert evidence to demonstrate that the videos had been tampered with. In fact, counsel for the Appellant indicated on 13 October 2016 that he needed time to find expert witnesses to deal with the contents of the Exhibits.

</div> However, he eventually did not offer any expert witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the circumstances, it is reckless for Mr Balchandani to suggest that the videos had been tampered with when there is simply no evidential basis whatsoever to support such a speculative suggestion. Although this is a very serious allegation, it was never put to any witness. Further, although the Appellant was given the option of recalling witnesses, he chose not to recall the IO. This is significant because the IO was the witness who received the videos from the Shipyard and was therefore the person who could possibly explain the provenance of the videos. If Mr Balchandani wanted to pursue the tampering allegation, he should have at least recalled the IO to initiate the train of inquiry. Having elected not to do so, any suggestion of the videos having been tampered with is plainly baseless.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>duty of disclosure is not some poison pill. Not all breaches of this duty would cause a conviction to be overturned (see <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [120]). There must be material irregularity that occasions a failure of justice (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the conviction must be rendered unsafe as a result of the late disclosure or non-disclosure). The court also stated at [121] that where disclosure is made after the commencement of the trial, the court may grant an adjournment of sufficient duration to allow defence counsel time to consider the effect of the disclosed material and to incorporate it into their case if necessary. Here, this was clearly done. As explained, the Judge ensured that the Appellant had sufficient time to examine the Exhibits and to make the necessary application(s) to recall witnesses or to take whatever further steps necessary (almost four months later) to address them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For these reasons, I find that the Judge was correct in finding that the two charges have been made out. There is also no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by the Judge. They are not manifestly excessive and are in line with the relevant precedents. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Steven Chong <br/>Judge of Appeal </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anil Narain Balchandani and Mato Kotwani (IRB Law LLP) for the appellant;<br/>Crystal Tan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
