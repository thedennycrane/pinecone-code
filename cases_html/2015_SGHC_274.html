<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application raised an interesting question
                    of law as to how the court should exercise its discretion in an application
                    under s 32(3) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Act”). The applicant, Mr Nicholas Jeyaraj s/o Narayanan
                    (“Mr Jeyaraj”) had applied for an order permitting his practice
                    trainee, Mr Teo Jun Kiat, Evan (Zhang Junjie)
                    (“Mr Teo”), limited audience before the courts on behalf of
                    Nicholas &amp; Tan Partnership LLP (“the Firm”), that is, before a
                    Judge of the High Court sitting in chambers, the Registrar of the Supreme Court,
                    a District Judge, a Magistrate, or the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the
                    State Courts (“part-call application”). At the time of the
                    part-call application, Mr Teo was serving his practice training period but had
                    yet to undertake Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations (“Part B
                    Examinations”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Before me, the Law Society of Singapore
                    (“the Law Society”) and the Attorney-General (“AG”)
                    objected to the part-call application. They submitted that permitting a practice
                    trainee who has not completed Part B (<em>ie</em>,
                    completed the preparatory course leading up to the Part B Examinations
                    (“Part B Course”) <em>and</em> passed the
                    Part B Examinations) to be part-called was not appropriate. The Singapore
                    Institute of Legal Education (“SILE”) did not object to this
                    application. The issue to be decided in this case was whether a practice trainee
                    should be permitted to be part-called subject to his or her completion of the
                    Part B Course and passing the Part B Examinations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr Teo’s situation was somewhat unusual.
                    Mr Teo had completed the final examinations of his Juris Doctor degree from the
                    University of Sydney on 23 November 2013. Given the timing of his return to
                    Singapore upon completion of his studies, he chose to commence his relevant
                    legal training (“RLT”) with Selvam LLC on 2 January 2014 and
                    completed it six months later. This was an unusual situation; graduates from
                    overseas universities, such as those graduating from universities in the United
                    Kingdom, would usually only undertake their RLT after completing the Part A
                    Examinations. This was because the timing of their graduation was likely to be
                    in June, which used to be just prior to the commencement of the preparatory
                    course leading up to the Part A Examinations (“Part A
                    Course”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Upon completing the Part A Course, the National
                    University of Singapore certified on 24 December 2014 that Mr Teo had passed the
                    Part A Examinations. By then, he had commenced his practice training contract
                    with the Firm on 4 December 2014 and received approval from SILE in February
                    2015 on the manner in which he was to serve his practice training period. By 30
                    January 2015, Mr Teo’s name had also been entered into the register of
                    qualified persons maintained by SILE. Thus, prior to commencing his practice
                    training contract with the Firm on 4 December 2014, Mr Teo did not have the
                    opportunity to undergo the Part B Course or the Part B Examinations. This
                    part-call application was filed about four months after Mr Teo had commenced his
                    practice training contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       For the purposes of this application, Mr Teo
                    listed out the details of his practical legal experience garnered over the
                    years. This included attending pre-trial conferences, criminal sentencing
                    hearings, a civil trial in the State Court, and attending an appeal against a
                    summary judgment before a Judge in chambers during his vacation internships in
                    the years of 2011 and 2012. In addition, during his RLT, he also attended a
                    hearing involving an application for a worldwide Mareva injunction, and an
                    application for pre-action discovery. Lastly, during his training contract with
                    the Firm, he attended a 10-day criminal trial in the State Court and assisted in
                    a striking-out application. The applicant also claimed that, as an Australian
                    graduate, Mr Teo had the benefit of undertaking mandatory studies in the area of
                    civil procedure, criminal procedure, and professional ethics, which overlapped
                    with subjects in the Part B Course, and he was thus equipped with a basic
                    understanding on these subjects. References were also made to Mr Teo’s
                    commendable grades obtained in his Juris Doctor degree from the University of
                    Sydney.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The applicant submitted that s 32(3) of the Act
                    contains certain mandatory requirements, but does not include an express
                    requirement that the practice trainee has to complete the Part B Course in order
                    to be part-called. The purpose or object of this section, it was submitted, was
                    to “serve the interest of the profession by permitting a practice trainee
                    some introduction to pleading and gain for him some direct experience
                    thereto”. To this end, the applicant submitted that Mr Teo possesses
                    sufficient practical experience, as outlined above at [5], for the purposes of
                    being part-called.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law Society’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Law Society conceded that there is no
                    express requirement in s 32(3) but relied on the amendments to the Act by
                    way of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2011 (Act 8 of 2011)
                    (“the Amendment Act 2011”) which expanded the scope of what a
                    qualified person within the meaning s 2(1) of the Act could do after being
                    part-called. The right of audience, it was submitted, was no longer restricted
                    to a Judge or Registrar in chambers but a qualified person could now appear in
                    open court on behalf of the Singapore law practice with which he had a training
                    contract. The Law Society submitted that since the scope of appearance for a
                    part-called qualified person had expanded, a more stringent qualifying criterion
                    should be applied to those seeking to be part-called.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       To this end, it was submitted that completion of
                    the Part B Course and Part B Examinations is a suitable qualifying criterion,
                    given that the content taught through the Civil Litigation Practice and Criminal
                    Litigation Practice modules equip the qualified person with the necessary
                    substantive and procedural knowledge to appear in court. The Ethics &amp;
                    Professional Responsibility module would also ensure that the qualified person
                    has knowledge and understanding of an advocate and solicitor’s duties to
                    the court and his client. In comparison, the Law Society submitted that the
                    practical experience garnered “simply does not vest the qualified person
                    with a comprehensive understanding of the court processes and their
                    rationales” and “will not be sufficient enough to equip the
                    qualified person with the ethical awareness required of him when he appears in
                    Court.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Attorney-General’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The AG submitted that all persons appearing
                    before the court owed the same duties as those owed by an advocate and solicitor
                    of the Supreme Court. The successful completion of the Part B Course would
                    impart the basic skills and knowledge on the procedural law and practice in
                    Singapore which are necessary for such persons to discharge their duties as
                    officers of the court. The court should thus be slow to exercise its discretion
                    to allow a qualified person who has not completed Part B to appear in court on
                    behalf of a Singapore law practice and, in the present application, the
                    Applicant had not adduced sufficient evidence that his practice trainee has
                    acquired the basic skills and knowledge which he would otherwise have acquired
                    through the Part B Course.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Under s 32(3) of the Act, the court has
                    an overriding discretion in respect of allowing qualified persons to be
                    part-called. Section 32(3) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A Judge may, <em>if he thinks
                            fit</em>, on the application of any advocate and solicitor in
                        active practice in a Singapore law practice, allow a qualified person who
                        has served <em>not less than 3 months</em> of his
                        practice training period, and who is serving his practice training period
                        under a practice training contract with that Singapore law practice at the
                        time the application is made, to appear, on behalf of that Singapore law
                        practice, before —</p>

                                described) of a Family Court or Youth Court, or the registrar, the

                                added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     After reviewing the submissions, I accepted
                    that while the completion of the Part B Course and Part B Examinations is not an
                    express requirement, in my view, s 32(3) of the Act was drafted on the
                    assumption that practice trainees applying to be part-called would have
                    satisfactorily completed such courses of instruction and passed such
                    examinations as the SILE may prescribe as necessary for admission as an advocate
                    and solicitor of the Supreme Court. Section 32(3) of the Act has to be read
                    in light of the entire schema of the Act and the rules enacted pursuant to the
                    Act. For example, s 13(1) of the Act lists out the requirements for
                    admission:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13.</b>—(1) Subject to any
                        rules made under section 14, no qualified person shall be admitted as

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    has attained the
                                age of 21 years;</p>

                                character;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    has
                                satisfactorily served the practice training period applicable to
                                him;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    has attended and
                                satisfactorily completed such courses of instruction as the Board of
                                Directors of the Institute may prescribe under
                                section 10;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>e</em>)    has passed such

                                prescribe under section 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Part B Course and the Part B Examinations
                    have both been prescribed for the purposes of ss 13(1)(<em>d</em>) and 13(1)(<em>e</em>) of the Act under
                    Part II of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 (Cap 161,
                    S 244/2011) (“the 2011 Rules”). It was noteworthy that the
                    requirements for part-call are linked to the duration of practice training that
                    has been completed (<em>ie</em>, not less than three
                    months), but do not address the other requirements for admission under the Act,
                    including the courses of instruction and examinations prescribed under the Act.
                    But Part IV of the 2011 Rules provided a possible explanation as to why
                    this is so. It states that the requirements relating to practice training period
                    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>16.</b>—(1) Subject to
                        paragraph (2) and section 14(5) of the Act, no qualified person

                        he —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    has attended and
                                satisfactorily completed the preparatory course leading to Part B of
                                the Singapore Bar Examinations; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    has sat for the
                                written examinations for all examinable subjects in Part B of the
                                Singapore Bar Examinations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Though there are exceptions to the
                    requirements in r 16(1) of the 2011 Rules, which allows for applicants like
                    Mr Teo to complete their practice training period prior to attending the Part B
                    Course, r 16(1) is instructive in allowing us to understand s 32(3) of
                    the Act and the context in which it was drafted. Given that the default scenario
                    seems to be that one would complete the Part B Course and Part B Examinations
                        <em>prior</em> to commencing the practice training
                    period, it is reasonable to think that s 32(3) was similarly drafted on
                    that basis, and that it is assumed that practice trainees seeking to be
                    part-called would have already completed the necessary preparatory courses and
                    examinations required for admission as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme
                    Court. I thus agreed with the AG’s submissions that courts should be slow
                    to exercise their discretion to allow part-call applications when a practice
                    trainee has yet to complete the Part B Course and Examinations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Part B Course is a rigorous course that
                    equips students with both substantive and procedural knowledge on law and
                    practice in Singapore relevant to civil and criminal litigation, and other areas
                    of practice. It also prepares those who wish to be admitted as an advocate and
                    solicitor by instructing them on the prevailing standards of conduct expected of
                    them. These knowledge and skills are necessary for such persons to discharge
                    their duties as officers of the court when appearing before the
                    court—which would include, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    assisting the court in arriving at a just decision, bringing any procedural
                    irregularity to the attention of the court during the hearing, and avoiding any
                    unnecessary wastage of the court’s time. These standards are equally
                    applicable to part-called practice trainees appearing before the court, who owe
                    the same duties to the court as those owed by an advocate and solicitor of the
                    Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I did not accept the Law Society’s
                    submissions that the 2011 amendments to the Act mean that a more stringent
                    criterion should now be applied to practice trainees seeking to be part-called.
                    Prior to the Amendment Act 2011, s 32(3) stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A Judge may, if he thinks fit, on the application of any
                        advocate and solicitor in active practice in a Singapore law practice, allow
                        a qualified person who is receiving supervised training in relation to the
                        practice of Singapore law under a practice training contract with that
                        Singapore law practice, and who has served <em>not less than
                            4 months</em> of his practice training period, to appear on behalf
                        of that Singapore law practice, or any advocate and solicitor in active
                        practice therein, before —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    a Judge or the
                                Registrar <em>in chambers</em>;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    a District
                                Judge, a Magistrate, the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts or a
                                Deputy Registrar of the Subordinate Courts <em>in
                                    chambers</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    a District Judge
                                or a Magistrate to mention a case or to apply for bail. [emphasis
                                added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Though the amendments did allow a practice
                    trainee to be part-called one month earlier, and enabled them to handle a wider
                    range of applications, there was no indication from Parliament that a more
                    stringent criterion should thus now be applied. Parliamentary discussion on the
                    2011 amendments merely stated that they were meant to enhance the practice
                    training experience for trainees such that “they can now be part-called
                    earlier and handle a broader scope of work” (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (14 February 2011)
                    vol 87 at col 2590). In the absence of an indication that a more
                    stringent criterion should be applied, I was of the view that the same criterion
                    should be applied in assessing part-call applications as before—to assess
                    whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge and experience to be able to
                    carry out his duties as an officer of the court. Thus, a practice trainee who
                    seeks to be part-called prior to completing Part B should be prepared to
                    demonstrate that he has sufficient knowledge and experience in the subject areas
                    taught in the Part B Course, and that his failure to complete Part B should not
                    be an obstacle to carrying out his duties owed to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this case, the applicant failed to
                    demonstrate that Mr Teo has sufficient knowledge and experience in the areas of
                    Singapore civil procedure, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, ethics and
                    professional responsibility, <em>etc</em>. Although the
                    applicant referred to Mr Teo’s Juris Doctor degree which included courses
                    on procedure and evidence, he did not provide details of the content of such
                    courses. In any event, such courses taught in an overseas university are not
                    geared towards imparting knowledge and skills on Singapore law and practice in
                    these areas to their students. The applicant also relied on Mr Teo’s
                    experience garnered during his RLT and the first few months of his practice
                    training period to argue that he has an abundance of practical experience on
                    Singapore law. Be that as it may, in my view, this is not an adequate substitute
                    for the Part B Course and Examinations. This may have enabled him to gain some
                    knowledge and experience on disparate areas of the law, but falls short of what
                    students gain during the Part B Course—a comprehensive understanding of
                    Singapore law and practice on various areas. The RLT is also in itself a
                    requirement of Mr Teo becoming a qualified person to be admitted as an advocate
                    and solicitor in the first place, and there would be an element of
                    double-counting if I were to treat his experience during the RLT as something
                    that could compensate for him not completing the Part B Course and Examinations.
                    Hence, I did not consider this to be a relevant factor in assessing Mr
                    Teo’s suitability to be part-called.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     At this juncture, it is important to note that
                    the Law Society and the AG have admitted that there have been previous cases in
                    which part-call applications have been granted to persons who have yet to
                    complete Part B, and they did not object in those cases. But I observed that
                    these cases largely involved practice trainees who had a diploma in law from
                    polytechnics like Temasek Polytechnic, and had actually worked as paralegals for
                    a number of years before studying for a law degree. In those situations, the
                    applicants were able to show in-depth knowledge and experience on areas of
                    Singapore law and the standards that were expected of them as an advocate and
                    solicitor of the Supreme Court, and this was experience which could compensate
                    for them not having completed the Part B prior to the filing of their part-call
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In conclusion, I decided that this was not an
                    appropriate case to exercise my discretion to allow a part-call application. As
                    Professor Tan Yock Lin states in Tan Yock Lin, <em>The Law of
                        Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</em>
                    (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at pp 127:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 32(3) … contemplates the possibility of pupils being
                        accorded a limited right of audience. … Such concession is made in
                        the interests of the profession so as to permit a pupil some introduction to
                        pleading and gain for him some direct experience in pleading. <em>But equally clearly, such concession must not lead to a
                            miscarriage of justice</em>. Having regard to these underlying
                        objectives, the court will exercise its discretion. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>An applicant who has not completed Part B can qualify for
                        part-call if he can cite other qualifications or experience which are
                        sufficient to enable him to carry out his functions as an officer of the
                        court. He may not need to show that these qualifications or experience give
                        him <em>all</em> the knowledge covered by the Part B
                        Course, but he does need to show adequate and sufficient knowledge to enable
                        him to carry out his functions as an officer of the court in this country
                        such that the concession for part-call must not lead to a miscarriage of
                        justice. In this case, I found that the applicant was not able to
                        demonstrate that Mr Teo had sufficient and adequate knowledge and
                        experience, and therefore dismissed the application.</p>
