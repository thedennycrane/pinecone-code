</div> The DJ noted that the Wife’s expenditure amounted to approximately $75,000 in six months, or about $12,500 per month, relating to a number of unaccounted expenditures or transactions. The DJ addressed this issue by relying on case law (<span class="font-italic">USC v USD</span> [2020] SGFC 76 at [114], <span class="font-italic">TYS v TYT</span> [2017] 5 SLR 244 at [45]–[48] and <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 at [29]–[30]) to draw an adverse inference against the Wife and then adjusted the eventual ratio of division against the Wife.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">113 The reasons for this stark difference is because at the time of the hearing, the sale of the matrimonial home had not been completed. In fact, parties have not yet collected the keys to the matrimonial home. That is the reason why the [Wife] had valued the property as ”0”. To be clear, Ms Tan [counsel for the Wife] was not taking the view that the matrimonial property had no value, but because the sale had not been completed, and no loan had been drawn and there was not [sic] comparative sale price to use as a benchmark, any value attributed to the matrimonial property would be speculative at best.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114 It is against that backdrop where Ms Chong [counsel for the Husband] submitted that the matrimonial property be “surrendered”, and for parties to receive a refund of the deposits they have made. In this regard, there is no dispute that parties had equally contributed the principal sum of $16,141.50 each from their respective CPF accounts. On the other hand, Ms Tan’s submission was that the matrimonial [home] be transferred to the [Wife]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115 After considering parties’ submissions, I was not inclined to accede to the [Wife’s] request for the property to be transferred to the [Wife]. While I noted Ms Tan’s submission that by transferring the property, the [Wife] would be the person solely bearing the mortgage, this misses the more fundamental point that the [Wife] would be receiving an asset which is a matrimonial asset which, ordinarily, would have to be divided. Put another way, it would be unfair for the [Wife], on the deposit sum she made, to obtain a large and valuable asset without any further consideration or “compensation” to the [Husband]. Indeed, in<span class="font-italic"> her own written submissions</span>, the [Wife] offered no position on the kind of payment which could be made to the [Husband] in exchange for her obtaining the matrimonial property. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 In my judgment, I was of the view that it would be a cleaner break for neither party to obtain the property, For it to be surrendered (or returned) to the HDB, and for parties to obtain the relevant refunds (less any applicable fees/penalties) in the proportion of their respective contributions. With their respective funds, parties are free to move on [and] look for their own accommodation on their own terms. I pause here and note that the matrimonial property is located nearby parties’ respective addresses, so the locality of the matrimonial property is, at best, a neutral factor. Furthermore, given also that neither the parties nor the Children has [sic] lived in the matrimonial property, there would be no acclimatization issues.  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the Appellant’s case, the Wife submitted that the DJ erroneously placed undue emphasis on the brevity of the parties’ marriage without adequately considering the Wife’s contribution in carrying and giving birth to two children during that period of time,

Further, as the BTO flat will eventually be mortgaged, the Wife submitted that the DJ should have considered it a liability instead. The liability was one which she is willing to bear on her own post-divorce. She pointed out that, save for his principal CPF contribution of $16,141.50, the Husband would not have to bear the liability of the mortgage for the BTO flat. She added that her purchase of the BTO flat should be without the need to refund the Husband’s CPF moneys (including accrued interest) that he utilised towards the purchase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Wife stated that she and the children are currently residing at her parents’ flat but the children will eventually require a permanent home of their own, relying on <span class="font-italic">Tham</span><span class="font-italic"> Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 336.

</div> It would amount to giving her a windfall. It would also make a mockery of the DJ’s decision to adjust the ratio in order to draw an adverse inference against the Wife for depleting almost half of her fixed deposit of $120,000 without satisfactory explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Every case on the division of matrimonial assets turns on the facts of the case in question.
