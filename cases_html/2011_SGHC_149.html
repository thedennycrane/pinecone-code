<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Conclusive evidence or verification clauses,
                    commonly found in banking documentation, have consistently been upheld by the
                    courts, <em>inter alia</em>, on the premise that banks who
                    insert them “<em>are known to be honest and reliable men
                        of business who are most unlikely to make a mistake</em>” (per
                    Lord Denning MR in <em>Bache &amp; Co (London) Ltd v Banque
                        Vernes et Commerciale de Paris SA </em>[1973]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 437 at 440). Such clauses have been upheld to exonerate
                    banks from liability in honouring cheques that were <em>subsequently</em> established to bear the forged signatures of their
                    customers. From my survey of the case law, there has been no occasion where the
                    courts have had to pronounce on the validity of such a clause when invoked to
                    exculpate a bank from liability of the fraud of its own employees engaging in
                    unauthorised trades. If such clauses were to be upheld in relation to such
                    unauthorised trades, the risk of fraud of the bank’s employee, entirely
                    within the sphere of control of the bank, would be shifted to the customer. Are
                    such clauses, even if worded broadly enough to encompass the fraud of the
                    bank’s employee, enforceable? Is the lack of case authority explained by
                    banks’ intuitive recognition that such liability cannot be validly
                    excluded or perhaps by reason of other commercial considerations? This is
                    precisely the principal issue that presented itself before me for determination
                    in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Material Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Jiang Ou
                    (“Mdm Jiang”) is a citizen of the People’s Republic of
                    China (“China”) and a permanent resident of Singapore. At all
                    material times, Mdm Jiang was a substantial shareholder, the General
                    Manager and Managing Director of Liaoning New Wentai Paper Industries Co Ltd, a
                    company engaged in the business of manufacturing of paper and paper
                    products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant, EFG Bank AG (“EFG
                    Bank”) is a bank incorporated in Switzerland, licensed to operate as a
                    bank in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 2008, Mdm Jiang and her husband applied
                    for permanent residence under the Monetary Authority of Singapore
                    (“MAS”) Financial Investor Scheme (“FIS”). Under
                    this scheme, an individual can apply for permanent residence in Singapore by
                    depositing a sum of at least S$5 million with an approved bank regulated by the
                    MAS, for a continuous period of five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In support of her application for permanent
                    residence under the FIS, Mdm Jiang opened a <em>non-discretionary</em> account (Account No XXX) (“the FIS
                    Account”), with EFG Bank on or around 2 June 2008. A
                    non-discretionary account is distinct from a discretionary account in that
                    Mdm Jiang’s instruction or mandate (written or oral) was required
                    prior to the valid execution of any transaction by EFG Bank. Mr Ng Ton Yee
                    (“Mr Ng”), an employee of the EFG Bank as well as
                    Mdm Jiang’s client relationship officer, purported to witness
                    Mdm Jiang signing the account opening documentation in China though it was
                    not disputed that Mr Ng was not present in China at that
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the customer information profile,
                    Mdm Jang was described by EFG Bank as someone with “<em>little level of understanding of financial
                        products</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and her objective was clearly stated as
                    achievement of capital growth balanced with an emphasis on “<em>Capital Protection</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Additionally, from the transcript
                    of a voice log conversation between Mdm Jiang and Mr Ng on 5 September
                        2008,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> it appeared that Mr Ng was fully aware
                    that she did not understand English and needed him to explain the relevant EFG
                    Bank documents to her.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     From 24 July 2008 until 14 August 2008,
                    Mdm Jiang deposited a total of US$4,999,957.50 into her FIS Account. On or
                    about 15 August 2008, Mdm Jiang, on the advice of Mr Ng, opened
                    another portfolio account to deposit the excess FIS monies (<em>ie</em> the difference between the US$4,999,957.50 deposit and the
                    required S$5 million for the FIS Account). On or about 16 August 2008,
                    Mr Ng advised Mdm Jiang to convert the FIS monies into Australian
                    Dollars to benefit from the higher interest rates to which Mdm Jiang
                        agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She
                    also accepted that Mr Ng could engage in “minor” transactions
                    involving currency conversion of the FIS monies to benefit from the higher
                    interest rates. It is noteworthy that this was the <em>only</em> type of transaction authorised by
                Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Between 5 August 2008 and 1 April 2009, EFG
                    Bank through Mr Ng executed a series of 160 high-volume and/or high risk
                    leveraged foreign exchange and securities transactions (“the 160
                    transactions”) purportedly on behalf of Mdm Jiang. None of the 160
                    transactions fell within the “minor” transactions which Mr Ng
                    was authorised to carry out for the currency conversion of the FIS
                    monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 1 April 2009, at a meeting with
                    Mdm Jiang and her husband in Shenyang, China, Mr Ng
                    “confessed” that he had entered into the160 transactions without
                    the knowledge or consent of Mdm Jiang which resulted in losses to her FIS
                    Account. Mr Ng pleaded with Mdm Jiang for time to make good the losses
                    within three months.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> When Mr Ng
                    failed to do so, Mdm Jiang and her husband arranged to meet the Managing
                    Director of EFG Bank, Mr Kees Stoute (“Mr Stoute”) on 11
                    September 2009. At this meeting, Mdm Jiang averred that Mr Ng admitted
                    in the presence of Mr Stoute that he had entered into the
                    160 transactions without her authority.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> On
                    18 September 2009, Mdm Jiang together with her solicitor had a meeting with
                    EFG Bank’s representatives, Mr Tan Kay Siong and Mr Ong Beng
                    Guan (“Mr Ong”) at which time she was informed that EFG Bank
                    was undertaking an internal investigation and that she would be informed of the
                    outcome. EFG Bank has since claimed privilege over the internal investigation
                    report and has not informed Mdm Jiang of the outcome of its
                    investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was common ground between the parties that
                    as a result of the 160 transactions executed by Mr Ng,
                    Mdm Jiang’s FIS Account suffered a loss of US$2,338,278.68. EFG Bank
                    denied liability for the losses and consequently Mdm Jiang commenced this
                    action by way of writ on 15 December 2009, seeking recovery of the said sum of
                    US$2,338,278.68 from EFG Bank on the principal basis that the 160 transactions
                    were executed without her knowledge or consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">EFG Bank’s case </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From 15 December 2009 until 28 March 2011 (the

                    Mdm Jiang’s assertion in her Statement of Claim that the 160

                        Account</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On the premise that the 160
                    transactions were authorised, EFG Bank further alleged that although
                    Mdm Jiang had received all the transaction confirmation slips in respect of
                    the 160 transactions as well as the other bank statements (collectively
                    “the transaction documents”), she did not protest that the
                    160 transactions were unauthorised. Consequently EFG Bank asserted that
                    Mdm Jiang was “<em>estopped</em> from now
                    denying that the trades were authorised”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Conspicuously, no particulars of estoppel were
                    pleaded. Neither did EFG Bank plead any specific clause in the Agreement in
                    support of the estoppel defence. In fact the only clauses of the Agreement
                    pleaded by EFG Bank in its Defence were cll 6 and 8 of the Account Mandate
                    and Trading Terms which dealt with investment advice provided by EFG Bank and
                    its entitlement to charge fees for services rendered to
                Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 28 March 2011, in its Opening Statement,
                    counsel for EFG Bank, Mr Siraj Omar (“Mr Omar”), made a
                    complete about-turn and conceded that, “[t]he Bank <em>does not have any record of specific instructions</em> given by
                    Mdm Jiang in respect of the Transactions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Upon EFG Bank’s admission that it did
                    not have any record of written instructions or voice logs of specific
                    instructions given by Mdm Jiang in relation to the 160 transactions, it
                    became clear that EFG Bank accepted <em>for the first
                        time</em> that the 160 transactions were in fact unauthorised. Arising
                    from EFG Bank’s admission, Mr Lawrence Quahe, counsel for
                    Mdm Jiang (“Mr Quahe”) was able to streamline the causes
                    of action pursued by Mdm Jiang to an action for breach of the Agreement;
                    abandoning the alternative causes of action for breach of fiduciary duties,
                    breach of implied terms, breach of duty of care and undue influence. In support
                    of her original causes of action, Mdm Jiang engaged the services of an
                    expert witness, Ms Janice Chua Bee Lian (“Ms Chua”)
                    whose expertise in fraud prevention and corporate risk management was procured
                    to assist the court on the prevailing private banking practices in Singapore.
                    She submitted an expert report, <em>inter alia</em>, to
                    demonstrate that the prevailing industry practice dictated that EFG Bank should
                    have obtained and recorded the instructions or authorisation from Mdm Jiang
                    prior to the execution of any of the 160 transactions in respect of her
                    non-discretionary FIS Account. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As regards Mdm Jiang’s
                    breach of duty claim, Ms Chua provided a comparative analysis of
                    EFG Bank’s conduct, the prevailing industry practice and safeguards
                    commonly put in place in relation to, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    a non English speaking client, compliance with the client’s risk profile
                    and the frequency and mailing of transaction documents. However, following EFG
                    Bank’s admission that the 160 transactions were in fact unauthorised,
                    Ms Chua’s testimony was no longer necessary and was therefore not
                    adduced. In light of the mandatory requirement of instructions in respect of her
                    non-discretionary FIS Account, Mdm Jiang submitted that the unauthorised
                    transactions were void and that EFG Bank should bear the loss of US$2,338,278.68
                    occasioned by the 160 transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Having conceded that the 160 transactions were
                    unauthorised, EFG Bank’s defence at trial was that by reason of
                    receipt of all the transaction documents, pursuant to the conclusive evidence
                    clauses set out in the Agreement under cll 3.1and 3.2, as well as the
                    presumption of delivery of the transaction documents under cl 4 of the
                    General Conditions, Mdm Jiang was precluded from disputing the unauthorised
                    transactions. What was regrettable was the glaring omission that EFG Bank had
                    failed to plead cll 3.1, 3.2 or 4 of the General Conditions which formed
                    the heart of its defence at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mdm Jiang claimed that prior to April
                    2009 she did not receive any of the transaction documents from EFG Bank save for
                    the 18 documents she had received from 29 July 2008 to 5 January
                        2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Of the 18 documents received by
                    Mdm Jiang, 12 were transaction confirmation slips while the remaining six
                    were non-transactional in nature. Of the 160 transactions listed in Schedule A
                    of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), Mdm Jiang accepted that she
                    received the transaction confirmation slips for the unauthorised transactions
                    listed as serial numbers 1, 19, 20, 51, 57, 58, 61, 62, 75, 76, 77 and
                        86.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Contrarily, EFG Bank
                    submitted that all the transaction documents for the 160 transactions were sent
                    by ordinary mail to Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Discovery of the internal protocols relating to EFG Bank’s mail
                system</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     An understanding of the factual background of
                    this dispute would not be complete without a detailed review of the discovery
                    process in respect of the various internal protocols of EFG Bank. It was common
                    ground between the parties that in order to rely on cll 3.1 and 3.2,
                    cl 4 of the General Conditions must first be satisfied. While EFG Bank
                    pleaded that all of the transaction documents were sent by ordinary mail to
                    Mdm Jiang, only <em>at the trial</em> did it rely on
                    cl 4 to argue that Mdm Jiang was deemed to have received them. This
                    was because prior to the commencement of the trial, EFG Bank’s case was
                    that the 160 transactions were validly authorised by
                Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Prior to the trial, Mdm Jiang sought
                    discovery of a wide range of EFG Bank’s internal documents including
                    its internal protocols relating to the “<em>post mailing
                        system of the Defendant with respect to the transmission of account
                        statements, transaction confirmation slips and other relevant documents to
                        local and overseas clients of the Defendant</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Mdm Jiang requested discovery of
                    EFG Bank’s internal protocols including the protocol relating to its
                    postal mailing system on three separate occasions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     By a letter dated 1 April 2010,
                        Mdm Jiang’s solicitors requested EFG Bank to disclose a range of
                        documents including its internal protocol relating to the postal mailing
                        system. In reply, in a letter dated 26 April 2010, EFG Bank’s
                        solicitors took the position that the internal protocols (<em>even if they existed</em>) were irrelevant and
                    privileged.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mdm Jiang then filed an application pursuant to Summons
                        No 2174/2010 on 17 May 2010 for discovery of the internal
                        protocols. EFG Bank stated that the160 transactions were <em>authorised</em> and thereby the internal protocols were
                        irrelevant. The Assistant Registrar (“AR”) agreed with EFG
                        Bank and dismissed the application on the ground of <em>irrelevance</em> as the issue relating to posting or receipt of
                        the transaction documents did not arise from the
                    pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     On 16
                        September 2010, Mdm Jiang then amended her Statement of Claim to
                        include a claim against EFG Bank for breach of an implied term in failing,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, to “implement processes
                        and procedures to ensure prompt confirmation of transactions to facilitate
                        timely detection of unauthorised transactions”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This amendment was introduced
                        in an effort to bring the internal protocol relating to the postal mailing
                        system into issue to warrant discovery of the same. The application for
                        specific discovery pursuant to Summons No 5921/2010 was filed on
                        21 December 2010. The AR again dismissed Mdm Jiang’s
                        application on the ground of <em>irrelevance</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the affidavit filed by Mr Ong to
                    resist the discovery applications, there was no mention that no such written
                    protocol existed. At the discovery hearing, Mr Omar highlighted to the AR
                    that “<em>the touchstone</em> [of any discovery
                    application] <em>is relevance and this is determined by the
                        pleadings</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Mr Omar’s main submission to
                    oppose the discovery applications was that since the 160 transactions were
                        “<em>not unauthorised</em>”, <em>ie</em> “authorised”, the internal protocols
                    would not be able to address the issue of whether the transactions were
                    authorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It became clear on the first day of the trial
                    that the discovery applications were successfully resisted by EFG Bank on the
                    wrong and somewhat disingenuous premise that the 160 transactions were
                    authorised. EFG Bank would have known by the time of the discovery applications
                    or even by the time of the request from Mdm Jiang’s solicitors that
                    the 160 transactions were unauthorised. It would have been plain and obvious to
                    EFG Bank by then that there were no written or oral instructions to support the
                    160 transactions since it had initiated investigations in September 2009, long
                    before the first discovery application was filed. It was on the basis that the
                    160 transactions were authorised that the ARs found on two separate occasions
                    that the internal protocols were irrelevant. More will be said about the
                    discovery of the internal protocols when I evaluate the quality and reliability
                    of EFG Bank’s sole witness for the trial, Mr Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Following EFG Bank’s long overdue
                    admission that the160 transactions were unauthorised, the remaining issues for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As this was essentially a factual inquiry, it
                    would be useful to first address the question as to which party bore the burden
                    of proof of posting. In <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Limited v
                        Credit Suisse</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 273 (“<em>Pertamina</em>”), the Court of Appeal followed

                        Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 824 (“<em>Ri
                        Jong Son</em>”) at [65]
                    and held that prior to undertaking any analysis of the relevant conclusive
                    evidence clause, the defendant bank bore the burden of first proving that the
                    account statements were effectively dispatched. In the face of such a clear
                    statement of the law, Mr Omar conceded that the burden was indeed on EFG
                    Bank to prove on a balance of probabilities that the transaction documents were
                    sent by ordinary mail to Mdm Jiang and that failure to discharge the burden
                    would be fatal to EFG Bank’s entire defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before embarking on a detailed analysis of
                    cl 4, it is apposite to mention that cl 4 was not specifically pleaded
                    by EFG Bank. This was probably another reason why the ARs ruled that the
                    internal protocols were irrelevant.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As a preliminary point, Mr Quahe raised

                        (this was strictly incorrect as cl 3.1 does not include this term), the
                        prefix “transaction” was missing from
                        “confirmation” in cl 4.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> On this premise, he submitted
                        that from the standpoint of the reasonable business person surveying the
                        Agreement, the term “confirmation” in cl 4 would not be
                        wide enough to include transaction confirmations.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, applying the objective
                        principle, Mr Quahe further submitted that the omission of the prefix
                        “transaction” from “confirmation” in cl 4
                        should be construed as the deliberate intention of the parties to exclude
                        transaction confirmations from the ambit of cl 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, he alluded to the perverse
                        situation that could arise if “customers of a bank could be exposed
                        to indeterminate liability by the mere fact that a transaction confirmation
                        slip or statement was sent to the customer at the last known address and was
                        not challenged within the time prescribed”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He submitted that
                        this eventuality could be avoided if cl 4 was interpreted to exclude
                        transaction confirmations. The illustration of a Singapore Armed Forces
                        serviceman away on a relief mission unable to challenge otherwise
                        unauthorised transaction confirmations within the 30-day window was advanced
                        in support of the unreasonable outcome hypothesis.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     The crux of Mr Quahe’s
                        argument was that the deliberate omission of “transaction”
                        from the general breed of “confirmations” referred to under
                        cl 4 was to avoid such a perverse outcome. Mr Quahe submitted
                        that, if cl 4 were determined not to apply to transaction
                        confirmations, EFG Bank would have to prove on the balance of probabilities
                        that the transaction confirmations for the 160 transactions were in fact
                        sent and delivered to Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Mr Omar submitted that the effect of
                    cl 4 was straightforward. If EFG Bank was able to show that the
                    transaction documents were sent to Mdm Jiang by way of one of the modes of
                    delivery set out therein, by operation of cl 4, the transaction documents
                    would be deemed to have been validly sent and delivered to Mdm Jiang.
                    Mr Omar submitted that it was clear that cl 4 was wide enough to
                    encompass all of the transaction documents, including transaction confirmations.
                    While the precise term “transaction confirmation” may be absent
                    from cl 4, EFG Bank submitted that “transaction
                    confirmations” would be included under the phrase “documents which
                    may have legal consequences to the client
                [Mdm Jiang]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my view, Mr Quahe’s
                    interpretation of the omission of “transaction” from
                    “confirmation” in cl 4 was overly technical and ignored the
                    fact, as rightly pointed out by Mr Omar that transaction confirmations
                    would fall under the rubric of “documents which may have legal
                    consequences”. It is undeniable that the transaction confirmations
                    forming the subject matter of this enquiry have legal consequences to
                    Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Additionally, while Mr Quahe sought to
                    establish that the transaction documents were not posted to Mdm Jiang
                    because they might have been intercepted by Mr Ng or someone acting at his
                    behest, it must be made clear that Mdm Jiang has no burden to prove the
                    interception. In other words, a finding that EFG Bank had, on the evidence,
                    failed to discharge the burden of proof of posting was not tantamount to a
                    finding that the transaction documents were <em>in
                        fact</em> intercepted prior to posting to
                Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Proof of sending</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Under cl 4, the transaction documents
                    were deemed to have been validly delivered to Mdm Jiang upon proof of one
                    of the following modes of delivery:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">actual delivery by hand; or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">mailing by ordinary mail to the last known
                            address of Mdm Jiang; or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">any other manner which EFG Bank may reasonably
                            consider appropriate. This could encompass delivery by facsimile or
                            electronic mail.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Upon delivery by any of the above modes, the dates of issue appearing
                    on the transaction documents shall be considered as the dates of delivery to
                    Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present case, EFG Bank relied on proof
                    of posting by ordinary mail and sought to discharge its burden of proof by
                    calling its only witness, Mr Ong, the Head of Operations, for the trial.
                    EFG Bank did not adduce any other form of evidence, written or through the
                    testimony of other witnesses, to prove and/or corroborate its case. EFG Bank was
                    therefore content to rest its <em>entire</em> factual
                    defence on one sole witness. All other personnel who had any involvement with
                    Mdm Jiang’s FIS Account (<em>ie</em> Mr Ng,
                    Ms Linda Lee and Ms Alicia Ng who assisted Mr Ng and
                    Ms Jessie Tan, Head of Private Banking, whom Mr Ng reported to) had
                    either been terminated by EFG Bank or had since left its employ and were not
                    called to testify on behalf of EFG Bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>
                    The quality of Mr Ong’s evidence was accordingly pivotal to EFG
                    Bank’s defence. Prior to my evaluation of the quality of
                    Mr Ong’s evidence, it is perhaps useful to review decisions where the
                    same issue was considered to assist my determination of whether the burden in
                    this case has been satisfactorily discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Ri Jong Son</em>,
                    the plaintiff claimed that remittance instructions which the defendant bank had
                    complied with to transfer funds from an account bore his forged signature and
                    consequently sought a declaration that the transfer was without his authority
                    and of no legal effect. The defendant bank denied liability and relied on its
                    clause that all bank statements sent by post shall be deemed to have been
                    received by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Ms Tan, an officer from the
                    administration department of the defendant bank, rather than the person who
                    actually dealt with the mailing of statements, testified in relation to the
                    defendant bank’s procedure for sending the weekly, quarterly and yearly
                    statements of accounts to the bank’s customers. She explained that based
                    on the defendant bank’s procedure, she believed that the disputed
                    statements were duly generated and mailed to the customer. In support, the
                    defendant bank produced some computer generated checklists in relation to the
                    documents which were sent out. Ms Tan explained that crosses were marked on
                    a checklist by the mail room operators when they had completed their jobs and
                    ticks were marked on another checklist to indicate that the documents had been
                    posted. However, on examination of the checklists, the court found that the
                    entries in some of the checklists were unmarked, some were marked with crosses
                    but without ticks and none of the markings were dated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Under these circumstances, the court held that
                    the person who dealt with the statements and made the crosses and ticks would
                    have been the appropriate witness to explain the checklists. Further, although
                    Ms Tan stated in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”)
                    that the statements were sent to the customer, she did not explain the basis and
                    source of her belief or knowledge. For these reasons, in <em>Ri
                        Jong Son</em>, the court held that Ms Tan’s evidence was
                    not sufficient to discharge the burden on the defendant bank of proof of posting
                    of the disputed statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In <em>Tjoa Elis v United
                        Overseas Bank</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 747 (“<em>Tjoa Elis</em>”), the defendant bank had a two-part
                    system in place for dispatching bank statements to its customers. The first part
                    involved the printing of statements and the second part involved inserting these
                    statements into envelopes, sealing them and delivering them to the post office.
                    While the first part was carried out by the bank, the second part was carried
                    out by a third party, Datapost Pte Ltd (“Datapost”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Evidence was given by the operations manager
                    of Datapost as to how monthly statements of account were printed and packed by
                    the defendant bank and then picked up by Datapost. A copy of the summary report
                    was to be given to Datapost when they picked up/collected the statements and
                    Datapost would produce a reconciliation report reflecting the total number of
                    statements processed by them. Although the evidence of the bank officer in
                    charge of the mailing system of the bank and the operations manager of Datapost
                    was not challenged, the plaintiff nevertheless submitted that the bank had
                    failed to discharge its burden of proof that the disputed statements were
                        <em>in fact</em> posted to the mailing address of the
                    plaintiff. It was in this context that Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was)
                    observed at [34] that the
                    plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[C]ould not be serious in suggesting that there should be someone who
                        could testify that he or she remembered putting the particular statement...
                        into an envelope each month and then delivering it to Singpost, even though
                        there may be hundreds, if not thousands, of such statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Further, the plaintiff had admitted to
                    receiving statements until the beginning of 2000 and did not complain to the
                    defendant bank when she ceased to receive statements even though she admitted
                    that she was very concerned about not receiving her monthly statements. Under
                    these circumstances, the court in <em>Tjoa Elis</em> had no
                    hesitation in finding that the defendant bank had indeed discharged its burden
                    of proof that the disputed statements were sent to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     From <em>Ri Jong Son</em>
                    and <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, it is clear that the court’s
                    focus was rightly on the quality of the bank’s evidence when determining
                    whether the burden of proof as regards posting had been discharged. In <em>Ri Jong Son</em>, the court held that it was imperative for
                    the bank’s witness (Ms Tan) to explain the basis of her belief and
                    knowledge of the bank’s mailing system and more importantly, where the
                    mailing system was capable of corroboration, evidence was to be led from the
                    person with the requisite personal knowledge. Crucially in <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, the evidence of the bank’s officer and Datapost
                    on the mailing system was not challenged by the customer. It is also relevant
                    that in <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, independent evidence of the
                    mailing system through Datapost supported by the summary and reconciliation
                    reports were adduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Turning our attention back to the present
                    case, EFG Bank argued that all the transaction documents were sent to
                    Mdm Jiang at her stated address in the account opening documents, namely,
                    “Room 231, No. 27 Zongzhan Street, Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning, P
                    R China”. Mdm Jiang confirmed in court that this address was the
                    correct one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Mdm Jiang had also acknowledged
                    that she received the 18 documents sent by EFG Bank over a period of five
                    months. Mdm Jiang’s receipt of the 18 documents was presented by EFG
                    Bank as sufficient evidence to support the submission that EFG Bank’s
                    postal mailing system was working properly and that the address to which the
                    transaction documents were sent was the correct one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In its effort to discharge its burden of
                    proof, EFG Bank submitted that Mr Ong as Head of Operations was in charge
                    of and had overall knowledge of, and responsibility for its back room operations
                    which included the system of dispatching the transaction documents to customers
                    including Mdm Jiang. However, Mr Ong was extremely economical in his
                    description of EFG Bank’s mailing system in his AEIC and his evidence,
                    unlike <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, was challenged by
                    Mdm Jiang. The sum total of his evidence on EFG Bank’s mailing system
                    was limited to one brief paragraph in his AEIC:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">27</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Once the transactions have been executed, it is
                            keyed into the Bank’s system and the backroom operations staff
                            sends a transaction confirmation directly to the customer. The
                            Bank’s practice of sending the confirmations directly to the
                            customer (and not via the CRO) is a form of check to ensure that the
                            transactions were correctly executed. The Bank would expect the customer
                            to highlight any error in transactions upon receipt of the
                            confirmations.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mr Ong did not provide any basis for his
                    belief or knowledge of EFG Bank’s mailing system. No corroborative
                    evidence whatsoever was adduced. Under cross-examination, additional details of
                    EFG Bank’s mailing system were revealed. Mr Ong testified
                        that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     He did not have personal knowledge
                        that the transaction documents were in fact mailed to Mdm Jiang’s
                        address.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     Every
                        morning, the transaction confirmations would be automatically downloaded
                        into the system which was located within a controlled environment in EFG
                        Bank’s Operations Room. Only members of the Operations Department
                        (including the CEO of EFG Bank) had access to the system. A designated
                        person from the Operations Department, one Mr Selva, who was in charge
                        of the mail room at all material times, would access the controlled room,
                        print out all the downloaded transaction confirmations, sort them out by way
                        of the different accounts and place them into envelopes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Selva would then bring the
                        mail to the receptionist for franking after which the mail would be returned
                        to Mr Selva, placed in a mail bag and then sent to Singapore
                        Post’s branch at UOB Centre. All this was apparently done on a daily
                        basis by Mr Selva.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Client Relationship Officers (“CROs”)
                        of EFG Bank including Mr Ng did not have access to the controlled room.
                        The transaction documents were sent out on daily basis directly by the
                        Operations Department without any involvement of the
                CROs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In re-examination Mr Ong volunteered
                    additional information. He testified that all transaction confirmations would be
                    downloaded into a spool file on a daily basis. Mr Selva would then check to
                    ensure that the total number of downloaded transaction confirmations tallied
                    with the quantity printed out.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I have noted that none of the above details
                    were stated in Mr Ong’s AEIC. From Mr Ong’s testimony in
                    court, it appeared to me that the integrity of the mailing system was largely if
                    not solely dependant on Mr Selva and yet EFG Bank failed to call
                    Mr Selva (he was still with EFG Bank at the time of the trial) as a
                    witness. Mr Quahe submitted that Mr Selva was the best person to shed
                    light on the mailing system as described by Mr Ong. I agree. Further, the
                    receptionist could also have been called to corroborate Mr Ong’s
                    evidence on the alleged segregation of duties between “the front and back
                    offices”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Mr Quahe also submitted that even taking
                    Mr Ong’s evidence at face value, there must be some record of the
                    daily automatic downloading of the transaction confirmations into the spool file
                    to corroborate his testimony, but none was produced. In addition, EFG Bank also
                    failed to produce any record of the limited access to the controlled environment
                    of its Operations Room alluded to by Mr Ong. EFG Bank could also have
                    called other CRO(s) to confirm Mr Ong’s evidence that CRO(s) were not
                    involved in the mail process at the material time or at all. It was immediately
                    apparent to me that while EFG Bank had ample opportunity to adduce evidence to
                    substantiate or corroborate Mr Ong’s evidence, curiously enough, it
                    failed to do so completely. Finally, cl 4 (excerpted at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>) referred to a “<em>dispatch list</em>”. Again EFG Bank did not disclose any
                    records of the dispatch list. Instead, it elected to rely solely on the evidence
                    of Mr Ong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Quite apart from the fact that Mr Ong did
                    not explain the source of his belief or knowledge of the alleged mailing system
                    of EFG Bank either in his AEIC or his oral testimony, I entertained serious
                    doubts about the reliability of his evidence. When he was questioned about the
                    average number of daily transactions in July 2008, he estimated that it was
                    between 20 to 30 transactions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However,
                    on my direction, after checking EFG Bank’s records, he corrected himself
                    that actually about 200 transactions were carried out per day.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Perhaps it may not be fair to Mr Ong to
                    attribute too much weight to this discrepancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However what was more troubling was his
                    evidence in relation to EFG Bank’s internal protocol relating to the
                    mailing of transaction documents. As explained in (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>–<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) above, EFG
                    Bank had successfully resisted discovery of the internal protocol on the ground
                    that it was not relevant. As observed earlier, when the discovery applications
                    were heard before the ARs, EFG Bank’s case was that all the 160
                    transactions were authorised and cll 3.1, 3.2 and 4 of the General
                    Conditions were not even expressly pleaded. However, when it became clear on the
                    first day of the trial that these clauses were pivotal to the defence, the
                    relevance of EFG Bank’s internal protocol relating to the mailing system
                    was unquestionable. Under these changed circumstances, I directed Mr Ong to
                    produce the internal protocol and he agreed to do so with the concurrence of
                        Mr Omar.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> However, the following day,
                    Mr Omar informed the court that he was instructed that there was no such
                        <em>written</em> protocol.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     This was an entirely unsatisfactory
                    development given that EFG Bank had resisted discovery on the ground of
                    irrelevance on three separate occasions without once stating that there was no
                    such written protocol to begin with. By informing the court that no such written
                    protocol existed despite having earlier informed the court that the protocol
                    would be disclosed, Mr Ong either did not have adequate knowledge of EFG
                    Bank’s mailing system or decided to withhold disclosure because it would
                    be adverse to EFG Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Giving Mr Ong the benefit of doubt, at
                    the very least, his knowledge of EFG Bank’s mailing system was less than
                    satisfactory or plainly unreliable. How could the Head of the Operations
                    Department who purported to testify on EFG Bank’s mailing system not
                    know whether a written protocol for the mailing system existed? Why did EFG Bank
                    fail to inform the court and Mdm Jiang at any stage of the lengthy
                    discovery process that no written protocol existed for the mailing system?
                    Viewed in this context, it was indeed puzzling that EFG Bank elected not to call
                    other available witnesses to substantiate or corroborate Mr Ong’s
                    evidence. Furthermore no reason was offered to explain its decision not to call
                    the other <em>available</em> witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Unlike the production of the checklists in
                        <em>Ri Jong Son</em> (which was held to be
                    unsatisfactory upon the court’s examination) or the summary and
                    reconciliation reports in <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, there was no
                    objective evidence forthcoming from EFG Bank of any system to verify whether all
                    the transaction documents were posted to Mdm Jiang. Again, in light of the
                    shortcomings of Mr Ong’s evidence, while in re-examination he alluded
                    to the fact that Mr Selva would check to ensure that the downloaded
                    documents tallied with the printed quantity, this was not corroborated at all.
                    As the daily quantity of post was about 200 and not 20 to 30 transaction
                    confirmations as was initially but incorrectly estimated, I would have thought
                    that there should have been some kind of checklist or dispatch list as provided
                    for in cl 4 and yet none was provided. At the very least, Mr Selva
                    should have been called as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Omar’s submission was that since
                    Mdm Jiang had admitted to receiving the 18 documents, her admission in and
                    of itself was proof that EFG Bank’s mailing system was working
                    properly and therefore she must have received the rest of the transaction
                    documents. First, under the customer profile information, Mdm Jiang had
                    instructed EFG Bank to send the statement of accounts to her on an annual
                        basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Ong agreed that this meant that the statement of account should have
                    been sent to Mdm Jiang in January of each year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Yet Mdm Jiang gave unchallenged
                    evidence that she was provided with a statement of account dated April 2010 at
                    her specific request because she was not provided with any statement of accounts
                    prior to 1 April 2010. This corroborated her evidence that she did not
                    receive the transaction documents save for the 18 documents. Further, as a
                    matter of simple logic there was no reason for Mdm Jiang to deny receiving
                    the rest of the transaction documents after having admitted to receiving the 18
                    documents since it was not disputed that Mr Ng knew that she did not
                    understand the nature of the transaction documents. In other words, since
                    Mdm Jiang did not understand the nature of the transaction documents, there
                    was no reason for her to have selected the 18 documents which she admittedly
                    received and none was suggested by Mr Omar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mdm Jiang further testified that when she
                    received the first batch of the 18 documents, she contacted Mr Ng to
                    enquire about the status of the documents as she did not understand them.
                    Mdm Jiang stated in her Supplemental AEIC that she asked Mr Ng whether
                    the documents were supposed to be balance sheets of her FIS Account to which
                    Mr Ng answered in the negative.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> This
                    was also not challenged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I have also examined the 18 documents myself
                    and it was not apparent to me on the face of the 18 documents that
                    Mdm Jiang’s FIS Account had incurred any loss from any of the
                    unauthorised transactions. Her evidence that Mr Ng informed her that the
                    documents related to her deposits or to her one-off conversion of the FIS monies
                    to Australian Dollars was not challenged either. In any event, it was not
                    suggested to Mdm Jiang that she knew or ought to have known from the 18
                    documents that Mr Ng had engaged in unauthorised transactions on her
                    behalf. Finally, unlike <em>Tjoa Elis</em> where the
                    plaintiff did not request for her bank statements after she ceased receiving
                    them, Mdm Jiang testified that she had requested, to no end, on several
                    occasions between August 2008 and April 2009, that Mr Ng provide her with
                    her account balance statements and the same were eventually provided <em>only</em> in April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having carefully considered the evidence
                    adduced by EFG Bank through Mr Ong, I find that EFG Bank has failed to
                    discharge its burden of proof that the transaction documents were sent and
                    therefore the presumption of delivery as provided for in cl 4 of the
                    General Conditions did not arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As EFG Bank’s substantive defence,
                    premised on the legal effect of cll 3.1 and 3.2, was entirely dependent on
                    establishing proof of posting under cl 4, my finding that the burden of
                    proof has not been discharged effectively disposes of its defence. On this
                    ground alone, Mdm Jiang’s claim is allowed as it is common ground
                    that the 160 transactions were all unauthorised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For completeness, I shall nonetheless consider
                    the applicability of cll 3.1 and 3.2 to exclude EFG Bank’s liability
                    for the 160 transactions, on the premise that the transaction documents were in
                    fact posted to Mdm Jiang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The conclusive evidence clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     EFG Bank’s defence was ultimately based
                    on cll 3.1 and 3.2 of the General Conditions which provide as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Conclusive evidence clauses, such as
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2, impose two concurrent duties on EFG Bank’s
                    customers. First, it places the onus on the customers to verify their bank
                    statements and second, it requires the customers to notify the bank if there is
                    any discrepancy (See <em>Pertamina</em> at [68]). If the customer fails to do so within
                    the stipulated time, he or she would be precluded from challenging the
                    correctness of the statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It is critical to stress that a defence under
                    conclusive evidence clauses such as cll 3.1 and 3.2 is a contractual
                    defence which is <em>separate</em> and <em>distinct</em> from estoppel. In fact, as illustrated in <em>Pertamina</em> at [72?85], the defence of the bank under the
                    conclusive evidence clause succeeded while the alternative estoppel defence
                    failed on the evidence. In <em>Pertamina</em>, despite the
                    fact that the Court of Appeal found that the appellant was aware of the
                    unauthorised transactions, the estoppel defence nevertheless failed simply
                    because the respondent had failed to plead and prove any detriment arising from
                    the appellant’s silence. It is instructive that the Court of Appeal
                    remarked at [85] that to rely on
                    estoppel, the party must “(a) plead and identify what steps it would have
                    taken and (b) prove that it would have had a real chance of protecting or
                    improving its situation and that it would have taken that chance”. This
                    was not done by EFG Bank and might explain why Mr Omar readily accepted
                    that estoppel was not made out on the evidence before the court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the present case, in spite of the fact that
                    EFG Bank recognised that the transactions were in fact unauthorised, and
                    therefore knowing that its defence was entirely based on cll 3.1 and 3.2,
                    it was unfortunate, to say the least, that these clauses and similarly
                    cl 4, were not specifically pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     EFG Bank was in effect pursuing a defence at
                    the trial which was not specifically pleaded and in fact ran counter to its
                    pleaded case. This objection, though mentioned by Mr Quahe in passing
                    during the oral closing submissions, was not seriously pursued before me. In any
                    event, as the rationale underpinning rules relating to pleadings relates to
                    guarding against prejudice and surprise, and since full submissions were made by
                    both counsel on this issue which is essentially a question of construction and
                    law, I shall consider whether the defence has been made out notwithstanding its
                    lack of specific pleading and EFG Bank’s failure to satisfy the
                    burden of proof of posting ([42]–[58]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     My analysis of the conclusive evidence clause
                    defence entails an examination of the rationale and genesis of such clauses and
                    the appropriate construction of cll 3.1 and 3.2. The question of whether
                    they were worded sufficiently wide to exclude liability for unauthorised
                    transactions carried out by EFG Bank’s own employees is central to this
                    analysis. I will also examine, as a matter of public policy, whether banks
                    should be able to exclude liability for the fraud or unauthorised dealings of
                    its employees even if the clauses were wide enough to encompass such a
                    situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Genesis and rationale of conclusive evidence clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is a feature of any banking relationship
                    that banks would periodically send various types of correspondence including
                    statements of accounts and transaction confirmation slips to their customers.
                    Given the sheer volume of such correspondence, it is perhaps inevitable that
                    mistakes and errors may occur at times, however uncommon they might be. The
                    following passage by Lord Scarman in <em>Tai Hing Cotton
                        Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd and others</em>
                    [1986] AC 80 at 106 (“<em>Tai Hing
                        Cotton</em>”) acknowledged that the risk of a bank paying
                    without legal mandate was a necessary incident of the service inherent in the
                    customer-banker relationship:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One can fully understand ... that the banks must today look for
                        protection. So be it. They can increase the severity of their terms of
                        business, and they can use their influence, as they have it the past, to
                        seek to persuade the legislature that they should be granted by statute
                        further protection. <em>But it does not follow that because
                            they may need protection as their business expands the necessary
                            incidents of their relationship with their customer must also change.
                            The business of banking is the business not of the customer but of the
                            bank</em>. They offer a service ... [i]f they pay out upon cheques
                        which are not his [the customer], they are acting outside of their mandate
                        and cannot plead his [the customer] authority in justification of their
                        debit to his account. <em>This is a risk of the service which
                            it is their business to offer</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As early as 1909 in <em>The
                        Kepitigalla Rubber Estates Limited v The National Bank of India
                        Limited</em> [1909] 2 KB 1010 (“<em>Kepitigalla</em>”), Bray J held that in the absence of any
                    express agreement, a customer does not owe a duty to the bank to check his bank
                    statements. In <em>Tai Hing Cotton</em>, the Privy Council
                    held that in the absence of properly drafted provisions in the banking
                    documentation, the common law would not impose a direct duty on the customers to
                    verify their bank statements for discrepancies as a means to exclude liability
                    of the bank. Following the Privy Council, an identical position was also adopted
                    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Canadian Pacific Hotels
                        Ltd</em> v <em>Bank of Montreal</em> [1988]
                        40 DLR (4<sup>th</sup>) 385. Similarly, the
                    Malaysian Supreme Court in <em>United Asian Bank Bhd</em> v
                        <em>Tai Soon Heng Construction Sdn Bhd</em> [1993]
                    1 MLJ 182 remarked at 189:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]t common law, in the absence of a contract to the contract, [no] duty
                        [is] imposed upon the customer to inspect his periodical bank statements to
                        ensure that his account [is] being properly maintained by the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Banks have traditionally attempted to shift
                    the consequences of such errors onto their customers. However, this desired
                    outcome could only be achieved if there was a duty on the customer to check and
                    verify the statements received from the bank. Persistent attempts by banks to
                    persuade courts to impose this direct duty on customers have met with outright
                    failure all over the Commonwealth. In fact, <em>Tai Hing
                        Cotton</em> has been referred to or followed in principle in a number
                    of Commonwealth jurisdictions wherein absent a contractual provision to the
                    effect, customers are not duty bound to inform the bank of discrepancies or
                    errors in their bank statements: see <em>Fried v National
                        Australia Bank Ltd</em> [2001] 111 FCR 322; <em>National Bank of New Zealand Ltd v Walpole and Patterson
                        Ltd</em> [1975] 2 NZLR 7; <em>Canadian

                    SC 1603; <em>Big Dutchman (South Africa) v Barclays
                        National</em> Bank [1979] (3) SA 267 (WLD.) at 283;
                        <em>Holzman v Standard Bank</em> [1985]
                    (1) SA 360 (WLD) at 363. In fact, in <em>Pertamina</em> at [54], the
                    Court of Appeal observed in <em>obiter</em> that the court
                    should be slow to intervene and imply a term into a contract as a matter of law,
                    that a customer is under a general duty not to facilitate fraud by his
                    negligence and that also, such an implied duty “lacked precise definition
                    as to its scope and content.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The steadfast reluctance of the courts to
                    impose this direct duty on customers has resulted in banks taking it upon
                    themselves to contractually create the customer’s duty to check bank
                    statements; taking the form of terms commonly known as verification or
                    conclusive evidence clauses. Of historical interest is the fact that the
                    introduction of these clauses in Singapore was pioneered by Bank of America,
                    heralding from the United States, where statutory protection under Art 406(c) of
                    the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) expressly legitimises the
                    incorporation of conclusive evidence clauses in banking contracts. However, no
                    equivalent statutory instrument exists in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In contrast, it is worth mentioning that
                    paying heed to strong consumer protection cultures, banks in the United Kingdom
                    and Australia appear to have refrained from incorporating such clauses in their
                    banking documentation. Benjamin Geva in “Allocation of Forged Cheque
                    Losses – Comparative aspects, policies and a model for reform”
                    (1998) Law Quarterly Review 250 at 252 remarked, in general, that banks in the
                    United Kingdom are reluctant to incorporate such clauses in their standard form
                    account agreements. The UK Law Commission on Contributory Negligence as a
                    Defence in Contract (London: Law Com No 219, 1993) at [5.21] also stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]s we pointed out in the consultation paper, it is open to banks to
                        stipulate in their contracts, subject to UCTA, that the customer should take

                        check bank statements. <b>As we have already said, a number
                            of respondents thought that this point was important and suggested that

                    New South Wales Court of Appeal observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has always been open to banks to contract upon the basis of an express

                        bank] would not have been aware of the long line of authority rejecting the
                        wider principle for which it argues and where, in that authority rejecting
                        the wider principle for which it argues and where, in that knowledge, it
                        declines to provide contractually for the duty there appear to me to be no
                        grounds to impose it on the customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Accordingly, cll 3.1 and 3.2 of the
                    General Conditions should be construed within the context of the creation and
                    development of conclusive evidence clauses, with the knowledge that such clauses
                    essentially seek to protect the bank’s inherent instinct to contractually
                    shift the risk and corresponding liability arising from <em>erroneous</em> transactions to the customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mr Omar cited several local decisions in
                    support of the proposition that conclusive evidence clauses similar to
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2 have been construed to exclude banks’ liability for
                    unauthorised transactions such as those bearing forged signatures of the
                    customers. On the strength of his understanding of those authorities,
                    Mr Omar advanced the argument that EFG Bank was not liable for the 160
                    admittedly unauthorised transactions on the mistaken belief that the transaction
                    documents were posted (the contrary was found at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> to <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above).
                    Notwithstanding, I will turn my attention to review the relevant authorities to
                    determine whether, in theory, they support EFG Bank’s

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In carrying out the instructions of a customer, a banker acts under the
                            <em>mandate of the customer</em> (<em>London Joint Stock Bank Ltd v Macmillian &amp;

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]f a bank fails to ensure that the requisite signatures are present on

                        customer to carry out the instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is important to note that a bank in making
                    payment on cheques drawn by its customers acts upon the mandate given by its
                    customer. The mandate comes into operation when the customer issues a cheque or
                    other order or direction. If the customer’s signature is forged or
                    unauthorised, pursuant to s 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act (Cap 23,
                    2004 Rev Ed), the signature is inoperative. Hence in the absence of a
                    common law or contractual duty to inform the bank of errors and discrepancies,
                    the bank has no mandate to pay on the forged cheques and is consequently liable
                    to the customer if it does so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Forged instructions vitiate the
                    customer’s mandate. However, the customer’s express agreement to
                    accept the duty to alert the bank of discrepancies by way of conclusive evidence
                    clauses has acted as a shield to banks’ liability in some instances. The
                    pertinent question is if unauthorised transactions by reason of forgery have
                    been found to be within the reach of conclusive evidence clauses, why should the
                    160 unauthorised transactions in the instant case be treated any differently?
                    For this reason, it was imperative to examine the cases where the relevant
                    clauses have been found to exclude the liability of the defendant banks for
                    paying against cheques bearing forged signatures or otherwise unauthorised
                    transactions.</p>

                    rationale for the distinction was simply the recognition that “<em>forged indorsements would not be apparent to the customer upon
                        their verifying the statement of account and the cheques, as contrasted with
                        forged signatures on the cheques</em>”. Given that this
                    exception was not applicable, he held that the 15 forged cheques fell within the
                    scope of “debits wrongly made” or “incorrect entries in the
                    account”. However, there was no dispute in <em>Consmat</em> that the defendant bank in honouring the forged cheques
                    had acted in good faith unlike the present case when Mr Ng carried out the
                    160 transactions knowingly without any instructions or approval from
                    Mdm Jiang. I will explore the issue of good faith in detail below at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> –<a href="#p1_104">[104]</a> . As such,
                    the reasoning adopted in <em>Consmat</em> to construe
                    forged cheques within the ambit of “debits wrongly made” or
                    “incorrect entries” does not assist EFG Bank in its attempt to
                    exclude liability for the 160 transactions executed in the absence of
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>Tjoa Elis</em>,
                    the plaintiff’s account with the defendant bank had been debited pursuant
                    to fax instructions bearing her signature which was forged by the
                    plaintiff’s sister. The defendant bank paid against the allegedly forged
                    instructions and sought to rely on the following conclusive evidence
                    clause:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Account holder is under a duty to (i) monitor the balance of the
                        Account at all times (ii) examine all entries in the statement of account
                        (iii) within fourteen (14) days of the date of the statement of account
                        notify the bank in writing of any omission from or debits/credits wrongly
                        made or made <em>without authority</em> or inaccurate
                        entries in such Statement of Account; and (iv) sign and return any
                        confirmation slip, including any required for audit purposes (if requested
                        to do so).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the Bank does not receive any written notification pursuant to Clause
                        4(b)(iii) within 21 days from the date of the Statement of Account, then, at
                        the end of the said 21 days, the Account as kept by the Bank shall be
                        conclusive evidence, without any further proof that except as to any alleged
                        errors so notified, the Accounts contains all credits that should be
                        contained therein and no debits that should not be contained therein and all
                        the entries therein are correct and further the Account Holder shall be
                        bound by such entries in the Account and the Bank shall be free from all
                        claims in respect of the Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank
                        reserves the right upon giving notice to the Account Holder to add to and/or
                        alter the entries in the Account in the event of missing and/or incorrect
                        entries or amounts stated therein.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Woo JC did not hesitate to find that the
                    defendant bank had a valid defence since the plaintiff failed to report the
                    error in the bank’s statement of accounts within the specified time. The
                    relevant conclusive evidence clause in <em>Tjoa Elis</em>
                    made specific reference to transactions “<em>without
                        authority</em>”, covering cheques bearing forged
                    signatures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Next, in <em>Pertamina</em>, the appellant deposited US$9 million in a deposit
                    account it had opened with the respondent bank. The appellant company also
                    authorised the bank to take instructions from its vice president of finance and
                    administration. The drawdown documents on the appellant’s credit facility
                    had been forged, permitting a transfer of US$8 million to a third party.
                    Subsequent bank statements were sent to the authorised signatory (the
                    appellant’s fraudulent employee) instead of the customer (appellant),
                    pursuant to a validly executed mail-redirection letter. The Court of Appeal held
                    that the appellant was to bear the legal consequences of its authorised
                    signatory diverting the bank statements to his home address, and that the
                    respondent bank was shielded from liability by reason of the conclusive evidence
                    clause which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) To examine all statements of account, bank statements, printed forms,
                        deposit slips, credit advice notes, transaction advices and other documents
                        (hereinafter in this Clause referred to collectively as
                        “statements”) supplied by the Bank setting out transactions on
                        any of the Accounts and agrees that unless the Customer objects in writing
                        to <em>any</em> of the matters contained in such
                        statement within 14 days of the date of such statement, the Customer shall
                        be deemed conclusively to have accepted <em>all the
                            matters</em> contained in such statement as true and accurate in
                        all respects …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The clause relied upon by the defendant bank
                    in <em>Pertamina</em> was drafted widely, covering
                        “<em>any</em>” and “<em>all</em> the matters contained in such statement”.
                    Given the width of the language used, the Court of Appeal held that it
                    encompassed unauthorised transactions by reason of forgery committed by the
                    customer’s agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Mr Omar also referred me to the decision
                    of the High Court in <em>Stephan Machinery Singapore Pte Ltd v
                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 518
                        (“<em>Stephan Machinery</em>”). In that
                    case, the plaintiff had opened a current account with the defendant bank and for
                    the sake of convenience had authorised the use of a facsimile signature for
                    cheques drawn on the account. One of the plaintiff’s employees had
                    fraudulently misapplied the plaintiff’s authorised facsimile signature on
                    57 of its cheques and subsequently encashed them. The defendant bank denied
                    liability and relied on the following conclusive evidence clause:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A statement of the customer’s account generated by the Bank’s
                        Computer (bank statement) will be sent to the Customer every month unless
                        there is no transaction during that month. The customer shall be under a
                        duty to examine the entries in every bank statement and to report
                        immediately to the bank if there <em>are any errors or
                            discrepancies</em>. If the customer does not within fourteen days
                        after the date of the bank statement object to <em>any of the
                            matters</em> contained in such statements, <em>he
                            shall be deemed conclusively to have accepted all the matters</em>
                        contained in such statement as true and accurate in all respects. Subject to
                        the rights of the Customer to object as aforesaid, the bank statement shall
                        be accepted by the Customer as conclusive evidence of the balance in the
                        account and of the particulars of the account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Lai Kew Chai J held that the plaintiff had
                    agreed to the conclusiveness of the bank statements and that it could not be
                    allowed to breach its agreement by asserting that the 57 debits were errors and
                    discrepancies by operation of the conclusive evidence clause. The court, in
                    endorsing <em>Consmat</em>, took the position that forged
                    cheques fell within the term “wrong debits” or
                    “errors” and held that the conclusive evidence clause was
                    operative to exclude its liability. However, similar to <em>Consmat</em>, the loss in <em>Stephan
                        Machinery</em>, unlike the present case, was not caused by
                    unauthorised trades of the bank’s employee and consequently was of no
                    assistance to EFG Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Accordingly, it is apparent from the
                    examination of the conclusive evidence clauses in <em>Consmat</em>, <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, <em>Pertamina</em> and <em>Stephen
                        Machinery</em> that the defendant banks were able to shield themselves
                    from liability as each of the clauses were drafted sufficiently wide to cover
                    forgery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Omar relied on two further decisions
                    which did not concern forgery. In <em>RBS Coutts Bank Ltd v
                        Shishir Tarachand Kothari</em> [2009] SGHC 273
                        (“<em>RBS Coutts</em>”) the court
                    observed in <em>dicta</em> that the relevant conclusive
                    evidence clause was wide enough to cover unauthorised transactions. In <em>RBS Coutts</em>, the defendant had opened an account with the
                    plaintiff bank for the purposes of, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    engaging in investment and forex trading activities. Towards the end of the
                    six-month trading period, market forces turned against the defendant’s
                    position and the bank informed the defendant to inject more funds or close out
                    some transactions to cut his losses. The defendant did neither and eventually
                    the plaintiff exercised its rights under the account terms and conditions,
                    closed out the defendant’s positions in the various forex transactions and
                    proceeded against the defendant for the sum of US$569,109 owing under the
                    account. The defendant alleged that some of the transactions were unauthorised.
                    In response to this allegation, the plaintiff relied on the following conclusive
                    evidence clause:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">17.1</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">RBS Coutts
                            will, unless it receives written instructions from you to the contrary,
                            send to your address of record a Statement on any Account at periodic
                            intervals.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">You agree that it will be your sole responsibility to ensure that you
                            receive Statements in due time and to make enquiries with and obtain the
                            same from RBS Coutts immediately if not duly received. <em>You undertake to verify the correctness of (a) each
                                Statement; and (b) any accompanying cheques or vouchers received

                                receipt thereof of any discrepancies, omissions or inaccurate or
                                incorrect entries in the account or details so stated in the

                            and the details set out in the Statement shall be conclusive evidence
                            without any further proof that the Statement, the entries and details
                            therein are correct (subject to the right of RBS Coutts, which may be
                            exercised by it at any time, to adjust any entries in the Account or
                            details in the Statement where they have been wrongly or mistakenly made
                            by it)...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     On the face of the above clause, it did not
                    specifically cover unauthorised transactions. However, the court in <em>RBS Coutts</em> held at [18] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The time period provided for dispute was a generous one and gave the
                        Defendant more than adequate time to examine all transactions in detail.
                            <em>The Statements, not having been disputed during the
                            relevant periods, were conclusive evidence that the Forex Transactions
                            were authorised</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Mr Omar submitted that the language of
                    the conclusive evidence clause in <em>RBS Coutts</em> was
                    very similar to cll 3.1 and 3.2 in the present case and that a similar
                    outcome should ensue. It is, however, relevant and critical to note that in
                        <em>RBS Coutts</em>, the court specifically found that
                    the transactions were authorised. Further, while the defendant claimed that some
                    of the transactions were unauthorised, the purported unauthorised transactions
                    were not identified by the defendant. Finally, there was also no dispute in
                        <em>RBS Coutts</em> that the defendant was notified by
                    way of email and/or written confirmation after each of the forex transactions
                    had been carried out and on no occasion did the defendant object to any of the
                    particulars stated therein. In the circumstances, in <em>RBS
                        Coutts</em>, the court was not concerned with a situation like the
                    present case, where EFG Bank had admitted to unauthorised trading by its
                    employee, Mr Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     As noted above at <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>, the court upon being satisfied that the defendant did
                    receive the transaction confirmation slips, remarked that failure to dispute the
                    statements was “<em>conclusive evidence that the Forex
                        Transactions were authorised</em>.” Given the court’s
                    finding that the transactions were authorised, there was understandably no
                    detailed analysis in <em>RBS Coutts</em> as to how and why
                    the relevant wording of the particular conclusive evidence clause was capable of
                    applying to transactions executed in the absence of a valid
                mandate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     One must keep in mind that the operation of a
                    conclusive evidence clause is not a substitute to the customer’s mandate
                    or simply put, does not create authorisation where there was none. In fact as
                    examined below (<a href="#p1_101">[101]</a>–<a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>) cl 3.3 of the General Conditions in
                    this case clearly limits the effect of receipt of transaction confirmations for
                    “record purposes only”. In my view, conclusive evidence clauses
                    merely impose a duty on the customer to verify his or her bank statements and to
                    inform the bank of discrepancies failing which the customer is precluded from
                    disputing the <em>correctness</em> of the transaction.
                    Accordingly, as stated in the operative clause in <em>RBS
                        Coutts</em>, the confirmation slip sent by the bank was conclusive
                    evidence of the <em>correctness</em>, rather than capable
                    of operating as retrospective “<em>authorisation</em>” of the transaction though the outcome
                    would be no different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     While EFG Bank also relied on <em>Banque National de Paris v Tan Nancy &amp; Anor</em>
                    [2001] SGCA 76 (“<em>Tan
                    Nancy</em>”) in support of its contention, this decision provided
                    no assistance to its defence. The employee of the claimant bank in <em>Tan Nancy</em> effected share and foreign exchange
                    transactions using the accounts of the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. The defendants were found to be
                    liable for the trades done by the employee. Significantly, various telephone
                    logs showed that the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants (ex-wife and former
                    brother-in-law of the bank’s employee respectively) had discussed and
                    agreed to a number of the transactions with the employee. Furthermore, on no
                    less than five occasions, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    instructed the bank employee to transfer profits from the disputed transactions
                    to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Court of Appeal was persuaded by the
                    cogent evidence presented that the defendants were <em>fully
                        cognisant</em> of the trades executed by the employee on their
                    accounts and <em>acquiesced to and condoned</em> his
                    actions. The crucial finding underpinning this decision was the court’s
                    satisfaction that the employee had actual or apparent authority to perform the
                    trades in the defendants’ accounts. Therefore, <em>Tan
                        Nancy</em>, like <em>RBS Coutts</em>, concerned
                    transactions that were found to have been authorised by the
                customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">True construction of clauses 3.1 and 3.2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the final analysis, whether a particular
                    risk of loss due to error, discrepancy, forgery or just plain unauthorised
                    transaction is shifted onto the customer is a question of construction of the
                    relevant clause. It is worth noting that the approach taken by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Pertamina</em> at [61], in upholding the conclusive evidence
                    clause against a commercial entity, limited its reasoning to the same. As such,
                    the preferred approach to the construction of such clauses in the context of a
                    private individual or a non-commercial entity was intentionally left unanswered.
                    The Privy Council decision of <em>Tai Hing Cotton</em>
                    held, on a question of construction, that each of the three clauses did not
                    constitute a valid “conclusive evidence clause”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If banks wished to impose upon their customers an express obligation to
                        examine their monthly statements and to make those statements in the absence
                        of query, unchallengeable by the customer after expiry of a time limit,
                            <em>the burden of the objection and of the sanction
                            imposed must be brought home to the customer</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The test is rigorous because the bankers would have their terms of
                        business so construed as to exclude the rights which the customer would
                        enjoy if they were not excluded by express agreement. <em>Clear and unambiguous provision is needed if the banks are to introduce
                            into the contract a binding obligation upon the customer who does not
                            query his bank statement to accept the statement as accurately setting
                            out the debit items in the accounts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The guiding principle articulated in <em>Tai Hing Cotton</em> was simply that if a bank seeks to
                    contractually allocate the burden and responsibility of the duty to inform of
                    any forgery or unauthorised drawing or instruction on the customer, no less than
                        <em>clear and unambiguous</em> reference will suffice.
                    Sufficiently wide language ascertainable by a reasonable person to include the
                    specific liability borne by the customer would also, in theory,
                suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Thus, in order for EFG Bank to successfully
                    rely on cll 3.1 and 3.2, it would have to overcome the following
                    hurdles:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     Discharge its burden of proof that
                        the transaction documents were sent by ordinary mail to give rise to the
                        presumption of delivery under cl 4. As I have found at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> to <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above, EFG Bank has failed to cross this first
                        hurdle.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     Assuming the burden was successfully discharged, whether cll 3.1 and
                        3.2 are sufficiently wide or expressly cover unauthorised transactions
                        executed in the absence of instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if the language is sufficiently wide or
                        expressly covers unauthorised transactions, whether cll 3.1 and 3.2 are
                        applicable to unauthorised transactions carried out fraudulently by EFG
                        Bank’s employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally, if the clauses expressly or impliedly apply to
                        unauthorised transactions carried out by EFG Bank’s employee, whether
                        such clauses should be upheld as a matter of public policy and/or under
                        UCTA.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The first noteworthy point is that cl 3.1
                    was subject to cl 3.2. As such, the limitations applicable to cl 3.2
                    were equally applicable to cl 3.1. Secondly, while cl 3.1 generally
                    related to “<em>confirmations</em>, advice and
                    statement of account”, further inspection revealed that the <em>confirmations</em> in cl 3.1 related to <em>periodic</em> confirmations. The use of the term
                        “<em>periodic</em>” indicated a lower
                    level of frequency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     On the other hand cl 3.2 specifically
                    related to “<em>transaction
                    confirmations</em>” and all confirmations were required to be sent
                    to the customer “no later than the end of the next Business Day after the
                    date upon which the relevant transaction is entered into”. Clause 3.2
                    clearly catered to specialised transaction confirmations for trading activity
                    which by its very nature (such as forex trading) is frequent and regular,
                    ensuring that the customer is promptly informed upon the execution of each
                    transaction. The 160 unauthorised transactions forming the subject matter of
                    this dispute fell squarely within the targeted <em>type</em> of transaction and <em>trading
                        pattern</em> envisioned under cl 3.2 while the statements of
                    periodic nature such as statements of account would more likely be governed by
                    cl 3.1. During closing oral submissions, Mr Omar agreed that
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2 should indeed be construed as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     However, the principal argument advanced by
                    Mr Quahe on the construction of cll 3.1 and 3.2 was more fundamental.
                    He submitted that both clauses contemplated EFG Bank acting on <em>instructions</em> from the customer and as such had no
                    bearing on transactions carried out in the absence of instructions. First,
                    cl 3.2 expressly limited the client’s duty of notification to
                        “<em>any claimed discrepancy between the Instructions
                        and the Transaction Confirmation</em>”. From the plain wording
                    of the clause, the mischief EFG Bank sought to shield itself from were errors
                    which could have taken place between the specific order/instruction given by the
                    customer and the execution thereof. This would presuppose the giving of
                    instructions by the customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Under cl 3.1, the customer was required
                    to inform EFG Bank of “any discrepancies, omissions, incorrect or
                    inaccurate entries in the Account of the contents of any confirmation, advice or
                    statement of account or the <em>execution or non-execution of any
                        order”</em>. In addition, cl 3.1 covered “periodic
                    confirmations or advices of all Transactions <em>carried out by
                        the Client and/or Authorised Representative</em>”. Thus, the
                    language of cl 3.1 also contemplated transactions executed on instructions
                    by the customer or his or her authorised representative. Furthermore, both
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2 should be construed as consistent with each other
                    especially since cl 3.1 is to be read subject to cl 3.2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    There was no reference in cll 3.1 or
                    3.2 to the exclusion of liability for transactions carried out in the <em>absence of instructions</em>. In fact, the contrary was
                    apparent. Curiously, Mr Omar during closing oral submissions claimed that
                        “<em>Instructions</em>” under
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2 were wide enough to include “<em>no
                        instructions</em>”. This submission was plainly misconceived.
                    To begin with, “<em>Instructions</em>” was
                    specifically defined under the General Conditions as “Instructions given
                    by the Client or an Authorised Representative in accordance with the Account
                    &amp; Trading Mandate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Furthermore, the tenor of the language used
                    in cl 3.3 was instructive as, similar to cl 3.2, it specifically
                    related to “Transaction Confirmation[s]” and in effect, reiterated
                    the central importance of the customer’s instructions for the
                    transactions. Clause 3.3 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Any Transaction Confirmation is provided for record
                            purposes only</em>, and any Instructions given or authorised, if
                        accepted, are accepted at the time of the same being given or authorised and
                        not at the time of the Transaction Confirmation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Clause 3.3 provides that the transaction
                    confirmations were <em>only</em> for <em>record purposes</em>. Therefore, delivery or receipt of the
                    transaction confirmations alone was not treated as instruction having been given
                    for the transaction in question. Clause 3.3 guarded against the conflation of
                    the customer’s mandate or authorisation solicited <em>prior
                        to</em> the execution of transactions, with the transaction
                    confirmations sent <em>subsequent to</em> the execution of
                    the transactions. By express reference to “<em>instructions</em>”, specific to cll 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, it
                    was clear that the Agreement did not intend for unauthorised transactions
                    executed in the absence of any instructions from the customer to be included
                    within the ambit of the clauses. Instead, in my view, cll 3.1 and 3.2 would
                    only protect EFG Bank from liability against “discrepancies”
                    and/or “omissions” in the execution of the customer’s
                    instructions. As such, I agree with Mr Quahe’s submission that the
                    clear and unambiguous wording of cll 3.1 and 3.2 exclude from the scope of
                    its protection transactions carried out <em>without</em>
                    any instructions from the customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Unauthorised transactions performed by bank’s
                employee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Both Mr Omar and Mr Quahe
                    confirmed that, to their knowledge derived from their research, there is no
                    authority where a conclusive evidence clause has been invoked by a bank, let
                    alone upheld by any court, to exclude liability for unauthorised transactions
                    carried out fraudulently by its employee in the absence of instructions. In
                        <em>Consmat</em>, <em>Tjoa
                        Elis</em>, <em>Pertamina</em>, <em>RBS Coutts</em>, <em>Nancy Tan</em> and
                        <em>Stephen Machinery</em>, the courts in each of the
                    cases were concerned with situations where at the time when the transactions
                    were executed, the banks believed in good faith that they were acting in
                    accordance with the customers’ mandate or instructions. The mandate was
                    subsequently found in some of the cases to have been vitiated by reason of
                    forgery which the banks were not aware of at the time when the transactions were
                    executed. In the result, the transactions were not authorised since the mandate
                    had been vitiated. None of the cases concerned the fraud or forgery of the
                    bank’s employee or the bank acting in the <em>absence of
                        instructions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In the present case, the situation is
                    materially different. EFG Bank managed Mdm Jiang’s FIS Account
                    through Mr Ng. At the time when the 160 transactions were executed,
                    EFG Bank knew through Mr Ng that it had no mandate/instruction to do so.
                    There was therefore no question of EFG Bank acting on
                    “instructions” in good faith when the transactions were executed.
                    Given that the 160 transactions were executed <em>knowingly</em> by Mr Ng on Mdm Jiang’s
                    non-discretionary FIS Account, without any instruction from Mdm Jiang, it
                    must follow on the facts of the present case that such transactions were in
                    effect carried out fraudulently by EFG Bank’s employee, Mr Ng. It was
                    not suggested by Mr Omar that the 160 transactions were carried out by
                    Mr Ng either negligently or inadvertently.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    No sensible bank, to my knowledge, has
                    sought to incorporate a conclusive evidence clause in its banking documentation
                    to exclude liability for unauthorised transactions fraudulently carried out by
                    its own employees. There is probably a logical reason why this is so. If such a
                    risk is provided for in the relevant clause, the law would require the bank to
                    bring it to the specific attention of the customer. It would be difficult to
                    imagine that any reasonable customer would agree to assume such an outrageous
                    risk given the wide range of choices offered by alternative banks. There is
                        <em>dicta</em> in at least two local decisions where
                    the courts have cautioned that such clauses would not be enforceable. In
                        <em>Tjoa Elis</em>, Woo JC expressed the view at
                        [96], that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, this is not to say that if UOB had inadvertently and unilaterally
                        make a wrong debit <em>without any instructions
                            whatsoever</em>, it would still be entitled to rely on cl 13
                        [the conclusive evidence clause]. In such a situation, it <em>may be</em> against public policy or <em>may
                            be</em> unreasonable to allow UOB to rely on cl 13.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In fact, Woo JC’s observation was made in relation to debits
                        <em>inadvertently</em> made without instructions. Here,
                    the court is concerned with a higher degree of fault wherein transactions were
                        <em>fraudulently</em> carried out in the absence of
                    instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In <em>Pertamina</em>
                    at [63], the Court of Appeal made a more
                    direct observation which specifically related to transactions carried out by the
                    fraud of the bank’s employee:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For example, if a bank attempted to exclude liability for the fraud of its
                        own employees, we would have <em>no hesitation</em> in
                        declaring such a clause unreasonable and invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    From the concluding words of cll 3.1
                    and 3.2, <em>ie</em> “even if the Bank had not
                    exercised the usual diligence in relation thereto”, it is clear that EFG
                    Bank, at best, sought to exclude liability for errors caused by its lack of due
                    diligence. It is also clear from other provisions of the General Conditions that
                    EFG Bank did not intend for cll 3.1 and 3.2 to exclude liability caused by
                    the fraud or wilful misconduct of its employees. In this connection,
                    Mr Quahe drew my attention to cl 7.1 of the General Conditions which
                    provided, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Neither the Bank nor any of the Bank’s Affiliates shall be liable
                        for any Claims, or for any diminution of value of or loss or damage to any
                        property or security under the Account, or in respect of the Services, or
                        for any lost opportunity whereby the value of such property or security
                        could have been increased, or for any other reason, or for the acts of any
                        Agent, broker, custodian, nominee or correspondent appointed by the Bank in
                        good faith, <em>save where the same arises directly from
                            their respective gross negligence, wilful misconduct or
                        fraud</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The risk of fraud by the bank’s
                    employee is a unique risk that typically resides with the bank. If EFG Bank had
                    intended to shift such risk to its customers including Mdm Jiang, in my
                    view, nothing short of express reference in the relevant clause to such a risk
                    would have sufficed. Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 clearly did not expressly or impliedly
                    cover unauthorised transactions carried out fraudulently by its employee in the
                    absence of instructions. In any event, as explained below, conclusive evidence
                    clauses which purport to exclude liability for the fraud of banks’
                    employees would, in my judgment, stand contrary to public policy considerations
                    and would run foul of the reasonableness test under UCTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Void under UCTA and/or contrary to public policy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    First and foremost, one must bear in mind
                    that on my construction of cll 3.1 and 3.2, their validity for what they
                    stand for is without question. I was, however, dismayed that EFG Bank sought to
                    exclude its liability for transactions executed in bad faith without any
                    instructions from Mdm Jiang, particularly in the absence of express wording
                    to that effect under any clause in the Agreement (<em>especially</em> in light of the plain wording of the clauses
                    supporting the contrary proposition). However, EFG Bank’s underlying
                    contention that in theory, a conclusive evidence clause could exclude liability
                    of the bank for unauthorised transactions executed by a fraudulent bank employee
                    merited closer analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I think it is fair to start from the
                    presumption that when parties enter into contracts they contemplate honesty and
                    good faith in the performance of their obligations. In the House of Lord’s
                    decision of <em>HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd v Chase
                        Manhattan Bank</em> [2003] 1 All ER (Comm) 349 (“<em>HIH Casualty</em>”) at [68] Lord Hoffman remarked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I think that in the absence of words which expressly
                            refer to dishonesty, it goes without saying that underlying the
                            contractual arrangements of the parties there will be a common
                            assumption that the persons involved will behave
                        honestly</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    However, if a clause expressly contemplated
                    the exclusion of liability for fraud or wilful misconduct by the bank through
                    its agents, it would be confronted with the reasonableness test under s 11
                    of the UCTA regime. In <em>Consmat</em> at [23], the court took the position that there
                    was no reason to “import” the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 of
                    the United Kingdom under s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
                    1988 Rev Ed) to interpret conclusive evidence clauses as their validity
                    could be determined by reference to s 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act. In
                    1994, Parliament enacted UCTA in Singapore, materially altering the statutory
                    landscape which formed the basis of the decision in <em>Consmat</em> in determining the non-applicability of UCTA. Any
                    residual doubt as to the applicability of UCTA to conclusive evidence clauses,
                    was clarified by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pertamina</em>
                    as V K Rajah JA remarked at [59]–[63]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The freedom of the parties to contract is however circumscribed by
                        legislation (such as the UCTA) and public policy considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 3(1) of the UCTA mandates that terms seeking to exclude liability
                        in respect of the breach of one’s own contractual obligations
                            (<em>which effectively is what conclusive evidence
                            clauses do) must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness</em>.
                        The Second Schedule to the UCTA lays down a few guidelines in assisting the
                        court’s determination of whether such terms are reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Pursuant to s 3 of UCTA, exclusion of
                    contractual liability falls within the reasonableness test:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. —(1) This section applies as between contracting parties where
                        one of them deals as <em>consumer</em> or on the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">except in so far as (in any of the cases mentioned in this subsection)
                            <em>the contract term satisfies the requirement of
                            reasonableness</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In respect of contracts in which one of the
                    parties is a consumer, by operation of s 3 of UCTA, a conclusive evidence
                    clause excluding liability for the fraud or wilful misconduct of an agent would
                    be subject to the reasonableness test set out under s 11:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.(1) In relation to a contract term, the requirement of reasonableness
                        ... is that the term shall have been <em>a fair and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.(5) It is for those claiming that a contract term or notice satisfies

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As provided for under s 11(5), the
                    burden of satisfying the reasonableness requirement clearly falls on the party
                    seeking to exclude its own liability (<em>ie</em>
                    EFG Bank in this case). In applying the reasonableness test, the court may
                    have regard to the matters specified in Schedule 2 of UCTA though it does not
                    preclude it from taking into account other principles of law in determining the
                    enforceability of exclusion clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Unequal bargaining power is a relevant
                    consideration under Schedule 2 in determining the validity of any conclusive
                    evidence clause. Articulating a preference to the non-interventionist approach
                    to the reasonableness test in the context of commercial contracts, in <em>Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd</em>
                    [1980] AC 827 Lord Wilberforce said (at 843):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n commercial matters generally, when the parties are not of unequal
                        bargaining power, and when risks are normally borne by insurance, not only
                        is the case for judicial intervention undemonstrated, but there is
                        everything to be said for leaving the parties free to apportion the risks as
                        they think fit for respecting their decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In similar vein, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Pertamina</em> upheld the widely drafted conclusive
                    evidence clause in that case, at [61]
                    but expressly limited its analysis to commercial entities, cautioning that the
                    reasonableness of such clauses in a non-commercial context was decidedly
                    open:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It bears emphasis that in holding that conclusive evidence clauses if and
                        when properly and reasonably defined are enforceable, <em>we
                            restrict such a conclusion to cases where the customers are commercial
                            entities</em>. ...<em>However, we are not required
                            to express a general opinion as to the reasonableness of conclusive
                            evidence clauses as and when applied to individuals and non-corporate
                            customers since the issue does not arise in the present
                            context</em>. Each case will entail a careful examination of its
                        own peculiar factual matrix starting with a careful scrutiny of the
                        conclusive evidence clause that is being questioned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    However, the dispute before me concerned a
                    private individual. As I have found that cll 3.1 and 3.2 were not
                    applicable to the unauthorised transactions carried out by EFG Bank’s
                    employee in the absence of instructions, there was strictly no necessity for me
                    to examine the issue of whether the clauses should be upheld in the case of an
                    individual. I shall therefore refrain from expressing a view on the matter
                    particularly since neither counsel made significant submissions on this point.
                    No doubt this point will be revisited when the appropriate occasion
                    arises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Notwithstanding that on my construction of
                    cll 3.1 and 3.2, the situation in question does not arise, it appears to me
                    that it is plainly unreasonable that a bank should be able to shift the risk of
                    unauthorised transactions by a fraudulent employee (within its own sphere of
                    control) to an innocent customer by way of a conclusive evidence clause. The
                    purpose or introduction of conclusive evidence clauses was to enable banks to
                    contractually allocate risks which were better managed by customers, brought
                    about by tainted transactions outside the purview of the bank. In recognition of
                    this rationale, conclusive evidence clauses have been upheld due to the relative
                    ease of detection of forgeries by the customer as opposed to the bank. In
                        <em>Pertamina</em> at [61] the Court of Appeal recognised this underlying principle as
                    support for the validity and reasonableness of conclusive evidence clauses,
                        <em>albeit</em> in a commercial context:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the context of banks on the one hand (which would otherwise bear the
                        onerous, if not near impossible task of detecting forgeries given the advent
                        of modern technology) and commercial entities on the other (which only have
                        to check their own records), we do not find it onerous or unreasonable to
                        place the risk of loss on the latter if this has already been agreed
                        upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    However, the converse must be true as
                    regards transactions executed fraudulently by banks’ employees. Allocation
                    of the risk of fraud or wilful misconduct of banks’ employees to the
                    customers by way of conclusive evidence clauses is contrary to the somewhat
                    compelling rationale underpinning the genesis of such clauses in that banks
                    rather than the customers would be in a better position to effectively detect
                    the fraud of its own employees. This allocation of risk was implicitly
                    recognised in <em>Pertamina</em> at [60]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[In] principle conclusive evidence clauses employed in a banker and
                        corporate customer relationship afford <em>a practical and
                            reasonable device for pragmatic management of risk
                        allocation</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    One must not lose sight of the foundational
                    legal rule that fraud unravels all: <em>fraus omnia
                        corrumpit</em>. As Lord Denning correctly observed in <em>Lazarus Estates Ltd v Beasley</em> [1956]
                    1 QB 702 at 712, once fraud is proved, “it vitiates
                    judgments, contracts and all transactions”. I am, however, dealing with
                    the nuanced question of whether liability for the fraud of agents or
                    specifically, employees of banks should be capable of contractual exemption. For
                    example, in the UCC which gives legislative force to conclusive evidence clauses
                    in the United States, Art 4-406(d)–(e) makes it clear beyond doubt that
                    banks are not at liberty to exclude liability or shift losses attributable from
                    transactions executed through its employees in bad faith. Using conclusive
                    evidence clauses to allocate the risk of fraud of an employee of the bank to the
                    customer is not only devoid of pragmatism, but also appears to be entirely
                    inconsistent with the core rationale underpinning the court’s willingness
                    to uphold these clauses in the first place, as the allocation of the risk of
                    fraud of the bank’s employees, by reason of the relative ease of detection
                    and control, should rightfully and reasonably be borne by the
                bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    While it is extraordinarily unlikely that a
                    customer seeking to open a bank account would knowingly agree to a term which
                    expressly excludes liability for fraud of the employees of a bank, the question
                    of whether such a clause is unreasonable by reason of UCTA turns on the relevant
                    factors identified (<em>ie</em> unfair bargaining power
                    (commercial, individual, non-corporate customer), inducement and knowledge of
                    the clause in question) as well as public policy considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Individuals and corporations entrust banks
                    and employees of banks with their savings and investments. Public confidence in
                    the banking system is therefore fundamental to the integrity of the system and
                    is no doubt founded upon mutual trust and a reasonable expectation of honest
                    dealings by employees of banks. Shifting the attendant risk and liability for
                    the fraud or wilful misconduct of employees of banks by way of conclusive
                    evidence clauses, strikes at the very heart of the presumed integrity of the
                    system. The negative impact on public confidence and trust in the modern banking
                    system would, in my view, render such clauses to be unreasonable under UCTA as
                    well as void as a matter of public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b>Unconscionable conduct of EFG Bank</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    This was Mdm Jiang’s alternative
                    submission in the event EFG Bank succeeded in its defence under cll 3.1 and
                    3.2 and on the premise that the clauses were not unenforceable under UCTA.
                    Mr Quahe expressly stated that he was not seeking to rely on his
                    alternative submission to vitiate the Agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> In support of his alternative
                    submission, Mr Quahe relied principally on Mdm Jiang’s lack of
                    proficiency in the English language as well as the exorbitant fees earned by EFG
                    Bank totalling approximately US$1 million (comprising of US$456,000 in
                    commissions and over US$500,000 in net option fees) from the 160 unauthorised
                    transactions. In light of my findings that EFG Bank has failed to discharge its
                    burden of proof of posting as well as my construction of cll 3.1 and 3.2,
                    this issue did not arise for consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    By reason of my findings, I make the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_a"></a>(a)     Judgment in the sum of
                        US$2,338,278.68 to be paid by EFG Bank to Mdm Jiang;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_b"></a>(b)     Interest at the rate of 5.33 per cent
                        on the judgment sum of US$2,338,278.68 from 15 December 2009 till the date
                        of judgment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_c"></a>(c)     Costs on a standard basis to be paid by EFG Bank to Mdm Jiang to
                        be taxed if not agreed and such costs shall include the cost of the expert
                        witness.</p>
