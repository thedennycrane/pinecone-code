The plaintiff alleges that the defendant infringed its copyright by, amongst other things, copying and referencing the listings and classifications in its directories. The central issue in this suit is whether plaintiff’s directories are protected by copyright, and if so, what the scope of that protection is.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This engages a question on which the foundations of copyright law rest: what does originality within s 27 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Copyright Act”) entail? Originality is the defining characteristic of works entitled to copyright protection under the Copyright Act. Other key concepts in copyright law, such as authorship, copying and substantiality, orbit around and take shape from the assessed originality of the work in question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Telephone directories, in particular, occupy a special place in this debate. They cast in sharp relief the dichotomy between facts and expression, a dichotomy which is said to lie at the heart of the requirement of originality. Similar cases have been encountered by courts all over the world and each jurisdiction has formulated varying responses to what is in essence the same problem: what subject matter does the law of copyright protect? Copyright is a property right conferring rights <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>. The term of protection is very long and liability for infringement is generally strict. Furthermore, certain types of infringement attract criminal liability. The question of what is the subject matter protected by copyright is important not just to the copyright owner; it is of fundamental importance to the public at large whose duty it is to avoid infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Whilst the plaintiff submits that the factual matrix of the suit is not complicated,

</div> the evidence was heard over 23 days; it was originally set down to be heard over 24. The statement of claim was amended six times. Numerous interlocutory proceedings took place. Indeed, the plaintiff initially intended to call one expert witness and 17 factual witnesses, three of which were subpoenaed. In the eventuality, only 15 witnesses testified orally for the plaintiff after the defendant agreed to forgo cross-examination of the remaining two. The defendant, on the other hand, called two witnesses. The plaintiff’s position was that the legal issues required a thorough examination of the efforts devoted to the creation of the works in suit.

The Yellow Pages Business and Yellow Pages Consumer, which are targeted at businesses and consumers respectively, are classified directories that contain listings arranged within various classifications. The three printed directories were each previously known by different names (the White Pages, the Yellow Pages Commercial &amp; Industrial Guide and the Yellow Pages Buying Guide respectively), but that is immaterial and I shall refer to them by their names at the time this suit was commenced.

The plaintiff receives approximately 4,200 discrete parcels of subscriber information monthly.

It suffices to say it is clear the amount would have been substantial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 It appears that the telephone service providers do not give the plaintiff information of all their landline subscribers indiscriminately. Rather, the plaintiff is only sent information that falls within certain prescribed guidelines set out in the plaintiff’s agreements with the telephone service providers.

Controlled classifications were not referred to DP Info for matching. These were classifications in which subscribers had to meet certain requirements before the plaintiff would consent to publishing their listings in those classifications. The requirements could either be internal to the plaintiff or regulatory requirements that the plaintiff had to comply with. For example, “Caterers” was a controlled classification, and subscribers had to have a valid catering license before they were permitted to be placed within that classification.

</div> This was done in a manner similar to the pre-2006 manual assignment of main classification headings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I digress for a moment to mention “classifications”, which are related to, but not the same as, main classification headings. Classifications are the visible categories or headings that appear in the Yellow Pages directories or the online directory and under which the individual listings within the directories are arranged. Main classification headings, on the other hand, are part of a back-end process for tagging and categorising subscribers (and their information) in the plaintiff’s master database. Thus whilst the entire schema of assigning main classification headings to subscribers is invisible to the eye of an end-user of the plaintiff’s directories, that assignment will determine the classification that each listing ultimately appears in. I will elaborate more on classifications below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Advertising</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further enhancements to the subscriber information also come in the form of subscriber’s advertisements in the plaintiff’s directories. Each subscriber is ordinarily given only one free listing in the Business Listings and one free listing within one classification in either the Yellow Pages Business or the Yellow Pages Consumer. This is known as the plaintiff’s “free listing policy”. The free listing policy is not set in stone. It is periodically adjusted by the plaintiff’s Marketing Department. For example, certain classifications were listed in both the 2009 editions of the Yellow Pages Business and Yellow Pages Consumer, effectively giving the subscribers listed in those classifications free listings in two classified directories.

In respect of the former, the formatting rules affect the number of lines of information and the fields of information that would appear for each individual listing (this is connected to the prevailing free listing policy for that year). For example, in the 2008 edition of Yellow Pages Consumer and Yellow Pages Business, the formatting rules were adjusted so that listings for non-paying subscribers displayed only one address and telephone number, where, in the past, there was no such limitation.

The entire set of categories in the online directory is a superset of all the classifications in the Yellow Pages Business and the Yellow Pages Consumer. Changes made to the classifications in the Yellow Pages Business and Yellow Pages Consumer are usually mirrored in the categories for the online directory, but the converse is not true. The online directory contains unique categories that are not published in any of the Yellow Pages directories.

</div> The online directory also contains various “keywords” and “filters” to improve the user interface, which are also not present in the Yellow Pages directories. Therefore, whilst the online directory contains some material distinctions with the printed directories, all of the plaintiff’s directories trace their source, through different paths, back to the plaintiff’s master database.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This concludes my overview of the plaintiff’s directory-production process. I now turn to the law on the subsistence of copyright, and the extent to which copyright subsists in the plaintiff’s directories.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether and if so to what extent copyright subsists in the plaintiff’s directories</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The central legal issue in these proceedings, the subsistence of copyright, brings us back to the meaning of originality and the dichotomy between expression on one hand, and facts and ideas on the other. It is uncontroversial that copyright protects expression and not facts or ideas. But that sharp dichotomy is eroded in the context of a compilation of facts or information (factual compilation). For where a factual compilation is concerned, the facts are necessarily bound up with and implicated in the form of expression. It becomes less clear where the expression stops and the facts begin. This murkiness is however “illuminating” because it draws into sharp focus contrasting conceptions of the ideals that the law of copyright serves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 There are of course many different types of factual compilations. They include a compilation of poems or quotations; a law report such as any volume of the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Law Reports</span>; a weekly television broadcast schedule or guide; a guide to the best restaurants in Singapore; annual weather statistics; a compilation of all the genes and gene sequences of a human being and, of course, telephone directories. In some cases, the compilation comprises existing works (which may enjoy their own copyright) such as a compilation of poems. Whilst each poem is a work of fiction, the fact that the poem exists is still a fact and information. In other cases, the compilation may be of facts which may have no human author (properly so-called) such as in the case of a yearly compilation of daily weather temperature in Singapore. The weather scientist must of course spend time and effort in finding and recording the temperature. He is not the author of the temperature. He is the discoverer of a fact of nature. Then again, whilst many compilations relate to pre-existing facts (which have to be discovered and collected), there are other compilations which require the creation of facts before the facts can be collected. One example is a broadcast schedule of television programmes. It is only when the broadcaster has made the decision to broadcast a programme on a given day, time and channel that the information can be collected and compiled. Facts and information are continuously created in this manner. An individual who moves into a new home creates a fact. He is who he is and lives where he now lives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The broad point I make is that for many compilations, the lion’s share of the work, effort and expense will be connected with the discovery of facts or the creation of facts which are then selected and arranged. The degree of effort required in selecting and arranging the facts can also vary considerably. In some cases there will be almost no effort of selection over and above the initial decision to produce a type of compilation (for example, a directory of all schools in Jurong, as opposed to a directory of all schools in Clementi, or indeed, Singapore). Once the “macro” decision is made, the comprehensiveness of the collection is often (but not always) the aim; not selection. The same is also true of arrangement and presentation. In the analogue world, the bigger the data set, the more important it will be to ensure that the individual pieces of information are presented in a user friendly and accessible manner. Whilst there may be creative ways of arranging facts to achieve that goal, often times, the facts will be arranged and presented in an obvious manner or by means of use of well-known methods or standards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In the world of digital databases, the digital interface with the end user is also important. The database must be able to interface efficiently with the search engine employed by or made available to the user. The search engine may enjoy its own copyright as a computer program separate from the copyright (if any) in the database. Indeed, the ability of the end user to efficiently search a digital database will depend as much on the search engine and its interface with the database as the database itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 It is in this context and, at the risk of over-simplification, that I note there are two prevailing schools of thought on originality and copyright. The first is the “creativity” school and the second, the “sweat of the brow” or “industrious collection” school. These contrasting schools of thought differ primarily on two connected aspects of the same point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The first aspect concerns the <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of the effort that is required before a work can be considered original. The creativity school emphasises the need for intellectual effort or creativity in the production of the work. The sweat of the brow school, on the other hand, acknowledges the industriousness or labour of the author as being relevant to its originality. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The second aspect concerns what the author’s effort must be <span class="font-italic">directed at</span><span class="font-italic"> or towards</span>. The creativity school focuses on the narrower window of the reduction of the work to its final form of expression. The sweat of the brow school, on the other hand, admits effort taken in the preparatory steps leading up to the reduction of the work to its final or particular form. These preparatory efforts include the labour involved in fact finding, fact creation and fact collection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Both schools are replete with pithy maxims said to capture the policy spirit that supports the case being advanced. The sweat of the brow school pleads the case that “if it is worth copying it is worth protecting” and that the law should be concerned with “preventing another person from reaping that which he has not sown”. The creativity school, on the other hand, borrows the aphorism often attributed to Sir Isaac Newton: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Copyright law should develop in a manner that permits and indeed encourages knowledge to be built on knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 These are, of course, caricatures of polar opposites. It comes as no surprise that there are nuances in the case law across jurisdictions which do not lend to a simple or clean characterisation. It is to these cases that I now turn. I will analyse the positions in the United States, Australia, Canada and England before turning to the position in Singapore. Many of these cases that I will discuss were cited by the parties in their closing submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">United States case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 There is no place better to begin the exploration of both competing schools of thought than the celebrated decision of the US Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Feist Publications, Inc v Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc</span> 111 S Ct 1282 (1991) (“<span class="font-italic">Feist</span>”). Rural, the plaintiff, was a telephone service provider in Kansas. Rural produced white and yellow pages directories. State regulations made the production of updated telephone directories mandatory for Rural. The white pages listed in alphabetical order the names of Rural’s subscribers together with their towns and telephone numbers. Feist, the defendant, was a publishing company that specialised in area-wide telephone directories, the contents of which had a far wider geographical reach than those of Rural’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Feist attempted to obtain a licence to use Rural’s listings but was refused one. Feist thereafter used Rural’s white pages listings without the latter’s consent. Feist’s employees called up the subscribers listed in Rural’s directory to verify the data and to obtain additional information from those subscribers. As a result, many of Feist’s listings contained addresses where Rural’s did not. But still, 1,309 of the 46,878 listings in Feist’s directory were identical to the listings in Rural’s white pages published the previous year. Feist’s directory also contained four fictitious listings that Rural introduced into its directory to detect copying. Rural claimed for copyright infringement. The issue was whether by copying the information, Feist had infringed Rural’s copyright. Both the US District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that it did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The US Supreme Court, however, disagreed with the courts below. Justice O’Connor, who delivered the opinion of the court, observed that the case concerned the interaction and undeniable tension between two well-established propositions. The first, that facts were not copyrightable; the second, that compilations of facts were. Facts were not copyrightable because “[t]he <span class="font-italic">sine qua non</span> of copyright is originality” (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1289). An original work was one that was “independently created by the author (as opposed to copied from other works)”, and that “possesses at least some <span class="font-italic">minimal degree of creativity</span>” [emphasis added]. The requisite level of creativity was low, but it existed nonetheless.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Factual compilations could be original because the compilation author had to decide which facts to include, and how to arrange and present the facts. These choices of “selection and arrangement, so long as they are made independently by the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity” (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1289), are sufficient to bring them within the scope of copyright protection. The court acknowledged that the “vast majority of compilations will pass this test [of originality]”, but that there existed a narrow category of works in which “the creative spark is utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually non-existent” (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1294). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The protection conferred on compilations by copyright was, however, “thin”, and limited to the original selection or arrangement of the facts (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1290):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Facts, whether alone or as part of a compilation, are not original and therefore may not be copyrighted. A factual compilation is eligible for copyright if it features an original selection or arrangement of facts, but the copyright is limited to the particular selection or arrangement. In no event may copyright extend to the facts themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The court repudiated the notion that protection for factual compilations could be justified under a distinct theory of “sweat of the brow” or “industrious collection”. That approach had numerous flaws. The most glaring was that “it extended copyright protection in a compilation beyond selection and arrangement—the compiler’s original contributions—to the facts themselves” (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1291).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The court held that Rural was unable to establish infringement because all Feist had copied was data or facts. There was nothing in the selection and arrangement of Rural’s white pages that conferred on it copyright protection (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1296):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rural’s white pages are entirely typical. Persons desiring telephone service in Rural’s service area fill out an application and Rural issues them a telephone number. In preparing its white pages, Rural simply takes the data provided by its subscribers and lists it alphabetically by surname. The end product is a garden-variety white pages directory, devoid of even the slightest trace of creativity.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rural’s selection of listings could not be more obvious: It publishes the most basic information—name, town, and telephone number—about each person who applies to it for telephone service. This is “selection” of a sort, but it lacks the modicum of creativity necessary to transform mere selection into copyrightable expression. Rural expended sufficient effort to make the white pages directory useful, but insufficient creativity to make it original.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court observed <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> that the selection in Rural’s white pages may also have failed to meet the originality threshold because it did not truly select to publish the names and telephone numbers of subscribers. Instead, it was required by law to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Finally, the court concluded that Rural could not claim originality in its coordination and arrangement of the facts. That was done in alphabetical order. It was an “age-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come to be expected as a matter of course” (<span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1297).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Feist had copied some of the fictitious listings and had used Rural’s directory as a source of information. Feist eliminated entries that fell outside the geographic scope of the area-wide directory. Of the 4,935 entries that remained—these were subjected to the verification process described earlier. What is significant is that Feist conceded that Rural’s white pages directory as a whole enjoyed copyright since it included foreword text and other original material such as advertisements. Nevertheless the court found that there was no infringement even though some 1,309 entries were identical. The other entries referenced from Rural were modified in that street addresses were included. The key point made in finding against infringement was that merely to copy unoriginal parts of a work (which as a whole enjoys copyright) did not on its own amount to a substantial taking. The selection of information for each listing (name, town and telephone number) could not have been more obvious and lacked that “modicum of creativity.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Whilst the court recognised that Rural had expended effort to produce a useful work, this did not mean that the appropriation of the labour and expense of producing the work was copyright infringement. In the court’s view, the primary objective of copyright was not to reward the labour of authors, but to advance the progress of science and the arts. To that end, copyright assured authors the right to their original expression but encouraged others to build freely upon ideas and information conveyed by a work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I note that <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> was influenced by the point that “progress of science and the arts” was a constitutional requirement under the applicable US laws. I digress to mention that a similar remark was made in England by Brightman J in <span class="font-italic">Ravenscroft v Herbert</span><span class="font-italic"> and New English Library Limited</span> [1980] RPC 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Ravenscroft v Herbert</span>”) (in the context of historical texts and non-fiction works). He stated that it was reasonable to take the view that copyright permitted wider use of a historical work than a novel so that knowledge could be built on knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <span class="font-italic">Key Publications, Inc v Chinatown Today Publishing Enterprises, Inc</span> 945 F 2d 509 (1991) (“<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span>”) was one of the first to consider and apply <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>. The plaintiff published a classified business directory containing both white pages and yellow pages sections for the Chinese-American community in New York City. The litigation concerned the yellow pages section of the directories, which occupied approximately two-thirds of each directory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The yellow pages initially contained telephone numbers and addresses for businesses that operated in Chinatown, but it then later expanded to include businesses operating in other parts of the New York metropolitan area, Boston and Philadelphia. The information was sorted by the type of business, with each of the 9,000 listings placed in one of the over 260 categories that the directory contained. The moving spirit behind the plaintiff, Ms Wang, had collected business cards from doctors and lawyers associated with the Chinese-American community, banks that did business with the Chinese-American community and other establishments which she thought should be included in the yellow pages since the directory’s inception. However, a “modest percentage” of the plaintiff’s listings were also obtained from another directory of Chinese-American restaurants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The plaintiff commenced suit against the producers of a competing directory also targeted at the New York City Chinese-American community. About seventy-five per cent of the businesses listed in the defendants’ directory were listed in the plaintiff’s directory for the year immediately preceding. The US District Court held that the plaintiff’s directory was protected by copyright, which had been infringed by the defendants’ directory. The defendants appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the plaintiff’s directory was an original compilation protected by copyright. Ms Wang’s testimony that “she excluded from the directory those businesses she did not think would remain open for very long, such as certain insurance brokers, take-out restaurants, and traditional Chinese medical practitioners” in itself “indicate[d] thought and creativity in the selection of businesses included in the [plaintiff’s directory]” (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 513).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Further, the arrangement of listings within the categories was original. Whilst some of the categories were commonplace in directories, others were peculiar to the Chinese-American community (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, “Bean Curd &amp; Bean Sprout Shops”). The arrangement of the plaintiff’s directory, “viewed in the aggregate”, was original. It was “in no sense mechanical”. It involved creativity on the part of Ms Wang to decide which categories to include and the names of the categories (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 514). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Court of Appeals, however, held that there was no infringement and reversed the District Court on that point. The court thought that a “somewhat more refined analysis” was necessary in the case of infringement of a factual compilation as opposed to a wholly original work (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 514). On one reading of <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>, nothing short of an exact replica of a copyrighted compilation would amount to infringement. The court refused to take such a “self-defeating” view of <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>, and preferred a broader approach (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 514): “[w]hat must be shown is substantial similarity between those elements, and only those elements, that provide copyrightability to the allegedly infringed compilation”. To give any broader protection than that would “preclude competitors from using elements in the public domain and impede rather than encourage originality and creativity in future compilations” (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 515).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The court held that two elements of the plaintiff’s directory were protected by copyright. First, the arrangement of over 260 categories under which all the businesses were catalogued, and second, the selection of the 9,000 businesses included in the yellow pages of the directory. If the defendants’ directory was substantially similar to the plaintiff’s directory in either of these respects, then there would be copyright infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The court held that there was neither. There was no substantial similarity in relation to the arrangement of the categories because the arrangement adopted in the defendant’s directory could “hardly be described as even remotely similar to the arrangement utilized by the [plaintiff’s directory]” (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 515). Whilst many of the duplicate listings in both of the plaintiff’s and defendant’s directories were placed in similar categories, this did not amount to infringement. There was a distinction between the “arrangement of categories in a classified directory” on one hand, and the “placement of a listing in a particular category” on the other. The latter was a “mechanical task” that did not merit copyright protection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 There was also no substantial similarity in respect of the selection of listings. Whilst the 1,500 duplicate listings comprised seventy-five per cent of the 2,000 listings found in the defendant’s directory, it only made up seventeen per cent of the 9,000 listings in the plaintiff’s directory. Some degree of overlap in the listings was to be expected because there were a “finite number of businesses that are of special interest to a sizeable segment of the New York Chinese-American community” (<span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> at 516).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 <span class="font-italic">Key Publications</span> again illustrates the crucial linkage between whether and why copyright subsists in a compilation and whether it has been infringed. The end effect is that only the original elements of the compilation are cloaked with copyright, and so infringement was necessarily assessed with reference to whether those original elements of the compilations had been reproduced. It is of course established law that the originality of a work is determined in respect of the claimed work as a whole. It is not necessary that all parts of the work are original when determining subsistence of copyright in the work. Nevertheless it is also established law that in deciding whether infringement has arisen by substantial copying, it is necessary to determine whether the parts copied were original to the copyright work. Merely to copy un-original parts of a copyright work will not on its own amount to a substantial part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Whilst<span class="font-italic"> Key Publications</span> addressed a specialist yellow pages directory, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in <span class="font-italic">Bellsouth Advertising &amp; Publishing Corporation v Donnelley Information Publishing, Inc</span> 999 F 2d 1436 (1991) (“<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span>”) was concerned with “a typical yellow pages directory” (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1438). BAPCO, the plaintiff, published a yellow pages directory of businesses operating in the Greater Miami area. The directory was organised into an alphabetical list of business classifications. Subscribers were each listed within one appropriate classification without charge, and within each classification, the arrangement was alphabetical. Subscribers were also able to purchase advertisements or cross-listings in other classifications. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Donnelley, the defendant, employed a data-entry company to create a database of business telephone subscribers based on BAPCO’s directory. The data-entry company created an entry for each listing appearing in BAPCO’s directory. Each entry recorded the name, address and telephone number of the subscriber, as well as the codes corresponding to business type and unit of advertising. Donnelley eventually created a competing directory from this database. BAPCO sued for copyright infringement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The defendant conceded that the directory as a whole enjoyed copyright. What was in issue was whether the defendant had infringed by taking the plaintiff’s original selection, coordination or arrangement. The US District Court granted BAPCO’s motion for summary judgment on its claim. Donnelley appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The majority opinion of the Court of Appeals, delivered by Circuit Judge Birch, was that there was no copyright infringement. The majority rejected the District Court’s reasoning that BAPCO performed selective acts by: (a) determining the geographic scope of its directory and setting a closing date after which no changes in listing information could be made; and (b) employing marketing techniques to generate listings, including the number of free listings offered to each subscriber, which subscribers to contact, and the procedure used to recommend the purchase of listings under multiple headings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 These purported “acts of selection” did not meet the requisite level of originality and were, more fundamentally, not acts of authorship. They were techniques for the discovery of facts. BAPCO’s sales strategies merely enabled it to discover how certain subscribers described their business and were willing to pay “for a certain number of listings under certain available business descriptions” (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1441). These went to the efficient discovery of data and not the selection of facts to be reported:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The protection of copyright must inhere in a creatively original <span class="font-italic">selection</span> of facts to be reported and not in the creative means used to discover those facts … Ultimately, the district court erred by extending copyright protection to the collection of facts in the BAPCO directory based on the uncopyrightable formative acts used to generate those listings. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The majority also did not look favourably upon the District Court’s finding that there was originality in BAPCO’s arrangement of the directory in an alphabetised list of business types, with individual businesses listed in alphabetical order under the applicable headings. That arrangement was “entirely typical” and “practically inevitable” for a business directory (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1442). Related to this was the preclusion of BAPCO’s claim on the basis of the “merger” doctrine. The doctrine stipulated that “expression is not protected in those instances where there is only one or so few ways of expressing an idea that protection of the expression would effectively accord protection to the idea itself” (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1442). The only way to construct a useful business directory was that done by BAPCO. The arrangement had merged with the idea of a business directory, thus making BAPCO’s arrangement unoriginal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The majority rejected the District Court’s reliance on the acts of coordination and arrangement in the system of headings used in the BAPCO directory. First, it was not clear that the heading structure constituted sufficiently original expression warranting copyright protection. Many of the headings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “Attorneys” or “Banks”) were such obvious labels that they could not be said to be original. Many of these headings were the direct result of standard industry practice. Further, the ultimate appearance of a particular subscriber under a certain heading was “determined by the subscriber’s willingness to purchase those listings” (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1445). Second, and in any event, there was no evidence Donnelley copied BAPCO’s system of headings. Because of the extent to which the heading structure of a classified directory was dictated by functional considerations and industry practice, the differences between the heading structures in both directories were sufficient to rebut any inference of copying.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Circuit Judge Hatchett, who wrote the sole dissent, thought there were at least four original aspects of BAPCO’s publication which had been “substantially appropriated” by Donnelley (<span class="font-italic">Bellsouth</span> at 1478–1480). First, the selection of the 7,000 classified headings. Second, the arrangement of the business listings within these classified listings. Third, the selection of businesses with only business telephone numbers, and not businesses with both residential and business telephone numbers. Fourth, the selection of the geographic area to be covered in its directory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It is clear, therefore, that the US cases require creativity, albeit only at a low threshold, in the reduction of the work to the final form of expression, before the work will be considered original, and copyright found to subsist. Further, substantiality in copying is established only when the original portions of the work (and not those unprotected by copyright) are taken.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Australian case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Australian case law is instructive because there has been a perceptible shift from the “sweat of the brow” approach to one that instead focuses on intellectual effort expended in reducing the work to its final form of expression. The Australian copyright legislation is also substantially similar to that in Singapore. Section 27 of the Singapore Copyright Act, which deals with original works in which copyright subsists, was based on and is identical to s 32 of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). The definition of a “literary work” is, however, not similar. Australia defines a “literary work” to include “a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols” (there is also a separate definition for computer programs, but that is not relevant for present purposes). This broad definition, which was also previously found in the Singapore legislation, was narrowed (or clarified) considerably by amendments to our Copyright Act in 1999. I discuss this change and its implications further below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The decision of a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd</span> 192 ALR 433 (2002) (“<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span>”) depicts the high watermark of the “sweat of the brow” approach in Australia. Telstra, a telephone service provider, produced telephone directories. It sued Desktop Marketing for infringing its copyright in its white pages and yellow pages directories, as well as its “headings book”. The infringement was alleged to arise from software containing white pages and yellow pages listings data, which Desktop Marketing produced and sold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The case was heard at first instance by Finkelstein J: <span class="font-italic">Telstra Corporation Ltd v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd</span> 181 ALR 134 (2001) (“<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (First Instance)</span>”). After a lengthy review of the English authorities, he concluded that an author may have copyright in the <span class="font-italic">form</span> in which he publishes facts, and that copyright will subsist so long as the author has undertaken sufficient work or expense in gathering the facts (<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (First Instance)</span> at [64]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I take the effect of the English authorities to be as follows. The author of a book that records facts, whether it be an encyclopedia, a map, a directory or some other factual compilation, does not acquire copyright in the facts that have been published. So much is trite. <span class="font-italic">But the author may have copyright in the form in which he has published the facts. Copyright will subsist if there has been sufficient intellectual effort in the selection or arrangement of the facts. It will also subsist if the author has engaged in sufficient work or incurred sufficient expense in gathering the facts.</span> The cases have not defined with any precision what amount of intellectual effort, labour, etc, is required to justify copyright. … <span class="font-italic">When copyright does subsist in a compilation of facts, any person who wishes to publish the same facts is free to do so. But he must collect the facts himself. He cannot copy them from the first work.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Finkelstein J considered the “creativity” standard adopted in the US and Canada, but declined to follow it. This was so even though the learned judge recognised that an element of creativity could be found in the preamble of the Statute of Anne (8 Ann c 21) (UK) (“the Statute of Anne”), the first English copyright statute passed in 1710, which stated that it was enacted “for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful books”. In Finkelstein J’s view, English law had since developed and evolved such that it recognised the importance of protecting the labour and expense of gathering facts. The legislative scheme in Australia was based on the law in England as it stood after that evolutionary development, and there was nothing in the subsequent changes in the Australian legislation to “admit of the conclusion that the English law had been discarded” (<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (First Instance)</span> at [85]). It was not possible, especially as a judge of first instance, to jettison the old law and replace it with the principles expressed in <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Finkelstein J’s decision was affirmed on appeal by a Full Court. Lindgren J, with whom Black CJ agreed, conducted an impressive review of the English authorities dating back to the early 19th century as well as the Australian authorities on point. He concluded that the requirement of originality did not necessitate a modicum of creativity (<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span> at [160]). The test of originality was “whether the work was not copied, but originated from the putative author”. It was not an all-or-nothing test but raised a question of fact as to the putative author’s contribution to the making of the literary work in question. Lindgren J also observed that it was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the law that where there was “only one way of expressing and arranging a whole-of-universe factual compilation”, the compilation could not attract copyright protection. There was also no principle that the labour and expense of collecting, verifying, recording and assembling the data to be compiled are irrelevant to establishing originality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Lindgren J candidly observed that the practical effect of this position was “an acceptance of the proposition that copyright can subsist in facts” (<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span> at [161]). He acknowledged that there were policy considerations tugging in both directions, but those were a matter for the legislature and not the courts (<span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span> at [164]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The position in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span> was subsequently cast in doubt by the landmark decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">IceTV Pty Limited and another v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited</span> [2009] 239 CLR 458 (“<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span>”), which marked the beginning of a shift in Australian jurisprudence away from the sweat of the brow approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The plaintiff, Nine, selected and scheduled television programmes to be broadcast by certain free-to-air television stations. The scheduling of programmes involved Nine’s computer network, “the Nine Database”. Nine produced weekly schedules of the television programmes to be broadcast two weeks in advance based on information from the Nine Database. The weekly schedules comprised time, title and programme information of television programmes scheduled to be aired in the seven-day broadcast week. The weekly schedules were then forwarded to third parties who published aggregated guides of the television programmes based on those schedules in various media.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The defendant, IceTV, produced the “IceGuide” which was an electronic programme guide for television. The IceGuide schedules, which were used to produce the IceGuide, were verified and corrected against the aggregated guides. Nine alleged that by doing so, IceTV had reproduced a substantial part of the weekly schedules or alternatively, the Nine Database, which was the source of the information. It should be noted that the judge at first instance found that IceTV never took the whole of the time and title information from the aggregated guides. Rather, IceTV copied no more than “slivers” of time and title information in order to maintain and update the IceGuide (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [123]). That finding was not challenged on appeal. The first instance judge found in favour of IceTV. She was overturned on appeal to a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 IceTV appealed to the High Court of Australia. IceTV accepted that copyright subsisted in the works in suit, namely, each weekly schedule and each week’s version of the Nine Database. The sole question before the High Court of Australia was whether there was a reproduction of a substantial part from any of the individual works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The court unanimously rejected Nine’s claim for copyright infringement in two separate concurring judgments. The first was a joint judgment by French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ. They said that the concept of “authorship” was “central to the protection given by copyright legislation” (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [22]). The copyright legislation struck a balance between policy objectives of rewarding authors of original literary works and yet recognising that literary works are beneficial to the public.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 They stressed that copyright protected an author’s <span class="font-italic">expression</span> and not <span class="font-italic">facts</span> (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [28]). The distinction between both was a crucial component in balancing the competing policy considerations that the scope of copyright protection brought to the fore:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Copyright does not protect facts or information. Copyright protects the particular form of expression of the information, namely the words, figures and symbols in which the pieces of information are expressed, and the selection and arrangement of that information. <span class="font-italic">That facts are not protected is a crucial part of the balancing of competing policy considerations in copyright legislation. The information/expression dichotomy, in copyright law, is rooted in considerations of social utility. Copyright, being an exception to the law’s general abhorrence of monopolies, does not confer a monopoly on facts or information because to do so would impede the reading public’s access to and use of facts and information. Copyright is not given to reward work distinct from the production of a particular form of expression.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ emphasised the inextricable link between <span class="font-italic">substantiality</span> of copying and the part of the work which was said to be <span class="font-italic">original</span> (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [30]–[32]). Where factual compilations were concerned, it was unhelpful to speak of “what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting”. Facts were worth copying but unprotected by copyright. Focusing on the “commercial value” of the information was also prone to mislead because it centred on the information rather than the form of expression.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 What then did “originality” in the context of copyright subsistence mean? French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said that this requirement was correlative to authorship. Originality simply meant that the works originated from the author. The creation of the work required “some independent intellectual effort”, but not literary merit or novelty (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ then turned their focus to originality in the context of infringement. Infringement also implicated the question of originality because the part reproduced would not be a substantial part if it did not originate from the author. The focus was on the “originality” of the part which was copied (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These cases direct attention to the degree of originality in the <span class="font-italic">expression</span> of the part of the work reproduced.

That expression lacks the requisite originality (in the sense explained) for the part to constitute a substantial part.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ concluded with some remarks on the relevance of “skill and labour” in the context of both subsistence and infringement. In respect of the former, they cited with approval <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>, and said that perhaps too much had been made of the relevance of skill and labour and the distinction between that and creativity (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… ‘Industrious collection’ or ‘sweat of the brow’, on the one hand, and ‘creativity’, on the other, have been treated as antinomies in some sort of mutually exclusive relationship in the mental processes of an author or joint authors. They are, however, kindred aspects of a mental process which produces an object, a literary work, a particular form of expression which copyright protects. A complex compilation or a narrative history will almost certainly require considerable skill and labour, which involve both ‘industrious collection’ and ‘creativity’, in the sense of requiring original productive thought to produce the expression, including selection and arrangement, of the material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ said that when ascertaining whether a “substantial part” had been copied, the focus was not so much on whether there was an “appropriation” of the author’s skill and labour, but rather, “on the nature of the skill and labour, and in particular … whether it is directed to the originality of the particular form of expression” (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [49]). Where factual compilations were concerned, focusing solely on skill and labour instead of the effort directed to producing the form of expression may lead copyright law to error (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The error is of a kind which might enable copyright law to be employed to achieve anti-competitive behaviour of a sort not contemplated by the balance struck in the Act between the rights of authors and the entitlements of the reading public.

Consideration of the skill and labour expended by the author of a work may assist in addressing that question: that the creation of a work required skill and labour may indicate that the particular form of expression adopted was highly original.</span> However, focusing on the ‘appropriation’ of the author’s skill and labour must not be allowed to distract from the inquiry mandated by the Act. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On the facts of the case, there was no doubt that Nine employees expended skill and labour on producing the weekly schedules and the Nine Database (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [53]). The critical question, however, was whether that skill and labour was directed to the final form of expression (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [54]).

They too focused on the centrality of the requirement of “authorship”. Where a literary work was brought into existence by multiple individuals, it was a question of “fact and degree” as to which, if any, had expended “<span class="font-italic">sufficient effort of a literary nature</span>” [emphasis added] to be considered an author of that work (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [99]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ disapproved of the “rhetoric of ‘appropriation’ of ‘skill and labour’” (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [131]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A finding that one party has ‘appropriated’ skill and labour, of itself, is not determinative of the issue of infringement of a copyright work.

Once that was done, there remained “the extremely modest skill and labour” in setting down the programmes already selected into the form of the Nine Database and the weekly schedules (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [168]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ also addressed a submission based on <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> as to whether a “creative spark” was required before a work could be considered original. They held that it was “by no means apparent that the law [in Australia] … was to any different effect”, and that it may be that “the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing</span> with respect to compilations is out of line with the understanding of copyright law over many years” (<span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> at [188]). There was therefore a need to be cautious as to the emphasis in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing</span> on “labour and expense”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> was a case that dealt with infringement, although the indelible link between infringement and subsistence is apparent from the analysis above. <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> was considered and applied in the context of subsistence by a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Telstra Corporation Ltd and another v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd and others</span> (2010) 273 ALR 725 (“<span class="font-italic">Telstra (</span><span class="font-italic">Full Court)</span>”). The question was whether copyright subsisted in the white pages and yellow pages directories published by one of the applicants, Sensis, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the other applicant, Telstra, a telephone service provider.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Gordon J tried the question of subsistence as a preliminary issue at first instance: <span class="font-italic">Telstra Corporation </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd and another v Phone Directories Co Pte Ltd and others</span> 264 ALR 617 (“<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span>”). Gordon J held that copyright did not subsist in any of the directories. She reached that conclusion after undertaking a detailed examination of the directory-production process. She observed that much of it was automated (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [56]), and carried out by a computer system known as the “Genesis Computer System”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 At the heart of that automated process were “the Rules”, which Gordon J described as “a set of prescriptive guidelines that control, dictate, restrict and/or prohibit the content and presentation of listings in the [white pages directories] and the [yellow pages directories]” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [90]). The Rules were automated in the sense that they were programmed into the Genesis Computer System, which supported the applicants’ directory-production operations. But they were also indirectly automated because human intervention was required in the application of the Rules (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [92]). Gordon J thought that the “overarching process is designed to ensure that decisions that violate the Rules are as rare as possible”. Where human intervention was required, it was directed at ensuring the content and presentation of listings complied with the Rules; “instances of so-called ‘discretion’ … [were] not a true discretion but one to be used in <span class="font-italic">accordance with the Rules</span>” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Gordon J took the view that copyright did not subsist in the directories because there was no author. None of the 91 people that the applicants listed as authors contributed what could be described as “independent intellectual effort” or “sufficient effort of a literary nature” in the compilation of the directory. Many of the processes were highly automated (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [334]–[335]). The “gamut of individuals” also could not have been considered joint authors. The staff performed their function separately from each other and it was doubtful that the requisite level of collaboration had been crossed (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [337]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 A Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia affirmed Gordon J’s decision on appeal. Keane CJ said that a revision of the position on the relevance of skill and labour as stated in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing (Full Court)</span> was necessary in the light of <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [79]). The latter case shifted the focus away from the protection of a party’s labour and expense to (a) the “particular form of expression” said to constitute an original literary work, and (b) the requirement that “the work originates with an author or joint authors from some independent intellectual effort” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [82]). Keane CJ agreed that the compilation of the directories was “overwhelmingly the work of the Genesis computer system” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [89]). The compilations which emerged thus did not originate from an individual or a group of individuals. Since there was no author, copyright could not subsist in the directories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Perram J said that whilst the collection of data engaged processes that involved substantial human industry, the creation of the material form of the directories was carried out by a computer program; no persons had any substantive input into those forms (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [101]). It was clear that the human effort in this case was directed at the collection of facts and not the creation of the material form, which was the work of a computer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 For Perram J, two questions thus arose (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [101]). First, whether the independent intellectual effort had to be directed at the creation of the material form, or whether it was sufficient that the effort was directed at some anterior activity (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, fact collection). Second, whether there was in fact sufficient human effort involved in the process to mean that the directories were reduced to a material form by an author.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Perram J held in relation to the first question that the effort directed at data collection was not relevant to the issue of the directories’ originality. He acknowledged that the business structure of Sensis was elaborate and comprised employees verifying data, performing quality control checks and persuading customers to purchase advertisements. It involved “the full panoply of activities which one might expect to attend the collection and maintenance of customer information for telephone directories prepared for a country of twenty or so million people” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [103]). Although much of this activity was automated, the collection phase would certainly not have been able to proceed without human input and contribution. However, all this human effort was not relevant to the issue of the directories’ originality. The preparatory steps that contributed to the ideas which a literary work ultimately expressed did not contribute to the work’s originality (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [104]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The important creative steps which involve the fashioning of the ideas on which a literary work’s ultimate form rests are not actions which the Act counts as authorial and this is because what is protected by the copyright monopoly is the form of a work and not the ideas which presage or prefigure it.</span> And this is so even if those ideas can plainly be discerned in the fabric of the material form. The travels reduced to a touring guide, the toils in the library underpinning a substantive work of history and the life led which finally results in an autobiography are not authorial activities however essential they might be to the creation of the work in question. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Perram J concluded the first question with the observation that it was difficult to find any room for the protection of labour or skill in the collection of material beyond that which satisfied the statutory requirement of originality (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [112]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Once one accepts that the focus of the copyright is on the creation of the material form by an author it is analytically difficult to identify any role for labour or skill in the collection of material beyond the question posed by the statute, namely, whether the work is ‘original’ in the sense of not being copied from elsewhere. </span>Any role for skill and labour in the process of collection which extends beyond that is inconsistent with the emphasis given in <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> to the reduction of a work into a material form. <span class="font-italic">It follows that,</span> <span class="font-italic">beyond showing that the directories were original in the sense of not having been copied, the activities in the collection phase are not relevant to assessing whether those who reduced the directories to material form did so with sufficient independent intellectual or literary effort.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In relation to the second question, Perram J said that if any of Sensis’s employees could have been said to have reduced the directories to material form, it was the persons who had control of the Genesis Computer System software, Mr Vormwald and Mr Cooper. Those persons were, however, not using the software in the way a novelist used a word processor. They were “giving [the software] instructions at the very highest level about the principal parameters of the directories …” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [117]). Any intellectual effort by Mr Vormwald and Mr Cooper was thus not directed at the material form of the directories. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Perram J emphasised that whether a person was sufficiently in control of a computer or computer program such that he could be considered an author was ultimately a question of degree that had to be decided with regard to the facts of the case (at [118]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [C]are must be taken to ensure that the efforts of [the person controlling the computer program] can be seen as directed to the reduction of a work into a material form.

But there will be cases where the person operating a program is not controlling the nature of the material form produced by it and in </span><span class="font-italic">those cases that person will not contribute sufficient independent intellectual effort or sufficient effort of a literary nature</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Yates J also acknowledged the laboriousness of the work of Sensis’s employees in “collecting, entering and manipulating data to provide the fabric out of which each identified compilation” was fashioned (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [166]). However, the selection, ordering and arrangement of the directories was carried out by the Genesis Computer System. It was not a “mere tool” utilised by Telstra’s employees for that purpose. The “transformative steps” performed by the Genesis Computer System were fundamental to the making of the compilation in each case. Yates J said that it was ultimately a question of “fact and degree” in forming a judgment about whether a work was original, or whether the requirement of authorship was satisfied. In that case, the compilations simply could not bear the characterisation of originating from human authors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Canadian case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The position in Canada is said to be an intermediate one. In the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada</span> 2004 SCC 13 (2004) (“<span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span>”), McLachlin CJ held that the meaning of originality in Canada fell in between the extremes of the creativity and sweat of the brow views. A work was original within the meaning of Canada’s Copyright Act 1985 (c C-42) if there was an “exercise of skill and judgment” in the expression of an idea (<span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span> at [16]). Skill meant “the use of one’s knowledge, developed aptitude or practiced ability”. Judgment meant “the use of one’s capacity for discernment or ability to form an opinion or evaluation by comparing different possible options in producing the work”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 McLachlin CJ came to this conclusion after considering the plain meaning of the word original; the idea of an “intellectual creation” which was implicit in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886) (“the Berne Convention”), which Canada had adopted in 1923 and which was the precursor to Canada’s first Copyright Act; the purpose of the Copyright Act; and the need to create a “workable yet fair standard”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 McLachlin CJ’s remarks in relation to the last two points are pertinent. She said that the purpose of copyright law was to balance, on one hand “the public interest in promoting the encouragement and dissemination of works of the arts and intellect” and, on the other, “obtaining a just reward for the creator” (<span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span> at [23]). The choice between the creativity or sweat of the brow standards of originality would determine where that balance was struck. She held that the sweat of the brow approach was too liberal because it shifted the balance of copyright protection too far in favour of the owner’s rights. The creativity standard was too stringent and the requirements of novelty or non-obviousness were more properly in the realm of patents than copyright. In view of that, clothing a work that was the product of an exercise of skill and judgment with copyright protection was a “workable yet fair standard” (<span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span> at [24]). The Canadian Supreme Court’s decision thus appears to have rested on what it thought was a reasonable compromise that sat on the horns of a dilemma between competing policy objectives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Applying the “skill and judgment” standard, the court considered that copyright subsisted in all the works in suit, namely: (a) headnotes of judicial decisions; (b) case summaries of judicial decisions; (c) the topical index in the book <span class="font-italic">Canada GST Cases</span>; and (d) reported judicial decisions as a compilation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I pause to comment that, however skill and judgment is defined, the Canadian Supreme Court nonetheless emphasised that it must be related to and directed towards the particular expression of the information or ideas. Over and above the point that the skill does not have to reach a high standard of intellectual creativity (there is certainly no requirement for inventiveness), it is a question of fact as to whether there is sufficient skill and judgment in the expression of an idea, facts or information. The Canadian Supreme Court clearly accepted that the skill and judgment must not be so trivial that it amounts to a purely mechanical exercise. The Canadian Supreme Court was not for a moment disparaging the practical significance and value of a mechanical exercise. But the point made was that given the objectives of copyright, this was insufficient to cloak the work with the requisite originality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147  I note also that the statutory provisions in the Canadian Copyright Act under consideration in <span class="font-italic">CCH</span><span class="font-italic"> Canadian</span>, whilst similar, are not the same as those in our Copyright Act. In particular, the Canadian legislation does not expressly set out that for compilations, what is required is that the selection or arrangement of the contents is such as to constitute the compilation an intellectual creation. The Canadian Supreme Court, however, accepted that the idea of “intellectual creation” was implicit in the Berne Convention (<span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span> at [19]). It also observed that some commentators took the view that countries which adopted a sweat of the brow or industrious collection approach to originality had departed from the spirit if not the letter of the Berne Convention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">English case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The position taken by the English cases has been alluded to above in the review of the Australian decisions. The key point is that even though many English cases recognise the importance of protecting the labour of authorship, the significance of a balanced approach is also underscored. Shortly after the Copyright Act 1777 (17 Geo 3 c 57) (UK) was enacted, Lord Mansfield heard the case of <span class="font-italic">Sayre v Moore</span> (1785) 102 ER 139 (“<span class="font-italic">Sayre v Moore</span>”), which concerned copying of sea charts. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he had gone to great expense to obtain information for the sea charts. The defendant copied the sea charts into one large map together with other alterations and improvements. In the direction to the jury (who found for the defendant), Lord Mansfield commented:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The rule of this decision … is a matter of great consequence to the country. In deciding it we must take care to guard against two extremes equally prejudicial; the one that men of ability, who have employed their time for the service of the community, may not be deprived of their just merits, and the reward of their just merits, and the reward of their ingenuity and labour; the other that the world may not be deprived of improvements, nor the progress of the arts be retarded. The Act that secures copyright to authors guards against piracy of the words and sentiments; but it does not prohibit writing on the same subject …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 There is no doubt that in the years after <span class="font-italic">Sayre v Moore</span>, many English cases placed greater stress on the effort and labour of authorship. For example, in <span class="font-italic">IBCOS </span><span class="font-italic">Computers Ltd v Barclays Mercantile Highland Finance Ltd</span> [1994] FSR 275 at 302, Jacob J proffered the view that liability for copyright infringement depended on whether there had been an over-borrowing of the skill, labour and judgment that went into the copyright work. In <span class="font-italic">Autospin (Oil Sea</span><span class="font-italic">ls) Ltd v Beehive Spinning (A Firm)</span> [1995] RPC 683 at 698, Laddie J stated that in compilation cases, copyright protected not just the form of the words; rather, it was also concerned with the author’s skill and effort expended in gathering information that was compiled. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Designers Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles) Ltd</span> [2001] FSR 113, Lord Bingham commented that “no one else may for a season reap what the copyright owner has sown” (at [2]). And yet, the remarks of Lord Mansfield in <span class="font-italic">Sayre v Moore</span> and Brightman J in <span class="font-italic">Ravenscroft v Herbert</span> remain valid, at least as part of the overall balance of factors to be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In UK and Europe, the tension and problem in using copyright to protect the investment of labour and expense into making of databases has long been recognised. The lack of a common approach within Europe resulted in the European Union Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 11 March 1996 on the Legal Protection of Databases (“the Database Directive”), that has been given effect to in the UK by the Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 (SI 1997 No 3022). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The Database Directive came into being soon after the decision of the US Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> brought into sharp focus the problem of using copyright to protect databases or factual compilations. The result of the database legislation in the European Union and the UK was to adopt a two-track approach. Copyright would remain as the appropriate form to protect databases created by an author. A new <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right was introduced to protect databases that were the product of considerable human, technical and financial resources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The preamble to the Database Directive (at para 45) makes clear that its purpose is not to replace copyright. Instead, the scope of copyright protection for databases was clarified and expressly limited to the original selection and arrangement of the contents of the database. It is also clear that there was no intention to extend protection to mere facts or data. The new <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right was explained as serving the objective of protecting the investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of a database from (a) unauthorised extraction and (b) re-utilization of all or a substantial part of the contents of the database (preamble to the Database Directive at para 42). The <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right is not limited to electronic or digital databases. Instead, “database” is defined in Art 1 of the Database Directive as “a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It is not necessary to review the considerable body of English and European case law on the new <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right. The interpretation and application of many of the provisions have proven difficult. That said, recent English and CJEU decisions have examined the use of copyright to protect databases that are created by an author. Whilst these cases are not binding and must be interpreted in the light of the Database Directive and its implementing provisions, a passing reference may be helpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The first is <span class="font-italic">Football Datco </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Brittens Pools Ltd</span> [2010] RPC 17 <span class="font-italic">(“Brittens Pools</span>”)<span class="font-italic">.</span> This case concerned the English and Scottish (football) Premier Leagues and football leagues fixture lists. They were lists which contained the dates, and match-ups between the football teams playing in the football leagues each season. The process of producing these fixture lists was a complex one. It required considering and balancing, amongst others, the large number of teams and matches played during the football season (between August and May every season), the many rules that governed the way teams could be matched up, and the pairing requests from football teams regarding dates and match-ups. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Floyd J recognised that whilst a computer assisted with the task, a significant amount of human judgment went into, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, striking a fair and reasonable balance between competing dates and pairing requests of each club (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [41]–[44]). He held, however, that the <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right in Art 7(1) of the Database Directive did not apply to protect the data in the fixtures list, for a number of reasons. Chief amongst them was that the type of investment made into the fixture lists was the wrong sort of investment to qualify for protection. The investment into the fixture lists was in the creation of the content and not in the obtaining, verification, or presentation of the content (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [92]). The work done in obtaining, verifying or presenting the data in the fixture lists was trivial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Floyd J nonetheless accepted that the fixture lists were protected by copyright (as a database) under Art 3(1) of the Database Directive. The process of preparing the fixture lists was said to involve “very significant labour and skill in satisfying the multitude of often competing requirements of those involved … the process was not entirely deterministic” (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [41]). Not everyone would come up with the same answer; there was an exercise of judgment which had to be made based on the relative importance of requests, rules, and so on (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [42]). The work was not mere “sweat of the brow”, which meant the rigid application of criteria to the processing of data as in, for example, a telephone directory. In each stage of production of the fixture lists, there was scope for the application of judgment and skill. Unlike a “sweat of the brow” compilation, some solutions were better than others. The use of the computer also did not eliminate the use of judgment discretion (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Floyd J stated that the purpose of copyright was to provide encouragement for creative endeavour, and differed in this respect from the<span class="font-italic"> sui generis</span> right which was designed to encourage investment in particular types of data gathering (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> at [80]). Further, the selection or arrangement required by Art 3(1) of the Database Directive was not confined to selection or arrangement performed <span class="font-italic">after</span> the data was finally created. The process of selection and arrangement of the contents of a database could and often did commence <span class="font-italic">before</span> all the data was created. To exclude selection decisions because they had occurred whilst the database was being created was arbitrary and conceptually fraught with difficulty (<span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span> [82]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The <span class="font-italic">Britten Pools</span> case came as a surprise.

The plaintiff, however, won on copyright protection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The appeal against Floyd J’s decision resulted in the English Court of Appeal referring questions (<span class="font-italic">sub nom</span> <span class="font-italic">Football Dataco Ltd v Stan James (Abingdon) Ltd</span> [2011] RPC 9 (“<span class="font-italic">Stan James</span>”)) to the European Court of Justice. Jacob LJ, when dealing with the copyright claim in the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the objective of the Database Directive (in setting up the two-track system) was not to create two additional rights, copyright and a <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> right. Instead, the Database Directive simply made clear that any copyright in any work contained in a database continued notwithstanding that it was included in the database (<span class="font-italic">Stan James</span> at [14]). The importance of this is that it did not follow that anything contained in a database necessarily enjoyed copyright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The decision of the European Court of Justice on the reference (Case C-604/10) is reported as <span class="font-italic">Football Dataco Ltd v Yahoo!

The European Court of Justice effectively reversed Floyd J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Brittens Pools</span>, and held that copyright protection under Art 3(1) of the Database Directive was concerned with the “structure” of the database, and not the contents nor the elements constituting its contents (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [30]). The concept did not extend to the creation of the data contained in that database (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [32]). The intellectual effort and skill of creating data were not relevant to assessing copyright protection under Art 3(1) (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [33]). This was said to be consistent with the purpose of the Database Directive: to stimulate the creation of data storage and processing systems in order to contribute to the development of an information market against a background of exponential growth in the amount of information generated and processed (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [34]). Resources spent on creating the fixture lists related to the <span class="font-italic">creation</span> of the data, which was of no relevance to assessing the eligibility of the football fixture lists for copyright protection under Art 3(1) (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [36]). Instead, as regards the setting up of a database, the criterion of originality was satisfied when—through the selection and arrangement of the data which it contained—the author expressed his creative ability in an original manner by making free and creative choices and thus stamped his personal touch on it (<span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Another instructive decision is that of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Football Dataco </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Sportradar GmbH</span> [2013] FSR 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Sportradar</span>”). The plaintiffs created and marketed a database known as “Football Live”, which contained, amongst others, football-related information including time-stamped data on goals, goals-scorers, own goals, penalties, cautions/expulsions and substitutions.

The data was said to have been collected by ex-professional footballers engaged by the plaintiffs who attended the relevant matches for this purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The defendants in one of the two jointly-tried actions were the Swiss and German arms of Sportradar, a firm that provided data relating to sports events to betting companies and their customers.

The Court of Appeal agreed with Floyd J’s decision in the High Court (reported at <span class="font-italic">Football Dataco Ltd v Sportradar GmbH</span> [2013] FSR 3), and held that when a goal was scored and employees of the claimants at the match phoned in to report it, the employees were not creating facts. The fact that a goal was scored was not a fact created by the claimants. The effort of the observer at the match was part of the effort of obtaining data or information (<span class="font-italic">Sportradar</span> at [68]). If an opinion was added, the opinion may have been created but not the fact of the goal. The Court of Appeal thus found that the database was protected by the database right created under Art 7(1) of the Database Directive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The significance of the latest <span class="font-italic">Sportsradar</span> decision is primarily in the area of the <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right, and in the recognition that the observation of a fact is not the same as its creation. The point being that earlier cases on the <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> right had made clear that a substantial investment in creating facts fell outside the <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> regime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 However, the question that remains is the extent to which effort and labour expended on finding, observing and recording facts is relevant in determining originality for the purposes of copyright law in English law. On its own, it is improbable that the labour of discovering facts will be sufficient. It will be recalled that the European Court of Justice in <span class="font-italic">Yahoo!</span> effectively reversed the <span class="font-italic">Britten Pools</span> decision in respect of the relevance of effort of creation and originality in copyright and databases. Indeed, Jacob LJ, in a judgment that was a prelude to the <span class="font-italic">Sportradar</span> decision discussed above, commented that whilst there may have been copyright in the Football Live database as a whole, what was alleged to have been copied was mere data on any reasonable view (<span class="font-italic">Football Dataco Ltd v Sportradar GmbH</span> [2011] FSR 20 at [16]). The recording of data may sometimes involve some skill (who scored in a goal-mouth scramble) but that is not creative skill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 Whilst I am cautious in commenting on the law from another jurisdiction (especially given the complexity of the relationship between copyright and the <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right), it does appear that the long and short of the English and European cases is that, whatever the position of factual compilations and copyright prior to Database Directive, originality requires a selection and arrangement of the data whereby the author expresses his creative ability in an original manner. The mere effort of collecting or finding data is insufficient. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Singapore case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Before coming to my decision, I will first discuss two series of Singapore cases that have addressed the elusive dichotomy between facts and expression in factual compilations, and the related concepts of authorship and originality that it implicates. The first is the <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The first instance decision was given by District Judge Thian Yee Sze in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Land Authority v Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd</span> [2007] SGDC 216 (“<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span>”). That case concerned copyright in (a) various editions of the Singapore Street Directory; (b) the street directory data of Singapore in vector format; and (c) the address point data of Singapore in vector format. The Singapore Land Authority (“the SLA”) had licensed the use of the vector data to Virtual Map for the latter to produce its online directories. The SLA subsequently terminated the licenses. The question was whether Virtual Map’s continued sale of its online maps after the termination of the licenses amounted to copyright infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The District Court held that the works were a subject matter capable of protection by copyright, and that copyright did in fact subsist in the works. The definition of “compilation” in the Copyright Act was a wide one. A compilation would be protected by copyright where “skill and labour [was] expended in choosing and arranging the individual works” that comprised the compilation (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [28]). The District Court rejected Virtual Map’s submission that the compilation comprised merely information and facts, which were not copyrightable. Although the individual parts of a compilation may “have nothing original”, “the sum total of the compilation may be original” (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The District Court found that it was “evident” that “a lot of work was required to produce the new Singapore Street Directory” (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [37]). The “labour, skill and expense involved in producing the new directory was such that the final form of work … was an original work within the meaning of the Act”. The compilation of the address point vector data also “necessitated much work to be done on the part of … SLA” (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [44]), and was thus protected by copyright. The District Court’s approach towards the requirement of originality was perhaps summed up in the manner the issue was framed in the introduction to the judgment (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [1]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question posed to me in this action was precisely … whether the defendant had availed for itself the results of what the plaintiff had sown by virtue of the latter’s hard work, skill, knowledge and judgment, without permission and in breach of the plaintiff’s copyright. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The District Court found that Virtual Map had infringed SLA’s copyright in the works. It discussed extensively the map-making process, from the determination of a skeleton framework upon which the details of the map were overlaid, to the process of surveying the topography and rendering it as vector data, to the effort involved in collecting additional data such as place names and other cultural data. The District Court found fingerprints of copying in the copied errors and inessential details, some of which had been deliberately introduced by SLA (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [73]–[87]). There was therefore substantial copying because Virtual Map had used “the framework or ‘skeleton of SLA’s data’”, within which was embedded the street directory vector data and address point vector data. The use of the “skeleton” itself was substantial because, without the skeleton, “there would be no map to speak of” (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (DC)</span> at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Virtual Map’s appeal against the District Court’s decision was dismissed by the High Court: <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (HC)</span>”). The appeal was, however, only confined to the question of infringement. Virtual Map was prepared to accept that SLA had copyright in the street directories and vector data (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (HC)</span> at [6]). Tan Lee Meng J held that there was infringement because proof of copying had been established. Virtual Map was unable to explain the “innumerable” fingerprints of SLA’s works in its maps nor was it able to establish that its maps were the result of its independent creation (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (HC)</span> at [55]). By copying the skeleton of SLA’s maps, Virtual Map had reproduced a substantial portion of SLA’s works (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (HC)</span> at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 Virtual Map’s application for leave to appeal against the High Court decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal: <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority and another application</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 558 (“<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (CA)</span>”). The Court of Appeal’s judgment centred on a point of civil procedure, namely, whether Virtual Map required leave to appeal against the High Court’s decision. It held that leave was necessary, and went on to consider briefly the grounds on which leave was sought. These related to the District Court’s and the High Court’s holdings on infringement and substantiality. Leave was refused because there were no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> error in either the District Court’s or the High Court’s judgments. The District Court’s decision was found to be “careful and well-reasoned” (<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (CA)</span> at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> cases may thus have expressed a view that was in line with the sweat of the brow approach. That was the approach taken in the District Court, and there were no adverse comments on that approach in the High Court or the Court of Appeal, even though the issue of subsistence was, strictly speaking, not before either of those courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The second case is the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Asia Pacific Publishing Pte Ltd v Pioneers &amp; Leaders (Publishers) Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 4 SLR 381 (“<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span>”), which focused on the requirement of authorship under the Copyright Act. <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> seems to have endorsed the creativity approach espoused by <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>, but its attention does not appear to have been drawn to the <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> line of cases. The plaintiff, Pioneers, produced a horse-racing magazine, <span class="font-italic">Punters’ Way</span>. The defendant, APP, produced a competing publication, <span class="font-italic">Racing Guide</span>. Pioneers alleged that APP infringed its copyright by copying four tables of horse-racing information printed in <span class="font-italic">Punters’ Way</span>. There was also a separate claim against APP for passing off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The tables that were the subject of the appeal contained information on: (a) the competing horses, physical statuses, jockeys, recent performance and the trainers’ strike rates; (b) the choice selection of potential winning horses picked by Pioneers’ tipsters; (c) preparation that the trainers had put the horses through; and (d) detailed accounts of the horses’ pedigree, ownership, and race history. APP’s <span class="font-italic">Racing Guide</span> allegedly reproduced the four tables in a materially similar way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The High Court judge allowed Pioneers’ copyright claim. She found that copyright subsisted in the four tables. They were original because skill and creativity were expended to compile the information in the tables in a manner which made it accessible to readers. The judge also held that a company could be the author of a copyright-protected work. The judge accepted the evidence that there was substantial similarity in the presentation of the information in <span class="font-italic">Punters’ Way</span> and <span class="font-italic">Racing Guide</span>, and granted an injunction restraining APP from infringing Pioneers’ copyright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The judge was reversed on appeal. V K Rajah JA, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, stated that the test of copyright in factual compilations remained the same as for all literary works; the defining characteristic was originality (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [33]). Rajah JA acknowledged that the threshold requirement of originality was “problematic”, and was a question of “fact and degree” to be determined on the facts of the particular case (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [34]). While the Anglo-Australian authorities appeared to place emphasis on the author’s time, labour and effort, many of those cases were decided in the 19th and 20th century, before the proliferation of computers. Those cases may “require reconsideration one day” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In respect of originality and the subsistence of copyright, Rajah JA advanced a tentative proposition that (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here someone has expended effort in creating something that has some literary value, it is worthy of protection, irrespective of the precise quantum of intellectual input involved in producing it or the literary merits or novelty of the work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He cautioned against the practical test that “what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting” (<span class="font-italic">University of London Press, Limited v University Tutorial Press, Limited</span> [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 610) in the case of a factual compilation. Copyright did not protect facts, information or ideas; only the form of expression (which was the product of some creativity) could be protected. He continued as follows (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [37]–[38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 … <span class="font-italic">Similarly, it is not the preparatory efforts or process of gathering facts that is protected. Rather it is the thought effort involved in creating the particular form of expression that is embraced by copyright.</span> Not infrequently, the expression of data, say, through an alphabetical listing, will involve little ingenuity or skill beyond mechanical labour or routine programming. In such matters, it may be difficult to argue that copyright protection is called for.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 In assessing copyright for compilations, in particular, we think it is always profitable to bear in mind the four key principles discerningly summarised in <span class="font-italic">Feist Publications Inc v Rural Telephone Service Company Inc</span> 499 US 340 (1991). First, facts are not copyrightable. Second, compilations of facts, however, are generally copyrightable. Third, the <span class="font-italic">sine qua non</span> of copyright is originality. Fourth, originality simply means that the work was independently created by the author and that it possesses some minimal degree of creativity, the level of creativity required being extremely low …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In relation to authorship, Rajah JA thought that it was clear from the copyright scheme that since the enactment of the Statute of Anne, “the objective of copyright law has been to encourage the creativity of natural authors” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [41]). An analysis of the history of the Copyright Act made it clear that copyright could only be accorded to natural persons, and not corporate bodies; “legal rights flowed only from human authorship” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [67]). Rajah JA also agreed with <span class="font-italic">Te</span><span class="font-italic">lstra (Full Court)</span> that an author “must first be identified before the work in question can be deemed to be original” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [75]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Rajah JA concluded that on the facts, Pioneers had not identified a human author and so, the four tables in <span class="font-italic">Punters’ Way</span> could not be said to be protected by copyright. There was evidence that <span class="font-italic">Punters’ Way</span> was “a continuing project developed from ideas and contributions put forward by the readers and horse racing experts” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [76]). Those ideas and contributions, however, were not protected, since copyright extended only to the final form of expression and not the ideas in the work. He also rejected the argument that Pioneers’ employees were the authors. They were not part of the actual process of compilation because their work was “not collaborative, but was instead merely organised to facilitate the production of the work” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [78]). In this case, the collection, organisation and selection of data was “done by separate people” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [79]). Rajah JA concluded that “in cases involving a high degree of automation, there will be no original work produced for the simple reason that there are no identifiable authors” (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Finally, I touch briefly on <span class="font-italic">RecordTV Pte Ltd v MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2011] 1 SLR 830 (“<span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span>”). Whilst the legal issues raised were quite different, the observations of Rajah JA at [69] are nonetheless helpful:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although copyright law is intended to promote creativity and innovation by granting exclusive rights … there is also a public interest in not allowing copyright law to hinder creativity and innovation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The general point which emerges is that copyright is not just about protecting the commercial interests of the author or copyright owner. It is not even a law of unfair competition. Copyright, where it is held to subsist, is a property right enforceable <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> on a strict liability basis backed up by an impressive armoury of remedies, both civil and criminal. Copyright is not an end in itself. It is a means to an end: benefit to the society as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 The plaintiff argues that both <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> and <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (CA)</span> are conflicting.

In my judgment, not only is the creativity standard required by the Copyright Act and the authorities, it also rests on firm policy justifications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The starting point is s 4 of the Copyright Act, which states that “no copyright shall subsist otherwise than by virtue of [the Copyright] Act”. Section 27(2) makes provision for when copyright subsists in published original literary works:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, where an <span class="font-italic">original</span> <span class="font-italic">literary</span>, dramatic, musical or artistic <span class="font-italic">work</span> has been published —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) copyright shall subsist in the work; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if copyright in the work subsisted immediately before its first publication, copyright shall continue to subsist in the work,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">if, but only if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the first publication of the work took place in Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) the <span class="font-italic">author of the work</span> was a qualified person at the time when the work was first published; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) the author died before that time but was a qualified person immediately before his death.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The express wording of the provision, which mirrors that in Australia, makes clear that the existence of an<span class="font-italic"> </span>original work presupposes an author.

It does not extend to the individual components of the compilation. This is but a natural extension of the correlation between originality and authorship. The individual components of a compilation cannot, in any sensible way, be said to have originated from the author (of the compilation). It is only the author’s selection and arrangement of the individual components that originated from him. This connection is reinforced by the superadded requirement that the compilation constitute an “intellectual creation” before it is protected by copyright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 This position based on the literal reading of the provisions is consistent with and supported by the drafting history of the Copyright Act. Section 7A was introduced by the Copyright (Amendment) Act 1999 (No 38 of 1999) (“the Copyright (Amendment) Act 1999”). Prior to that, the definition of “literary work” was identical to the definition in the Australian Copyright Act (see [109] above) and was expressed to include “a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether or not in a visible form)” (s 7 of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Rev Ed) (“the Copyright Act 1988”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 The 1999 amendments came just three years after the Copyright Treaty 1996 (“the WCT”) maintained by the World Intellectual Property Organization was adopted in Geneva. The resemblance between Art 5 of the WCT and s 7A is unmistakable. Art 5 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Article 5</span><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/>Compilations of Data (Databases)</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Compilations of <span class="font-italic">data</span> or other material, in any form, <span class="font-italic">which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations, are protected as such.</span> This protection does not extend to the data or the material itself and is without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material contained in the compilation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Art 5 of the WCT is in turn almost identical to Art 10(2) of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”), which is found in Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. Art 10(2) of TRIPS has been described as “appear[ing] to emulate the <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> holding” by “requiring a consideration of the selection or arrangement of a database” (Michael Blakeney, <span class="font-italic">Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights: A Concise Guide to the TRIPs Agreement</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1997) at para 4.14). Art 10(2) TRIPS provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196  Art 10(2) in fact is similar to the provision in Art 2(5) of the Berne Convention, which provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Collections of literary or artistic works … which by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 The key differences between Berne Convention and TRIPS for our purposes are (a) the reference in TRIPS to “data or other material”, and (b) the linkage in TRIPS between intellectual creation to selection <span class="font-italic">or</span> arrangement. Carlos M Correa, <span class="font-italic">Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</span> (Oxford University Press, 2007) at p 126 comments that despite the differences, the TRIPS provision on compilations remains within the boundaries of accepted copyright principles as some level of intellectual creation is required. It is said that the drafters of TRIPS were not seduced by the concept promoted at the time of the negotiations by the database industry of expanding (copyright) protection to non-original databases. Yet another commentator, Daniel Gervais, <span class="font-italic">The TRIPS Agreement</span><span class="font-italic">: Drafting History and Analysis</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2008) at para 2.103 comments in respect of Art 10(2) that the mere amassing of huge amounts of data, even at high cost, will not be sufficient if it is not also selected or arranged by an author. Indeed, it must be said that not any selection or arrangement will suffice. It must be sufficient to qualify the compilation as an original work using well-established copyright principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 In my judgment, the introduction of s 7A is consistent with the scope of copyright protection conferred on compilations by <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>. Singapore is not of course bound by <span class="font-italic">Feist</span>, but the creativity standard is entirely consistent with the Berne Convention, TRIPS and the language of section 7A. The 1999 amendments in Singapore came after the <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> decision and on the back of important developments in the global intellectual property environment. The connection between the s 7A of the Copyright Act, and Art 10(2) of the TRIPS agreement and Art 6 of the WCT is seen not just in the focus on selection or arrangement, but also in the express coverage of data.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199  All these provisions stipulate that any copyright in the compilation is separate and distinct from any copyright that may subsist in the material or data. Copyright in the compilation does not extend to the data or material <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. What this means is that a collection of poems may well enjoy copyright as a compilation as a whole by virtue of the effort of selection or arrangement. The copyright in the compilation does not, however, protect the material or data. That said, in appropriate cases, applying established copyright principles, there may well be a separate copyright in the material or data. Data after all can mean many different things. A collection of the best new poems of 2014 may enjoy copyright as a compilation. Each individual poem may also enjoy copyright. What is clear is that s 7A is not mandating a separate copyright in each item of compiled material or data as a matter of course. Whether any item of data or material (that is then compiled) enjoys copyright on its own depends on basic copyright principles. In particular, whether it is an original literary work bearing in mind the distinction between expression and facts or ideas. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 I am fortified in this conclusion by the Court of Appeal’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span>. In my view, Rajah JA expressed a clear preference for the creativity approach and agreed with <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> and <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span>. Whilst it is correct that the Court of Appeal was concerned with authorship, there is no denying the intimate connection between the author, originality and the expression, idea/fact principle of copyright law. Rajah JA also emphasised, albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that with a compilation it was not the effort in collecting or gathering facts that was protected. Rather, it was the intellectual effort in “creating the form of expression” that was (<span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [37]). I do not think that <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> is at odds with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (CA)</span>. The latter case concerned the narrow point of whether leave to appeal ought to be granted. The Court of Appeal thought that there was no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> error of law and thus refused leave. It did not give the issue of what was necessary to cross the threshold of “originality” full consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> series of cases was decided after the 1999 amendments had come into effect. The District Court after citing the new statutory definition of literary work and compilations and analysing the facts, concluded that copyright subsisted in the Street Directory, the street directory vector data and the address point vector data. That said, I note that the primary authority the District Court relied on was the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd</span> [1964] 1 WLR 273 (“<span class="font-italic">Ladbroke</span>”). Whilst that decision is certainly helpful for focusing the question on whether the compilation as a whole is original, it does not, with respect, shed much light on the proper approach to be taken to what is meant by originality and copyright especially post-1999 amendments and the sharpened legislative focus on intellectual creation, selection and arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The brief review of recent English case law subsequent to the amendments driven by the European Union Database Directive is instructive. It will be recalled that the current English position is that whilst a database may be protected as an original work alongside the new <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right, it is necessary to show that the database is original by reason of the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database such that the database is the author’s own intellectual creation. The requirement of intellectual creativity and selection and arrangement means that English law has moved away from “sweat of the brow” and “industrious collection” for databases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 It is true that UK and Europe have introduced a new <span class="font-italic">sui</span><span class="font-italic"> generis</span> database right to protect substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of a database. But it does not follow that our Parliament must have intended copyright to “fill the gap” and recognise and protect “industrious collection” because there is no such right in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204  The explanatory statement to the Copyright (Amendment) Bill 1999 stated that the bill sought, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to address issues arising from the use of copyright material in the digital environment as well as to make further amendments to the Copyright Act to give full effect to TRIPS. This included the new s 7A to clarify that the expression “literary work” includes a compilation of any type of copyright material (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a multimedia work) which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of its contents, constitutes an intellectual creation. Speaking at the second reading of the bill, the then Minister for Law, Professor Jayakumar, explained that s 7A set out a new definition of compilation to ensure protection for multimedia works. These were to be protected provided there was intellectual creation by virtue of selection or arrangement of the contents (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (17 August 1999) vol 70 at cols 2070–2071).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 It is apparent then, that there were two reasons for the 1999 amendments. First, the pre-amendment definition of literary work provided that it included “a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols (whether or not in a visible form)”. The problem was that it was unclear whether compilation was restricted to compilation of works: literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works. Did the definition extend to compilations of works and sound recordings or films (multimedia)? Second, there was the larger question as to whether a compilation of other material (not copyright subject matter), such as pieces of data, was covered. Given the expression/idea and fact dichotomy in copyright some compilations may well comprise collections of facts wherein each collected fact is not protected by copyright as such. To meet these problems and satisfy Singapore’s obligations under TRIPS, the Copyright (Amendment) Act 1999 was passed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 For these reasons, I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s argument that I should augment the statutory requirement of originality to make up for the absence of a <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> database right in Singapore. It is not the role of the court nor does it have the tools to shape the law to extend copyright protection to an entire class of subject matter (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, data) on the basis of substantial investment in the obtaining of information or data. On the creativity view, this is fundamentally at odds with the essence of copyright protection. To do so would be to judicially overrule the clear legislative intent to adopt the creativity view at least where compilations are concerned. Nor do I think it would be beneficial for the court to supplement database protection by augmenting the scope of copyright protection. I have no doubt that in the modern world databases have a tremendous commercial significance and arguments can be raised that it is in the public interest to protect them. But the scope and strength of any new form of database protection (if necessary) must be appropriate. That is a matter best left for Parliament. The protection of databases engages distinct concerns from what copyright was originally concerned with, namely, the protection of artistic expression (see Rajah JA’s remarks in <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [37]–[38]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The point was made earlier that the decision of the Canadian Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">CCH Canadian</span> represents a compromise between the two schools. The Canadian Supreme Court held that copyright (compilation) subsisted in: (a) headnotes of judicial decisions; (b) case summaries of judicial decisions; (c) the topical index in the book <span class="font-italic">Canada GST Cases</span>; and (d) reported judicial decisions. Whether the same decision would have been reached applying the creativity standard is not relevant to the matter before me. That said, I would comment in passing that the headnotes, case summaries and topical index are material to which the author of the compilation has applied intellectual creativity. Substantial judgment (selection and choice) over and above mechanical extraction is likely to be necessary. Leaving aside the actual judgments (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the judicial reasons in themselves) reported judicial decisions comprising the headnotes, case-summary, catch-lines, tables of cases and legislation, the judgment, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, are also likely to pass the creativity standard of originality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 In summary, for a compilation to be protected by copyright under s 27(2) of the Copyright Act, the compiler must exercise sufficient creativity or intellectual effort in the <span class="font-italic">selection or arrangement</span> of the material or data within the compilation. The copyright protection only extends to the original expression in the form of the selection or arrangement of data or material. The compilation copyright does not extend to the composite parts of the compilation, namely the facts or data contained therein.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211  It is noted that aside from the raw subscriber information provided by the service providers, the plaintiff adopted a multi-layered approach in defining the copyright subject matter. At the broadest, each directory as a whole was a compilation. Thereafter the claims were directed towards the collection of listings under any given heading as a compilation in its own right, followed by each individual listing as yet another compilation in its own right. These included the seeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 I pause here to make the comment that there may be a practice of claiming and defining the copyright work in a cascading manner so as to aid proof not just that there is a valid copyright but also to aid infringement. Infringement depends on the substantiality of the material reproduced (copied). Whilst this is a matter of the quality, and not quantity, of what was taken, it stands to reason that a copyist who takes three pages of a five-page article is much more likely to infringe than a copyist who takes three pages of a 500-page textbook. In <span class="font-italic">Hyperion Records Ltd v Warner Music (UK) Ltd</span> (unreported, 17 May 1991) (“<span class="font-italic">Hyperion Records</span>”), a decision of the late Mr Hugh Laddie QC (then sitting as a deputy judge of the English High Court), the copyright action concerned the taking of approximately eight notes from a recording of a medieval chant that lasted some 5 minutes and 18 seconds. The eight notes taken were repeated several times in the allegedly infringing work. The plaintiff claimed copyright in the recording as a whole. It also claimed that the eight-note segment enjoyed copyright in its own right. Mr Laddie QC expressed doubt as to whether all copyright works could be regarded as consisting of copyright in the whole and in an infinite number of sub-divisions. If that was possible it would render the substantiality requirement meaningless (see also Brad Sherman, “What is a Copyright Work?” (2011) 12(1) <span class="font-italic">Theoretical Inquiries in Law</span> 99 at pp 111–114).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Whilst a compilation such as a collection of speeches will comprise a selection and arrangement of a number of discrete works, it cannot be assumed that every part of any compilation is a discrete work in its own right. <span class="font-italic">Hyperion Records</span> rightly underscores the importance of defining and determining with care whether any portion of a work can be excised and treated as a discrete work in its own right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 I also note that whilst the plaintiff claims copyright in each directory as a whole on the basis of selection or arrangement of contents, that the contents of the directories included introductory and other sections quite apart from the actual listings of subscribers. Whilst much has been made of the plaintiff’s works as a whole or as dissected, it is important to bear in mind that <span class="font-italic">there is no suggestion</span><span class="font-italic"> or allegation that the defendant’s directories took anything else aside from the listings</span>. The relevance of this will become clear later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 For convenience, the order that I adopt to address the works in which copyright is claimed and asserted is as follows: (a) the individual listings in the plaintiff’s printed and online directories; (b) the listings arranged within each classification in the Yellow Pages Business and Yellow Pages Consumer or each category within the online directory; (c) the plaintiff’s printed and online directories, each as a whole; and (d) the individual seeds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether copyright subsists in the individual listings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 The plaintiff argues that the “individual listings” in its directories are each “compilations on their own thereby being entitled to copyright” protection.

The form of expression contained in the listings does not meet the requisite level of originality—if there is any originality at all—for copyright protection to be conferred on it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 There is no doubt that the plaintiff has invested painstaking effort and considerable expense in developing procedures, creating software and employing persons to collect, verify and sort subscriber information. It begins with the receipt of subscriber information from the telephone service providers. That information is then synthesised and verified by automated computer software (the SOP module) and manually by the efforts of the Records Maintenance Team. The information is then sorted by the assignment of book codes and main classification headings. This is done by the Records Maintenance Team and DP Info. Advertisements, which allow subscribers to embellish their listings in various ways, are sold by the Records Maintenance Team and the Sales Department, which record the advertisements in the LMS module and COP and CIS modules respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 The collection, verification, enhancement and arrangement of information are time-consuming and expensive. Intellectual effort and human skill and judgment are interspersed at many stages in the process. It requires complex interactions between human actors and sophisticated software. The fruit of that effort is an up-to-date, accurate and well-organised database of subscriber information. But that effort is not what copyright protects. The difficulty is that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of that effort is directed at the <span class="font-italic">particular</span><span class="font-italic"> form of expression</span>: the individual listing. And in my judgment, there can be little, if any at all, intellectual effort or creativity directed towards the expression of a listing in a telephone directory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 I mentioned at [70] above that factual compilations posed a particular problem because they erode the dichotomy between expression on one hand and facts and ideas on the other. There may be greater room for expression where the expression of vector data is concerned, and Prof Ng-Loy’s perceptive remarks are well taken. But in the case of an individual listing in a telephone directory, the fact-expression dichotomy dissolves entirely. The fact is largely coterminous with the expression. A listing in a telephone directory is essentially an entry to provide the user of the directory adequate information about an individual subscriber to enable the user to contact that subscriber. This information must necessarily take the form of the subscriber’s name with any combination of the following fields of information: (a) the subscriber’s address; (b) the subscriber’s telephone number; (c) the subscriber’s email address; or (d) the subscriber’s website. It seems to me inconceivable that the selection or arrangement of any combination of these fields of information to form an individual listing could entail the minimum level of creativity or intellectual effort necessary to make that listing an original work protectable by copyright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 To grant the plaintiff copyright protection over the individual listings would be tantamount to granting the plaintiff copyright in, and thus a monopoly over the use of the bare facts themselves.

</div>
</div> The complaint made relates to the compilations of the listings under each classification heading. Each subscriber is assigned a particular heading under which his listing will appear. There will ordinarily be many listings under any given classification heading. The collection of listings under each classification heading is said to be an original compilation in its own right. I note in passing that there was evidence that the plaintiff from time to time reviewed the classification headings (see [56] above), for example, for the purpose of introducing a new heading or to alter the heading for an existing classification such as “Dental Surgeons” to “Dentists”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 <span class="font-italic">Even if</span> a claim for copyright had been made in respect of each of the specific classification headings, I am of the view that the effort expended fell far short of what is required to meet the requirement of originality. Whilst I do not doubt that some time and intellectual effort was expended on maintaining the classification headings, each classification heading on its own could hardly be regarded as a work in its own right. There may have been some effort in the selection of the categories, but I am not satisfied that there is sufficient effort of selection or labelling such as to constitute the classification heading as an intellectual creation. Indeed, the headings used appear to be common place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 Instead, what is asserted is that the<span class="font-italic"> placement</span> of the listings under each classification heading entailed sufficient effort and judgment such as to make the listings under each heading a protected compilation. In my judgment, copyright does not subsist in the listings selected and arranged within each classification. That is because there was no creativity or intellectual effort in reducing the work (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the individual listings under each classification) to the <span class="font-italic">final form of expression</span>. Any intellectual effort expended by the plaintiff’s employees was directed at the <span class="font-italic">discovery of facts</span> and did not fix upon the selection and arrangement of the listings within the classifications.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 Central to the selection and arrangement of listings into the classifications is the assignment of main classification headings to subscribers. This could happen in one of two ways. First, through matching of main classification headings to new subscribers either by DP Info or the Records Maintenance Team. Second, through the subscriber’s purchase of cross-listings by existing subscribers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">229 In relation to the first aspect, the assignment of main classification headings to new subscribers was done manually by the Records Maintenance Team prior to 2006, and thereafter outsourced to DP Info (see [39] above). DP Info successfully assigned main classification headings to approximately 82% of the new subscribers each year.

One of these was the classified listings of subscribers. There was also other front matter and introductory material. Each Yellow Pages directory also had special segments devoted to certain classes or categories of products. In the Yellow Pages Business, for example, there was a segment known as the “Trade-name Listings” which featured various advertisers. In the Yellow Pages Consumer, there was a segment known as the “Verticals”, which contained editorials or advertorials on certain specially selected topics, such as “After Hours” or “Lifestyle”. There was evidence that a substantial degree of intellectual effort went into the determination of the topic and contents for the Verticals in each year’s directory.

</div> There are, however, two difficulties with this position. First, the plaintiff’s pleadings do not make any reference whatsoever to the Trade-name Listings or the Verticals or other introductory and forward material, much less plead that these segments formed a part of the directories as a compilation. Second, and more fundamentally, the plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant reproduced parts of the directories other than the various listings in the classifications. I have no doubt that each Yellow Pages directory, comprising the introductory material, specialist segments, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, as well the listings under the classification headings is likely to pass muster as an original compilation. But there is no assertion that the defendant copied any of the introductory material, the Trade-name listings or the Verticals. The plaintiff’s allegation of infringement is limited to the defendant’s taking of information about the subscribers and the listings found in the classified listings of the subscribers. Indeed, the plaintiff submits that the legal issues engaged relate to works which “consist of information that largely comprise subscriber listings and enhancements made to the listings”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Assuming for the moment that copyright subsists in each Yellow Pages directory as a whole (including the introductory material, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), copyright is only infringed if there has been copying of a substantial part of the protected work. Substantiality depends on the quality of the material copied, not quantity alone. It is well established that quality in this context is primarily tested against whether the defendant has copied or taken the parts of the work which contribute towards the finding of originality. In short, merely to copy parts of the work which are not original to the work is not substantial copying. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 Thus in <span class="font-italic">Ladbroke</span>, Lord Pearce stated that the reproduction of a part of a work which by itself has no originality would not normally be regarded as a substantial part of the copyright work (at 293):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The reproduction of a part which by itself has no originality will not normally be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore not be protected. For that which would not attract copyright except by reason of its collocation will, when robbed of that collocation, not be a substantial part of the copyright and therefore the courts will not hold its reproduction to be an infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Flamelite (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Lam Heng Chung and others</span> [2001] 3 SLR (R) 610 at [37]. A similar conclusion was reached in <span class="font-italic">Warwick Film Productions Ltd v Eisinger</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [1969] Ch 508. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 That being so, even if there is copyright in the Yellow Pages Directory as a whole (including the introductory material, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>), a defendant who copies just the listings may not infringe unless there is a finding that the listings themselves copied contributed to the originality—in this case, as an intellectual creation by reason of selection or arrangement. Indeed in the US case of <span class="font-italic">Bell</span><span class="font-italic">south</span> the defendant conceded that the directory as a whole enjoyed copyright. What was in issue was whether the defendant had infringed the copyright in the yellow pages directory by taking the plaintiff’s original selection, coordination or arrangement. It will be recalled that US Court of Appeals found that infringement had not taken place despite the fact that a considerable amount of material (including listings) had been taken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 This then collapses back into the second characterisation that the Yellow Pages directory as a whole refers to the entire compilation of all the individual listings under all the classification headings within each entire directory, since there is no allegation that anything other than that has been copied. In this respect, the plaintiff argues that there was sufficient originality in the selection and arrangement of the contents of both Yellow Pages directories, such that they each constituted intellectual creations that were protected by copyright. The originality is said to arise from the Classification Committee’s/Marketing Department’s choices as to which classifications to include in each of the Yellow Pages directories.

</div> With respect, this puts the question the wrong way around. A compilation of data can be creatively selected and arranged precisely to enable it to perform its function of conveying information to the reader with ease. The question is whether the function of the work dictates the form of expression such that there can be no creativity in the expression of the work (see <span class="font-italic">Bellsouth Publishing</span> at 1442). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Here, the choice of what classifications to include in which directory presented the Marketing Department with a field of discretion. For example, the line between business-to-business listings (which were placed in the Yellow Pages Business) and business-to-consumer listings (which were placed in the Yellow Pages Consumer) was not an entirely clear one. It is not self-evident which directory the classifications “Marble-Synthetic” and “Marble-Natural” should belong to. The Marketing Department had to make decisions as to which of the two Yellow Pages directories these classifications should appear in.

</div> Such choices required intellectual effort and judgment. Various factors including user-experience were considered. This would have entailed conceptualising what a user of each of these directories would find useful, and selecting the content to meet the needs of that user.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 Whilst I do not pretend that the decision was easy, in my judgment, the intellectual effort in the selection of the classifications to be included in each of the Yellow Pages directories possessed the requisite creativity to qualify the compilation in each directory of classifications and listings as a whole for copyright protection. The protection conferred on it, however, is a “thin” one (see <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> at 1290). The copyright does not protect the individual listings, the individual listings within the classification or even the individual classifications themselves. It is limited to the plaintiff’s selection and arrangement of the various classifications and listings within each of the Yellow Pages directories as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 The defendant takes a further objection to the subsistence of copyright in the Yellow Pages directories as a whole. There are no identifiable authors or joint-authors because the process was largely automated and any compilation was carried out by the COM module rather than any human.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 I am not convinced by this objection. It is well established that the mere fact that a literary work is reduced into its final form of expression through the instrumentality of computer software does not in itself divorce the work’s origination from the person operating the machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 In <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers plc v Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo plc and others</span> [1985] FSR 306 (“<span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers</span>”), the plaintiff newspaper publisher devised a competition, which comprised a grid containing letter sequences. The defendants allegedly copied the grid and letter sequences into their publications. The defendants argued that there was no author because the grids and letter sequences were produced by a computer which had been programmed by Mr Ertel, the person tasked to create the grid and letter sequences. Whitford J rejected this argument and held that the computer was to Mr Ertel what a pen was to a writer (at 310):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The computer was no more than the tool by which the varying grids of five-letter sequences were produced to the instructions, via the computer programs, of Mr Ertel. It is as unrealistic as it would be to suggest that, if you write your work with a pen, it is the pen which is the author of the work rather than the person who drives the pen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 The same point was made by a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court</span>). Perram J said at [118] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So long as the person controlling the program can be seen as directing or fashioning the material form of the work there is no particular danger in viewing that person as the work’s author.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The crucial question is the degree of <span class="font-italic">control</span> that the putative authors exercise over the computer software in shaping the final form of expression (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> at [118] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Perram J; at [166] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Yates J). In <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Full Court)</span> there were no authors because the persons in control of the software were not involved in “shaping or guiding the material form of the directories”. This was a natural consequence of the first instance court’s finding that the Rules dictated the final form of expression of the directories, and any discretion given to the employees in the directory production process was not a true discretion, but rather, a discretion to ensure the Rules were complied with (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (First Instance)</span> at [124]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 The case here, however, is different. The members of the Marketing Department dictated the final selection of the compilation in the form of the Yellow Pages directories by determining the extraction criteria for each of the directories. The IT Department was the bridge between the members of the Marketing Department and the COM module. As the defendant itself submits, “it is clear that, all that IT did was to implement the ideas of the Marketing Department and did not exercise any intellectually creative authorial choice”.

</div> That was because the intellectual activity or creativity in fashioning the content of the Yellow Pages directories was exercised by the members of the Marketing Department, and <span class="font-italic">not</span> the IT Department or the COM module.

The facts of <span class="font-italic">Fylde Microsystems</span> are far-removed from those at present. The plaintiff in that case produced printed circuit boards loaded with software for use in portable radios. The defendant was the sole importer of a particular design and make of radio hardware. The plaintiff developed a printed circuit board and software for the defendant’s mobile radio. As the business relationship developed, the plaintiff stopped pre-loading the printed circuit boards with the software, but sent the software to the defendant for the latter to upload itself. The defendant used the plaintiff’s software to programme printed circuit boards that were not bought from the plaintiff, but from another manufacturer. The plaintiff sued for copyright infringement. The defendant argued that it was a joint author of the computer software because its employee had spent substantial time and effort assisting with the troubleshooting and perfecting of the software.

In the plaintiff’s pleadings, the focus appears to be only on the compilation of the entirety of the listings in the Business Listings. In its closing submissions, however, the plaintiff states that the Business Listings as a compilation would typically include multiple segments such as:

First and foremost, there is no allegation that the defendant has copied anything apart from the listings in the Business Listings, as is the case with the Yellow Pages directories, which I have discussed at [238] above. Second, it does not appear that there is any evidence on who was responsible for the selection and arrangement of the multiple segments in the Business Listings, nor does it appear that there is any evidence on the process through which that was done. Further, at least some of the multiple segments such as Emergency Telephone Numbers, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, appear to be routine and commonplace.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 The difficulty with the position taken in the plaintiff’s pleadings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that copyright subsists in the compilation of the listings in their entirety) is a more fundamental one. Laying aside the requirement of authorship for a moment, the plaintiff has not established how the selection and arrangement of the listings in the Business Listings as a compilation meets the requisite threshold of originality necessary for copyright protection to attach. There was no creativity involved in reducing the Business Listings to its final form of expression as a compilation. The Business Listings, a whole-of-the-universe directory, is, by definition, exhaustive. The Business Listings derived its purposefulness and efficacy not from the selection of the individual business subscriber’s data to be included in the compilation, but from the lack of it. The alphabetical arrangement of the individual listings within the Business Listings is also commonplace. Like in <span class="font-italic">Fe</span><span class="font-italic">ist</span>, there is nothing creative about the selection and arrangement of the individual listings within the compilation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 The plaintiff relies on what is known as the “Sort_PLA” rules to show how its employees could still “exercise authorial decisions” even <span class="font-italic">within</span> the scheme of an alphabetical arrangement.

</div> The result of the Sort_PLA entry is that the listing “7-11 Pte Ltd” would be arranged in alphabetical order together with the listings starting with the letter “S” instead of the digit “7”. Similarly, the listing “3 @ 11 Pte Ltd” would be arranged together with the listings starting with the letter “T” instead of the digit “3”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Mr Anil Kumar, who worked in the plaintiff’s IT Department from 1998 to 2012, and who was the Director of IT from 2009, gave evidence on the function or purpose of the Sort-_PLA rules. He said that it was to prevent subscribers from “tak[ing] advantage” of the alphabetical system:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A. I only meant subscriber himself, sometimes they want to have their listing to go on top, they may come with funny, funny names to put on the top.

But I do not think it crosses the requisite threshold of creativity to make the arrangement of the listings original. The Sort-_PLA rules are in no way a departure from the age-old method of alphabetical arrangement. Quite the contrary, they are predicated upon and intended to reinforce the alphabetical selection by ensuring that the alphabetical approach to arrangement is not upset by rogue, or in the words of Mr Kumar, “funny” listings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 The requirement of authorship is also problematical.

</div> there does not appear to be any evidence showing that they expended any intellectual effort or made any authorial choices to determine the selection and arrangement of the listings.

It was initiated and completed by applying the COM module to the compilation database.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Indeed, the plaintiff’s Mr Kumar gave evidence that the compilation of the Business Listings had nothing to do with classifications; it was a straightforward alphabetical arrangement of all the subscribers in the plaintiff’s master database.

</div> These differences include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Under the plaintiff’s agreement with SingTel, it had the discretion to determine which subscribers to exclude (see [26] above). Rural, on the other hand, was required to publish all the names and telephone numbers of its subscribers as determined by the Kansas Corporation Commission. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) SingTel had the right to object if the content or appearance of the Business Listings did not comply with relevant laws in Singapore, or departed materially from the format, content or appearance of the immediate previous edition, which departure affected the usability or efficiency of the directories. This meant that the plaintiff had “room to maneuver [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in the creation of the Business Listings”. Rural, on the other hand, published <span class="font-italic">all</span> the data provided by its subscribers. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff’s employees categorised and enhanced the data. Rural, on the other hand, published only the names and telephone numbers given by its subscribers.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The plaintiff had the <span class="font-italic">option</span> to “priority sort” listings (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by placing advertisers “in front, or in front of each alphabet”), although this was not done. The alphabetical arrangement of the listings was also affected by revisions to the sorting rules. Rural, on the other hand, listed the data from subscribers alphabetically by surname.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 In my judgment, these differences between the present case and <span class="font-italic">Feist</span> are nothing to the point. None overcome the lack of originality or the absence of any identifiable author(s) in the directory compilation process. Distinction (a) does not involve intellectual effort or creativity directed at the final form of expression (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the compilation of listings in the Business Listings). Distinction (b) is not relevant and in fact undermines the plaintiff’s case that it has an unguided hand in deciding how to select and arrange the listings in the Business Listings. Distinction (c) collapses into the plaintiff’s argument that it is entitled to copyright in the individual listings, which I have addressed and dismissed above. Distinction (d) relates to the Sort_PLA rules (which I have addressed at [265] above) and is also factually inaccurate—nowhere in the evidence was it suggested that “priority sorting” was considered for the arrangement of listings in the Business Listings. On the evidence of the plaintiff’s own witnesses, priority sorting was considered and implemented <span class="font-italic">only</span> for the 2005 edition of the Yellow Pages Consumer. There is nothing that suggests it was ever contemplated for the Business Listings.

The online directory is published daily using its own extraction criteria. A data file called the Web Daily Data is generated daily from the plaintiff’s master database. From here, the content of the data file is transferred into the search engine database where it is indexed and optimised for searching by users.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 It is not exactly clear as to what the plaintiff means by the online directory. It is not the master database—that much is clear. Does it refer to the Web Daily Data or the search engine database? The evidence is that the listings in the online directory mirrored the classifications in the Yellow Pages directories. That said, the online directory has an additional unique categorisation system enabling drill-downs and sub-categories. The online directory was also said to include various keywords and filters to assist the user. What remains unclear is whether these keywords and filters, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, to improve user experience was part of the search engine (computer program), the online directory, or both. Indeed, the evidence suggests that the actual form in which the online directory appears to the user on-screen when a search is made depends on the user’s choice of key words or filters or search terms. It may be thought that the keywords and filters were part of the computer program. Nevertheless, the parties did not draw any distinction between the database and the search engine.

First, in the control they exercised over the maintenance and introduction of new category headings.

One example Mr Tsoi gave was a request that the category “fusion food” be introduced. Mr Tsoi gave evidence that he was adamant the category not be permitted because it would affect the usability of the online directory:

In doing so, the Online Team helmed by Mr Tsoi controlled the categories present in the Online Directory, they determined the appropriate depth of the drill-down menus, and they also set in place filter parameters by reconstructing or “imagining” the user’s thought process.

</div> Whilst the answer may be said to be self-serving, I am on balance, but with one reservation, in agreement that the online directory as a whole is an original compilation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 The reservation is that there is no evidence before me as to how many changes, if any, would be made to the Online Directory on a daily basis. It is said that the online directory was updated daily. It was the most up-to-date of the plaintiff’s directories. If there were new subscribers or changes to existing subscribers, the information from the telephone service providers, after being received and processed, would be reflected in the appropriate classification in the online directory well before the printed directories. But as noted already, there is no copyright in the subscriber data as such. Whether there were other daily changes such as new sub-categories or keywords, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, is unclear. But it seems unlikely that these would be made on a daily or a frequent basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 It is perhaps for this reason that the defendant argues that copyright does not subsist in the online directory because it was not reduced into material form.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 In my judgment, the defendant’s argument misses the point. The problem with digital databases which are updated or revised daily (to greater or lesser extent) is not so much a matter of reduction to material form. Material form does not require that the material record must endure for any particular length of time. A hand-written note that is incinerated may still be a material form into which the note was reduced. The real problem is the difficulty with establishing that there are sufficient changes (day-to-day or week-to-week, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>) to make each daily version of the online directory an original literary work in its own right. To give a simple example, if on Day 185, the plaintiff adds five new subscribers under the appropriate headings, this will not be sufficient to cloak the Day 185 online directory as a new original literary work. More must be done. But a defendant who copies (for example) the whole of the Day 185 online directory will be indirectly copying the Day 184 online directory, which is in turn a copy of the Day 183 online directory and so on. So long as the plaintiff can show on a balance of probabilities that there is indirect copying of a substantial part of the online directory that is an original work, copyright infringement will arise. Copying, for purpose of copyright law, includes indirect copying; the copying of a copy of an original is still a copy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether copyright subsists in the seeds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">289 The seeds were false entries deliberately introduced into the plaintiff’s directories to detect instances of copying.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 It is clear that the purpose of including seeds was to facilitate proof of copying. The difficulty for the plaintiff, however, is that copyright is not a simple law against copying. The defendant can copy whatever he likes as long as the copied material is not protected by copyright, or some other right. The defendant does not deny referencing the plaintiff’s directories for information on subscribers and listings. They do not deny copying some of the seeds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 The first hurdle is for the plaintiff to show that the seeds enjoy copyright, either individually or as a compilation of seeds. Each seed contains a fictitious subscriber. According to Ms Koh, the telephone numbers of the seeds belonged to the plaintiff; according to Ms Toh, they were fictitious. The address and postal code numbers for each of the seeds belonged to the plaintiff. The problem in conferring copyright on very short “works” such as titles, slogans and names is well-known. In order for these to be protected, they must be an original <span class="font-italic">work</span>. Whilst it may be said that a fictitious name (or newly coined word or phrase) is original simply because it is a figment of a person’s imagination and not copied, this alone is not enough to make the same an original <span class="font-italic">work</span>. Some names may be protected as a species of artistic work, but there is no claim to artistic work copyright in the present case. Outside of copyright, slogans and names may sometimes be protected under trade mark law or by the law of passing off. The question is when, if ever, it is appropriate to treat a piece of writing comprising a fictitious name, an address and phone number as an original <span class="font-italic">literary</span> <span class="font-italic">work</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 A literary work is generally regarded as a work expressed in print or writing for the purpose of providing information, pleasure or instruction. The defendant argues that more than a <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> amount of information is necessary. A quick review of case law reveals the considerable difficulty that the courts have had in deciding whether a name or slogan or title qualifies for copyright protection:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Maxwell v Hogg</span> (1866-67) 2 LR Ch App 307, <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> to the effect that there is no copyright in the title “Belgravia” for a magazine;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Francis Day and Hunter v Twentieth Century Fox</span> [1940] AC 112, no copyright in the title “The Man who broke the Bank at Monte Carlo”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Kirk v Fleming</span> (1928-35) MacG Cop Cas 44, no copyright in the slogan “Goodsight is your most valued asset.

The closer the phrase comes to an obvious description, or a hackneyed phrase, or a common expression, the less the room for originality. Then again, it does not follow that if the word or phrase is newly coined that it must qualify as an original literary work, although this will help. It has been suggested in <span class="font-italic">Exxon</span> that there may be cases where a single word or title, which is too short to attract copyright on its own, may be of such significance to the larger work of which it forms a part that to copy it will be to take a substantial part of the larger work, which does enjoy copyright. The problem, however, is this approach may provide what is in effect back door protection for that which cannot be directly protected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 <span class="font-italic">Shetland Times</span> was an interlocutory decision on the back of a concession by the defendant that a headline could be a literary work. <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers</span> involved a competition based on a 5x5 grid of 25 letters against which subscribers matched a sequence of five random letters which they received. A prize was won if the sequence matched. Copyright was held to subsist on the 25-letter grid and the winning sequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 In the<span class="font-italic"> Sunlec</span> case, the slogan was used in connection with a portable electrical wire marking gadget. The evidence was that a snappy memorable phrase was devised to describe the usefulness of the gadget. After considering a number of options the slogan was chosen. Wylie J sitting in the New Zealand High Court rightly stressed the principle that there was no requirement of literary merit for a work to qualify as a literary work. Neither was there any principle that a slogan or title could never qualify as a work simply because it was a mere slogan or title. After all, an award-winning short poem might be used as an advertising slogan tomorrow. Wylie J held that the slogan was a product of intellectual effort and judgment. The words offered information. The slogan was accordingly an original literary work: the words were used in a succinct and relatively memorable way and according to Wylie J, the phrase was not hackneyed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 In my judgment, each individual seed does not qualify as an original literary work. In coming to this conclusion I do not doubt that some effort was expended and that the seeds served a useful purpose of providing the fingerprints of copying. But it is not enough simply to prove that the seed has value or utility. That is not the law of copyright. The amendments made in 1999 and the earlier discussion of the case law on factual compilations has served to place renewed emphasis on the importance of creativity. The observations of French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in <span class="font-italic">Ice </span><span class="font-italic">TV</span> at [28] bear repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Copyright does not protect facts or information. Copyright protects the particular form of expression of the information … That facts are not protected is a crucial part of the balancing of competing policy considerations in copyright legislation. The information/expression dichotomy in copyright law is rooted in considerations of social utility. Copyright, being an exception to the law’s general abhorrence of monopolies does not confer a monopoly on facts or information because to do so would impede the reading public’s access to and use of facts and information. Copyright is not given to reward work distinct from the production of a particular form of expression.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 In the present case, I am of the view that there is insufficient skill in devising the individual seeds to qualify them for copyright protection. Each seed is nothing more than the name, address and telephone number of a fictitious subscriber. Even assuming the telephone number was fictitious, the address was a real one belonging to the plaintiff. Earlier, I held that there is no copyright in each individual listing. The only difference with the seeds is that the names and telephone numbers are fictitious. This falls well short in my view of casting the seeds as an original literary work. I note in passing that the evidence is clear that the efforts to make changes to the seeds each year were to assist pinpointing the actual volume from which the seed was taken. The changes made were small and wholly insufficient to recast each updated seed as an original literary work even if the start seed was an original literary work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 Finally, I am unable to agree with the plaintiff’s assertion that the totality of seeds constitutes an original compilation. It is not clear what the plaintiff means by this: all the seeds together as an original compilation or the seeds as part of the entire compilation of listings? A “compilation” is defined as a compilation of material which by reason of the selection or arrangement of its contents constitutes an intellectual creation. Whilst the term “compilation” is not defined in the Copyright Act, it means in this context a collection of works or material that has been assembled together. The coherence and assembly is reflected in the need for sufficient selection or arrangement such as to constitute the collection as an intellectual creation. In my judgment, even if the seeds were put together as a collection, there is insufficient basis for me to conclude that the “collection” constitutes an intellectual creation for the purposes of the Copyright Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 To be clear, even if I am wrong and there is copyright in the seeds that have been copied, this does not mean that the defendant is <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> liable for infringing copyright in the other works claimed by the plaintiff. The defendant does not deny copying the seeds. Earlier I held that there is no copyright in the individual listings or the compilation of listings under each heading or classification. If there is copyright it is confined to the directories as a whole as discussed earlier. To infringe, what must be proven is that a substantial part of the directories as a whole has been taken. This is considered next, after a consideration of the defendant’s business processes.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendant’s business processes and how the defendant’s directories are produced</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An overview of the defendant’s operations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 The defendant is a smaller company than the plaintiff and its operations are significantly less sophisticated.

He was the founder of the defendant’s predecessor, Promedia International Pte Ltd (“Promedia International”), in 1980.

Each SOP generally ranged from one to ten pages in length, and often contained illustrations of the aspects of the processes they sought to govern. For example, the SOPs governing the procedures for telephone verification included scripted lines and responses for various contingencies that the caller may be presented with. SOPs setting out instructions for the operation of web applications were accompanied by illustrated screenshots depicting the computer interface the employees would encounter. The defendant maintained an impressive number of SOPs in its operations, which numbered in the thousands. There was an index sheet to keep track of the SOPs which ran into 55 pages, with approximately 65 SOPs indexed on each page.

Fifth, the defendant’s selection and arrangement of the individual listings within its directories. The evidence for each of these processes came almost exclusively from Mr Teo.

</div> Mr Teo, however, did not point to any documents setting out this alleged second stage in the delivery order procedure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 This leads to the second point. It is incongruous that Mr Teo, who ran the defendant’s business in a detailed and systematic manner, and documented in the form of SOPs almost every process which could conceivably be documented, would order the destruction of the delivery orders in a haphazard and undocumented manner. Subscriber information is the lifeblood of a telephone directory; Mr Teo’s evidence was to the effect that the defendant’s foremost source of subscriber information was the delivery orders. If these delivery orders were so essential to the defendant’s operations, I doubt they would have been destroyed in an undocumented fashion, in the context of how scrupulously planned and documented the defendant’s other processes were. There was nothing in the documents which cohered with Mr Teo’s explanation. The defendant points to an SOP in its closing submissions to support Mr Teo’s position, but this is equivocal at best.

The evidence on this is very thin. But in my judgment, it is more likely that only the listings section from the Business Listings were photocopied or scanned. This inference follows naturally from the defendant’s stated purpose of the photocopying or scanning exercises, which was to compare the <span class="font-italic">listing information</span> in the Business Listings with that in the defendant’s database. There is no evidence (nor is it alleged by the plaintiff) that <span class="font-italic">other</span> sections of the Business Listings, such as the front matter or introductory material, were photocopied or scanned. Indeed, it would have been senseless or illogical for the defendant to do so, since all that was useful to the defendant was the listing information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 I therefore conclude that information from the Business Listings also formed a key source of data for the defendant’s master database. While I accept that the defendant’s independent data collection efforts were a substantial source of the defendant’s information, they were insufficient to cope with the demands for accurate and up-to-date information that the publication of a telephone directory necessitated. The defendant thus had to supplement its data collection efforts with the information from the plaintiff’s directories.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Data verification and updating</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">337 The defendant’s SOPs were also replete with instances where the plaintiff’s directories were used to verify or ensure the accuracy of the information the defendant had collected.

It required the defendant’s employees to access the plaintiff’s online directory and compare the classifications used by the plaintiff with those used in the defendant’s directories. The defendant’s employees further had to list down any additional classifications that were assigned to companies in the plaintiff’s online directory, which did not have similar classifications in the defendant’s directories.

So we cannot rely on the Yellow Pages to introduce our new classification [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”.

</div> While the Yellow Pages generally assigned each subscriber to only one classification, the Green Book sought to assign each subscriber to multiple classifications which best matched the entire gamut of goods and services that the subscriber had to offer.

So ‘Vacuum Equipment &amp; System’ can refer to many [types] of vacuum equipment. That is a very general classification. So Green Book has done their own independent research, we approach Avac System and ask them in detail, what are the specific products that they sell. So we find out from Avac System that they sell all these other products: blowers, filters, gauges, and they sell different kinds of pumps. They have other products that they sell. So you can see that, in this example, right, Green Book classification is different, and we do not follow the classification from the Yellow Pages. And this classification, like ‘Gauges: Vacuum’, you will not find it in the Yellow Pages. ‘Meters Vacuum’, the ‘Pump: Chemical’, ‘Pumps: Rotary’, ‘Pumps: Vane’, ‘Vacuum Fittings’, ‘Vacuum Pumps’, this classification will not be available in the Yellow Pages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">347 Mr Teo’s evidence that the Yellow Pages classifications were only used as a starting point for further research into more sub-divided and specialised classifications is also borne out by the defendant’s SOPs.

The lion’s share of the defendant’s market intelligence efforts was directed at identifying companies which advertised in other directories and so were more likely to advertise in the defendant’s directories. In short, the defendant took note of the more aggressive advertisers in competitor directories so that its own sales staff could approach these subscribers with sales canvasses for advertisements in the defendant’s own directories.

</div> This SOP contained step-by-step instructions for the defendant’s employees to log down advertisers in the Yellow Pages directories. These included recording the advertisement’s “ad size”, its “MC Size Rating”, its “MC Class No” and the page of the relevant directory that it appeared on. The “MC Size Rating” was a scale that the defendant devised to record the size of the companies’ advertisements in other directories. There were four ratings: “A”, for “Advertisement”; “B”, for “Box Advertisement”; “C”, for “Bold Listing”; and “D”, for “Ordinary Listing”. The “MC Class No” was the number code that was allotted to the particular classification that the listing was found in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 The SOP also instructed the defendant’s employees to “[a]mend whatever fields required”. This was presumably an instruction to amend the company’s listing information in the defendant’s master database if it differed from that in the Yellow Pages Business or Yellow Pages Consumer. Mr Teo said in cross-examination that any information that was amended or updated this way would be subsequently verified by the defendant’s employees.

</div> The fact that Mr Teo had been able to coordinate a data collection exercise on such a large scale is testament to his industry and meticulousness, which I alluded to earlier. Through this industry and meticulousness, Mr Teo also came to develop a keen understanding of the plaintiff’s directories and how they operated.

For its printed directories, the defendant usually excluded all “D” rated companies.

He could stipulate, for example, that the defendant’s printed directories for a year would include 100% of “A” rated companies, 100% of “B” rated companies, 50% of “C” rated companies and 0% of “D” rated companies. Mr Teo fine-tuned these percentages based on the final page count of the defendant’s printed directories each year, so as to manage printing costs.

</div> For the defendant’s digital and online directories, however, where space was not a constraint, the extraction criteria were less restrictive, and included “D” rated companies. This approach to the extraction criteria explains the apparent aberration that none of the plaintiff’s seeds appeared in the defendant’s printed directories. The seeds, being dummy listings, were necessarily “D” rated companies with no advertisement expenditure. They were thus passed over in extraction for inclusion into the defendant’s printed directories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">360 The defendant’s extraction and selection criteria thus differed markedly from the plaintiff’s (whether the printed directories or the online directory). Whilst the plaintiff’s directories appeared to prize inclusivity and exhaustiveness, the defendant’s directories (<span class="font-italic">especially</span> the printed directories) were built around potential advertisement revenue. The defendant had no qualms about leaving out of its printed directories companies which it thought would likely not advertise in them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">361 In summary, these are my findings on the defendant’s business processes:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant took efforts to collect data from multiple independent third-party sources (at [311]–[325] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant also relied on the Business Listings to supplement its independent data collection efforts (at [326]–[332] above). For some of these exercises, the Business Listings were photocopied and scanned.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The scanned copies of the Business Listings were stored in a temporary database to enable the defendant’s staff to verify those listings before they were entered into or merged with the defendant’s master database (at [334] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The evidence on what exactly was photocopied or scanned is very thin, but there is no evidence which suggests that the Business Listings was photocopied or scanned in its entirety (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, including introductory material). Instead, it is more likely that only the subscriber listings were photocopied and scanned. This inference follows naturally from the stated purpose of the photocopying and scanning exercises, which was to compare the listing information to that in the defendant’s master database (at [335] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) There was extensive use of the plaintiff’s directories in verification and updating of the information in the defendant’s master database (at [337] above). The defendant generally required any information that was taken from the plaintiff’s directories to be independently verified through telephone calls or against other online sources (at [338] above). This was, however, not always complied with by the defendant’s employees, as evidenced by errant SOPs (at [339] above) and the fact that seeds were found in the defendant’s directories.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The defendant used the classifications in the plaintiff’s directories as reference points to do further research into new classifications (at [342] above). But ultimately the classificatory approaches in both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s directories were different.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The defendant conducted extensive market intelligence on advertisers in the plaintiff’s directories and other directories. The defendant had painstakingly built up a database on various companies and their advertising habits (at [350]–[355] above). In the course of conducting this market intelligence, the defendant also concurrently updated the information in its master database.

</div> Once copying has been established, any further side-by-side comparison is inappropriate when addressing the question of whether what was copied is a substantial part of the plaintiff’s work. In view of the defendant’s SOPs and admissions made by Mr Teo, there is an abundance of evidence showing that the defendant copied the plaintiff’s works in a “quotidian, systematic and accretive method”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No 6) at para 12.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is apparent that the fact of photocopying or scanning emerged only during the trial. In my judgment, this pleading is sufficient to cover the point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">368 I am satisfied the acts of photocopying and scanning the Business Listings constituted unauthorised reproductions despite the fact that the database produced was just a temporary database. The question as to whether this amounts to a substantial taking, which is necessary to establish copyright infringement, is a far trickier matter. If the defendant had scanned in the whole of the Business Listings including all the introductory material, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, then clearly there would infringement; I have noted that it is doubtless that copyright subsists in the Business Listings as a whole, including the front matter and introductory material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">369 The question, however, is whether there is substantial taking when <span class="font-italic">only</span> the listings (albeit in their entirety) were photocopied or scanned without the other material. Each individual listing does not enjoy copyright on its own. There is no selection of the listings in the Business Listings, which, as a whole-of-the-universe directory, prizes exhaustiveness. The sorting and arrangement of the listings into alphabetical format (as described earlier) is obvious and requires little ingenuity or intellectual effort. To be clear, originality does not require inventiveness. Nevertheless, I am of the view that the portions of the Business Listings that were reproduced by the defendant, although voluminous, were not substantial in the copyright sense. Not an iota of originality rested in the material that the defendant reproduced. All that was taken by the defendant was the facts that constituted the listings. What may have made the Business Listings original as a whole was the selection and arrangement of the listings <span class="font-italic">together with</span> the other material such as lists of emergency phone numbers; important/useful numbers; Government and quasi-government listings, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>. It has not been alleged, much less established, that the defendant’s directories reproduced such material. For this reason, I find that the defendant’s photocopying or scanning of the entirety of the listings in the Business Listings did not amount to copyright infringement. I emphasise that the plaintiff’s claim is based on infringement of copyright in the Business Listings as a <span class="font-italic">literary work</span>. There is no claim to infringement of any publisher’s right which would subsist in the Business Listings, by virtue of the typeset and layout, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, under ss 86 and 91 of the Copyright Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">370 In reaching this conclusion, I am aware of the English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Waterlow Directories Limited v Reed Information Services Limited</span> [1992] FSR 409 (“<span class="font-italic">Waterlow Directories</span>”), where Aldous J found a strong case of substantial copying when 1,600 out of 12,600 entries were copied by the defendant into a computer from the plaintiff’s directory. The plaintiff in that case published a legal directory containing the name and addresses of firms of solicitors and barristers. The defendant produced a similar directory. In order to update its directory, the defendant compared it with the plaintiff’s and highlighted those entries which did not appear in the defendant’s. The highlighted entries were copied into a computer and used to generate invitations to the lawyers to appear in the defendant’s directory. Aldous J held that the act of copying into the computer amounted to reproduction (<span class="font-italic">Waterlow Directories</span> at 417). He found that there was a strong case that the amount copied was a substantial part of the copyright work, and granted the interlocutory relief that the plaintiff sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">371 It seems to me, however, that the <span class="font-italic">Waterlow</span><span class="font-italic"> Directories </span>decision came on the back of the defendant’s concession that the legal directory was original. In determining substantiality, there was little discussion of the nature of the originality, which is, in turn, an important matter when determining whether there has been a substantial taking. For this reason, the <span class="font-italic">Waterlow</span><span class="font-italic"> Directories</span> decision—as representing the industrious collection approach to originality and factual compilations—sits uneasily with the<span class="font-italic"> Feist</span> decision of the US Supreme Court, the <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> decision of the High Court of Australia and the <span class="font-italic">Telstra</span> decision of a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, discussed above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">372 In respect of the Yellow Pages and online directories, all that has been established is the referencing of information in the listings or classifications for the defendant’s use. Some of the listings were copied by the defendant without any further verification. But whether or not verification was done by the defendant is immaterial. I have found that copyright does not subsist in these individual listings or the classifications, and so there can be no infringement from copying this information. Copyright protects the final form of expression, and not the underlying facts or data contained within that form of expression. Painstaking and laborious though the plaintiff’s efforts at collecting that data may have been, it is not protected by copyright. At a higher level of abstraction, I am satisfied that there were sufficient differences in the defendant’s method of selecting and arranging the material in its directories, such that it did not reproduce a substantial part of the aspects of the plaintiff’s Yellow Pages and online directories that I found to have contributed towards originality in the Yellow Pages and online directories as a whole. Whilst the defendant may have noted or recorded (as part of their research) new classification headings or headings which did not appear in the Green Book, this is not in my view sufficient to amount to a substantial taking of the selection and arrangement of the classifications into the two Yellow Pages directories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">373 It follows that the plaintiff’s claim for copyright infringement fails in its entirety. It is not necessary accordingly to consider the question of defences. Nevertheless, because of the lengthy submissions and in the event that the matter proceeds further and I am wrong (for example, because the scanning in of the Business Listings is a substantial taking) I will briefly touch on the main defences raised. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendant can avail itself of any defences to copyright infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">374 Leaving aside the denial of infringement, the main defences relied on are (a) laches, delay and acquiescence; (b) innocent infringement; (c) fair dealing; and (d) the public interest defence. Some are defences to liability whilst others are in respect of certain remedies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Laches, delay and acquiescence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">375 The defendant submits that the plaintiff is not entitled to seek equitable relief in the form of an injunction to restrain the continued publication of its directories. In brief, the argument is that the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge of the allegedly infringing acts as early as 2003, but it only commenced suit in 2009.

</div> This argument is disingenuous because Mr Teo’s own evidence is that the defendant continued with the destruction of its documentary records even <span class="font-italic">after</span> the commencement of proceedings against it (see [320] above). There is nothing to suggest that the defendant would have been in any better a position to defend the claim against it, had the plaintiff brought proceedings earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">378 Second, there is nothing to suggest that the defendant was led to believe that the plaintiff would not enforce its rights against the defendant, nor was there any detrimental reliance by the defendant. I agree with <span class="font-italic">Fisher v Brooker</span>, where Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury (with whom the other members of the House of Lords agreed) said that detrimental reliance was usually necessary for the defence of laches to equitable relief to succeed. The defendant must show that “it would be practically unjust to give a remedy” bearing in mind the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done (<span class="font-italic">Fisher v Brooker</span> at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 The defendant has not raised any evidence which shows that it was led to believe the plaintiff would not enforce its strict rights against the defendant. Nor has the defendant shown how it has detrimentally relied on the plaintiff’s alleged failure to bring the action earlier, apart from the destruction of evidence. Whilst there may have been some delay, it was not, in the circumstances, of such a length so as to render it unjust to grant equitable relief, bearing in mind the benefits the defendant had obtained from the inaction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Innocent infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">380  The defendant relies on s 119(3) of the Copyright Act, which sets out the defence of innocent infringement. This is a defence to damages if it can be shown that, at the time of infringement, the defendant was not aware of and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the act constituting infringement was an infringement of copyright. Innocent infringement, however, is not a defence to a claim for an account of profits. The defendant submits that it is relevant that it did not have “actual or constructive knowledge that what [it] was doing is an infringement”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">382 If it was necessary for me to decide this, I would agree with the plaintiff. The defence of innocent infringement is predicated on whether a defendant has reasonable grounds for <span class="font-italic">suspecting</span> that the act constituted infringement. In <span class="font-italic">Milwell Pty Ltd v Olympic </span><span class="font-italic">Amusements Pty Ltd</span> (1999) IPR 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Milwell</span>”) a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia held (in respect of identical Australian provisions) that it was necessary to show two elements to make out the innocent infringement defence. First, an active subjective <span class="font-italic">lack </span>of awareness that the act was an infringement of copyright, and second, that objectively there were no reasonable grounds for suspecting the act complained of was infringing (<span class="font-italic">Milwell</span> at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">383 There remains a controversy over the relevance of a mistake of law as to whether the act complained of infringes copyright. The Full Court in <span class="font-italic">Milwell</span> thought that a mistake of law could never avail the defendant of the statutory defence of innocent infringement; <span class="font-italic">Pollock v JC Williamson</span> [1923] VLR 225 was cited in support of that proposition (<span class="font-italic">Milwell</span> at [62]–[63]). The Full Court also expressed caution over the comment in <span class="font-italic">Kalamazoo (Aust) Pty Ltd v Compact Business Systems Pty Ltd</span> (1985) 84 FLR 101 (“<span class="font-italic">Kalamazoo</span>”), that a mistake of law could be relevant if it was made after a reasonable inquiry. The position in <span class="font-italic">Kalamazoo</span>, however, is that endorsed in Staniforth Ricketson &amp; Chris Creswell, <span class="font-italic">The L</span><span class="font-italic">aw of Intellectual Property: Copyright, Designs &amp; Confidential Information</span>, (Law Book Co, Looseleaf Ed) (“<span class="font-italic">Ricketson &amp; Creswell</span>”) at para 13.770. <span class="font-italic">Ricketson &amp; Creswell</span> express the view that evidence that the defendant had been encouraged to believe in the legality of its actions by the plaintiff may help to open the door to the defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">384 I shall not attempt to resolve that controversy since parties have not provided detailed submissions on the applicable legal principles. Nevertheless, it does not appear from the evidence before me that the defendant made any independent inquiry as to whether copyright might have subsisted in the claimed material or whether there might be a case of infringement. Indeed, Mr Teo’s evidence was also that the defendant had not sought legal advice on the propriety of its photocopying, scanning or referencing the plaintiff’s directories prior to the commencement of proceedings against it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">385 The defendant has made much of the inadequacy of the plaintiff’s copyright notices to establish its subjective lack of awareness that infringement had occurred. Even if that is accepted (which is doubtful), it only establishes the first of two requirements necessary to make out the defence of innocent infringement. It is necessary to go further and establish that objectively, there were no reasonable grounds to suspect copyright infringement. And in my judgment, if it was necessary to decide the point, I am of the view that the defendant has failed to establish this on the facts before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">386 I have found that the defendant photocopied the entirety of the listings in the Business Listings and scanned them into a temporary database. This is not a case where the defendant subconsciously photocopied and scanned the Business Listings. The defendant was well aware of what it was doing. It would have been unreasonable for the defendant to not have suspected that it may be infringing the plaintiff’s copyright.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fair dealing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">387  The defendant also relies on the fair dealing defence under s 35 of the Copyright Act.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">389 These arguments will be better situated in their context with a brief overview of the legislative history of the fair dealing provisions in our Copyright Act, which Prof Ng-Loy has rightly commented, are “truly an indigenous species” (<span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore</span> at para 11.3.2). The fair dealing provisions originally enacted in the Copyright Act 1987 (No 2 of 1987) (“the Copyright Act 1987”) followed the Anglo-Australian approach. The defence was then tied down to three specified purposes: (a) research or private study (s 35(1) of the Copyright Act 1987); (b) reporting news or current events (s 36 of the Copyright Act 1987); and (c) criticism or review (s 37 of the Copyright Act 1987). Unlike in the US, there was no general defence of fair use that was not predicated on and limited to specific purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">390 In respect of the first specified purpose—research or private study—whether a dealing was fair was to be determined by considering four non-exhaustive factors. These included the purpose and character of the dealing, the nature of the work, the amount and substantiality of the part of the work copied, and the effect of the dealing on the potential market or value of the work (ss 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Copyright Act 1987). Further, “research” was expressly defined by s 35(5) to <span class="font-italic">exclude</span> “industrial research or research carried out by bodies corporate …, companies, associations or bodies of persons carrying on any business”. The fair dealing defence for private study or research thus could not be relied upon by corporate bodies or businesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">391 The original version of the fair dealing provisions had been hotly discussed by a Select Committee of Parliament. The bill was amended just prior to its eventual enactment: <span class="font-italic">Report of the Select Committee on the Copyright Bill (Bill No 8/86)</span> (Parl 9 of 1986, 22 December 1986) at D11. The amendment incorporated the restrictive definition of research that was found in s 35(5) of the Copyright Act 1987, and this was driven in part by the perceived concern that the defence might cover studying or research “for profit”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">392 The litigation culminating in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology Ltd v Aztech Systems Pte Ltd</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”), however, put a spotlight on the desirability of removing the limitation against commercial research in s 35(5) of the Copyright Act 1987. <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> was a case where the defendant made a copy of the plaintiff’s computer program (the firmware for a soundcard) by operating the program as part of the process of reverse engineering. The goal was to develop a competing soundcard. The defendant’s soundcard was eventually found to be non-infringing as it did not reproduce a substantial part of the plaintiff’s program. The defendant was nevertheless liable for making an infringing reproduction when the plaintiff’s program was operated for the purpose of study and research. The defendant could not rely on the fair dealing defence, which was unavailable in dealings of a <span class="font-italic">commercial</span> nature (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [76]–[77]). Since the defendant’s infringing reproduction of the plaintiff’s program did not fall within the specified purpose of “research of private study”, the Court of Appeal therefore did not go on to consider whether the defendant’s dealing was fair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">393 As a result of the concerns raised by the result reached in the <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology</span> case, the statutory provisions were amended in 1998. Section 5 of the Copyright (Amendment) Act 1998 (No 6 of 1998) removed the restriction on the definition “research” in s 35(5), which excluded from its scope research done by corporations or businesses. The intended goal was to make the defence available for commercial research provided that the dealing was fair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">394 The next and final change to the relevant provisions took place on 1 January 2005, when the Copyright (Amendment) Act 2004 (No 52 of 2004) came into effect. The amended provisions, which are the current provisions, essentially retain the basic structure of the fair dealing defence tied to specific purposes. What the amendment did, however, was to introduce (amongst others) a new US-style general fair dealing defence into s 35(1) of the Copyright Act. Section 35(1), thus amended, covers dealings for <span class="font-italic">any purpose</span> other than (a) reporting news or current events; or (b) criticism or review, both of which remain the subject of ss 36 and 37, respectively. Research and study is expressly stipulated by s 35(1A) to fall within the other purpose limb in s 35(1). The amendments also included a fifth to the list of the existing four non-exhaustive factors (see [390] above) to determine whether a dealing that falls within s 35(1) is fair. The fifth factor is the “possibility of obtaining the work or adaptation within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price” (s 35(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Copyright Act).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">395  These latest amendments are of broad effect and raise important questions as to the relationship between the purpose-limited fair dealing defences in ss 36 and 37 of the Copyright Act, and the new open-ended fair dealing defence in s 35(1). US case law and experience indicates that time and appropriate case law will be needed to flesh out the scope of the new open-ended fair dealing defence in areas such as transformative use. It is not necessary to explore these questions at length in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">396 I shall nonetheless set out some short observations on the fair dealing defence in the event that my conclusion on copyright infringement is wrong. Fair dealing is a defence to an act of infringement. It follows that in any consideration of the defence, attention must be paid to the nature of the act found to be infringing. In the present case, any infringement (in brief) will concern either (a) the competing directories of the defendant on the basis that these are a reproduction of a substantial part of the protected work(s) and/or (b) the making of copies of the protected works during the process whereby the defendant’s competing directories were produced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">397 It will be helpful to discuss <span class="font-italic">Aztech Systems Pte Ltd v Creative Technology Ltd</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 568 (“<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span>”), which was the first instance decision that was a prelude to <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (CA)</span>. Lim Teong Qwee JC in the High Court held that the defendant’s dealing fell within the specified purpose of “private study and research”, notwithstanding the fact that it was for a commercial purpose (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span> at [58]). He also held that the defendant’s dealing was fair, and he took into account the following considerations, amongst others: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The copying was only into the computer memory. No copies were made for distribution (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span> at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The copying was for the purpose of observing the operation of the soundcard, with the aim of developing a compatible soundcard that could be marketed in direct competition (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span> at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The commercial nature of the dealing was a factor against fair dealing. But that had to be balanced against the fact that the defendant’s sound card was not a copy of the plaintiff’s program (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span> at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">398 It will be recalled that Lim JC’s decision was reversed on appeal, because the Court of Appeal took the view that commercial research did not fall within the specified purpose of “research or private study”. The Court of Appeal therefore did not have to consider whether the dealing was fair (<span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (CA)</span> at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">399 In my judgment, and on the facts of the present case, I would have been inclined to find that the defendant is able to avail itself of the fair dealing defence. The complained acts of infringement relate heavily to the admission that the entirety of the listings in the Business Listings had been photocopied and also scanned into a temporary database. The purpose of this was clear: to facilitate comparison or identification of listings not found in the defendant’s directories. The scanned copy was not distributed to the public. What was distributed was the defendant’s printed directories. The scanned copy does not appear to have been made available in the form of the defendant’s online directory. It will be recalled that the defendant’s online directory is not an infringing reproduction of the plaintiff’s works. No doubt the defendant’s printed directories, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, were direct competitors to the plaintiff’s directories. Nevertheless, the defence of fair dealing for study or research or for any other purpose is not restricted to non-commercial dealings. Whilst the fact that a dealing is for non-profit educational purposes assists in establishing fair dealing, it is clear that the commercial nature of the dealing is just one of many factors to be taken into account. The importance and significance of the commercial nature of the dealing will vary from case to case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">400 It may well be that the scanning of the plaintiff’s business listing into a temporary database was a convenient or efficient method of enabling the defendant’s staff to reference the Business Listings for comparison; this might have been a quicker and more expedient method than making comparisons from the hard copy of the Business Listings. It remains a matter of judgment as to whether this tips the balance against a finding of fair dealing. Whilst it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> necessary for me to decide the point, I am of the view this very limited form of copying may well be protected; at least in circumstances where the resulting work which is exploited by the defendant is not an infringing work in itself. To be clear, I am not suggesting, even by way of a passing observation, that copying in the course of study or research generally falls within fair dealing. Much will depend on the circumstances including the effect on the value of the work, whether a copy of the work could be obtained within a reasonable time at an ordinary price, the nature of the study or research and so on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">401 In making these observations, I note that the defendant also submits that it was not in a position where it could obtain subscriber information directly from telephone service providers because of agreements between the telephone service providers and the plaintiff.

</div> These are factors that work against a conclusion that the dealing was fair. It is clear that “referencing” Yellow Pages and indeed the Business Listings was useful to the defendant as part of its strategy of market research. Whilst the defendant asserts that its Green Book directory is different because it is a directory which organises listings into very specific sub-classifications, the point remains that the Yellow Pages was obviously useful. The fact that the defendant thought the terms would be unfavourable does not assist them on the facts before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">402  Nevertheless, on balance, if it was necessary to decide the point, I would be inclined to find fair dealing for research or other purposes has been made out in respect of the photocopying of the Business Listings or scanning them into the temporary database. Indeed, to the extent that the defendant may have copied new classification headings as part of their research into their own classification system this is also a fair dealing on the evidence before me. To give an example: a writer of a legal text book who notes from another recently published text that there have been 5 new decisions on a particular legal principle and who copies down the names of the cases in order to conduct his own research on the cases for possible inclusion and discussion in his own text appears to have a strong case for fair dealing. Whilst this example is not on all fours with the case at hand (the plaintiff asserts that it created the new headings), there is no claim to copyright in the headings as such and if there was—serious questions would have arisen as to whether a new classification heading is an original work. If there is any copyright at all, it must be in the overall selection and arrangement of the classifications into the two Yellow Pages directories. Even if what the defendant did amounted to infringement (by reference to that overall selection and arrangement and any scanning into a temporary database) I am of the view that fair dealing has been made out on the facts before me. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Public interest defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">403 The defendant also relies on the defence of public interest.

</div>
</div> To succeed, the defendant faces two hurdles. First, establishing an extra-statutory defence protecting acts of infringement in the public interest. Second, showing that on the facts, the defence is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">404 The first question as to whether there is a stand-alone non-statutory defence of public interest is complex. Public interest in this sense is distinct from bars to relief such as the doctrine of unclean hands. It also goes further than the principle of law embodied in the maxim <span class="font-italic">ex turpi causa non oritur actio</span>. The latter principle prevents the court from enforcing a copyright where the work is (a) dishonest and misleading; (b) of a gross immoral tendency; and (c) written in breach of confidence or where it reeks of moral turpitude (<span class="font-italic">ZYX Music GmbH v Chris King</span> [1995] FSR 566 at 577). This is clearly not a case where the maxim has any applicability. Instead, what the defendant argues for is a broader defence of public interest on the basis that the public at large benefitted from competition in telephone directories.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">405 This is not an appropriate case to delve into arguments for and against a stand-alone public interest defence. I note that in <span class="font-italic">Creative Technology (HC)</span> at [57], Lim JC appears to have accepted that an extra-statutory public interest defence was consistent with the architecture of the Copyright Act. While that may have been the case then, the Copyright Act has since been amended several times. New statutory defensive provisions have been introduced including an open-ended US-style fair dealing defence. The list of factors set out in s 35(2)—which are broad in themselves—relevant to determining whether a dealing is fair is not exhaustive. The question as to whether there is any need or indeed room for an independent defence of public interest therefore requires careful scrutiny, especially since <span class="font-italic">ex turpi </span>and unclean hands are already established principles which affect the granting of relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">406 In any event, even cases from the UK, where a public interest defence appears to have statutory support, suggest—and rightly so—a cautious and restrained approach that places emphasis on whether the work is immoral, scandalous, contrary to family life or injurious to public life, public health and safety and the administration of justice. Whilst there may be other situations where the English courts will be prepared to apply the defence, it is likely that a restrained approach will be taken. Suffice it to say that on the facts, there is no basis or indeed assertion that the plaintiff’s directories are immoral or scandalous or injurious to public life.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">407 Given my earlier findings on subsistence of copyright and infringement as well as my observations on the fair dealing defence, it is not necessary to say any more about the alleged public interest defence than has already been said.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the plaintiff is liable for groundless threats of copyright infringement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">408  The defendant counterclaims under s 200 of the Copyright Act for the making of groundless threats of legal proceedings.

</div> The plaintiff has given no explanation as to why proof of loss is necessary at this stage given the bifurcation of the suit. I therefore accept the defendant’s position that so long as liability is established, the extent of the loss suffered will be determined at the hearing on the quantification of damages. I should stress that the evidence in relation to the threats of copyright infringement was very bare, but the plaintiff did not dispute that it sent the letters to the defendant, nor did it appear to dispute the alleged contents of the threats made in those letters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">411 The sole issue before me is whether the defendant succeeds in establishing the plaintiff’s liability under s 200 of the Copyright Act. In <span class="font-italic">Pioneers &amp; Leaders</span> at [141]–[142], the Court of Appeal held that the counterclaim for groundless threats followed as a matter of course since the plaintiff’s claim in copyright infringement failed. A similar conclusion was reached by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">RecordTV</span> at [66]. These decisions support the defendant’s submission that a case of groundless threats has been made out. As I mentioned earlier, the plaintiff’s closing submissions did not appear to deny that liability under s 200 will follow if its claim failed. Instead, its submissions are directed toward the appropriate relief. In his reply oral submissions,

</div>
</div>
</div> however, the plaintiff’s counsel, Mr Ghows, alluded to a line of Australian cases in respect of a similar provision in the Australian Copyright Act, which have cast doubt on the position that liability for groundless threats is strict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">412 The issue was considered by the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Telstra Corporation Limited v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd</span> (2014) 316 ALR 590 (“<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span>”), which was satellite litigation following in the wake of the series of <span class="font-italic">Telstra</span> decisions on subsistence of copyright that I discussed earlier (see [130]–[141] above). It suffices to recount that the plaintiff’s claim for subsistence of copyright failed in the earlier <span class="font-italic">Telstra</span> litigation. This was because the High Court of Australia had, in <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span>, departed from the industrious collection approach that formerly held sway in prior Australian decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">413 Telstra argued in <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> that it had a good defence to a claim in groundless threat because it (Telstra) had relied <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> on the law as it stood in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing</span> when it made the threat<span class="font-italic">.</span> Murphy J agreed with Telstra, and adopted a nuanced interpretation of an earlier decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, <span class="font-italic">SW Hart &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Edwards Hot Water Systems</span> (1980) 30 ALR 657 (“<span class="font-italic">SW Hart</span>”), which had held that “good faith and honest belief” were “no defence” to the grant of an injunction on the basis of groundless threats (<span class="font-italic">SW Hart</span> at 661). Murphy J acknowledged that whilst good faith was not a defence to a claim for an unjustifiable threat of copyright infringement, <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> (or good faith) had to be understood as a reference to the subjective state of mind of the party making the threat (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> at [670]–[671]). Murphy J elaborated that “unjustifiable” in the statutory provision was, however, a reference to the “objective strength of the legal position underpinning the threat” (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> at [672]). The upshot of this analysis was that the <span class="font-italic">justifiability</span> of the threat was a distinct question from its <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> at [675]). The former was objective and the latter subjective, and they “ought not be conflated”. A threat could be subjectively <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> yet still objectively unjustifiable. Murphy J concluded that Telstra’s defence to the claim of groundless threats of copyright infringement succeeded. Telstra’s threat of copyright infringement was justifiable because it was made on “strong Full Court authority”, based on the law as it then stood in <span class="font-italic">Desktop Marketing</span> (<span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> at [681]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">414 In the context of s 200 of our Copyright Act, the word “unjustifiable” appears in s 200(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), in relation to an order for declaratory relief (see [408] above). The word “groundless” appears only in the section heading. Section 200(1) provides that the three forms of relief for groundless threats of copyright infringement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, declaratory relief that the threat was unjustifiable, an injunction and damages) may be sought, unless the person making the threat satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the action or proceeding was threatened constituted, or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of copyright. When one considers the provision as a whole, including the section heading, there is something to be said for the approach taken by Murphy J in <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span>. Even though the mere fact of an honest belief in the legitimacy of the threat is rightly no defence, the position may be different where it is shown that, at the time when the threat was made, there was <span class="font-italic">clear binding authority</span> that the acts complained of constituted copyright infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">415 But in the present case, I do not think that anything turns on the point, for two reasons. First, that was never the plaintiff’s position to begin with. The plaintiff initially argued in its closing submissions that an injunction was not necessary and that damages should be nominal. It did not appear to dispute liability for groundless threats should its claim for copyright infringement fail. It was only in its reply submission that <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span> was relied upon, and liability for groundless threats of copyright infringement was disputed. Second, and more importantly, I am of the view that there are clear differences between the position before me and that in <span class="font-italic">Telstra (Groundless Threats)</span>. There was no clear binding authority on the position of industrious collection and the creativity school of thought in Singapore. Whilst the District Court in <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> supported industrious collection, I have made the point that the matter was not considered as such by the Court of Appeal when leave to appeal was refused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">416 Second, the threats of action in the 12 August and 9 September 2009 letters were overly broad and went even beyond the “industrious collection” approach which had been endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span>. The letters stated that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff’s copyright in <span class="font-italic">information</span>, <span class="font-italic">classifications</span> and <span class="font-italic">artworks</span> in the plaintiff’s directories.

</div> The reference to “information” in the letters goes beyond “industrious collection”. There was no claim made, or any evidence led at trial for the subsistence or infringement of copyright in artwork. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">417 These overbroad and unjustified allegations were <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> the type of threats that s 200 of the Copyright Act was meant to deter. The trial judge in the <span class="font-italic">IceTV</span> litigation, Bennett J, observed in his first instance decision that the purpose of the section was to deter unjustified threats, threats that did not result in infringement proceedings or could not be justified for actual infringement, and threats made to “frighten away competitors or damage such persons less directly”: <span class="font-italic">Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd v IceTV Pty Ltd</span> [2007] FCA 1172 at [232], citing with approval <span class="font-italic">Ricketson &amp; Creswell</span> at para 2.195.

</div> The plaintiff relies on cl 7.2 of the Integrated Directory Agreement in support of this position. Clause 7.2 states:

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.2 SingTel acknowledges and agrees that [the plaintiff] shall own any and all the Intellectual Property Rights, whether vested, contingent or future and all rights of action and all other rights of whatever nature in and to the following …:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.2.1 each and every copy and edition of the Printed Directory …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.2.2 each and every copy and edition or version of the Electronic Directory …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.2.3 each and every copy and edition of and/or work produced pursuant to the YPS Uses and the New Uses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">422 In the light of cl 7.2 of the Integrated Directory Agreement, it is clear that the plaintiff must own any copyright that subsists in its directories as a whole, and the copyright in the compilations within each directory (if any). Indeed, the defendant’s submissions make no attempt to address the plain effect of cl 7.2. The waters get muddied, however, in respect of the plaintiff’s assertion that it also owns copyright in each individual listing in its directories, by virtue of the enhancements and further enhancements it made to the subscriber information. I have concluded that copyright does not subsist in the individual listings in the plaintiff’s directories because they are essentially facts, and there cannot be copyright in facts. This in my view feeds into the difficulty with attributing ownership of copyright in the information found in each individual listing. It is senseless to speak of anyone—whether the plaintiff or SingTel—owning or having a copyright monopoly over the use of the information in each parcel of subscriber information or each subscriber listing. These are facts which no one can claim copyright ownership over; they are entitled to be used by everyone.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of main findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">423 The plaintiff’s claim for copyright infringement fails in its entirety and is dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">424 The defendant’s claim for groundless threats of copyright infringement succeeds. I therefore grant the defendant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration that the plaintiff’s letters of 12 August and 9 September 2009 stating that the defendant has infringed the plaintiff’s copyright in unspecified information, classification and artworks are unjustifiable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An injunction to restrain the plaintiff, or any of its officers or agents, from making groundless threats of copyright infringement that the defendant has infringed the plaintiff’s copyright in unspecified information, classification or artworks in the plaintiff’s directories.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Damages to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Costs to be agreed or taxed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Concluding remarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">425 The litigation in this case commenced in 2009. The pleadings were amended many times. There were numerous interlocutory hearings. Part of the reason for the time it took for the case to come up for trial appears to have been the decision to order the plaintiff’s action against the defendant to be heard together with similar claims against three other defendants, each in separate suits. The claims against the other three defendants were eventually discontinued, one of which was done only very late in the day. The trial took 23 days. Much of the evidence was directed to the business processes whereby the plaintiff and defendant obtained, collected, compiled and produced their competing directories. Given the use of computer technology (especially by the plaintiff) the evidence traversed at some length the architecture of the plaintiff’s software system. Whilst some of the evidence (or details) were not necessary, a broad understanding of how the plaintiff’s directories were produced was important, because of the issues that had arisen especially in relation to authorship, originality and the expression/idea or fact dichotomy in copyright law. Whilst the plaintiff has failed in its claim before me and the defendant has succeeded in its counterclaim for groundless threat of suit, I am mindful that the litigation involved fundamental principles of copyright law in an area which has attracted considerable litigation around the world including, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">426  The proceedings and the hearing were robustly fought and argued by counsel. The variety and range of matters and issues raised on matters of procedure, evidence and law were considerable. Whilst I have alluded to the difficult questions of law that arose on key copyright principles, the hearing would have been less contentious and shorter if there had been a sharper and clearer focus on the main issues of fact and law. Nevertheless, given the complexity of the legal issues, I especially thank counsel for their helpful submissions. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Bryan Manaf Ghows and Wang Yingyu (Via Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>G Radakrishnan and Mark Teng (Infinitus Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
