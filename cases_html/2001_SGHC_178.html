</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u>

       </strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1.

        All the parties are members of the Zu-Lin

Temple Association (the Association) and this action reflects the existence of factions

among the members that are struggling for control of the Association.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The action started as a claim by the three

plaintiffs against the 21 defendants for a declaration that the appointment of the 21

defendants as the seventh management committee of the Association was null and void and

that the sixth management committee was still the duly elected and effective management

committee of the Association. The defendants filed a defence and also a counterclaim. The

counterclaim was not only against the three plaintiffs. It was also against two additional

members who became two of the five defendants to the counterclaim. Many affidavits were

filed and the action was fixed for hearing over 10 days.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        When the hearing started before me on 2 May

2001, Mr Shanmugam, counsel for the plaintiffs, put forward two preliminary points. The

first point was that no defence to the plaintiffs’ claim had been disclosed either in

the pleadings or in the affidavits filed by the defendants and therefore judgment should

be entered for the plaintiffs without a trial. The second point was that in respect of the

counterclaim there was no cause of action disclosed against the original plaintiffs who

were the first, second and third defendants to the counterclaim and that the counterclaim

could not therefore properly subsist against only the fourth and fifth defendants to the

counterclaim who were not parties to the original action.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        I heard submissions from both parties on the

first preliminary point. I decided that it was well founded and that judgment should and

would be given for the plaintiffs without the necessity of a full hearing. I then

proceeded to hear submissions on the second point. Partway through those submissions I was

informed that the defendants wished to discontinue the counterclaim without prejudice to

their right to start a new action and with no order as to costs on the counterclaim. Mr

Shanmugam’s clients accepted those terms and I accordingly granted leave to the

defendants to discontinue the counterclaim. The defendants have now appealed against the

decision in favour of the plaintiffs on the first preliminary point and the consequent

declarations that I made in respect of the nullity of the seventh management committee and

the continued existence of the sixth management committee.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Pleadings</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        The amended statement of claim started by

averring that all the plaintiffs were members of the Association and that the second

plaintiff was a committee member. It then went on to give a history of the Association.

Paragraph 6 of the statement of claim gave the names of all 25 members of the 6<sup>th</sup>

management committee of the Association. It named the second plaintiff and the third

plaintiff as committee members. In paragraph 7, the statement of claim, rather

confusingly, asserted that the first and second plaintiffs were two of the members of the

duly elected and current management committee. It stated that this committee was elected

at the annual general meeting held on 6 June 1999 and that the tenure of the 6<sup>th</sup>

management committee was due for expiry on 6 June 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Paragraph 8 recited the effect of various

relevant provisions of the constitution of the Association and this was elaborated on

until paragraph 11. In paragraph 12, the plaintiffs contended that in view of the

constitutional provisions, the terms of the 6<sup>th</sup> management committee was only

due to expire on 6 June 2001 and the defendants were prohibited from appointing a new

management committee before then.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        By paragraph 13 of the statement of claim, it

was stated that on 20 May 2000, a notice of an extraordinary general meeting (EOGM) of the

Association was given to all members including the plaintiffs. The EOGM was scheduled for

28 May 2000 at 8pm. It was specifically pleaded that the notice and the agenda of the EOGM

did not state that the sixth management committee would be dissolved and that an election

would be conducted to elect a replacement management committee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        By paragraph 14, the plaintiffs averred that

they did not attend the EOGM and came to know on 29 May that members attending the EOGM

had, contrary to the agenda of the EOGM and the constitution of the Association,

purportedly voted to dissolve the existing and duly constituted sixth management committee

and purported to appoint the defendants as the new management committee (the seventh

management committee). In paragraph 15, it was stated that the members had also purported

to appoint new trustees.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        In paragraph 16, the plaintiffs contended that

the election of the defendants as the seventh management committee and of the new trustees

was null and void for various reasons. The first of these was that the purported

dissolution of the sixth management committee had not been provided for nor tabled as a

resolution in the agenda for the EOGM and neither was it any part of the agenda for the

EOGM. Further in breach of the constitution, no notice of any proposal to remove the

trustees from their trusteeship or to appoint new trustees was given. The next paragraph

pleaded that the plaintiffs had been denied their right to propose and/or second and/or

elect and/or vote at the EOGM on 28 May.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the amended statement

of claim dealt with other matters which were not relevant to the preliminary point. Among

the reliefs thereafter sought by the plaintiffs were declarations that the appointment of

the defendants as the seventh management committee was null and void and that the sixth

management committee remained the management committee of the Association.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        In their amended defence, the defendants

admitted that the plaintiffs were members of the Association and that the sixth management

committee had been elected on 6 June 1999. This was in paragraph 1. The rest of that

paragraph and paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 dealt with the history and practice of the

Association. In paragraph 9 the defendants did not admit that the second plaintiff was a

committee member and in paragraph 10 the defendants denied that the first plaintiff was

ever a committee member of the Association. The defendants did not in any of their

paragraphs deny that the third plaintiff was a committee member.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        In paragraph 11 the defendants averred that the

tenure of the sixth management committee had been effectively, validly and

constitutionally terminated by a majority vote which had been taken to dissolve this

committee at the EOGM of 28 May 2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        Paragraphs 8 to 16 are not relevant for the

present purpose. In paragraph 17, the defendants denied paragraph 12 of the amended

statement of claim and contended that the ordinary members retained the right to elect a

new management committee when the sixth management committee had resigned and vacated

office.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        In paragraph 18, the defendants referred to the

agenda for the EOGM and stated that it had been specifically convened to discuss and

address the problems facing the sixth management committee. Paragraph 19 averred that at

the meeting the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and assistant secretary offered to

resign and vacate their offices. These resignations were accepted by the general meeting.

In paragraph 20, the defendants did not admit paragraph 14 of the statement of claim.

Paragraphs 20 and 21 dealt with the appointment of the trustees and in paragraph 22, the

defendants went on to aver that upon acceptance of the resignation and vacation of key

office bearers, the sixth management committee had exercised its discretion to dissolve

itself by virtue of clause 24 of the constitution which provided that in the event of any

question or matter arising out of any point which was not expressly provided for in the

rules, the committee would have the power to use its own discretion. Paragraph 23 went on

to say that after the sixth management committee had been dissolved, the members had

proceeded to vote for and elect new office bearers. The remaining paragraphs of the

defence did not bear on the issue argued.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Relevant facts</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        The arguments turned on the sufficiency of the

notice calling the EOGM. This notice was issued pursuant to a requisition sent to the

chairman of the sixth management committee on 18 May 2000 by some 28 members of the

Association. As translated into English, the requisition read:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘With reference to the

    opening ceremony of the temple and other subsequent development matters, as well as

    call an "Urgent Member Meeting" for discussion.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Consequently, on 20 May the EOGM

was called. The English translation of the notice of the EOGM read:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        What happened at the meeting in relation to the

position of the sixth management committee was set out succinctly in the minutes of the

EOGM recorded by Mr Neo Yek Boon (the eighth defendant) from the tape recording of the

meeting. The first matter discussed was the issue of the board of trustees. After some

discussion, four trustees verbally offered to withdraw from the trusteeship to pave way

for a proper election of trustees by the members. Mr Chan Huang Seng (the first

defendant), a withdrawing trustee, then proposed to the members that the board of trustees

be dissolved and that the meeting elect new trustees. This proposal was seconded by Mr Lim

Seng Hoo (the second defendant), another withdrawing trustee. The election was, however,

delayed as the fifth trustee was apparently on her way to the meeting.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        The next event was a discussion of the

investment of funds of the Association in certain insurance policies. It was agreed at the

meeting that the investment must be withdrawn as the money had been donated towards the

building of the temple and not for investment. This discussion was followed by the

significant events. As recorded by paragraphs 1.4 to 1.6 of the minutes, what took place

was:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘1.4 Mr Neo Yit Sui [12<sup>th</sup>

    defendant] said that because of these issues, members have lost confidence with the

    current 6<sup>th</sup> in-take of committee members. Mr Toh Tong Tiong asked the members

    present whether they sincerely work for and pray for guidance from our Goddess of Mercy

    and requested them to raise their hand if they do. It was a unanimous "YES". Mr

    Toh Tong Tiong than read out the advice that the current 6<sup>th</sup> in-take of

    committee members be dissolved, the board of trustees be dissolved and the election of the

    new 7<sup>th</sup> in-take of committee members and new board of trustees.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.5 Mr Chan Huang Seng proposed

    and Mr Lim Seng Hoo [2<sup>nd</sup> defendant] seconded that the current 6<sup>th</sup>

    in-take of committee members be dissolved. The dissolution was unanimously accepted by the

    members and Chairman Mr Lim Seng Hock officially announced the dissolution of the current

    6<sup>th</sup> in-take of committee members and the current board of trustees.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Subsequently, the meeting

proceeded with the election of a new board of trustees and a new management committee. It

should be noted that whilst Mr Lim Seng Hoo, the second defendant, was also a member of

the sixth management committee, the proposer of the motion to dissolve that committee, Mr

Chan, the first defendant, was not a member of it. He therefore acted as a member of the

Association rather than as a member of the committee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        Basically the stand taken by the defendants in

their affidavits as to what had happened at the EOGM was somewhat contradictory. On the

one hand they relied on the minutes of the EOGM as recorded and translated by Mr Neo Yek

Boon. Those clearly state that the sixth management committee was dissolved by a

resolution passed by the meeting at the instigation of the first and second defendants. On

the other hand, various deponents stated that during the meeting members of the sixth

management committee resigned voluntarily and as a result there was a vacuum and the sixth

management committee was dissolved. This allegation that the dissolution of the sixth

management committee was prompted by an en-masse resignation was not part of the defence.

As can be seen from the recital above, the assertion in the defence was that four key

office bearers had resigned and the management committee had then used its own discretion

to dissolve itself. This assertion was not substantiated by the facts put forward by the

defendants themselves and therefore could not compensate for any inadequacy in the notice

calling for the meeting.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Since the minutes were prepared by one of the

defendants based on tape recordings and were relied on by the other defendants as an

account of what had happened, they had to be taken as the best record of what had actually

occurred at the EOGM. These minutes show that the sixth management committee was dissolved

by a general resolution of the meeting and not by any action on the part of the committee

itself. Further, since at least one committee member (ie the plaintiff) was absent, there

could not have been a complete vacation of office by the committee members.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The defendants’ pleadings did not admit

that the plaintiffs were absent from the meeting. It appeared from their affidavits,

however, that they were not able to deny the plaintiffs’ absence. One of the exhibits

to the affidavit filed by the third defendant attached the minutes of the EOGM and the

attendance list bearing the names of all the members of the Association. Those present at

the EOGM signed against their names. The plaintiffs’ signatures were absent. The

plaintiffs themselves specifically attested that they were absent. On the other hand, none

of the deponents from the defendants specifically attested to the presence of the

plaintiffs at the EOGM. At the beginning of the trial therefore, the plaintiffs’

absence from the meeting was, in effect, uncontroverted.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The law</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        The law is clear that meetings would be invalid

at the behest of non-attending members if the notices convening them do not specify, with

sufficient particularity, the matters to be discussed and resolved at the meetings. See <i>Shackleton

on the Law and Practice of Meetings </i>(9<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1997) pp 39-43. There are also

case authorities to similar effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        <i>Young v Ladies’ Imperial Club, Limited </i>[1920] 2 KB 523 involved a situation that was very similar to the one before me. There a notice

was issued convening a meeting of the executive committee of a club. The stated object of

the meeting was ‘to report on and discuss the matter concerning [the plaintiff] and

Mrs Lawrence’. The plaintiff had made some derogatory comments about Mrs Lawrence, a

fellow member, which she had later withdrawn having realised that the comments were

unfounded. She had not apologised, however, and Mrs Lawrence had complained to the

executive committee. When the committee sat it decided that the plaintiff’s conduct

was injurious to the character and interests of the club and recommended that she resign.

When the plaintiff failed to resign, the committee erased her name from the membership

rolls. The rule under which the committee acted provided that no member could be

recommended to resign unless a resolution to that effect had been passed at a meeting

specially convened for the purpose. The plaintiff’s action to be reinstated was

allowed by the Court of Appeal. The main ground of decision was that notice of the

committee meeting had not been given to every member of the committee. Two members of the

court also observed that the notice was not a sufficient notice because it had not

specified that its purpose was to consider whether or not the plaintiff should be

recommended to resign.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        Another case where the sufficiency of a notice

was considered was <i>Kaye v Croydon Tramways Company </i>[1898] 1 Ch D 358. There, a

notice convening a meeting of shareholders of the selling company to consider an agreement

made by the selling company to sell its undertaking to another company omitted reference

to a fact that a substantial sum would be payable to the directors of the selling company

as compensation for loss of office. It was held that the notice did not fairly disclose

the purpose for which the meeting was convened and did not comply with s 71 of the then

current UK Companies Act. The company was restrained from carrying the agreement into

effect until it had been sanctioned by the shareholders at a meeting duly convened for the

purpose.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The decision</font></p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        In the present case, there was nothing in the

notice that indicated the purpose of the meeting was to remove and replace trustees and/or

committee members. If that was what was intended by item 1 of the agenda, ie

‘Chairman’s explanation of the meeting’ or by item 3 ‘Problem between

Councillors’ as averred in the defence, the intention was not effectively conveyed.

The phraseology of the two items was too vague and general to bring home to the mind of

each and every member that what was being aimed at was a complete re-structuring of the

administration of the Association.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        The plaintiffs did not attend the meeting.

Their evidence was that they did not think that anything momentous was to be discussed and

therefore did not attend. It is not necessary, however, to rely on such evidence to find

the notice to be inadequate. A discussion of problems amongst councillors does not

necessarily imply a wholesale removal of all members of the committee concerned. For that

matter it does not even imply the removal of those members who are having problems inter

se.</font></p>

        As far as the defendants were concerned,

neither their pleadings nor their evidence properly addressed the issue of the sufficiency

of the notice. Their comments in their affidavits to the effect that the plaintiffs were

not interested in the Association’s affairs could not be regarded as an answer to the

allegation of insufficiency of notice. Their allegation of a mass resignation was

contradicted by their own minutes. In any case as the third plaintiff was absent, he had

not resigned and his removal could only have been effected by the resolution passed for

the dissolution of the sixth management committee so that allegation was unfounded and

could not serve as a defence to the plaintiffs’ claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        The plaintiffs were entitled to be told exactly

what business was to be transacted at the meeting. If they had known that the intention

was to remove the trustees and the sixth management committee (including the two

plaintiffs who sat on it), they would have been able to make an informed decision as to

whether or not they would attend the meeting. Since no indication of such a purpose was

disclosed on the notice, the plaintiffs were deprived of their right to attend and

contribute to the discussion and participate in the voting that took place.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        In this regard, the following passage from <i>Shackleton

</i>is helpful:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘Whether a notice is

    sufficient must be decided on the facts of each case. A crucial test is whether it

    contains enough information to enable the recipient to decide for himself whether he

    should attend, or appoint a proxy on his behalf, or whether he is content to let matters

    take their course at the meeting: to enable him "to decide for himself whether he

    should do any more."’ (at p 41)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        In my judgment, the notice calling the EOGM

plainly failed the crucial test. It gave no hint to the plaintiffs or anyone else not in

the know that there would be a motion to remove the sixth management committee and to

replace it with a new committee. It also did not allow the plaintiffs to decide whether

they should attend or whether they were content to let matters take their course. Even if

they were not adverse to the removal of the sixth management committee, the plaintiffs or

any of them might have wanted to stand for election as members of the replacement

committee or as new trustees. They did not have the opportunity to decide whether they

should attend the meeting for this purpose. In my judgment, therefore, the notice was bad

and the actions taken could not be validated notwithstanding that a majority of the

members of the Association had voted in favour of them. I therefore gave the plaintiffs

the declarations asked for.</font></p>
