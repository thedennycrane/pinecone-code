<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">    The respondent was charged in the district court

with causing the death of one Mohd Yassin bin PM Sultan (the ‘deceased’) by

doing a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, an offence under s 304A of the

Penal Code (Cap 224). After calling for the defence, the trial judge acquitted the

respondent of the charge. The prosecution appealed to the High Court and, after hearing

their arguments, I dismissed the appeal against acquittal. I now give my reasons. </p>
</font><b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts</p></b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">2 On 23 December 2000 at about 9.38 pm, the respondent was riding on

his motorcycle along Commonwealth Avenue in the direction of Queensway when he was

involved in a traffic accident with the deceased. The deceased, who was dressed in green

pants and a purple shirt, was 72 years of age, 1.52m tall and weighed 40.5 kg. He was

brought by ambulance to Alexandra Hospital and pronounced dead at 10.44 pm. The autopsy

report showed that the deceased had suffered two fractured left ribs and fractures of his

left leg. The forensic pathologist took the view that the deceased had died from the

injuries sustained in the accident.</p>
<p align="justify">3 Commonwealth Avenue comprises two separate carriageways which are

divided by a canal and the elevated MRT tracks. The carriageway in question had three

lanes, and the accident took place in the extreme right lane, which is the lane closest to

the MRT tracks. Two arrows, indicating the direction of the traffic flow, are marked on

each lane before the pedestrian crossing. Photographs adduced at the trial showed that

there are shrubs planted along the roadside, measuring about 0.8 m high at the time of the

accident. It can also be seen from the photographs that the edge of the MRT track runs

directly above the edge of the road. Finally, while there are streetlights on the side of

the carriageway opposite the MRT tracks, there are none on the same side of the

carriageway as the MRT track.</p>
</font><b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The adduced evidence</p></b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">4 At the trial before the district judge, the prosecution only called

two witnesses. The first, SSSgt Zainuddin M Saleh (‘SSSgt Zainuddin’), testified

that he arrived at the scene of the accident at about 11.20 pm that evening. It was still

raining at the time, and while lighting was dim, it was not in pitch darkness. Although he

found that it was possible to see a pedestrian standing at the traffic light, he did not

take measurements of the maximum distance from which such a person could be seen. SSSgt

Zainuddin was also unable to shed any light on the point of the accident, or the positions

of the deceased or the motorcycle after the accident, as the deceased had already been

conveyed to hospital before he arrived, and the motorcycle had been moved. Finally, he

confirmed that the photographs of the accident scene which had been taken at his direction

had been taken with a powerful flash.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The prosecution’s second witness, Sgt Max Ong Gak Boon

(‘Sgt Ong’) was the investigating officer for the case. Although he visited the

scene of the accident in the course of his investigations, he was unable to shed any light

as to the height of the bushes, the height of the kerb, or whether it was possible for the

respondent to have seen the deceased. It was also not raining and the road surface was dry

when Sgt Ong visited the scene of the accident. However, he noted that the lighting on the

road was dimmer than on other roads which had street lights on both sides of the road.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 The respondent was the only person who could give an account of the

accident as there were no witnesses apart from a Chinese man who helped call the ambulance

for the deceased, but who remained anonymous. He stated that he was on his way to Holland

Village to meet a friend when the accident happened. It was drizzling at the time, and

although the respondent wiped his visor twice to get rid of the raindrops, his visor

continued to be blurred by the rain. He decided to ride in the extreme right lane, so that

he could be sheltered by the MRT track as he rode. The respondent was travelling at a

speed of 40 to 50 km/h as he was on third gear. As he approached the pedestrian crossing

where the accident occurred, he slowed down to approximately 30 km/h as he approached the

first arrow, and checked for pedestrians at the crossing. The lights were green in the

respondent’s favour, and as he approached the second arrow, he checked the lights and

for pedestrians again. This time, he turned his head to the left to perform his check, and

when he turned his head back, he saw that the deceased had stepped off the right side of

the road and taken two steps onto the road.</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">7 At the time, the respondent was about three metres away from the

deceased. He did not sound his horn as he had no time to do so, and instead applied his

brakes and swerved to the left to avoid the deceased. However, the deceased kept walking

forward and the respondent felt an impact on his right shoulder before the motorcycle fell

over. The deceased was then still alive but unconscious, and the respondent asked the

anonymous Chinese man to call the ambulance, which brought the deceased to the hospital,

where he was pronounced dead. The respondent also explained that he had not seen the

deceased as the shrubs planted by the side of the road were about the same height as the

deceased.</p>
</font><b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The trial judge’s decision</p></b><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8 The trial judge accepted the respondent’s unchallenged evidence

that the traffic lights at the signal were green in his favour, that he had not seen the

deceased step off the kerb, that he only saw the deceased when he was about three metres

away from the deceased, and that the deceased’s body was lying about one metre past

the stop line after the accident. The direction the deceased was facing, and the manner in

which the collision occurred was also corroborated by the autopsy report. Finally, in

light of the position of the accused’s body and the respondent’s evidence, he

found that the respondent had not been speeding at the time. </p>
<p align="justify">9 Although the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossing) Rules state that

pedestrians have right of way at signalised pedestrian crossings, even when the lights are

not in their favour, the trial judge took the position that the Rules did not impose

strict liability on motorists. Instead, the respondent was obliged to exercise the care

which would have been exercised by a reasonable and prudent motorcyclist, namely to take

all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of a pedestrian at a pedestrian crossing. The

trial judge was of the view that, in the circumstances of the case, the respondent had not

failed to do anything which a reasonable and prudent motorcyclist in his circumstances

would have done. </p>
<p align="justify">10 The trial judge also had serious doubts as to whether the respondent

could have seen the deceased before the accident, noting that the prosecution had not been

able to tender satisfactory evidence on the maximum distance from which such a pedestrian

could be seen. Accordingly, he acquitted the respondent of the charge, and also turned

down a request by the prosecution to amend the charge to one under s 65 of the Road

Traffic Act (Cap 276), viz., driving a motor vehicle without due care. </p></font><b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal to this Court </p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 Although the prosecution raised several grounds of appeal before me,

the main contentions underlying these grounds of appeal were that the respondent should

have seen the deceased, that he had not kept a proper lookout for pedestrians, and that he

had not acted prudently when riding his motorcycle. Alternatively, the prosecution argued

that the evidence disclosed the offence of driving without due care and attention, in

contravention of s 65 of the Road Traffic Act, and urged me to convict the respondent on

the reduced charge. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the respondent should have seen the deceased</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 The prosecution’s argument under this head was that the

surrounding circumstances were such that the deceased should have been seen by anyone who

kept a proper lookout. Since the respondent did not see the deceased until the deceased

was three metres away, it followed that the respondent had not in fact performed a check

as he claimed to have done. Two issues were hence raised in relation to this contention:

whether the deceased was visible when the respondent carried out a check for pedestrians

when he was 15 metres away from the pedestrian crossing; and whether the respondent had in

fact performed the check as he said that he did. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 Having looked at the evidence, I was not convinced by the

prosecution’s argument that the deceased should have been visible from 15 metres

away. It is trite law that that an appellate court will be slow to disturb the findings of

a lower court unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence – <i>Lim

Ah Poh v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>, applied in <i>PP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=62033&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 4 SLR 75</a>, and I was of the view that the trial judge’s findings on this issue were not

in error. The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the accident, the poor lighting

and the shrubs planted by the roadside would all have affected the respondent’s

ability to detect pedestrians. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 The physical attributes of the deceased would have made his

detection even more difficult, as more than half of his body would have been concealed by

the shrubs, and the photographic evidence showed that the deceased was of dark-complexion

and dressed in dark clothing. I also noted that there had been some uncertainty in the

court below as to whether the deceased had been carrying a black umbrella when he was

struck by the respondent’s motorcycle. The prosecution argued that, if the deceased

had been carrying a black umbrella, that would have made him all the more detectable, but

I was of the contrary view. I felt that, if the deceased had indeed been carrying a black

umbrella, that would have served to further conceal him from the respondent’s view. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 In rejecting the prosecution’s argument that the deceased was

visible from 15 metres away, I was also conscious of the fact that the prosecution had

been unable to adduce any evidence as to the maximum distance from which the respondent,

under the prevailing weather and light conditions, ought to have been able to see the

deceased. The photographs of the accident scene which had been adduced in the court below

were of no help, as SSSgt Zainuddin had conceded that the photographs had been taken with

a powerful flash. I considered the absence of such evidence to be a major obstacle towards

proof of the prosecution’s contention that the respondent should have been able to

see the deceased much earlier than when he actually did. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 Having rejected the prosecution’s first proposition, namely

that the respondent ought to have detected the deceased much earlier, it followed that

there was no basis from which it could be inferred that the respondent had not actually

carried out the pedestrian check the way he said he did. I would in any event have been

extremely reluctant to accept such an inference. The prosecution had proceeded in the

court below on the basis that the respondent had been negligent since he failed to spot

the deceased until the deceased was three metres away. The issue of whether the respondent

had or had not checked the right side of the road for pedestrians had not arisen at all,

since the prosecution did not challenge the respondent’s evidence that he had indeed

carried out a check.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 The rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> [1893] 6 R 67 states that any

matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness

must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the

contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the

evidence-in-chief. Although I said in <i>Liza bte Ismail v Public Prosecutor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10887&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 2 SLR 454</a> that the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> is not an inflexible rule, I was of the

opinion that in the circumstances of the present case, it would have been extremely unfair

to the respondent to accept such an argument. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 It was for this same reason that I was disinclined to consider the

effect of white railings located at the right side of the road (which were intended to

channel pedestrians) on the detectability of the deceased. The railings had not been

brought up in the court below, and the respondent had not been questioned on the effect,

if any, that they had on his perception, or whether he could even have seen them from 15

metres away. In such circumstances, it would have been extremely inappropriate for me to

have taken the railings into account when considering the issue of the deceased’s

visibility.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the respondent had kept a proper lookout</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 Related to the foregoing was the prosecution’s contention that

the accident had occurred because the respondent had not kept a proper lookout. Much

reliance was placed upon <i>Public Prosecutor v Er Wee Kok</i> (unreported), where the

accused was convicted under s 304A for causing the death of a pedestrian. I was also

referred to <i>Public Prosecutor v Teo Lian Seng</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9736&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 19</a>, in which I had

commented that on normal roads, there was a need to be alert at all times to the

possibility of persons crossing the road indiscriminately. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 With respect, I did not find the two cases cited to me to be

helpful. In <i>Er Wee Kok</i>, the deceased had checked for vehicles before he started to

cross the road, and the road had actually been clear when he began to make his way across.

The accused was also observed to be travelling quite fast, such that after the impact, the

deceased was thrown up into the air. In light of the trial judge’s finding that the

deceased had not dashed across the road, as claimed by the accused, the trial judge was

"driven to the inescapable conclusion" that the accused had not seen the

deceased because he was not keeping a proper lookout. The finding was as such closely

related to the facts of the case, and given the very different facts in the present case,

I did not find <i>Er Wee Kok</i> to be relevant to the present inquiry. Certainly, I was

of the view that the many factors at play in the present case (as already discussed in the

preceding section) militated against an "inescapable conclusion" that the

respondent had not been keeping a proper lookout. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 I also did not find <i>Teo Lian Seng</i> to be of particular help,

as it was to my mind clear that in the present case, the respondent was in fact alert to

the possibility of the deceased crossing the road indiscriminately, and had in fact taken

precautions in order to ward off that eventuality. For example, apart from carrying out

two pedestrian checks, the respondent had also slowed down his speed from about 40 or 50

km/h to 30 km/h as he approached the pedestrian crossing in question. Further, although

the prosecution also referred me to public policy on the protection of pedestrians at

signalised crossings, as exemplified by Rules 5 and 7 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian

Crossing) Rules, I took the view that such public policy had not been compromised by the

respondent’s behaviour in approaching the fateful crossing.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Whether the respondent had behaved prudently</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 The third contention made by the prosecution before me was that the

respondent had not behaved prudently as he had persisted in riding on when it was his

evidence that the rain was affecting his vision. The prosecution also took issue with the

respondent’s moving into the right-most lane when such lane is meant only for

overtaking. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 I did not agree with either of the prosecution’s contentions

under this head. With regard to the first contention, the rain at the time of the accident

was not heavy, the respondent having testified that, while his T-shirt had water droplets

on it, it was not drenched. The respondent had also taken precautions to counteract the

effect of the rain, namely to wipe his visor at every given opportunity, and had also

testified that, after he sought shelter by riding under the overhang of the MRT track, his

vision improved. Under such circumstances, I was of the opinion that it was not imprudent

of the respondent to continue riding. Indeed, given the light rain conditions at the time

of the accident, if I accepted the prosecution’s submission on this issue, it would

mean that all motorcyclists would be obliged to stop riding once rain progressed beyond a

mere drizzle, and I considered such a proposition to be completely untenable.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 As for whether the respondent had been imprudent in choosing to ride

in the overtaking lane, while it was clear that such action was in violation of traffic

rules, I did not see how such a violation could be said to bear a direct relation to the

accident that subsequently happened. The accident did not occur because the respondent

chose to ride in the overtaking lane, but because he did not have the opportunity to see

the deceased until it was too late. Riding in the overtaking lane, while certainly not to

be encouraged, in fact gave the respondent a better opportunity to see the deceased as his

vision improved once he made the change in lanes. The respondent nevertheless failed to

see the deceased, a failure more properly attributable to the confluence of prevailing

conditions at the time. As such, I was of the opinion that such imprudence bore no

relation to the issue of the respondent’s negligence. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Alternative conviction under s 65, Road Traffic Act </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25<b> </b>Turning finally to the prosecution’s request for an

alternative conviction under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act, it seemed to me that s 65 might

have been a more appropriate section for the present case to have been brought under. I

did not feel that the nature of the accident warranted the harsh criminal sanctions of a

charge under s 304A. Having said that, I was unwilling to grant an amendment to the charge

at such a late stage, given both that the entire trial in the court below had proceeded on

the basis of s 304A, as well my view that the respondent’s alleged culpability under

s 65 was at best speculative in light of the circumstances of the present case. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal against the

respondent’s acquittal. </p>
