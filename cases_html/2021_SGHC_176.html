Subsequently, the company went into liquidation. The liquidator applied to set aside the debenture as a voidable preference under s 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (the “1986 Act”) or as an undervalued transaction under s 238 of the same Act. The court dismissed the application. Millett J held, among other things, that the transaction was not one at an undervalue,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and said, at 340: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Section 238 of the 1986 Act is concerned with the depletion of a company’s assets by transactions at an undervalue. Section 238(4) of the Act defines a transaction at an undervalue as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘For the purposes of this section and section 241, a company enters into a transaction with a person at an undervalue if — (a) the company makes a gift to that person or otherwise enters into a transaction with that person on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration, or (b) the company enters into a transaction with that person for a consideration the value of which, in money or money’s worth, is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, of the consideration provided by the company.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The granting of the debenture was not a gift, nor was it without consideration. The consideration consisted of the bank’s forbearance from calling in the overdraft and its honouring of cheques and making of fresh advances to the company during the continuance of the facility. The applicant relies therefore on para (b).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the applicant's claim to characterise the granting of the bank’s debenture as a transaction at an undervalue is misconceived. The mere creation of a security over a company’s assets does not deplete them and does not come within [s 234(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1986 Act]. By charging its assets the company appropriates them to meet the liabilities due to the secured creditor and adversely affects the rights of other creditors in the event of insolvency. But it does not deplete its assets or diminish their value. It retains the right to redeem and the right to sell or remortgage the charged assets. All it loses is the ability to apply the proceeds otherwise than in satisfaction of the secured debt. That is not something capable of valuation in monetary terms and is not customarily disposed of for value.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… By granting the debenture the company parted with nothing of value, and the value of the consideration which it received in return was incapable of being measured in money or money’s worth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The definition of an undervalued transaction in s 238(4) of the 1986 Act is similar to that found in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of our Bankruptcy Act (see [24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Hill v Spread Trustee Co Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2007] 1 WLR 2404 (“<span class="font-italic">Hill</span>”), the English High Court found that there was no consideration for certain charges and an assignment, for the purposes of s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the 1986 Act (see <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>at [92]). Section 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that a person enters into a transaction with another person at an undervalue if “he … enters into a transaction with the other person on terms that provide for him to receive no consideration” (see <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>at p 2440). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Before the English Court of Appeal, the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>argued, relying on <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a grant of security could not constitute a transaction for no consideration. The English Court of Appeal rejected the argument and held as follows (at [93]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The appellant’s] argument relies on the holding of Millett J in <span class="font-italic">In re MC Bacon Ltd</span> [1990] BCLC 324, 340–341 that the grant of security cannot constitute a transaction at an undervalue. It does not follow from this that a transaction involving the grant of security can never amount to a transaction for no consideration. In my judgment, it is no different from any other transaction in that respect. This in my judgment was also the view of Millett J who was careful to point out, at p 340F, that the security in the case before him was not given without consideration because it was given in exchange for forbearance by the creditor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the event, the Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the appellant had given no consideration (at [98]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Sections 238 and 423 are two ways in which antecedent transactions may be challenged under the 1986 Act. Section 238 deals with transactions at an undervalue which occurred during the “relevant time” (s 238(2)), when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction (s 240(2)). “Relevant time” is defined in s 240(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>as the two-year period ending with the “onset of insolvency”. The “onset of insolvency” is defined in s 240(3) and refers to the date of the commencement of the winding up in the case of a company going into liquidation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Section 423 deals with transactions to defraud creditors and applies to transactions entered into at an undervalue. However, s 423 differs from s 238 in two respects. First, s 423 imposes an additional requirement – undervalued transactions may be set aside under s 423 only if they were entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a creditor or otherwise prejudicing the interest of the creditor (s 423(3)). Second, there is no requirement in s 423 that the transaction must have occurred during the “relevant time”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Sections 238(4) and 423(1) contain similar definitions of a transaction at an undervalue. Sections 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) define it as a transaction in respect of which no consideration is received (the “no consideration limb”), whilst ss 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) define it as a transaction in which the value of the consideration received is significantly less than that given, both values being measured in money or money’s worth, (the “value comparison limb”). The definition in s 423(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (transactions entered into in consideration of marriage) is not relevant for present purposes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">Feakins v Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs</span> [2007] BCC 54 (“<span class="font-italic">Feakins</span>”), a differently constituted English Court of Appeal cited the decision in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>(that the granting of charges did not deplete the grantor’s assets) with approval (at [72]). The facts in <span class="font-italic">Feakins </span>are not relevant for present purposes. The transaction that was being impugned in <span class="font-italic">Feakins</span> was a sale of a farm that was subject to a mortgage; the transaction itself did not involve the grant of security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In Singapore, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Encus International Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v Tenacious Investment Pte Ltd and others </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1178 noted (at [36]) that the question of law as to whether a grant of security can qualify in principle as an undervalued transaction, was not settled.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The Court referred to <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span>, <span class="font-italic">Hill</span> and <span class="font-italic">Feakins</span> and also noted that <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>was strongly endorsed by Prof Roy Goode in Roy Goode, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) at para 13-38 (at [36]–[38]). Although the Court expressed a preference for the approach in <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, ultimately, the Court left the question open as it was not required to decide the question (at [39]). The Court found that the transaction in question could not have created an equitable mortgage or other security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my respectful view, the decisions in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hill</span> are not inconsistent with each other and both are correct. The decision in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>was in respect of the value comparison limb under s 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1986 Act. The Court expressly found that the “granting of the debenture was not a gift, nor was it without consideration” (see [32] above). However, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Hill </span>was in respect of the no consideration limb under s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the 1986 Act. This distinction between the two cases is important.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The value comparison limb requires an assessment of the value of the consideration given against the value of the consideration received. It was in this context that Millett J decided in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>that the appellant’s grant of the debenture could not be a transaction at an undervalue because mere creation of the security over the company’s assets did not deplete them (see [32] above). As Millett J said, by granting the debenture “the company parted with nothing of value”. Millett J also went on to find that the value of the consideration received was incapable of being measured in money or money’s worth. For these reasons, Millett J concluded that the debenture could not qualify as an undervalued transaction under s 238(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the 1986 Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Hill</span>, the High Court found that there was no consideration for the charges and assignment, for the purposes of the no consideration limb in s 423(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The issue before the Court of Appeal was in respect of the no consideration limb, the question being whether the appellant, who was the <span class="font-italic">beneficiary</span> of the charges and assignment, had given consideration for the security. The fact that the grant of security did not deplete the grantor’s assets was relevant to the question as to the value of the consideration given by the <span class="font-italic">grantor</span>; it was irrelevant to the question whether the <span class="font-italic">beneficiary</span> of the security had given consideration. Under the no consideration limb, the value of the consideration given by the grantor of the security did not arise. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Mortgage was an undervalued transaction on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees relied on both the no consideration limb and the value comparison limb in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act, respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With respect to s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), I disagreed with Rothstar’s submissions that that it had given consideration for the Mortgage in that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it forbore from enforcing (i) its rights for repayment of the Loan, and (ii) the Equitable Mortgage;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it granted extension of time for the repayment of the Loan;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) it agreed to consider a further loan to AIPL; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) it had given AIPL the Loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Ng and Pictorial executed the Mortgage on 2 December 2019. At that time, the Loan was not yet due, the repayment date having been extended to 1 February 2020 pursuant to the 2nd Addendum (see [8] above). The Loan Agreement had no provision enabling Rothstar to demand repayment before the due date. Under the Equitable Mortgage, Rothstar had no right to enforce the Equitable Mortgage before the Loan had fallen due.

</div>
</div> Therefore, there was nothing for Rothstar to forbear. Rothstar’s submission that its forbearance amounted to consideration for the Mortgage, was wholly unmeritorious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Rothstar’s submission that it had given consideration for the Mortgage because it had granted extension of time for repayment of the Loan was equally unmeritorious. The repayment date for the Loan was extended on 4 November 2019 to 1 February 2020 by way of the 2nd Addendum. In addition, Rothstar’s own evidence was that the Mortgage came about after AIPL requested a further loan on <span class="font-italic">14 November 2019</span> (see [9] above). The 2nd Addendum could not have been the consideration for the Mortgage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Rothstar claimed that the Mortgage was granted in order for Rothstar simply to <span class="font-italic">consider</span> whether to grant a further loan to AIPL. I found this assertion implausible and unbelievable. Ng Xinwei’s evidence that Rothstar asked for a legal mortgage because it had heard rumours about AIPL’s financial situation (see [10] above) seemed more likely. As for Ng Xinwei’s assertion that Rothstar threatened to recall the Loan if the legal mortgage was not given, it would seem that Ng and Ng Xinwei might not have been aware that Rothstar had no right to recall the Loan. In addition, there was nothing in the Deed of Discharge or the Mortgage that supported Rothstar’s assertion that the consideration for the Mortgage was its agreement to consider whether to grant a further loan to AIPL. In any event, as explained in [62] below, even if it was true that the Mortgage was granted in order for Rothstar to consider whether to grant a further loan to AIPL, it would not have made any difference to the outcome of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Rothstar’s submission that the Loan was consideration for the Mortgage simply did not make sense. The Loan Agreement was entered into on <span class="font-italic">9 April 2019</span>. The Equitable Mortgage was given as security for the Loan. The Mortgage was executed only on 2 December 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 However, pursuant to cl 2.1 of the Deed of Discharge, Rothstar had agreed to the termination of the Equitable Mortgage, and the release and discharge of AIPL, Ng and Pictorial from all claims under or in connection with the Equitable Mortgage, in consideration of Ng and Pictorial agreeing to grant the Mortgage. It is true that under the Mortgage, the Property continued to be security for the Loan and AIPL’s liability for the Loan remained. In fact, under the Mortgage, Pictorial and Ng became liable for the Loan as well. Nevertheless, in my view, the discharge of the Equitable Mortgage and release from claims under the Equitable Mortgage constituted valid consideration in law. The value of the consideration for purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), which is dealt with below, was a separate question.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I therefore agreed with Rothstar that it had provided consideration for the Mortgage.

In <span class="font-italic">Corporate Insolvency Law</span>, the authors explained the decision in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon </span>and went on to state as follows (at para 13–35 on p 647):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The position is otherwise, of course, where the company gives security for the indebtedness of a third party, for in that situation realisation of the security does not result in the discharge of any debt owed by the company, which accordingly suffers a loss of a charged asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I agreed with the view expressed in <span class="font-italic">Corporate Insolvency Law</span>. Ng and Pictorial had given the Mortgage as security for their own indebtedness, but also (in fact, primarily) for the indebtedness of AIPL (a third party). It was clear that the creation of the Mortgage could result in the value of the Property being depleted, or as the authors put it in <span class="font-italic">Corporate Insolvency Law</span>, the “loss of a charged asset”. The decision in <span class="font-italic">MC Bacon</span> would not apply in such a situation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Accordingly, I concluded that, as a matter of legal principle, the granting of the Mortgage in this case could constitute an undervalued transaction for the purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether, on the facts, the Mortgage was granted at an undervalue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The next step was to consider whether, on the facts, the Mortgage satisfied the value comparison limb in s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). The value comparison limb requires an assessment (a) of the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration received by Pictorial and Ng, (b) of the value, in money or money’s worth, of the consideration given by Pictorial and Ng, and (c) as to whether the value received was “significantly less” than the value given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees disputed Rothstar’s claim that it had disbursed the Loan to AIPL. However, in my view, on the face of the evidence, there was enough to show that the Loan had been disbursed to AIPL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Rothstar explained that as its available funds then were held in RMB in the People’s Republic of China, AIPL agreed to the Loan being disbursed in RMB in China.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Liquidator and the Private Trustees argued that there was no documentary evidence that the funds came from Rothstar. However, in my view, Rothstar had produced sufficient evidence that the Loan had been disbursed to AIPL, such as to shift the evidential burden to the Liquidator and the Private Trustees. The Liquidator and the Private Trustees had no other evidence to the contrary. During submissions, the Liquidator also accepted that there was no evidence of any conspiracy between Rothstar and Ng.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 That said, the Loan was for the benefit of AIPL. I agreed with the Liquidator and the Private Trustees that Pictorial and Ng could not be said to have received the value of the Loan. AIPL was a separate entity. Pictorial was not even part of the AIPL group of companies. Rothstar relied on the principle in contract law that consideration need only move from the promisee and need not move to the promisor.

</div> Rothstar’s reliance on this principle was clearly misconceived. In this case, the principle clearly had no application. Section 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>expressly requires an assessment as to whether the value of the consideration received by Pictorial and Ng was significantly less than that given by them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Rothstar also argued that the Loan benefited Ng because AIPL was Ng’s main business. I disagreed with Rothstar. The mere fact that Ng was a director and shareholder of AIPL did not mean that Ng therefore received the value of the Loan for purposes of s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). There was no other evidence to show how the Loan benefited Pictorial and/or Ng. Even if it could be said that the Loan benefited Ng in some way, the value of that benefit could not be the full amount of the Loan. There was no basis upon which the value of that benefit could be assessed in money or money’s worth, as required under s 98(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Further, even if one accepted Rothstar’s claim that it gave consideration for the Mortgage by agreeing to consider whether to grant a further loan to AIPL, that was still of no benefit to Pictorial or Ng. In any event, the value of this benefit to Pictorial or Ng (if at all, there was any) was at best dubious and, further, could not be assessed in money or money’s worth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As part of the arrangement under which the Mortgage was given, the Equitable Mortgage was terminated. However, even this was of no benefit to Pictorial and Ng since the Equitable Mortgage was replaced with the Mortgage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On the other hand, pursuant to the Mortgage, Pictorial and Ng gave Rothstar a legal mortgage over the Property, which was valued at approximately $4.5m in March 2020, subject to inspection.

Before the Mortgage was granted, Pictorial’s and Ng’s creditors already had no recourse to the Property to the extent that the Property had been given as security for the Loan, pursuant to the Equitable Mortgage. Under the Mortgage, the Property remained as security for the Loan.

I would only add that it was not clear what was the difference between “valuable consideration” and “good consideration” in s 73B(3); the submissions before me did not deal with this. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the caveat should be removed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Under s 127(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”), a caveatee may summon a caveator to attend before the court to show cause why the caveat should not be withdrawn or otherwise removed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Under s 76(1) read with s 36(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, upon the making of the bankruptcy order, the property of the bankrupt shall vest in the private trustee. Under s 111 of the LTA, when the private trustee takes possession of land under a bankruptcy order, he may lodge a caveat under s 115 of the LTA. The Private Trustees lodged the caveat against the Property based on these provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The thrust of Rothstar’s case was that the Mortgage meant that the Property fell outside the pool of assets that vested in the Private Trustees. Rothstar argued that therefore the Private Trustees had no caveatable interest in Property. As I had found that the Mortgage was void, I dismissed OS 78.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Liquidator and the Private Trustees were entitled to void the Mortgage on the ground that it was an undervalued transaction under s 98 of the Bankruptcy Act. However, they were not entitled to void the Mortgage under s 73B of the CLPA because intent to defraud creditors had not been proved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Accordingly, I dismissed OS 78 and granted the applications in OS 87 and OS 89. I ordered Rothstar to pay the costs of OS 87 fixed at $12,000 inclusive of disbursements and the costs of OS 89 and OS 78 fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Wen Cheng Adrian and Tan Choon Yuan Delson (August Law Corporation) for the plaintiff in Originating Summons No 78 of 2021, the defendant in Originating Summons No 87 of 2021 and Originating Summons No 89 of 2021;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Beng Chye, Raelene Pereira and Yeoh Su Yi (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendants in Originating Summons No 78 of 2021 and the plaintiffs in Originating Summons No 89 of 2021;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sim Kwan Kiat and Wong Ye Yang (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff in Originating Summons No 87 of 2021.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
