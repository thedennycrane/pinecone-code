The Singapore Police Force’s (‘SPF’) role was to convey AGC’s conditional warning to your client. For this purpose, SPF created the case reference number ‘F/20221018/2089’ on 18 October 2022 for its internal administrative records.

She submits that the court did not consider the full extent of the warning. In particular, the element of assurance in the warning in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham</span> as the phrase “in lieu of prosecution” in the warning in <span class="font-italic">Jolovan</span><span class="font-italic"> Wham </span>was considered by the court at [33] together with the phrase “the same leniency may not be shown towards you”. She submits that the AGC’s decision here to issue the Warning instead of initiating criminal proceedings amounts to an assurance not to prosecute for the conduct that is the subject of a stern or conditional warning, if she complies with the conditions set out in the Warning (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to remain crime-free for 12 months). This assurance is reinforced at Note 1 of the Warning, which states “… a decision has been taken not to prosecute you in court for the offence(s).” Based on this, Ms Han submits that the Public Prosecutor is estopped from initiating legal proceedings against her for that conduct if she complies with the condition.

It does not bind the recipient. A conditional stern warning is no more than an expression of opinion coupled with a statement of intent.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A warning does not and cannot amount to a legally binding pronouncement of guilt or finding of fact. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Both stern warnings and conditional stern warnings do not have legal effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As can be seen from the above, there is nothing in the characteristics of a warning that involves an assurance that there would not be any prosecution for past conduct. Indeed, the very nature of a warning is to focus on warning the recipient not to commit any misconduct in the future rather than to provide assurance against prosecution of past misconduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1) ">29 </span>There is also nothing in the language of the Warning that makes the assurance to Ms Han that she would not be prosecuted for the conduct of the Warning, if she remains crime-free for 12 months. The Warning states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. We refer to the Facebook post published on 10 May 2022 on your Facebook account under the name “Kirsten Han”.

Having taken into account the circumstances of the case, the Attorney-General’s Chambers has decided that you should be issued a <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">12</span>-month conditional warning in lieu of instituting proceedings against you for contempt of court. You are warned to refrain from any criminal conduct for a period of 12 months from the date stated on this warning (“crime-free period”).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. If you commit any offence(s) within this crime-free period, you may be prosecuted for the offence(s) you commit during this crime-free period and proceedings may be commenced against you for the contempt of court referred to at paragraph 1.” [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Paragraph 2 of the Warning emphasises that the AGC has decided that Ms Han should be issued a 12-month conditional stern warning in lieu of instituting proceedings against her for contempt of court. This simply conveys AGC’s decision to proceed with a warning instead of instituting proceedings. That does not extend to AGC making an assurance to Ms Han that it would not prosecute her for the conduct that is the subject of the Warning, if she remains crime-free for 12 months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Ms Han submits that the assurance is reinforced by Note 1 of the Warning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. This conditional warning is issued to you because while an assessment that you have committed the offence(s) listed in paragraph 1 has been made, a decision has been taken not to prosecute you in court for the offence(s). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, this part of the Note merely states that a decision has been taken not to prosecute her in court for the offence. There is no assurance made that the AGC would not revisit that decision subsequently, for example, if further information about that misconduct came to the AGC’s attention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Moreover, in so far as Ms Han accepts that the Notes to the Warning are relevant by relying on Note 1 of the Warning, there is a corresponding need to also consider Note 2(d) of the Warning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. This conditional warning: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-italic">does not affect any of your legal rights, interests, or liabilities</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Note hence explicitly reiterates that the conditional warning does not affect any of Ms Han’s legal rights, interests, or liabilities. In other words, the Warning expressly states that it does not affect any of Ms Han’s legal rights or interests of Ms Han. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Furthermore, the foreign authorities which Ms Han cite do not support her submission that the Warning is susceptible to judicial review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Harun bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2009] 3 MLJ 337 (“<span class="font-italic">Harun</span>”), the court found that the prosecution had not made any assurances not to prosecute. On the contrary, the court found at [12] that the prosecution did not state that whatever the outcome of the appeal of the first case, the matter under appeal would not be proceeded with. The court subsequently expressed at [19] that <span class="font-italic">if</span> there was a declaration or promise made by the prosecution not to prosecute, that could be binding. Hence, this case does not assist with the question here of whether there was an assurance in the Warning against prosecution of Ms Han for her past misconduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the English cases of <span class="font-italic">R v Croydon Justices, ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Dean </span>[1993] QB 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Croydon</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">R v Bloomfield </span>1 Cr App R 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Bloomfield</span>”), the prosecution had made assurances that it would not prosecute. In <span class="font-italic">Croydon</span>, the suspect was invited by the police to provide evidence as a prosecution witness and assured that, if he did so, he would not be prosecuted. In <span class="font-italic">Bloomfield</span>, the counsel for the Crown indicated to the defence counsel “in the clearest of terms" that the prosecution wished to offer no evidence against the defendant, as it accepted that the defendant was the victim of a set up. The prosecution also conveyed to the court that it would be offering no evidence against the defendant. The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">R v Abu Hamza </span>[2007] 2 WLR 226 (“<span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span>”) noted at [54] that these representations were “unequivocal assurances” from the prosecution that the defendant would not be prosecuted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Ms Han also seeks to rely on <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span> for the proposition that it could be an abuse of process to prosecute someone who relied on an unequivocal assurance that no prosecution would be brought against that person, especially if the person relied on that assurance and acted to their detriment.

</div>
</div> However, as with the cases of <span class="font-italic">Croydon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bloomfield</span>, <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span> was decided on the basis that there had been assurances given by the prosecution that no prosecution would be brought. The English authorities cited hence do not assist in the question of whether the Warning here contains an assurance not to prosecute Ms Han.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Moreover, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza </span>undermines Ms Han’s submission. The English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza </span>stated at [50], affirming the <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>of the judge below: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As the judge held, circumstances can exist where it will be an abuse of process to prosecute a man for conduct in respect of which he has been given an assurance that no prosecution will be brought. … The judge expressed reservations as to the extent to which one can apply the common law principle of ‘legitimate expectation’ in this field, and we share those reservations. That principle usually applies to the expectation generated in respect of the exercise of an administrative discretion by or on behalf of the person whose duty it is to exercise that discretion. <span class="font-italic">The duty to prosecute offenders cannot be treated as an administrative discretion, for it is usually in the public interest that those who are reasonably suspected of criminal conduct should be brought to trial. Only in rare circumstances will it be offensive to justice to give effect to this public interest</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Such rare circumstances can arise “if police, who are carrying out a criminal investigation, give an unequivocal assurance that a suspect will not be prosecuted and the suspect, in reliance upon that undertaking, acts to his detriment”: <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span> at [51]. Following its examination of the English authorities, including <span class="font-italic">Croydon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Bloomfield</span>, the court in <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span> found at [54] that the English authorities suggest that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is not likely to constitute an abuse of process to proceed with a prosecution unless (i) there has been an <span class="font-italic">unequivocal representation</span> by those with the conduct of the investigation or prosecution of a case that the defendant will not be prosecuted and (ii) that the defendant has acted on that representation to his detriment. Even then, if facts come to light which were not known when the representation was made, these may justify proceeding with the prosecution despite the representation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Here, Ms Han seeks to rely on an assurance that she would not be prosecuted, which she alleges was given <span class="font-italic">indirectly</span> in the Warning, to establish that the Warning had legal effect. Even taking her case at its highest, there is no evidence in the present case of an “unequivocal representation” from the prosecution, which <span class="font-italic">Abu Hamza</span>, that Ms Han relies on, requires. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In summary, in my view, the Warning does <span class="font-italic">not </span>have any form of legal effect. The Warning does not contain an assurance not to prosecute, much less any such unequivocal assurance. Note 2(d) of the Warning also expressly states that it does not affect Ms Han’s legal rights or interests. I thus find that the Warning is not capable of altering Ms Han’s legal rights, interests and liabilities. In other words, the Warning does not contain a decision for the court to quash. In light of this finding in relation to the first Requirement to obtain leave for judicial review (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, susceptibility to judicial review), the other issues relating to the other two Requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian </span>do not arise. This was accepted by Ms Han’s counsel at the hearing.

There is nothing in <span class="font-italic">Husdi</span> that states this. What the Malaysian court did hold there, at p 185, was that it found no statutory provision which gives a right to inspect a police statement. Notably, where the court in <span class="font-italic">Husdi</span> made an observation about FIRs, it was made in relation to Magistrates, and even then, in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1) ">53 </span>More importantly, taking into consideration the definition and explanation of FIR in the CPC, it is clear that what Ms Han submits as qualifying as a FIR is not what the CPC describes as a FIR, nor were they used in the manner contemplated by the CPC for FIRs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> “FIR” is described in s 14 of the CPC as </span>“information [that] is first received at a police station about an offence” and recorded by the “recording officer”, namely the officer in charge of a police station or any other police officer whose duty includes receiving reports relating to the commission of any offence. As explained in <span class="font-italic">The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore - Annotations and Commentary </span>(Jennifer Marie (editor-in-chief) and Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir (general editor) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 04.006, the “primary <span class="font-italic">raison d’être </span>of a first information report is to serve as notice to the police of the possible commission of a cognisable offence so as to set the wheels of investigation in motion”. Under s 16 of the CPC, where the information filed or recorded relates to a non-arrestable offence, the case must be investigated by a police officer; the informant must be referred to a Magistrate; or the case must be referred for mediation. Under s 17 of the CPC, where the police officer has reason to suspect that an arrestable offence has been committed at any place, the Police must, amongst other things, go as soon as practicable to the place to investigate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1) ">55 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">The Warning issued here relates to an instance of </span>contempt of court under s 3(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the AOJPA. Section 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the AOJPA states where that where the AG has reasonable grounds to suspect that contempt of court has been committed, and that it is in the public interest to do so, the AG <span class="font-italic">may</span> by order in writing authorise a police officer to investigate the alleged contempt as if it were an arrestable offence. It is the AG’s position that, in this case, he decided not to order the police to investigate but to instead issue a warning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Viewed in light of the aforementioned statutory provisions in the CPC and the AOJPA, it is clear that the evidence here discloses no FIR in respect of the Warning. The first information received by the AGC (if any) is not a FIR. It is not information that is first received <span class="font-italic">at a police station</span>, as defined by s 14 of the CPC. The initial communication from the AGC to the Police requesting that the Police to convey the AGC’s warning to Ms Han is also not a FIR. Given that it was a request for the Police to convey AGC’s warning, it could not be said to “serve as notice to the police of the possible commission of a cognisable offence so as to set the wheels of investigation in motion”. This is reinforced by the AG’s decision not to authorise the Police to investigate the alleged contempt by an order in writing, <span class="font-italic">per</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the AOJPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I find that, on the facts of this case, there is no FIR in respect of the Warning. There is hence no FIR that could be the subject of a Mandatory Order. Hence, the application for permission to commence judicial review for the mandatory order for Ms Han to be furnished with the FIR in respect of the Warning is misconceived, and dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Alternative prayer: Mandatory order to backdate the Warning </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In her written submissions, Ms Han seeks, in the alternative, for permission to apply for a mandatory order for the Warning to be backdated to 14 July 2022, or any other appropriate date, and for the “crime-free period” set out in the Warning to be backdated to this date.

</div> In view of my finding that the Warning is not justiciable, the issue of whether the Warning should be backdated does not arise. For completeness, I observe that Ms Han’s submission for a mandatory order to backdate the Warning also fails on the basis that she did not include this alternative prayer in her pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Ho Soo Tong and others v Ho Soo Fong and others </span>[2023] SGHC 90 at [43], “[i]t is trite law that parties are bound by their pleadings, and the court is precluded from deciding on matters that have not been put into issue by the parties” (referencing <span class="font-italic">V </span><span class="font-italic">Nithia (co-administratix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [38] and <span class="font-italic">OMG Holdings Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Pos Ad Sdn Bhd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 231 at [21]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Ms Han had only raised this alternative prayer in her written submissions.
