<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against an order of costs made
                    by a District Judge in a defamation action arising from an email sent by the
                    Appellant to two managers of the parent company of the Respondent’s
                    employer. The District Judge had ordered that each party was to bear his own
                    costs after dismissing the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant was a director and shareholder of
                    Daifuku-Wis Technologies Pte Ltd (“DWIST”), a Singapore
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> DWIST is a joint venture between the
                    Appellant and Daifuku Mechatronics (S) Pte Ltd (“DMS”), the
                    Singapore subsidiary of Daifuku Co Ltd (“Daifuku”), a Japanese
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent was DMS’s deputy general
                    manager. At the time of the trial below, the Respondent had been promoted to the
                    position of general manager.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the defamation action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent sued the Appellant for defamation
                    arising from an email in the Japanese language which the Appellant had sent to
                    two members of Daifuku’s “top management” on 6 August
                    2007 (“the Email”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> An agreed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Attn: Inoue Director and Okuno General Manager</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am sorry for sending you this letter abruptly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It’s been quite some time since we last met. I am Low, Ex-President
                        of Singapore DWIST. Do you remember seeing me once in Japan about 2 years
                        ago regarding the sale of DWIST shares?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">About 3 years have passed already since I resigned as President of DWIST,
                        but the transfer of DWIST shares has not been settled, and I am still in
                        deadlock.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is because DMS has been unilaterally pressing down the share value. I
                        was told to keep the share value at zero if I wouldn’t sell to DMS for
                        $0.30 per share. (In fact, DWIST did not have any sales in 2005. All new
                        jobs orders were given to IT Wireless, and orders under maintenance contract
                        were given to sub-contractor of DWIST.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">About 3 years ago, I reported to Shimizu, President of DMS, that [the
                        Respondent] and Ms Quek, both [of whom] were employees of DMS, seemed
                        to be intentionally giving DMS’ orders to a company called IT
                        Wireless, and I showed evidence to him, but was ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Form [<em>sic</em>] 2003, the order value from DMS to
                        IT Wireless has increased continuously, and they achieved quite a large
                        profit. Salaries of Eric Teo and Sam, both [of whom] are Directors of IT
                        Wireless, have increased sharply to S$240,000 in 2006. (Their salaries were
                        S$100,000 in around 2002.) (Sales of DWIST continued to decrease from
                        2003.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The Respondent] and Yong Yong of DMS are originally the founders of IT
                        Wireless, and it appeared on the surface that all shares were sold to Eric
                        Teo and Sam in 2001, but they received dividends payouts in around 2003, and
                        in between 2005 and 2006, Eric Teo and Sam handed over money to [the
                        Respondent] in several instalments. All these evidences [<em>sic</em>] were submitted to the judge by them as part of
                        discovery process during the law suit against Koh, Eric Teo and Sam started
                        last year. (Refer to the attached), the judge has already ruled that [the
                        Respondent] was a Shadow Director of IT Wireless. There is a need for [the
                        Respondent] to appear in court later to defend about Eric Teo and daily
                        operation of IT Wireless. Among the evidences [<em>sic</em>] that were gathered, there were payment vouchers for the
                        commission that IT Wireless paid to Yong Yong of DMS. A company called
                        MobiSoft was set up under the names of Eric Teo and Sma [<em>sic</em>] in 2006, and orders from DMS were transferred to
                        MobiSoft.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I always believe that Daifuku is not a company that bullies Partner
                            [<em>sic</em>]. It is no point talking to Shimizu,
                        Singapore local President. I have been thinking that there is no other way
                        but to sue [the Respondent] and his lot, and show the evidences [<em>sic</em>] to the head office. I wish that I will receive
                        fair treatment one way or another. For these 2 and half [<em>sic</em>] years, I am living a difficult life with debts and just
                        a little income, and waiting for justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Looking forward to your kind attention.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent claimed that the following
                    portions of the Email were defamatory (“the Words”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent pleaded in his Statement of Claim
                    (Amendment No 1) that the natural and ordinary meaning of the Words meant
                    or were understood to mean the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Respondent, together with
                        Ms Quek Yong Yong, an employee of DMS, had abused the power of his
                        position and office at DMS to give business to a company called IT Wireless
                        Pte Ltd (“IT Wireless”), a competitor of DWIST, for personal
                        gain and enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Despite his purported resignation from his position in IT Wireless in
                        2001, the Respondent had continued to be involved in the business of IT
                        Wireless. Arising from that relationship, the Respondent received several
                        secret commissions from IT Wireless for giving it
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Respondent had breached his fiduciary duties to DMS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Respondent is guilty of
                        dishonourable conduct against DMS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Respondent is untrustworthy.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_f"></a>(f)     The court had already ruled against the
                        Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant denied that the Email had any of
                    the meanings set out in the Respondent’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No
                    1) (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Instead, the Appellant claimed that the plain and ordinary or innuendo meaning
                    of the Words (see above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>) was as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant was a past President of
                        DWIST.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     He owned
                        shares in DWIST which he wished to dispose of to DWIST at a fair and
                        reasonable price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     DMS was the other majority shareholder of DWIST.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     A fair and reasonable agreement could
                        not be reached for the sale of the Appellant’s DWIST shares to DMS
                        because the value of DWIST has been kept artificially
                    low.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     One reason the
                        value of DWIST shares was artificially low was because business which would
                        otherwise have been booked by DWIST has been procured for IT Wireless by,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, the Respondent who was and may
                        still be a shadow director of IT Wireless. The Respondent was and still is
                        also an employee of DMS. The Appellant then set out the definition of the
                        term “shadow director” under s 4(1) of the Companies Act
                        (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Appellant averred that the directors of IT Wireless
                        were accustomed to acting on the Respondent’s instructions after he
                        resigned his directorship of IT Wireless on 30 June
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_g"></a>(g)     The Appellant
                        had provided supporting evidence of the Respondent’s involvement in IT
                        Wireless to one Shimizu, the President of DMS, in an attempt to seek his
                        assistance in obtaining a fair and reasonable price for the
                        Appellant’s shares in DWIST.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant then
                    pleaded that the above understanding of the Words was true and therefore
                        justified.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He also raised the
                    defence of qualified privilege.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The District Judge’s first decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The District Judge dismissed the
                    Respondent’s claim (see <em>Koh </em><em>Poh Seng v Low Leong </em><em>Meng</em>
                    [2010] SGDC 256) (“the District Judge’s First
                    Decision”). He held that the Email was not defamatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In his view, the substance of
                    the Email was this (see the District Judge’s First Decision at [21]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I ask for your intervention. The share value of DWIST has come down so
                        that I can’t get a reasonable price for it. The reason that the share
                        value of DWIST has come down is because the plaintiff has been giving
                        business that might have come to DWIST instead to [IT Wireless]. The
                        [Respondent], although he appeared to have sold his shares in [IT Wireless]
                        in 2001, remains financially connected to, and have [<em>sic</em>] profited from, [IT Wireless]. The [Respondent], with
                        others, has been sued. The court has ruled that the [Respondent] still
                        retains influence over [IT Wireless’s] board of directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The District Judge did not consider this interpretation of the Email
                    to be defamatory. He did not think that the Email suggested that the
                    Respondent’s influence over IT Wireless was such that he had
                    “profited at the expense of, or in derogation of his fiduciary duties to
                    DMS” (see the District Judge’s First Decision at [22]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> He
                    did not consider that it was defamatory to call someone a shadow director
                    “unless the context suggested otherwise, which was not the case
                    here” (see the District Judge’s First Decision at [23]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After hearing the parties, Kan J ordered that

                    mind. His views on the meaning of the Email only crystallised as he reviewed the
                    case for the purpose of making his decision (see the District Judge’s
                    Second Decision at [17]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The District Judge was also of

                    Hence, he believed that he could not revisit his findings, in particular, his

                        costs for expending time to prove what the District Judge had ruled to be a

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     The

                        taken into consideration in the court’s exercise of discretion in
                        respect of the costs of the trial (“Head

<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant also applied for leave to appeal
                    against the District Judge’s Second Decision on the ground that all the
                    evidence adduced at trial in support of the Appellant’s defence of
                    justification was also essential to prove his alternate defence of qualified
                    privilege (“Head L”). The Appellant deposed in his affidavit in
                    support of his application for leave that this argument was raised to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I granted the Appellant leave to appeal on

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments at the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Appellant argued that the Email was
                    defamatory when it was read in context because it suggested that the Respondent
                    placed his employer’s business with IT Wireless of which he was a
                    “shadow director”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> He asserted that he
                    should have been awarded costs even if the Email was not held to be defamatory
                    for the following reasons. <em>First</em>, the truthfulness
                    of the statement in the Email that the Respondent was a “shadow
                    director” of IT Wireless was an issue in the proceedings below. This is
                    apparent from the District Judge’s suggestions and comments during the
                        trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and the Respondent’s
                    conduct at trial<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. <em>Second</em>, in defamation actions, costs should be awarded based on
                    the success or failure of the defences advanced as long as the publication was
                    adjudged as being capable of bearing a defamatory meaning. Otherwise, counsel
                    would have to second-guess the judge’s decision on whether the publication
                    is defamatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span><em>Third</em>, the District Judge should have taken into
                    consideration the fact that the parties had incurred considerable pre-trial
                    costs for which the costs order was costs in the cause.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Appellant also argued that although costs
                    are in the discretion of the court, an appellate court may intervene if the
                    discretion has been “manifestly exercised wrongly or exercised on wrong
                    principles” (citing <em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta v Maoro Andrea G</em> [1994]
                        2 SLR(R) 501<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> (“<em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta</em>”) at

                    District Judge’s exercise of discretion was manifestly wrong. The
                    Appellant did not waste any time at trial by pursuing the defence of
                        justification.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Respondent argued that the only portions
                    of the District Judge’s Second Decision which were of relevance were
                        [24]–[25] where he had set out his decision to
                    reaffirm his earlier decision that each party was to bear his own
                        costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent asserted that the Appellant has not appealed against those portions
                    of the District Judge’s Second Decision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Respondent further argued that this appeal
                    was an abuse of process because the Appellant is having another bite at the
                    cherry based on a fresh position that the Email was defamatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> If the Appellant was
                    dissatisfied with the District Judge’s primary finding that the Email was
                    not defamatory, he should have appealed against that aspect of his decision in
                    the First Appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The scope of the appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The rather complicated procedural history of
                    this matter raises interesting issues concerning the scope of the present
                    appeal. The Appellant had <em>five</em> heads of appeal in
                    DCA 43/2010 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). As I
                    observed earlier (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above),
                    Kan J’s remission of the matter to the District Judge seemed to only
                    touch on one of the heads of appeal, <em>viz</em>, Head E.
                    On remission, the District Judge held that he was <em>functus
                        officio</em> in relation to any substantive matters but he
                    nevertheless expressed an opinion that his primary findings were correct (see
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). As a result, the present
                    appeal before me also seemed to raise substantive issues. However, in the
                    decision presently under appeal, the District Judge was merely expressing an
                    opinion because he had ruled (correctly, in my view) that he was <em>functus officio</em> as regards his primary findings. These
                    procedural complications raised two questions in my mind. First, was it within
                    the scope of the present appeal for me to review the District Judge’s
                    primary findings? Second, were the <em>remaining</em> heads
                    of appeal in DCA 43/2010 (<em>ie</em>, Heads A to D)
                    still in issue at the appeal before me?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I do not, however, have to decide these
                    questions because of a development during the hearing of the appeal. Counsel for
                    the Appellant, Mr Simon Jones, withdrew his client’s appeal on all
                    substantive issues. In other words, he was only pursuing his client’s
                    appeal on the District Judge’s affirmation of his earlier decision that
                    each party was to bear his own costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This means that the scope of the appeal before
                    me is limited to whether the District Judge erred in ruling that the Appellant
                    should not get costs (<em>ie</em>, Head G). I should at
                    this juncture mention that I do not think that the Respondent’s contention
                    that the Appellant has not appealed against the portions of the District
                    Judge’s Second Decision in which he affirmed his earlier order as to costs
                    (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above) had any merit. I considered
                    that Head G of the Appellant’s second application for leave to appeal
                    plainly placed in contention the issue of whether the District Judge had erred
                    in his order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable legal principles </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Court of Appeal in <em>Tullio </em><em>Planeta</em> adopted (at
                        <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>) the following exposition of the
                    principles governing cost orders from the headnote of the English Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>Re Elgindata Ltd (No 2)</em>
                    [1993] 1 All ER 232:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The principles on which costs were to be awarded were (i) that
                            <b><em>costs were in the discretion of the
                        court</em></b>, (ii) that <b><em>costs should follow the
                            event except when it appeared to the court that in the circumstances of
                            the case some other order should be made</em></b>, (iii) that the
                        general rule did not cease to apply simply because the successful party
                        raised issues or made allegations that failed, but that he could be deprived
                        of his costs in whole or in part where he had caused a <b><em>significant increase in the length of the proceedings</em></b>, and
                        (iv) that <b><em>where the successful party raised issues or
                            made allegations improperly or unreasonably the court could not only
                            deprive him of his costs but could also order him to pay the whole or
                            part of the unsuccessful party's costs</em></b>. The fourth principle
                        implied, moreover, that <b><em>a successful party who neither
                            improperly nor unreasonably raised issues or made allegations which
                            failed ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the unsuccessful
                            party's costs</em></b> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second principle is also found in
                    O 59 r 3(2) of the ROC. The third and fourth principles set out above
                    are embodied, in a slightly different way, in O 59 r 6A of the
                    ROC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) In addition to and not in derogation of any other provision in this
                        Order, where a party has failed to establish any claim or issue which he has
                        raised in any proceedings, and has thereby <b><em>unnecessarily
                            or unreasonably</em></b> protracted, or added to the costs or
                        complexity of those proceedings, the Court may order that the costs of that
                        party shall not be allowed in whole or in part, or that any costs occasioned
                        by that claim or issue to any other party shall be paid by him to that other
                        party, regardless of the outcome of the cause or matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A summary of the applicable principles may also be found in my
                    decision in <em>Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter
                        and others (Tung Yu-Lien Margaret and others, third parties)</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 582 at [34]–[36].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I find that the District Judge was manifestly
                    wrong in the exercise of his discretion. The Appellant’s conduct of the
                    litigation was reasonable for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     First, the District Judge’s comments
                    during the trial suggested that he considered the issue of whether the
                    Respondent was a shadow director of IT Wireless to be relevant. The Appellant
                    cannot therefore be faulted for continuing to pursue the issue. As the Appellant
                    has correctly pointed out, the following comments and indications from the
                    District Judge would have reasonably led him to believe at that time that it was
                    relevant to prove that the Respondent was a shadow director of IT
                    Wireless:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     When the Respondent requested for
                        the District Judge to make a preliminary ruling as to whether the words
                        complained about were defamatory, the District Judge stated that he would
                        have to hear the evidence. His view was that there would be “no time
                        savings” with making such a preliminary ruling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     When the Respondent was asked if he recalled
                        signing IT Wireless’ cheques, the Respondent replied that he could not
                        recall. The District Judge then interjected and expressed his surprise that
                        the Respondent would forget signing his cheques.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> The District Judge’s
                        interjection suggested that he felt that it was relevant for the Appellant
                        to pursue the truth of whether the Respondent was a shadow director in IT
                        Wireless.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     On
                        the second day of the trial, the Respondent was further cross-examined on
                        the issue of his signing IT Wireless’ cheques. When the Respondent was
                        asked whether he was aware that he remained as an authorised signatory for
                        IT Wireless’ cheques at the material time, the District Judge
                        interjected again and stated that the issue was whether the Respondent
                        signed cheques and not whether he remained as a signatory.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should also
                    mention that, at the hearing before me, I asked the Respondent’s counsel
                    to bring to my attention any part of the District Judge’s notes of
                    evidence in which he (<em>ie</em>, the District Judge)
                    indicated that the issue of whether the Respondent was a shadow director was
                    irrelevant. The Respondent was not able to refer me to any such
                    indication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Second, and perhaps more importantly, although
                    the District Judge’s finding that the Email was not defamatory is not on
                    appeal, it was <em>at least </em><em>arguable</em> that the Email was defamatory. It is well established
                    that the test for determining the natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly
                    defamatory words is the meaning that the words would “convey to an
                    ordinary reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his
                    general knowledge and common sense” (see <em>Review
                        Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another
                        appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52 at [27]). In my view, the natural and ordinary meaning of the Email
                    was that the Respondent was diverting business from DMS (his employer) to IT
                    Wireless, a company of which he was a shadow director and from which he was
                    receiving dividends. It is arguable that this meaning of the Email was
                    defamatory. It is, of course, not defamatory to simply call someone a shadow
                    director. However, the Email goes beyond that. The suggestion is that the
                    Respondent was engaged in self-dealing. In establishing the defence of
                    justification which the Appellant had pleaded as one of his defences, the
                    Appellant would have to prove, <em>inter alia</em>, at the
                    trial that the Respondent was indeed a shadow director of IT Wireless, the
                    company that the Respondent was diverting business to whilst as an employee of
                    DMS. If it was arguable that the Email was defamatory, then the
                    Appellant’s conduct of the litigation in the proceedings below was
                    reasonable. There was no reason therefore to depart from the general rule that
                    costs should follow the event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Since the Appellant’s conduct of the
                    litigation in the proceedings below was reasonable, the general rule that costs
                    follow the event should have been followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For the reasons above, I allow the appeal. The
                    District Judge’s order that each party was to bear his own costs of the
                    trial is set aside. I order the Respondent to pay the Appellant’s costs of
                    the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Unless the parties wish to be heard on costs,
                    the Appellant is further entitled to the costs of this appeal.</p>
