The plaintiff purchased a property from the first defendant, with the belief that the rental yield of the property would inevitably rise.  The plaintiff also believed that it could be re-sold at a higher price.  When the plaintiff’s expectations did not materialise, the present suit was initiated against the first defendant, as well as the second to fourth defendants, who are the original tenants of the property. The central theme of the plaintiff’s complaint is that the defendants had conspired to artificially inflate the rental yield of the property.  The plaintiff’s purchase was therefore pegged to an allegedly  inflated price that did not represent the property’s true market value.  The two causes of action relied on by the plaintiff are fraudulent misrepresentation and unlawful means conspiracy.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The property which is the subject of the dispute is a mixed-used building located at 44 and 46 Changi Road, Singapore (“the Property”).

However, the fourth defendant did not agree to this proposal.  He and his father, the third defendant, in fact wanted a reduction in the rental and saw no need for any renovations to the building.

There is no dispute that the first defendant had passed copies of the two tenancy agreements to his property agent for the purposes of marketing the Property for sale.  This had the desired effect.  When the Offer was made to buy the Property from the first defendant, it was expressly stated that the offer was made “subject to [the] existing tenancy” of “S$35,000”.

</div>  While the figure in the Offer was S$500 short of the rental yield of the Property at the material time, the parties were clearly referring to the combined rental yield generated from the second to fourth defendants and Golden Sands.  Similarly, when the OTP was granted by the first defendant to the plaintiff, it was expressed that “[t]he Property is sold subject to existing tenancies currently comprised in the two (2) Tenancy Agreements…”.

</div>  Hence, regardless of how Mr Lee came to know of the tenancy agreements which showed that the rental yield of the Property was S$35,500 per month, such information undoubtedly emanated from the first defendant, and was fully intended for potential purchasers of the Property like the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It was also immaterial that the representation that the Property was generating a monthly rental income of S$35,500 had been made <span class="font-italic">before </span>the incorporation of the plaintiff.  As Steven Chong J (as he then was) held in <span class="font-italic">Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 990<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It does not matter that the entity bringing the suit did not exist at the time the representation was first made <span class="font-italic">so long as the representation was intended to be communicated to the representee and, having been so communicated, was an operative factor in its mind at the time it was relied on</span> … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The next question is whether a representation that the Property was <span class="font-italic">then</span> generating monthly rental income of S$35,000 is also tantamount to representing that the Property <span class="font-italic">would be able to</span> generate rental income of S$35,500 monthly, which is the precise manner in which the Representation has been pleaded.  I find that the use of the word “<span class="font-italic">would</span>” creates ambiguity.  It may suggest a thing that may happen in the future.  Having said that, in my judgment, a commonsensical understanding by a potential buyer on being shown the two tenancy agreements was that the Property was generating a monthly rental income of S$35,500 and that the tenancies were genuine.  In other words, by making the two tenancy agreements available to potential purchasers like the plaintiff and or Mr Lee, the first defendant was effectively stating that “this building is <span class="font-italic">capable of</span> generating monthly rental income of S$35,500, as shown by the two tenancies in place, which are genuine agreements”.  In that limited sense, I am prepared to accept that a representation of fact that the Property would be <span class="font-italic">able to</span> generate monthly rental income of S$35,500 was indeed made by the first defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 However, insofar as the plaintiff is suggesting that the first defendant had represented that the Property <span class="font-italic">would be able to </span>generate a monthly rental income of S$35,000 <span class="font-italic">after the expiry of the 2013 Lease</span>, such a representation would in effect amount to a warranty as to the future rent of the Property, after the 2013 Lease had expired.  Such a representation would amount to a statement as to something that would happen in the future, and would not be an actionable representation, since a “representation is a statement which relates to a matter of fact, which may be a <span class="font-italic">past or present fact</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng and others v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd</span>  [2003] 3 SLR (R) 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [12]; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 11.029).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 By way of illustration, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng</span>, certain representations were made in promotional materials sent to a “chosen few” prior to the launch of a proprietary social club, which suggested that members who signed up would be part of an exclusive group.  After the club opened, the appellants experienced crowdedness at the club premises, and it was subsequently discovered that the club had admitted 19,000 of such “exclusive” founder members.  The appellants sued for misrepresentation and breach of contract.  The Court of Appeal found that the statements in the promotional materials were not representations of fact, as they pertained to “matters as to the future”, and were instead “future promise[s]” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Seng </span>at [17] and [21]), in which the proper cause of action laid not in an action for misrepresentation, but for the breach of an implied<span class="font-italic"> </span>term of the contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In this case, it has not been pleaded that the Representation amounted to a breach of a promise.  Instead, the plaintiff’s case against the first defendant rests solely on the allegation that the Representation amounted to a fraudulent <span class="font-italic">misrepresentation</span>.

</div> <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">f </span>the plaintiff meant to say that the Representation included a warranty about the <span class="font-italic">future </span>rental yield of the Property, such would not be actionable as a misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In any event, and more importantly, I am fortified in my view that the Representation did not include a representation as to the future rental yield of the Property because the only information or representation which emanated from the first defendant were the tenancy agreements.  Such tenancy agreements would not have been understood by a reasonable commercial buyer of the Property as an assurance as to the amount of rental income that was obtainable on the Property in the future <span class="font-italic">after</span> the expiry of the tenancy agreements (which included the 2013 Lease).  Put simply, a reasonable buyer would not expect, through being shown the <span class="font-italic">existing </span>tenancy agreements to a property, to be given a warranty that the rental yield would never go down.  The rent obtainable is quite obviously dependent on a wide variety of factors, including market forces which are beyond the seller’s control.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Therefore, I find that the Representation was made, although it bears emphasis that such the Representation did not extend to a warranty or a promise relating to the rental yield <span class="font-italic">after </span>the expiry of the 2013 Lease.  As stated earlier, I also find that the Representation was made with the intention that it be acted upon by potential purchasers, such as the plaintiff.  As Ms Chew explained, the tenancy agreements were given to the first defendant’s property agent to forward to potential purchasers.

</div>  This statement was made in the context of negotiations between the fourth defendant and Ms Tang for the renewal of the 2013 Lease, and was followed immediately with the fourth defendant informing Ms Tang that, despite “suffering every month” due to his poor business, he was paying the plaintiff the rent timeously every month.

</div>  These statements preceded the commencement of the present suit.  In my view, they clearly show that the evidence contradicts the plaintiff’s belated allegation that the tenants somehow received kickbacks from the first defendant to support what is asserted to be the artificially inflated rent under the 2013 Lease.  Instead, while the tenants were “suffering” in light of business conditions, they continued to pay “out of [their] pocket[s]”.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 That being the case, it is not possible for me to arrive at a conclusion that the 2013 Lease was “bogus”, as alleged.  The rent may have been high, but the plaintiff has not proven that the tenancy agreement was not genuine.  I would also add that there was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to show that the monthly rent of S$30,000 per month for the first and second storeys of the Property was much higher than the market rate of similar properties in the vicinity.  Put another way, the plaintiff has not shown that the monthly rental of S$30,000 was not a realistically achievable rent for the Property.  Evidence of such nature might have lent more credence to the allegation that the rent of S$30,000 was artificially inflated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Therefore, the Representation that the Property would be able to generate rental income of S$35,500 was simply not false – as represented, the Property generated a monthly rent of S$35,500 at the time the Offer was made.  After Golden Sands moved out, the rental yield of the Property fell to S$30,000 per month.  However, as the plaintiff admits, the change in circumstances were known to the plaintiff, who decided nonetheless, on Mr Hau’s assurance, to continue with the purchase of the Property as it was assumed that another tenant could easily be found to occupy the vacant third storey.  Hence, any representation relating to the rental yield of the Property was true, and there is thus no operative misrepresentation to speak of.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Clements’ statements to Ms Tang</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80  In my judgment, Mr Clements’ statements to Ms Tang, which suggests that the quantum of rent had been misstated, does not change the fact that the Representation was at all times true.  As Ms Tang herself sceptically observed in her conversation with Mr Clements when told that the rent in 2013 Lease was only “on paper”, the full rent of S$30,000 per month was always paid by the tenants.

</div>  Thus, without more evidence to support Mr Clements’ assertion that the first defendant had “cheated” the plaintiff by artificially inflating the rental yield of the Property, it is difficult to abscribe much weight to Mr Clements’ statements (see [60] above).  Mr Clements’ statements to Ms Tang were also inaccurate in several respects.  For example, Mr Clements’ assertion that the rental was doubled from S$12,000 a month

</div>  All this suggests that a more plausible explanation for Mr Clements’ allegation of the first defendant’s “cheating” was that it was an attempt to negotiate a lower rent for the tenants, who he was trying to portray as victims of the alleged “cheating” as well.  After all, Ms Tang herself admitted that she had told the tenants that the plaintiff had other offers of tenancy for the Property, when in truth there were none.  This was part of her “negotiation strategy” to push up the renewal rent.

</div>  First of all, this alleged admission was not pleaded by the plaintiff.  This is exactly the type of allegation that ought to be pleaded because it would otherwise take the second to fourth defendants by surprise.  Since the allegation was never pleaded, the fourth defendant can hardly be faulted for not challenging this allegation in his own affidavit of evidence-in-chief.  In fact, this allegation made its first appearance in the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Mr Lee.  Relying on the fourth defendant’s silence on this issue in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff argues that the defendants had conceded and accepted the plaintiff’s version of what had transpired at the September 2016 meeting – namely, that the tenants had admitted to entering into the 2013 Lease to help the first defendant sell the Property at an inflated price.

</div>  Having assessed his credibility and the events that followed that meeting, I accept this evidence.  Mr Lee’s own conduct is inconsistent with any such admission being made.  If he was indeed told of a scheme by the defendants in September 2016 to cheat him, I would be very surprised that he took no action at all in the months that followed to find out more about the scheme or to seek legal redress.  Instead, his instructions were for Ms Tang to continue to negotiate a renewal of the tenancy with the third and fourth defendants, which she did in March 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As for the March 2017 meeting between the fourth defendant, Ms Tang and Mr Clements, my review of the Transcript, the Recording and the evidence of Ms Tang and the fourth defendant under cross-examination, leads me to find that the fourth defendant did not acknowledge or confirm Mr Clements’ statements that there was a scheme to cheat the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 While it might sound convenient, it does indeed appear true that, for several minutes during the meeting, the fourth defendant was engaged in a phone call.

</div>  A review of the Transcript shows that he re-joined the discussions abruptly, and that he had a different idea of what the alleged “cheating” referred to.  This requires some elaboration.  According to the fourth defendant, the first defendant had informed the tenants that they could use the third storey of the Property as an office and that the relevant permission from the authorities had been obtained.  Relying on this assurance, the tenants renovated and occupied the third storey as an office, but they were then promptly ordered by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) to move out as no permit had in fact been granted to the first defendant (“URA’s order”).  The tenants were thus required by URA to demolish the office, and were out of pocket because the first defendant did not compensate them.

</div> when in fact, the fourth defendant was telling her to tell Mr Lee that he should “let go” of his demand for a higher renewal rent.

The business decision took into account the goodwill they had generated from operating at the premises, the fact that they would further enjoy the use of the second storey of the Property, that they could still afford to pay the higher rent and remain profitable, as well as the fact that they had incurred renovation expenses in relation to the Property.

During the meetings, Mr Hau informed Mr Lee that the second to fourth defendants were “good tenants who had been leasing the Property for a long time, and that they always paid their rent on time”.  Furthermore, the third storey was being rented by Golden Sands.  Based on what Mr Hau told him about the rental income from the Property and its long term tenants, Mr Lee considered the Property to be an attractive investment, and he thus agreed to purchase the Property at S$11m.

</div>  Armed with these observations, Mr Lee anticipated that the Property’s rental yield or value would increase over time.  Thus, he could either make a profit by selling it off, or he could turn it into a “long-term money-making business”.  This was because he considered that the tenants had occupied the premises for about a decade, and that they were “good operator[s]”.  Given their lengthy occupation of the premises, Mr Lee believed that they would continue with their lease after it had expired.  Hence, if he could make the tenants pay a monthly rental of “40 or 50 thousand per month” after he incurred some capital expenditure in refurbishing the Property, he would be able to make a profit of “about 7, 8 thousand a month”, after deducting the plaintiff’s monthly mortgage repayments of S$42,000 on the Property.

It was based on the fact that the second to fourth defendants were paying S$30,000 per month that Mr Lee formed the view, based on his “experience” and Mr Hau’s recommendation that, since the tenants were “good operators”, they would eventually be prepared to stay on and pay up to S$40,000 to S$50,000 in rent each month after the Property was refurbished.  This made the Property a good investment from the perspective of the plaintiff.  Hence, even when the rental income fell to S$30,000 before the OTP was issued, the plaintiff continued with its purchase of the Property at the price of S$11m, without renegotiating its offer.  I therefore find that the element of reliance on the Representation is made out on the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I should add that, from my analysis of Mr Lee’s evidence, he made a number of assumptions about the second to fourth defendants, which turned out to be erroneous.  He assumed that the tenants would be prepared to pay significantly higher rent (in the region of S$40,000 to S$50,000) if the plaintiff renovated the building.  But, as became clear during his discussions with the tenants before and after he completed the purchase of the Property, they did not think that there was any need for any renovations for the Property, and they were not prepared to pay such a high rent (see [16]–[17] above).  Mr Lee also assumed that the second to fourth defendants would definitely want to stay on as tenants given their long association with the Property.  But, he did not seem to appreciate that the second to fourth defendants could move to alternative premises just a few doors away, if they really could not afford the rent being demanded for the Property.  The unchallenged evidence of the fourth defendant was that, at various times, his and the third defendant’s businesses had use of leased premises at not only the Property, but also at 48A, 48C, 48D and 58 Changi Road, which were all within close vicinity of the Property.

The alleged misrepresentation was that the Property was capable of generating rental income of S$35,500 per month.  This amount fell to S$30,000 after Golden Sands vacated the premises, but the plaintiff remained content with proceeding with the purchase of the property.  The main difficulty for the plaintiff is the fact that the S$30,000 rent was actually paid in full and punctually by the second to the fourth defendants until the expiry of the 2013 Lease.

</div>  It cannot therefore be argued that the plaintiff suffered any loss of the rental income attributable to the Representation (which related to the rental yield of the Property) for the period that the 2013 Lease subsisted.  As for the period thereafter, it bears emphasising that the Representation did not operate as a warranty as to the quantum of rent obtainable in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The plaintiff has argued that it overpaid for the Property as a consequence of its reliance on the Representation.  The plaintiff’s case is that it purchased the Property at the price of S$11m on the basis that the rental income payable under the 2013 Lease was indeed S$30,000.  Assuming that the rent was “bogus”, in that it was artificially inflated for the purposes of inducing the plaintiff to buy the Property, there is no expert evidence before me as to what then would have been the actual market value of the Property.  The material times would be when the plaintiff offered to purchase the Property for S$11m in November 2014, and when he eventually exercised the OTP in February 2016.  The onus is on the plaintiff to establish that he overpaid for the Property and thus show that he suffered some loss in the form of the overpayment.  But, no expert evidence was led as to the true market value of the Property at the material times.  Thus, the plaintiff has also failed to show that it has suffered loss in relation to the value of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In totality, for all the reasons above, I therefore find that the plaintiff’s claim in fraudulent misrepresentation is flawed in several important aspects and must fail.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Turning to the claim in conspiracy against all four defendants, the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 1 SLR 860<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [112] that, to succeed in an unlawful means conspiracy claim, a plaintiff must show that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the alleged conspirators had the intention to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff by those acts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the acts were unlawful;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the acts were performed in furtherance of the agreement; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) the plaintiff suffered loss as a result of the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiff’s claim in unlawful means conspiracy is fraught with much of the same difficulties that plague its claim in fraudulent misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The plaintiff’s case in conspiracy is premised on the scheme, under which it is alleged that the first defendant entered into an arrangement with the second to fourth defendants to artificially inflate the rental income of the Property so as to induce potential purchasers like the plaintiff to purchase the Property.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 However, given my finding that the 2013 Lease was not a “bogus” one (at [76]–[79] above), and that the tenants had legitimate reasons to enter into the lease (at [98]–[103] above), it is clear that the defendants did not combine together to inflate the rental income of the Property so as to cause damage to the plaintiff.  My finding that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation made to the plaintiff also renders the claim in conspiracy untenable.  There was no unlawful act to speak of.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Furthermore, even if a conspiracy is proven, the plaintiff has not shown how it has suffered any loss, whether in rental income or in the loss of value of the Property, which would have been the alleged result of said conspiracy.
