<p xmlns="">summons was for a stay of execution of judgment pending appeal. Mr Tan had waited until 8

May 2002, more than five months after the original deadline for filing the notice of

appeal, to withdraw that prayer. That would have obstructed or delayed enforcement action

by the defendant. The defendant has obviously been prejudiced (see  16). </p>

        This is an appeal by the Plaintiff against my

order of 8 May 2002 dismissing his application in OS 434 of 2002 for extension of time to

file a notice of appeal against the decision of District Judge Laura Lau of 12 November

2001 in DC Suit No.784/2000.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2

        The Defendant had commenced two actions in the

District Court against the Plaintiffs, viz. DC Suit No.229/2000 and the aforementioned DC

Suit No.784/2000. These two actions were consolidated and District Judge Laura Lau

dismissed the first one and gave judgment for the Defendant (i.e. the plaintiff in the

suit) in the second. The Plaintiff naturally was happy with the decision in DC Suit

No.229/2000, but not so with that in DC Suit No.784/2000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3

        The last day of filing of the Notice of Appeal

permitted by the rules was 26 November 2001. On 23 November, the Plaintiff instructed his

solicitors to file the appeal. He did this by telephone as he was in Japan at the time.

However the appeal was not filed on time. His counsel, Mr Simon Tan, explained what had

happened in an affidavit filed in this summons:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3. The [Plaintiff] instructed us

    to appeal against the decision of the learned District Judge… His instructions were

    given before the period to appeal expired on 26 November 2001.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4. However, we discovered that

    our client did not have the funds in our client’s account to deposit the sum of

    S$3,000 with the Accountant-General. As he was outstationed in Japan, he could only give

    us the sum of S$3,000 upon his return from Japan which he eventually did on 7 December

    2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5. On his assurance that he will

    put me in funds upon his return, I issued a .. cheque … dated 26 November 2001 in

    favour of the Accountant-General but my court clerk was unable to file the application

    before the expiry date on 26 November 2001. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6. On 5 December 2001, I

    proceeded to apply to the Subordinate Courts for leave to file the Notice of Appeal out of

    time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7. On 17 January 2002, the

    application was heard by … Magistrate Mr Adam Nakhoda and I was given leave to

    withdraw the application on the basis that it should have been filed in the High Court

    pursuant to Order 55D Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8. On 30 January 2002, my firm

    re-filed the application electronically but due to inadvertence on my firm’s part, it

    was re-fixed [for] hearing again in the Subordinate Courts despite the fact that we

    indicated that this application was to be heard in the High Court.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9. The application came up for

    hearing on 18 March 2002 and it was heard by … District Judge Laura Lau …

    whereby she gave me leave to withdraw the application again with no order as to costs.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4

        It would appear from Mr Tan’s affidavit,

and indeed he conceded before me, that there were three mistakes made by his firm:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(i) failing to file the Notice of

    Appeal on 26 November 2001;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(ii) on 5 December 2001, applying

    for leave to appeal out of time by way of SIC in the action in the District Court instead

    of by Originating Summons in the High Court; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(iii) on 30 January 2002, filing

    the Originating Summons in the Subordinate Courts instead of the High Court. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was only on the fourth attempt

on 28 March 2002 in the present summons that Mr Tan’s firm was able to get it

correct. By that time slightly over four months had elapsed since 26 November 2001, the

date due to file the Notice of Appeal under the Rules of Court. In connection with these

three mistakes there were three instances of unexplained delays as I shall elaborate

below.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mistake No. 1</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5

        In respect of the failure to file the Notice of

Appeal on 26 November 2001, Mr Tan gave some explanation in Chambers about his firm’s

cheque being unacceptable that I was unable to make sense of. He certainly did not

elaborate in his affidavit why his court clerk was unable to file the application on that

day. Neither did he back it up with any document. The long and short of it is that he had

failed to file a Notice of Appeal by the date due under the Rules of Court.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Delay No. 1</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6

        By itself, this mistake is not necessarily

fatal. Any solicitor would have taken immediate steps to rectify it by making an

application to extend time. Unfortunately Mr Tan chose not to take any immediate action.

Instead he waited a good eight days before filing in such an application on 5 December

2001. He gave no explanation in his affidavit for this delay.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mistake No.<b> </b>2</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7

        But he still was unable to get it right.

Instead of making an application to the High Court, he applied to the Subordinate Courts.

Order 55D of the Rules of Court provides for appeals from the Subordinate Courts to the

High Court. In respect of an application for extension of time to file and service notice

of appeal, O 55D r 14 provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Without prejudice to the power of

    the High Court under Order 3, Rule 4, to extend the time prescribed by any provision of

    this Order, the period for filing and serving the notice of appeal under paragraph (1) of

    Rule 4 may be extended by the Court below on application made before the expiration of

    that period.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8

        It is clear on the face of this rule that an

application for extension of time may be made to the Court below only if it is made before

the expiration of the period for filing and serving the notice of appeal. If that period

has expired, then the application can only be made to the High Court pursuant to its

general powers to extend time under O 3 r 4. If the construction of O 55D r 14 (or its

predecessor) had not been clear before, any doubt would have been eradicated since the

High Court decision in <i>Chen Chien Wen v Pearson</i> [1991] SLR 578. The matter there

pertains to O 57 r 4 of the Rules of Supreme Court in force at the time, which is in the

same terms as O 55D r 14 under consideration. Order 57 r 4 provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Without prejudice to the power of

    the Court of Appeal under O 3 r 5, to extend the time prescribed by any provision of this

    Order, the period for serving notice of appeal under r 4 … may be extended by the

    Court below on application made before the expiration of that period.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was held that the High Court

has no jurisdiction to extend time to serve the notice of appeal where the application is

made after expiration of the prescribed period for service and that an extension of time

in such circumstances can only be granted by the Court of Appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9

        Mr Tan said that he was misled by the decision

in <i>Tan Thye Heng v Pan Mercantile</i> [1989] SLR 973. The appellant there filed a

notice of appeal within the prescribed time but served it one day late, on the fifteenth

day. The appellant applied to the High Court for extension of time for service. The

respondent raised a preliminary objection on the basis that such an application should

have been made to the District Court as there was no appeal yet before the High Court.

This argument was accepted by the judge. However that case concerns the Subordinate Courts

Rules 1986. The present case falls under the Rules of Court (1997 Ed) which is an entirely

different regime as the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts rules have become merged.

Under O 3 r 4 of the Rules of Court the High Court has jurisdiction to extend any period

prescribed in those rules, including the period for filing notice of appeal against the

decision of a Subordinate Court. Crucially, there is no equivalent provision to O 55D r 14

in the Subordinate Courts Rules 1986. It is therefore difficult to comprehend how any

solicitor can be misled by that decision.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Delay No. 2</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10

        When the application came up for hearing before

the Registrar at the Subordinate Courts on 17 January 2002, Mr Tan withdrew it upon

realising the correct legal position. But again he did not act with expedition even though

by now he was already more than one and a half months out of time. He waited another

twelve days before filing the OS application on 30 January 2002. No reason was given in

his affidavit for this delay.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mistake No.<b> </b>3</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11

        For the third time Mr Tan or his firm could not

get it right. Due to "inadvertence", the application was again filed in the

Subordinate Courts. He appears to suggest that it was on account of the Electronic Filing

System ("EFS"). He said that this was despite the fact that they had "<i>indicated

that this application was to be</i> <i>heard in the High Court</i>". However he did

not elaborate on this. If it was on account of unfamiliarity with the EFS system, I would

say two things. Firstly, the EFS was already up and running since March 2000, almost years

earlier. Secondly, it is a matter of specifying the Court concerned. Mr Tan did not deem

it fit to explain how this inadvertence came about. The onus is upon him to explain it

clearly and he had chosen not to.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Delay No. 3</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12

        Mr Tan realised the error on 18 March 2002 when

he appeared before District Judge Laura Lau. For a third time, he did not act to file the

present summons until 28 March 2002, a lapse of nine days. Yet again, no explanation was

given for this delay. As I have pointed out earlier, by this time more than four months

had passed since the original deadline for filing the notice.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Merits of the appeal</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13

        This action is a claim for the sum of $122,700

in respect of a quantity of Koi fish that the Defendant claimed he had sold to the

Plaintiff. In his defence, the Plaintiff denied the existence of such a transaction. The

decision of the District Judge would turn substantively on questions of fact. In arriving

at that decision the judge would have had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the

witnesses and observing them in the course of the trial which lasted seven days. The

Plaintiff would have great difficulty in appealing against findings of fact.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Conclusion</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14

        In relation to the three mistakes, any single

one might, in the circumstances, have moved the Court to exercise its discretion to extend

time. But three mistakes were made and there is no full and frank explanation as to how

they came about.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15

        On top of that the Plaintiff’s counsel had

not acted with the due expedition that the Court would expect in such matters. This

happened not once but three times, resulting in a wholly unnecessary delay of 29 days.

This has to be considered in the context of the 14-day period under the Rules of Court for

the Plaintiff to file and serve the notice of appeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16

        Furthermore, the entire proceedings was dragged

out for four months as a result. One of the prayers in this summons is for a stay of

execution of judgment pending appeal. Although Mr Tan had withdrawn that prayer at the

hearing before me, that was not until 8 May 2002, more than five months after the date due

for filing notice of appeal. That would have obstructed or delayed enforcement action by

the Defendant. The Defendant has obviously been prejudiced by this.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17

        The circumstances of this case clearly do not

justify the Court exercising its discretion to extend the time to file and serve the

notice of appeal. To do so would also send the wrong signal to the profession as to the

standard demanded of it by the Courts and the public. </font></p>
