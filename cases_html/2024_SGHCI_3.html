The success of these grounds all hinge upon showing that Mr Agrawal’s signature on the Guarantee Letter was forged or that he signed without authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The ground of fraud is not, upon analysis, a distinct ground for setting aside. It is only if Shanghai Electric forged the Guarantee Letter that Shanghai Electric’s officer, Ms Yu, adduced false evidence to the Tribunal by testifying that Mr Agrawal signed the Guarantee Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The ground that the Award is contrary to the public policy of the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span> (<span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>, Singapore) in turn depends on showing that the Award was procured by fraud, which is contrary to Singaporean public policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, the premise of Reliance Infrastructure’s case remains that the arbitration agreement was invalid either because the Guarantee Letter is the product of forgery or that Mr Agrawal had no authority to execute it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Hence, we proceed to consider the following questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether Reliance Infrastructure waived its right to challenge the Award on the grounds of forgery and want of authority; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If not, whether Reliance Infrastructure proved that –</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Guarantee Letter was forged; or </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Mr Agrawal lacked authority to make agreements to arbitrate with Shanghai Electric.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether Reliance Infrastructure is precluded by waiver from raising its grounds to set aside the Award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Our starting point is Art 16(2) of the Model Law – having the force of law in Singapore (as the <span class="font-italic">lex loci </span><span class="font-italic">arbitri</span>) under s 3(1) of the IAA 1994 – which provides that “[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence”. If raised later in the arbitral process, then the tribunal must be persuaded that the delay in raising the plea was a “justified” one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The fundamental purpose behind Art 16(2) is to require parties to raise objections to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal at the earliest possible time: <span class="font-italic">Hunan </span><span class="font-italic">Xiangzhong Mining Group Ltd v Oilive Pte Ltd </span>[2022] 5 SLR 239 (“<span class="font-italic">Hunan </span><span class="font-italic">Xiangzhong</span>”) at [42]. A party should be treated as having waived its right to raise a jurisdictional objection in a setting aside proceeding if it had made a decision not to raise it during the arbitration when it ought to have done so at that juncture: <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA and others and other </span><span class="font-italic">matters</span> [2020] 5 SLR 266 (“<span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA</span>”) at [64] (see also <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd</span> [2019] 2 SLR 131 at [50]–[51] and [61]–[62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, a party will only be deemed to have waived its rights if the objection was clear to the party and they knew of the objection: <span class="font-italic">BAZ v BBA</span> at [59]. Crucially, the question is whether the party had knowledge of the “<span class="font-italic">matters</span> <span class="font-italic">underlying</span> the jurisdictional objection so that it <span class="font-italic">could have objected</span> in a timely fashion during the arbitration [emphasis added]” itself: per the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) decision in <span class="font-italic">Deutsche Telekom AG v The Republic of India</span> [2023] SGHC(I) 7 (“<span class="font-italic">Deutsche Telekom v India</span>”) at [165] (affirmed on appeal by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG</span> [2023] SGCA(I) 10).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The SICC also considered whether “India had <span class="font-italic">good reason for</span> holding back on the three allegations due to lack of evidence and still–ongoing investigations [emphasis added]” and whether its “failure to raise the three illegality allegations in the Arbitration was <span class="font-italic">justified</span><span class="font-italic"> or excusable</span> [emphasis added]” (<span class="font-italic">Deutsche Telekom v India</span> at [169] and [171]). Thus, once a party s<span class="font-italic">ubjectively</span> knows of facts that ground the jurisdictional objection, failure to raise it is only justified or excused for good reason which is a matter for <span class="font-italic">objective </span>evaluation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reliance Infrastructure waived its right to challenge the Award based on forgery</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 We consider the state of Reliance Infrastructure’s actual knowledge of the facts underlying its right to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, based on the alleged forgery of the Guarantee Letter at two stages. First, when the claim was originally made and it could find no mention or documentation thereof within its internal company records. Secondly, after the hearing when it was told that the original Guarantee Letter was not printed on its original letterhead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, it is Reliance Infrastructure’s own case that it only learnt of the existence of the Guarantee Letter, for the very first time, when Shanghai Electric raised it in its Notice of Dispute, and that it saw a copy of that document – again, for the <span class="font-italic">first time</span> – when Shanghai Electric appended that copy to its Notice of Arbitration. According to Mr Parakh, when Reliance Infrastructure received a copy “for the first time” on or around 13 December 2019, it checked its internal records and could find no “evidence of the existence of the purported Guarantee Letter in its records”.

It would have been a basic step to ask him the question directly. This was not done. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In short, subjectively knowing that the absence of record meant that the Guarantee Letter might be forged, Reliance Infrastructure did not have good reason for not raising the jurisdictional objection.

The Tribunal had asked for a description of the original at the close of the hearing of 21 January 2022. An inaccurate answer was proffered by Shanghai Electric’s counsel that was corrected soon after by email dated 30 January 2022. This email explained that the letterhead on the Guarantee Letter had been printed in black–and–white (with Mr Agrawal’s signature appearing in blue ink). In response, Reliance Infrastructure’s lawyers sent an email to the Tribunal dated 4 February 2022, arguing that the revelation rendered the Guarantee Letter a “false instrument”. They said that “[i]f this was done by Mr Rajesh Agrawal”, it would constitute forgery, and “[e]ven if Mr Rajesh Agrawal participated in this misadventure, he would be a conspirator”.

At the hearing before us, it became clear that it consciously chose not to raise a jurisdictional objection because it was content to rest on its defences already run in the proceedings. Such was the oral evidence of Mr Parakh. When asked in cross–examination whether Reliance Infrastructure asked Mr Agrawal if he signed the Guarantee Letter after Reliance Infrastructure “learnt of the possibility of forgery”, Mr Parakh’s reply was “I don’t think that was a requirement because it was so clear during the oral submissions before the honourable tribunal. We were … very confident that this would come through in the award, whenever the tribunal gives the award. … It’s only the award which came other way [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”.

An agreement to arbitrate is a separate contract that survives the destruction or rescission of the underlying contract in which it is contained. The separability doctrine is also found in Art 16(1) of the Model Law, which has the force of law in the <span class="font-italic">lex loci </span><span class="font-italic">arbitri</span> (see s 3(1), IAA 1994), which provides that “[a] decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Accordingly, to put in issue that the Guarantee Letter was invalid does not impliedly put in issue that the arbitration agreement was <span class="font-italic">also</span> invalid. This is confirmed by the heads of relief sought in the arbitration itself. Reliance Infrastructure never sought a finding from the Tribunal that it lacked jurisdiction to arbitrate the Parties’ dispute. Instead, it sought “[a] declaration that the purported Guarantee Letter is invalid and not enforceable”, as noted by the Tribunal in its Award at [130(a)].

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We do not agree with the interpretation of these authorities that Reliance Infrastructure propounds. Reliance Infrastructure relies on the paragraph in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span> at [58], where it was explained that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principle of separability cannot guarantee the survival of the arbitration clause in all circumstances. Instead, where a challenge to the validity of the underlying contract is raised, it will be crucial to determine if this is also an attack on the arbitration agreement. This will necessarily be a fact–sensitive exercise, and much will depend on the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the challenge mounted against the underlying contract. … if the allegation is that the entire contract was entered into without authority, this may well be an attack on both the underlying contract and the arbitration agreement, as the implication would be that every clause in the contract including the arbitration agreement was entered into without authority. On the other hand, where the challenge is that the underlying contract is void or voidable for misrepresentation, the arbitration agreement may survive because the parties’ intention to arbitrate may not be affected by the misrepresentation. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Indeed, that the whole agreement was entered into without authority “may well be an attack” on the arbitration agreement, but it may not always be. The distinction is important on the facts of this case. Mr Agrawal had previously signed an indemnity on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure in favour of Shanghai Electric: Reliance Infrastructure distinguished this on the basis that it was an indemnity and not a parent company guarantee. But both contained arbitration agreements. This illustrates the point that the person signing an agreement may have authority to enter into arbitration agreements but not to enter into the contract which contains it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Thus, an attack on the main contract remains conceptually separate, in law, from an attack on the arbitration agreement within it. The learned Lord Hoffmann gave the example in <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> at [17] that “if the main agreement and the arbitration agreement are contained in the same document and one of the parties claims that he never agreed to anything in the document and that his signature was forged, that will be an attack on the validity of the arbitration agreement. But the ground of attack is not that the main agreement was invalid. It is that the signature to the arbitration agreement, as a ‘distinct agreement’, was forged. Similarly, if a party alleges that someone who purported to sign as agent on his behalf had no authority whatever to conclude any agreement on his behalf, that is an attack on both the main agreement and the arbitration agreement”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We do not read the decision in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span> as erasing the distinction between an attack on an arbitration agreement and an attack on the main contract in which it is found. While there may be an overlap – if not an outright identity, in some cases – of the facts and evidence used to invalidate both agreements, they remain distinct agreements nevertheless. The question to be asked is whether the ground for invalidation being pleaded would affect the arbitration agreement as a separate agreement. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Fiona Trust</span> at [18], the mere fact that an agent was shown to have exceeded his authority in making the main contract did not automatically mean that he also exceeded his authority in making the arbitration agreement found therein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 It is also important to keep in mind that the question we are concerned with is whether Reliance Infrastructure is <span class="font-italic">precluded by waiver</span> from raising the objection now. For the purpose of deciding that issue, the relevant question is whether Reliance Infrastructure did or did not pursue its jurisdictional objection, on the grounds of Mr Agrawal’s want of authority <span class="font-underline">to make an arbitration </span><span class="font-underline">agreement</span>, during the arbitral process itself. It plainly did not do so. Instead, it was content for the question of authority to be decided by the Tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Having failed in its defence of lack of authority on the merits, Reliance Infrastructure cannot now recast its merits defence as a jurisdictional objection for which it seeks<span class="font-italic"> de novo </span>review before us.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Reliance Infrastructure failed to show that the Guarantee Letter was forged </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As we find that Reliance Infrastructure has waived its rights to challenge the Award on the basis of forgery and want of authority, its application to set aside the Award must be dismissed. We will not delve in detail into the merits of these challenges, given that Reliance Infrastructure is precluded by waiver from raising them before us now. However, even if those challenges had not been waived, we are not persuaded of their merits in any event. We shall now briefly canvass our reasons for coming to that view on the evidence before us.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The external evidence clearly showed that the Guarantee Letter is genuine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 First of all, the objective evidence proved the existence of the executed Guarantee Letter. The most compelling evidence was the email sent by Mr Agrawal to officers of Shanghai Electric on 26 August 2008. In that email, he wrote concerning two other power plant projects in India that for those contemplated projects “RIL Guarantee Letter similar to Sasan would be given for Reliance Infra behalf”. “RIL” is an acronym for Reliance Infrastructure Limited, with “Reliance Infra” being an abbreviation of the same.

First, there is the DVC Draft Guarantee, sent in an email dated 23 June 2008 from an officer of Reliance Infrastructure to the officers of Shanghai Electric (whilst copying Mr Agrawal). Paragraph B of its recitals states that “RELINFRA [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Reliance Infrastructure] has assigned the BTG Contract to Reliance Infra Projects UK Limited … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is a subsidiary of </span>RELINFRA [emphasis in bold and italics]”.

</div> Although that DVC Draft Guarantee may not have been executed in the end, the contents of that draft, which were sent by Reliance Infrastructure to Shanghai Electric, show that, whatever the internal corporate structure of the Reliance Group may have been, as far as Shanghai Electric was aware, the Parties were content to deal with each other on the understanding that Reliance (UK) was, for all intents and purposes, in fact a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure. This is reinforced by the Supply Contract, which contains a similar description of Reliance (UK) as “a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure Limited for the procurement of equipments [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>&amp; services from outside India for the projects of the group companies of Reliance Infrastructure Limited” in its recitals.

The statement that a guarantee letter “similar to Sasan <span class="font-italic">would</span> be given [emphasis added]” is clearly not provisional or conditional on some future event that may or may not materialise, but can only be a reference to a guarantee letter already in existence at that point in time.

Similar to the Guarantee Letter, it concerned a power plant project in India which both Parties were involved in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 While there are differences between the arbitral processes provided in Paragraph 6(b) of the Hisar Indemnity and Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter – <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the former provides for one arbitrator, the latter provides for three; the former selects SIAC arbitration rules as the procedural regime, the latter selects UNCITRAL arbitration rules, <span class="font-italic">etc</span> – these do not affect the salient point that Reliance Infrastructure effectively ‘held out’ Mr Agrawal as having the authority to commit it into agreements to arbitrate disputes with Shanghai Electric. The differences are minor and immaterial to the question of authority to bind Reliance Infrastructure to arbitration agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Reliance Infrastructure invokes differences in the commercial context surrounding the two agreements to argue that Mr Agrawal’s authority to execute the Hisar Indemnity did not amount to a representation that he could execute the Guarantee Letter. In particular, it argues that the indemnity in the Hisar Indemnity was for a joint deed of undertaking (JDU) executed by both Parties to the project owner, whereas the Guarantee Letter concerned a ‘parent company guarantee’, which it says Mr Agrawal had no authority to make.

Even if it is assumed that Mr Agrawal’s signing of the Hisar Indemnity would <span class="font-italic">not</span> amount to a reasonable representation that he could sign ‘parent company guarantees’ on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure, it would <span class="font-italic">nonetheless</span> amount to a representation that he could sign arbitration agreements on their behalf.

Thus, the making of the arbitration agreement found in Paragraph 10 of the Guarantee Letter fell squarely within the scope of Mr Agrawal’s ostensible authority. This is regardless of whatever may be said about Mr Agrawal’s apparent authority (or lack thereof) to make ‘parent company guarantees’ or to execute other commercial agreements between the Parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Indeed, the differences in nature between the Hisar Indemnity and the Guarantee Letter were not so great that his previously signing the Hisar Indemnity on behalf of Reliance Infrastructure would not amount to a representation that he had authority to sign the Guarantee Letter.

Here, the length of time and frequency of Mr Agrawal’s dealings with Shanghai Electric support the inference that Reliance Infrastructure must have known of and acquiesced in Mr Agrawal dealing with Shanghai Electric on its behalf on matters relating to the power plant projects they were both involved in. Thus, Reliance Infrastructure impliedly represented that he had their authority to do so (<span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span> at 498).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Of course, if each of the above acts are taken strictly in isolation, various arguments may be made attacking the strength of the individual representations. Distinctions may be drawn between negotiating contracts and concluding contracts or between signing a contract for Reliance (UK) versus Reliance Infrastructure. The critical point, however, is to assess the representations <span class="font-italic">in the round</span> and not as discrete acts. The <span class="font-italic">overall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>impression given by Reliance Infrastructure was that Mr Agrawal was heavily involved in the business dealings between Shanghai Electric and Reliance Group entities and handled many relevant arrangements and negotiations for the conclusion of contracts relating to the power plant projects that the Parties were engaged in, including the Sasan Project. Thus, he was cloaked with apparent authority to enter into any contracts in the ordinary course of such business dealings (<span class="font-italic">Freeman &amp; Lockyer</span> at 505). There was nothing unusual about the Guarantee Letter, and it was conceded by Reliance Infrastructure’s own witness, Mr Agrawal, that it had been contemplated by Parties.

The Tribunal’s putative jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute was based on an arbitration clause found in a purported letter dated 26 June 2008 (<span class="font-weight-bold">“the Guarantee Letter”</span>), in which Reliance Infrastructure had allegedly guaranteed the obligations of a related company owed to Shanghai Electric under a separate contract.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 In its Originating Application, Reliance Infrastructure sought to set aside the Award on the grounds that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute, that the Award was affected by Shanghai Electric’s fraud, and being affected by such fraud, it was contrary to Singapore’s public policy. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 Reliance Infrastructure made two arguments in support of the above grounds – (1) it alleged that Shanghai Electric had forged the signature of its former officer (<span class="font-weight-bold">“</span><span class="font-weight-bold">Mr Agrawal”</span>) on the Guarantee Letter; and (2) that Mr Agrawal had no authority to make agreements on its behalf.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The Parties were involved in a construction project for a power plant in Sasan Village, India (<span class="font-weight-bold">“the Sasan Project”</span>). On 26 June 2008, an English company related to Reliance Infrastructure – Reliance Infra Projects (UK) Limited (<span class="font-weight-bold">“Reliance (UK)”</span>) – entered into a contract for Shanghai Electric to supply equipment and services for the Sasan Project (<span class="font-weight-bold">“the Supply Contract”</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The validity of the Supply Contract was not in dispute between the Parties. What was disputed was whether the Guarantee Letter had also been executed on that same day. On Shanghai Electric’s case, Mr Agrawal signed the Guarantee Letter on Reliance Infrastructure’s behalf, guaranteeing Reliance (UK)’s obligations to Shanghai Electric under the Supply Contract and agreeing to submit disputes in the Guarantee Letter to SIAC arbitration. Reliance Infrastructure denied this, claiming that Mr Agrawal’s signature was forged and, alternatively, that he lacked authority to make that agreement on its behalf.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 Shanghai Electric then commenced an SIAC arbitration against Reliance Infrastructure, claiming that Reliance (UK) failed to make progress payments owed to it under the Supply Contract, and seeking to enforce Reliance Infrastructure’s guarantee thereof.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 In the SIAC arbitration, Reliance Infrastructure denied the existence of the Guarantee Letter and contested Mr Agrawal’s authority to sign it. However, it never objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. It never put in issue that Mr Agrawal’s signature had been forged nor that he lacked authority to make an arbitration agreement (as distinguished from his authority to make the Guarantee Letter).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 After Reliance Infrastructure filed its setting–aside application, it raised for the first time its allegation of forgery. It adduced fresh evidence in support of that allegation, in the form of Mr Agrawal’s evidence that he never signed the Guarantee Letter, and the report of a handwriting expert to that effect. It also raised an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction based on Mr Agrawal’s lack of authority to make agreements on its behalf.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Court’s judgment</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 In the circumstances, the Court found that Reliance Infrastructure had waived its rights to pursue these challenges against the Award (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[82]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[95]</span>). On its own case, it allegedly could find no contemporaneous documentation corroborating the existence of the Guarantee Letter in its internal records near the outset of the arbitration (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[69]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 Despite this, Reliance Infrastructure never asked Mr Agrawal if he had signed the Guarantee Letter or not throughout the arbitration (at<span class="font-weight-bold"> [74]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[75]</span>). Moreover, it never engaged an expert to examine the authenticity of his signature when it could have done so (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 Thus, the Court found that Reliance Infrastructure had adequate knowledge of the necessary facts to pursue its forgery allegation when it could find no proof of the Guarantee Letter in its company records or, alternatively, when it sent an email to the Tribunal on 4 February 2022, showing that it subjectively believed that the Guarantee Letter had been forged (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[68]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[76]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[80]</span>). By failing to take steps to pursue its forgery allegation before the Tribunal without good reason, it waived its right to raise the same challenge against the Award before the Court (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[81] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [82]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The Court also found that Reliance Infrastructure could have raised Mr Agrawal’s lack of authority to make an arbitration agreement on its behalf as an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction during the SIAC arbitration (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span>). Therefore, its failure to do so constituted a waiver of its right to challenge the Award on that ground (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[95]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 It was not enough for Reliance Infrastructure to challenge Mr Agrawal’s authority to make the Guarantee Letter during the arbitration, since an agreement to arbitrate is a separate and distinct agreement from the main contract which contains it (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[86]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[92]</span>). Hence, challenging Mr Agrawal’s authority to sign the Guarantee Letter was not the same as challenging his authority to make the arbitration agreement therein (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[87]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[94]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Thus, the Court found that Reliance Infrastructure had waived its rights to challenge the Award on the grounds that the Guarantee Letter was forged and that Mr Agrawal lacked authority to make an arbitration agreement on its behalf (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[141]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 In any event, the Court held that Reliance Infrastructure’s allegations were without merit and it would have dismissed them even if they had not been waived (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[96] </span>and<span class="font-weight-bold"> [142]</span>). The evidence showed that Mr Agrawal had signed the Guarantee Letter (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[97]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[123]</span>) and that Reliance Infrastructure had ‘held him out’ as having the apparent authority to make arbitration agreements with Shanghai Electric on its behalf (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[134]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[137]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[140]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 For these reasons, the Court dismissed Reliance Infrastructure’s application to set aside the Award (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[143]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
