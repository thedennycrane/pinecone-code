I find that as the intended investment or fund manager under the Four Agreements, RCL and Liew (the alter ego of RCL, being its only shareholder and director) owed fiduciary duties to Zhou. Even if investment or fund managers do not fall within settled categories of fiduciaries, the circumstances of the case justify the imposition of such duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out a few observations on fiduciary law. First, the hallmark of a fiduciary obligation is that he is to act in the interests of another person. The distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty which entails that he must act in good faith for his principal’s benefit (at [192]). Second, a fiduciary obligation is a conclusion rather than a premise. The relationship is the reason why undertaken duties are fiduciary (at [193]). Third, fiduciary obligations are voluntarily undertaken (see also <span class="font-italic">Vivendi SA and another v Richards and another </span>[2013] EWHC 3006 (Ch) at [137]–[141]). Such undertakings arise when the fiduciary voluntarily places himself in a position where the law can objectively impute an intention on his part to undertake these obligations (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon</span> at [194]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>I find that Liew and RCL owed a duty to act in good faith for Zhou’s benefit, having voluntarily taken on the responsibility as Zhou’s fund manager handling Zhou’s investment monies.

The Sum comprises $5m transferred to SIPL and the remaining being the converted sum of US$199,975 transferred to Mah. Second, they were entrusted to remit the Sum to the relevant parties for the purposes of the Four Investments, and thus were liable to Zhou for the sum by way of a constructive trust or a resulting trust.

Mah also failed to explain why she had converted the US$199,975 to Singapore dollars. Although Mah had subsequently transferred a total of $75,000 each to Zhou and Liew in September 2011, the documents showed (and Mah admitted) that these were interest payments for earlier investments that were made not only to Zhou but to Liew.

That the defendants had not explicitly made these arguments in their pleadings or submissions pose no difficulty as they had pleaded that their roles were merely to remit monies to Chen Jie, that they remitted monies in accordance with instructions, and that they did not benefit from the transactions.

Save for the US$199,975 relating to the LBI Investment and the $1m relating to the 2ST2 Investment (see [46(b)] and [46(d)] above), I find that Mah, SIPL and Gobind had received the monies ministerially as they had remitted these monies onwards to Chen Jie or her representatives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Aside from ministerial receipt, Mah, SIPL, and Gobind could also rely on the defence of change of position based on the same fact pattern.

A defendant lacks good faith if he acts in a commercially unacceptable way, and such behaviour is made out if he fails to query the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would so query. Put another way, a defendant would not be acting in good faith if the circumstances of transaction were such that he would be put on notice. In my judgment, there is no reason why this should not similarly apply to ministerial receipt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>Further, in <span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore Pte Ltd v Leow Tet Sin and another </span>[2015] 2 SLR 271, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) held that the <span class="font-italic">Barlow Clowes </span>test involves two stages (at [42]). First, a subjective assessment of what the defendant knew about the transaction. Second, an objective assessment of whether participation in the transaction with such knowledge would offend ordinary standards. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>I turn now to address the third to fifth defendants’ knowledge to ascertain whether they were acting in good faith. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mah’s, SIPL’s and Gobind’s knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>I make two quick observations at the outset. First, Mah was evidently not forthcoming on her business experience and SIPL’s scope of work.

In order to fix a company (being an artificial construct) with the requisite intention or state of mind, it is necessary to pinpoint some human actor with that state of mind and to determine whether, as a matter of law, that state of mind also counts as the company’s via a process of attribution (<span class="font-italic">The “Dolphina”</span> [2012] 1 SLR 992 (“<span class="font-italic">The Dolphina</span>”) at [205]). Two attribution doctrines may be invoked here. The first is that of agency, which entails the imputation to a principal of knowledge relating to the subject matter of the agency which the agent acquires while acting within the scope of his authority. The second is that of identification, which involves the identification of the directing mind and will of the company (<span class="font-italic">The Dolphina </span>at [216], [235] and [239]). In my view, Mah’s and Marino’s knowledge (and there appears to be no difference between the two) are attributable to SIPL. Mah is SIPL’s director and the directing mind and will of SIPL. Marino is SIPL’s business development executive

First, it was not as if monies were transferred in one direction (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, away from Zhou). SIPL had, on various occasions, transferred monies to Zhou and Liew as their investment returns. Second, the e-mail correspondences between RCL and Marino (representing SIPL) and even Chen Jie did not reveal anything suspicious. To the contrary, there was substantial e-mail correspondence dealing with interest payments and the repayment of principal, which would have instead indicated to Mah and SIPL that various investments were afoot.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>All things considered, there is insufficient evidence to show bad faith on the third to fifth defendants’ part. I had earlier found that their roles were to transfer the money from Zhou or RCL to the proper party, and there was no evidence that they knew that the monies were to be applied for a specified purpose (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for the GT Investment, etc). The documents support that they had done so in accordance with proper instructions. It would be inequitable to require them to make restitution for the monies that had been remitted to Chen Jie. They had received those monies ministerially. Alternatively, they could rely on a change of position defence. That they would have likely earned a fee or commission for the remittances does not mean that they have been enriched at Zhou’s expense, as it was normal for fees to be charged for such services.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unjust enrichment claim in respect of US$199,975 (LBI) and $1m (2ST2)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>I turn now to the US$199,975 intended for the LBI investment, and the $1m intended for Investment X (which was to be rolled over to the 2ST2 Investment). These sums were received by Mah and SIPL respectively, and based on my earlier findings (see [37], [43] and [44] above), these sums have not been transferred to Chen Jie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>I will focus, in particular, on the requirement of an unjust factor. There is no freestanding claim in unjust enrichment on the abstract basis that it would be “unjust” for the defendant to retain the benefit. Instead, there must be a recognised “unjust factor or event which gives rise to a claim” (<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [134]; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie </span>[2016] 3 SLR 845 at [93]). Mr Quah has not identified the unjust factor that he is relying on; he had merely stated that the retention of Zhou’s funds would be wrongful. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>Nevertheless, I will go on to consider the ground on failure of consideration or basis, which appears to be the most relevant factor. This ground was recently applied in <span class="font-italic">Cristian Priwisata Yacob </span>and<span class="font-italic"> another v Wibowo Boediono and another and another suit</span> [2017] SGHC 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Wibowo Boediono</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Wibowo Boediono</span>, monies were transferred as consideration for shares in properties, but the joint investment was not carried out. George Wei J held that the ground is made out when a promisor does not provide what has been promised. This can arise in both a contractual and non­contractual context where advances were made to further a particular purpose or goal, and the purpose or goal fails. In such cases, the recipient in general must return the advance (<span class="font-italic">Wibowo Boediono</span> at [189]). In <span class="font-italic">Goff and Jones</span>, the editors explain that the idea underlying failure of basis is that “a benefit has been conferred on the joint understanding that the recipient’s right to retain it is conditional. If the condition is not fulfilled, the recipient must return the benefit” (at para 12-01). This joint basis is key and it is to be ascertained objectively; uncommunicated subjective thoughts are irrelevant (<span class="font-italic">Supercars Lorinser Pte Ltd and another v Benzline Auto Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 281 at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>In multi-party cases, it is not apparent how the fundamental requirement of a joint understanding will be satisfied (<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 13-05): must the defendants (Mah and/or SIPL) know of the understanding shared by the claimant (Zhou) and the third party (Liew)? In relation to the US$199,975, even if Zhou and Liew had a joint understanding that the monies were meant for the LBI Investment, there was certainly no joint understanding between Mah and Zhou about how the monies ought to be used except that Mah knew it was meant for investment. That said, there was a common understanding among Zhou, Liew and Mah/SIPL, or between any two of them, that the US$199,975 received by Mah was Zhou’s money meant for investment. Mah knew this even if she did not know the exact investment it was to be applied to. In this case, it is clear that the purpose or condition had not been fulfilled, as Mah cannot even recall or explain what she had done with this money. Hence she must return the benefit. For similar reasons, Mah would not be able to escape liability on the basis of ministerial receipt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span>This common understanding similarly applied to the $2m (pertaining to the 2ST2 Investment) originally transferred by Zhou to SIPL and intended for Investment X. Mah knew that this was Zhou’s money for investment, and she had remitted $1m onwards to Chen Jie through Gobind. However, Mah had failed to explain what had happened to the remaining $1m. Although SIPL had on 3 October 2011, issued a cheque to Zhou for $1,020,000, she did not explain how this was related to the remaining $1m which she had received <span class="font-italic">from Zhou</span> and which had to be <span class="font-italic">transferred onwards for investment</span>. Indeed, she would have known from the e-mails between Brian, Chen Jie and Marino (and Mah admitted that she read e-mails sent to Marino), that the $1,020,000 was <span class="font-italic">returns</span> on a <span class="font-italic">different </span>investment which had matured and was to be <span class="font-italic">returned </span><span class="font-italic">by Chen Jie or RCL</span> to Zhou (see also Mah and SIPL’s counterclaim below at [97]).

Mah did not adduce evidence to show that she would not have transferred the $1,020,000 <span class="font-italic">to Zhou</span> but for the earlier receipt of $2m <span class="font-italic">from Zhou</span>. Moreover, the circumstances were so irregular that ordinary honest people would have made further queries (see [57] above). The sum of $2m was transferred to SIPL for investment purposes, yet there was no designated recipient for the remaining $1m. It was not open for Mah to argue that the $1m constituted part of the $1,020,000 that she paid to Zhou, when she would have known that this $1,020,000 represented the returns from a different investment. This set of transactions was also unlike the earlier rollovers done by Chen Jie or Liew in respect of other investments. I therefore find that Mah was not acting in good faith in respect of this $1m.

V K Rajah JA held that the applicable test was whether the company was carrying on the business of its controller (at [96]). On the facts of that case, the Court of Appeal agreed with the lower court’s finding that the controller in question (“Alwie”) had made no distinction between himself and his company (“OAFL”). Alwie was the directing mind and will of OAFL and although the monies constituting the enrichment was paid into OAFL’s bank account, Alwie was the beneficial owner of the account and had operated the account as if it was his own personal bank account. Likewise, Mah was the sole shareholder of SIPL. Her evidence was that her role in the transactions was “merely that of a friend helping out a friend”.

</div> By this, Zhou must mean a remedial constructive trust (“RCT”) as the scenario does not fit within any categories of institutional constructive trusts (on the distinction between the two: see <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2013] SGHC 249<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [140]–[141]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>, the Court of Appeal held that an RCT is to be imposed only where the payee’s conscience is affected, and the basis of an RCT is founded on fault which is predicated on a state of knowledge which renders it unconscionable for the recipient to keep the monies (at [171]–[172]). The Court cited <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit</span> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 856 for the proposition that “the payee’s conscience must have been affected, while <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">monies in question still remain with him</span>” [emphasis added] for an RCT to arise, stressing that the fact giving rise to the court’s discretion to impose an RCT is not the fact of unjust enrichment, but the <span class="font-italic">knowing retention </span>of the monies in a way that affects the recipient’s conscience. This may arise separately from a strict liability claim in unjust enrichment, although the facts giving rise to an RCT may arise subsequently to or concurrently with the unjust enrichment claim (at [183]–[184]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>On the facts, a claim in RCT would fail, as all of Zhou’s monies (apart from the US$199,975 pertaining to the LBI Investment and the $1m pertaining to the 2ST2 Investment) had been remitted to China. Even in relation to the US$199,975 and $1m, an RCT could not be imposed as the monies have since been dissipated. After the receipt of US$199,975 in Mah’s foreign currency account, a transfer of US$119,942.43 was made to another account and a cheque for US$85,000 was issued, leaving a balance of only $914.94 in that foreign currency account.

Zhou is not seeking any personal remedy in excess of the investment monies that he has lost and cannot avail himself of any proprietary remedy (see [82] above). That said, if I had to consider the matter, I would have allowed the claim in knowing receipt in respect of these sums. A knowing recipient may be liable where he receives trust property or property in respect of which fiduciary duties exist, knowing it to be such, and he then either misappropriates it or otherwise deals with it in a manner which is inconsistent with the trust and/or the applicable fiduciary duties (<span class="font-italic">Sitt Tatt Bhd v Goh Tai Hock </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 44 at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 9(3) (LexisNexis, Reissue, 2015) at para 110.587; Philip H Pettit, <span class="font-italic">Equity and the Law of Trusts </span>(Oxford University Press, 12th Ed, 2012) at p 156). Mah knew that the US$199,975 was intended for Zhou’s investments and had failed to explain how this sum was used. She had thus dealt with the monies in a manner inconsistent with the fiduciary duties that Liew owed. Likewise, Mah and SIPL knew that the remainder $1m was meant to be transferred onwards for investment purposes, but they have failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Resulting Quistclose trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>Zhou also claims entitlement to the monies he transferred as beneficiary of a resulting <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council</span> [2015] 4 SLR 474 at [114], Quentin Loh J held that for a resulting <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust, the twin certainties of subject matter and object must be present. The settlor-donor must intend to constitute the recipient as a trustee and confer upon him the power or duty to apply the money exclusively in accordance with the stated purpose, and the donor must lack the intention to part with the entire beneficial interest in the transferred money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>In my judgment, Zhou’s claim in <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust against SIPL and Mah for the monies transferred to Gobind is not made out. As Zhou admitted, SIPL and Mah were essentially RCL’s intermediaries, assisting RCL to do the transfers. This they had done based on RCL or Chen Jie’s instructions. The stated purpose at the heart of Zhou’s <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust claim is limited to the conveyance of these monies to the relevant party in China for unspecified investments and this purpose was discharged. <span class="font-italic">A fortiori</span>, Zhou’s <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust claim against Gobind fails as well. As I have stated at [63], Gobind was not informed that the monies to be remitted to Chen Jie came from Zhou, and Mah had added that she was “sure” that Gobind did not even know of the investments.

As Robert Chambers notes in <span class="font-italic">Resulting Trusts </span>(Clarendon Press, 1997), “[e]very resulting trust requires that the claimant (i) has provided the property and (ii) did not intend to benefit the recipient in the circumstances and, further, that the property (iii) <span class="font-italic">is identifiable in the hands of the recipient</span>…” [emphasis added] (at p 234).

</div> In my judgment, the elements of conspiracy are not made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>First, there must be an agreement between the defendants to pursue a particular course of conduct and that concerted action was taken pursuant to that agreement.

I find that this is not made out. There was insufficient evidence to show that Mah and Gobind (and even Marino) had sought to conspire with each other or with Liew, RCL or Chen Jie to defraud Zhou of his investment monies. Liew may have misrepresented to Zhou that he would manage and apply Zhou’s monies specifically for the Four Investments. However, there is no evidence that Mah, Marino or Gobind knew of the representations that Liew made to Zhou, or that Zhou’s monies in Mah’s, Gobind’s or SIPL’s hands were meant specifically for particular investments, or that they had agreed with each other or with Liew to mislead Zhou and retain the monies for some other purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>Second, I am of the view that none of the defendants had an intention to injure Zhou. While Liew had left the management of Zhou’s monies to Chen Jie without maintaining proper oversight over the Four Investments, this did not amount to an intention to injure.

</div>), and yet at the same time absolve himself of the responsibilities associated with managing the Four Investments. This was indolence and irresponsibility at its worst – but nonetheless, not an injurious intent. It was certainly not in Liew’s interests for Zhou to be defrauded – his stream of “management fees” got cut off, he did not receive any of the investment monies, and ultimately, he was exposed to personal liability under the Four Guarantees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>It follows that there was simply no intent by Mah (much less Gobind) to injure Zhou. Mah and Gobind were essentially intermediaries who knew that the monies belonged to investors and had to be transferred in accordance with instructions by RCL or Chen Jie (in Mah’s case) or by Mah and Marino (in Gobind’s case) and they had acted on those instructions. Mah had agreed to do so as she would earn fees from the transactions – that in itself did not make her actions unlawful nor was it sufficient to infer any conspiracy to do certain acts to injure Zhou. The fact that the monies were transferred through more than one intermediary and subsequently remitted in smaller amounts also did not necessarily or invariably mean that the parties were in cahoots to defraud Zhou of his money. There may be other possible explanations for this course of dealing. Gobind also explained that it is up to the money remitter to determine how the monies would be remitted,

These were e-mails that Zhou did not receive, and they would have been wholly unnecessary and farcical if the parties were all in cahoots to defraud Zhou. It should also be borne in mind that Liew had made a CAD report claiming that he had been defrauded by Chen Jie.

</div> It would take immense temerity for Liew to have done so if he was part of the entire scam. Additionally, I had earlier found (at [62] and [94]) that Mah and SIPL would earn fees for their role in remitting the monies; it was not as if they were willingly doing so without compensation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>Finally, though this was not an argument raised by Mr Quah, I pause to briefly deal with the possibility that there was a conspiracy founded on a combination/agreement between Mah and SIPL (<span class="font-italic">Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [22]). In my view, there was insufficient evidence to support such a conspiracy in respect of the retained monies.

Indeed, based on SIPL’s records of the running account, these retained monies were whittled away after issuing interest payments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mah and SIPL’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>Mah and SIPL claimed that they had paid to Zhou various amounts between September 2011 to February 2012 and that after setting off the amounts that Zhou and Liew had paid to Mah or SIPL, Zhou and Liew collectively owed Mah and SIPL $266,850.68, which they had wrongfully retained and been thereby unjustly enriched.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  SIPL and Mah’s Defence and Counterclaim, paras 39–40.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, Mah and SIPL’s counterclaim against Zhou fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>The editors of <span class="font-italic">Goff and Jones </span>examined the following hypothetical situation (at para 3–78):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If [the defendant] receives a benefit at [the claimant’s] expense to which [the defendant] is entitled by a contract between [the defendant] and a third party, X, then can [the defendant] rely on this contract as a bar to [the claimant’s] claim in unjust enrichment?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">99 </span>The answer proffered is that the claim would be barred if the claimant was aware of the contractual arrangements between the defendant and the third party, and had impliedly agreed to provide the benefit on the basis that the third party alone would be liable to pay the claimant for it (at para 3–79). Another consideration that has to be borne in mind is the contractual allocation of risk and benefit between the defendant and the third party, which would be upset if the claimant’s unjust enrichment claim succeeds (at para 3–78). In this regard, it is relevant to note that at [104] of <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span>, the Court of Appeal also commented that the courts would be unwilling to permit a plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim to undermine contracts and contractual allocations of risk.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">100 </span>In the present case, Mah knew that the payments made to Zhou were for returns on investment agreements entered into with RCL. In particular, Mah knew that the $1,020,000 cheque issued by SIPL on 3 October 2011 was Zhou’s principal and interest for an investment which had matured and she also knew that these monies had to be returned by Chen Jie or RCL to Zhou (see [43] and [74] above). For the other smaller amounts paid to Zhou, Mah knew they were interest payments which had to be paid to Zhou under the investment agreements that Zhou had entered into. Chen Jie had asked Mah to pay on her behalf in advance to Zhou and which she would repay Mah.

</div>
</div> Hence, by continuing with the transfers, Mah and SIPL had impliedly agreed to pay Zhou on Chen Jie’s or RCL’s behalf on the basis that Mah would seek repayment from Chen Jie or RCL. I therefore find that Zhou was not unjustly enriched. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">101 </span>In conclusion, I find Liew liable to Zhou for $6,530,000. I also find Mah liable for $247,689.04 (which is the converted sum of US$199,975 and which Zhou had claimed in Singapore dollars, pertaining to the LBI Investment) and jointly and severally liable with SIPL for $1m (pertaining to the 2ST2 Investment) – this is subject to the prohibition against double recovery from Liew and Mah/SIPL for the sums pertaining to the same investments. I dismiss Zhou’s claim against Gobind in its entirety and dismiss Mah and SIPL’s counterclaim against Zhou. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">102 </span>I shall hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Quah Siew Ping and Wong Teck Ming (RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>First, third and fourth defendants in person; <br/>Lim Kim Hong (Messrs Kim &amp; Co) for the fifth defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
