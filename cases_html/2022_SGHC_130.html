To effect the transfer of Unit 473 to D1, P paid an option fee of $54,000 (representing 10% of the purchase price of Unit 473) to RHB. P borrowed $20,000 from his sister, Lau Yaw Ngoh (“LYN”) and took a loan of $30,000 from NTUC Insurance to pay the option fee. D1 did not pay any moneys as transferee of Unit 473.

Before me, Mr Yeo (P’s counsel) pointed to a Land Titles Registry transfer document (“Transfer Document”) to show that whilst the contract to sell Unit 473 was made between P and D1 in October 2004, the property was only transferred to D1 in October 2005 and it was then transferred to WKS immediately on the same day.

</div> for two reasons (“the Workaround”). First, Unit 473 had no separate strata title but only a lot number, which would have made it extremely difficult to find a willing buyer. If D1 was the owner/seller of Unit 473 and there was any problem with the title to Unit 473, a purchaser could at least have potential recourse against D1 as the immediate seller. Second, as P was in a precarious financial situation and facing the prospect of bankruptcy, a potential buyer of Unit 473 might be concerned with the risk of clawbacks if he bought the property directly from P.

P encashed this cheque out of fear that if he deposited the moneys into his bank account, RHB would become cognisant that P was in possession of a significant sum of money and revoke the payment plan it extended to him (see [12] above). From this amount, P handed $82,000 (the Inheritance Sum) to D1 for his safekeeping and kept the loose sum of $68.20.

Certainty of intention requires proof that a trust was intended by the settlor (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1097 at [51]–[52]). Additionally, under s 7(1) of the CLA, a declaration of trust respecting any immovable property or any interest in such property must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust. However, s 7(1) does not affect the creation of a resulting, implied or constructive trust (see s 7(3) of the CLA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Turning to the law on resulting trusts, where a transferor appears to have paid for the acquisition of an interest in property in the name of a different party or to have transferred some interest in property to a transferee, the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement are relevant. If there is no relationship between the transferor and transferee, the court presumes that the transferor intended to retain the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to his financial contribution towards the acquisition of the property. This is the presumption of resulting trust. Where, however, the transfer occurs in the context of certain recognised categories of relationships (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, between parents and children), the presumption of advancement (“POA”) operates to rebut the presumption of resulting trust on the basis that the transferor intended to benefit the transferee. The burden then lies on the party challenging the claim of the transferee to rebut the POA by proving that the transfer was not intended to be a gift (<span class="font-italic">Koh Lian Chye and another v Koh Ah Leng and another and another appeal</span> [2021] SGCA 69 at [23]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Importantly, however, the court will not rely on the presumption of resulting trust and POA when the evidence adequately reveals the true intentions of the transferor (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I find that there was no express trust created over Unit 473 in P’s favour.

Contrary to P’s claim that a trust of Unit 473 was created in his favour because he had no intention of gifting it to D1, I find that P had intended to divest the beneficial interest in the property to D1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, if P claimed that he had transferred Unit 473 to D1 for D1 to refinance it and make part payment to RHB, D1 would have given consideration for the property when it was transferred to him. In this regard, what P essentially sought to do was to obtain funds from D1 through <span class="font-italic">D1</span> refinancing Unit 473, to assist P to reduce the Loan to RHB. By refinancing Unit 473, D1 would become the owner and mortgagor of Unit 473 and bear the responsibility and burden of repaying the mortgage to the mortgagee. As D1 stated, Unit 473 was transferred to him so that he could assist P to discharge the Loan and <span class="font-italic">D1</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>paid the $540,000 to RHB to do so.

The Transfer Document thus contradicts P’s claim that <span class="font-italic">he</span> had first paid $54,000 to RHB to effect the transfer of Unit 473 to D1. If P’s claim is to be believed, there is no reason why all $540,000 from the sale of Unit 473 was paid over to P for P to pay RHB given that he claimed to have already paid 10% of this amount to RHB. P’s evidence that $540,000 <span class="font-italic">from the sale proceeds</span> of Unit 473 was paid to RHB thus contradicts his earlier evidence that he had already personally paid $54,000 to RHB “to start the transaction”.

P’s desire to place Unit 473 out of the reach of his creditors and for D1 to bear the risk of warranty to title supports a finding that P intended to divest the beneficial interest in the property to D1, as otherwise P’s creditors would still be able to reach into P’s beneficial interest in the property and any corresponding sale proceeds. That the transfer of Unit 473 to D1 immediately preceded its sale to WKS did not change P’s motive or intent to divest the beneficial interest in Unit 473 to D1. This further demonstrates there to be no resulting trust of Unit 473 in P’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the above regard, I find P’s explanation for the Workaround, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it would be extremely difficult to find a buyer who would agree to buy a property (Unit 473) which did not have a title but merely a lot number, to show that he did not intend to gift Unit 473 to D1, to be unconvincing.

</div> it was improbable that D1 would have used moneys purportedly belonging to P and kept in D1’s bank account without P’s knowledge or permission. At this juncture, my analysis includes the assumption that the Inheritance Sum was also deposited into D1’s bank account(s) – whether this was indeed the case is a point I will return to later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In this regard, both P and D1 relied on <span class="font-italic">Hin</span><span class="font-italic">ckley Singapore Trading Pte Ltd v Sogo Department Stores (S) Pte Ltd (under judicial management)</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 119 at [28]–[29] to support their respective positions. In particular, the Court of Appeal stated (citing <span class="font-italic">R v Clowes (No 2)</span> [1994] 2 All ER 316 at 325) that a requirement to keep moneys separate is normally an indicator that they are impressed with a trust, and that the absence of such a requirement, <span class="font-italic">if there are no other indicators of a trust</span>, normally negatives it. The fact that a transaction contemplates the mingling of funds is, therefore, not necessarily fatal to a trust. However, in the present case, not only are there no other indicators of a trust of Unit 473 or of the 473 Moneys, but D1 had also utilised a substantial part of the Sums for his personal and family benefit. There is no evidence that D1 needed or sought P’s consent to use the moneys held in D1’s name for such purpose, whose consent D1 would have sought if the moneys were indeed P’s. It must be remembered that the issue of whether D1 held on trust certain moneys for P was not raised until the Divorce Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 To conclude, I find that there was no express or resulting trust of Unit 473 in favour of P, and hence there was likewise no trust of the 473 Moneys. P’s intent to transfer Unit 473 to D1 for D1 to refinance it and his motive for the Workaround with the sale of Unit 473 to WKS with D1 as the seller showed P’s consistent intent to divest his beneficial interest in Unit 473. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 At this juncture, I deal with P’s claim that the $18,000 paid to UOB over five years was paid using his moneys, namely the 473 Moneys (see [9] above). Quite apart from the fact that I have found there to be no trust of the 473 Moneys, there is also no evidence that D1 had utilised the 473 Moneys to help P discharge the sum owing to UOB. Whilst D1’s AOM stated that D1 had helped his father to repay this sum, he did not mention that he had used the 473 Moneys for this purpose.

</div> Before me, D1 attempted to explain away the missing $32,000 by claiming that he had only deposited $50,000 into his bank account as he was hiding the rest of the moneys from P’s creditors.

</div> But this contradicted D1’s own claim that all of P’s Inheritance was gradually deposited into his bank account. In any event, there is no evidence that the $50,000 deposited into D1’s bank account came from P. P and D1’s inability to maintain a consistent story casts doubts on their assertions that P had entrusted the Inheritance Sum to D1, much less that there was a trust of this sum for P.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In conclusion, I find that D1 did not hold the Sums on either an express or resulting trust for the benefit of P.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is telling that D1 never informed D2 that he held the Sums on trust for P at any time during their marriage.

</div> This was only raised in D1’s AOM after the dissolution of their marriage. D1 remained silent through his years of marriage even though he received significant sums of moneys purportedly held beneficially for P. He received the 473A Moneys shortly after he married P in February 2012 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 8 March 2012 following the completion of the sale of Unit 473A) and purportedly received the Inheritance Sum relatively recently in 2017. I could not but infer that the reason for D1’s silence was because he knew that he did not hold the Sums (if any) on trust for P. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the above reasons, I dismiss P’s application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 My findings above render the precise quantum of moneys D1 allegedly held on trust for P an academic issue. I nevertheless mention for completeness that the total sum of moneys P averred that D1 held on trust for his benefit was, on his own case, overstated. P accepted that D1 had expended at least $125,000 of the 473 Moneys and 473A Moneys for P’s benefit.
