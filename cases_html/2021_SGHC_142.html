</div> The word “nominee” simply means a person nominated, and has two common uses that confusingly differ in meaning. Discerning the correct meaning depends on context. In a sale and purchase agreement, reference to the purchaser’s right to direct conveyance to a nominee may mean that the purchaser has the right to direct conveyance to any person that the purchaser nominates after contract and before conveyance. That person could well receive the conveyance of the purchased property as its beneficial and not just legal owner. But the word “nominee” is also often used to mean a person who has been nominated to hold property on behalf of another, or, to adopt more precise legal language, as an express trustee. In OOPA’s plea, the word “nominee” is being used in the second sense, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> as an express trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 OOPA also added that OnOnPay had assigned its intellectual property (“IP”) to OOPA, by a Deed of Assignment dated 30 July 2015, including the domain names “ononpay.com” and “ononpay.vn”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 OOPA’s answer was that its claim is that the CSB belonged to OOPA, and that the decision whether and how to pursue the CSB, including by establishing a new entity to do so, was for OOPA to make. This is shown by the fact that discussions concerning the CSB took place at the level of the board of OOPA. It was for OOPA to decide whether to house the CSB within OnOnPay or to establish a new entity for this purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I accept that the claim as framed is properly brought by OOPA. It claims in respect of what it asserts to be its asset, and in respect of loss directly suffered by it. Whether it can prove its claim is dealt with under the sections that follow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As a matter of general principle, a single individual may owe fiduciary duties under different relationships or to different principals. The same act or omission may possibly constitute a breach of fiduciary duty to more than one principal. That there may have been a breach of duty to another principal does not negate or limit the first principal’s rights against the defaulting fiduciary. The fiduciary’s conduct will have to be measured and judged in terms of the scope and content of his duty to the principal that is bringing suit against him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It is instructive to compare the situation where a particular individual is a director of both the holding company and its subsidiary with one where he is only a director of the holding company. If the individual abuses his position as director of the holding company in order to obtain a gain from the subsidiary, the holding company in both situations will have the same rights against its director. Those rights will not be impaired or diminished if the individual is also a director of the subsidiary. If he is, the subsidiary might have rights against him too, but any difficulty is resolvable by the application of the principle against double recovery. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Breach of fiduciary duty </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The relevant principle on which OOPA relies is a well-established one. The director of a company is disqualified “from usurping for himself or diverting to another person or company with whom or with which he is associated a maturing business opportunity which his company is actively pursuing”: see the Canadian Supreme Court case of <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Services Ltd v O’Malley</span> (1974) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (“<span class="font-italic">Canaero</span>”) at 382, approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tokuhon</span><span class="font-italic"> (Pte) Ltd v Seow Kang Hong and others</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 414, at [50]–[51].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 This issue requires consideration of three questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the CSB a maturing business opportunity?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the CSB was a maturing business opportunity, did it belong to OOPA?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If it belonged to OOPA, did OOPA pursue it?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 As Bui remained a director of OOPA until 16 June 2020, more than a year after the events in question, no concern arises, unlike in <span class="font-italic">Ca</span><span class="font-italic">naero</span>, of the extent to which a director remains disqualified following his resignation as a director.

</div> The email was sent from his OnOnPay email address and bore his signature block as Founder and CEO of OnOnPay. It was addressed to the directors and shareholders of OOPA.

A few comments are apposite. First, Bui was updating the board of OOPA about the activities of OOPA’s subsidiary, OnOnPay. Secondly, Bui described the CSB as having been active for the past one and a half months and having “shown good traction in terms of revenue growth and profitability”. Thirdly, he foreshadowed the consideration of moving the business into a new entity so that it would be easier to attract new investors. Keeping it within OnOnPay would mean that new investors would have to consider and take account of any negative impact from OnOnPay’s failing e-wallet business. Fourthly, the existing investors in OOPA would have their shareholding fully reproduced in the new entity. Bui acknowledged in his oral evidence that although he had referred to OnOnPay’s cap table, what he had actually meant was OOPA’s cap table.

The reference to Option 2 is to one of two options for the new corporate structure set out in the attachment to this email. Option 1 was for the creation of a new holding company above both OOPA and Telio which would have the same shareholding as OOPA and which would be a direct shareholder of Telio. Option 2 was to keep OOPA and Telio separate, but the existing shareholders of OOPA would share a percentage (to be determined, with the placeholder “Y%”) of the shareholding of Telio on a basis that mirrored their shareholding in OOPA. That last sentence was expressed not only by the diagrammatic depiction but also by a bullet point that read: “Cap table of [OOPA] is migrated to [Telio] on Y% basis”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 This email is one of many whose authenticity Bui accepted but contended that it could not be relied upon for the truth of its contents as its maker did not testify.

</div> Not only did he attach a “transition plan from OOP [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to Telio”, but he also made comments in the body of the email to which he was responding. Among other things, he indicated that there would be little risk of cannibalisation for Telio to reach out to the merchants currently on OOPA’s payment network, because both Telio and OOPA would be “held by basically same group of shareholders”. He also noted that they would be moving “all the current HR as well as other OnOnPay resources to Telio”. Bui sought to explain this away on the basis that it was all contingent on additional investment from Captii.

</div> I reject this explanation.

This document was not agreed, nor was its provenance or accuracy established by any of OOPA’s witnesses. It was not even put to Bui. This is not a reflection on Mr Potter’s work, which was itself meticulous. It is unfortunate that a critical building block of his evidence was not substantiated. Nonetheless, subtracting this disputed document, and the testimony of Mr Potter that relies on it, has no impact on my findings, as these rest on other material, including the contemporaneous correspondence.

Apart from the Y% for OOPA’s existing shareholders, there was to be X% for an option pool for founders (which would include Bui and Van) as well as Z% for new investors. The values of X, Y and Z were what had to be discussed and agreed. What they would be would depend on the value ascribed to the three components necessary for Telio’s flourishing, namely the involvement of the founders, the CSB to be transferred (belonging to OOPA) and lastly the new funding from new investors. All three components were necessary for Telio to be started up, and to succeed. Without new funding, the CSB could not grow. Without Bui’s drive and knowledge, the business might not be executed successfully. But crucially, without the CSB there was no business at all either to execute or to grow. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Bui had a fiduciary responsibility to OOPA because he was a director of OOPA. The CSB fell within the ambit of that responsibility, which is why he reported on it, including in his 16 January 2019 email. A fiduciary does not have to be selfless, however, and Bui was entitled to look after his own interests in negotiating the X value. In short, he could legitimately bargain for a higher option pool for founders. But he was not entitled to make a secret deal with new investors so as to cut OOPA out, whether by taking over the Y value (the value of the CSB) for himself or putting it at zero. This is because the core obligations of a fiduciary are candour and loyalty to his principal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The irony is that Bui’s interests ought to have been somewhat aligned with OOPA’s, as he was its largest single shareholder even after dilution, holding 40.15%. I find that contrary to Bui’s allegation that Captii was greedy, it was he who was greedy, because he was not satisfied with having 40.15% of the Y value (in addition to the lion’s share of the X value, as the driving entrepreneurial force behind Telio) and instead took what belonged to OOPA for himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Counsel for Bui relied

</div> in support of his argument that the CSB at most belonged to OnOnPay and not OOPA. This is because the email asserted that “[t]he interest of OnOnPay in Telio belongs to OnOnPay, this has to be recognised”. However, the same email also asserted that Telio belonged to OOPA, stating that “[a]ll IP and business opportunities that are development [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] and identified shall belong to OOPA. Therefore, the business of Telio, being firstly development [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] within OOPA, and using funds of OOPA, shall belong to OOPA”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Ng was neither precise nor consistent in how he worded this email. Notwithstanding that he should have been more precise, especially given that by this time he had just discovered that Surge had entered the picture and that he acknowledged having spent some time to “complete our thoughts”, I am unable to accept that the email, read as a whole, conceded that Telio was claimed to be owned by OnOnPay in contradistinction to OOPA. Ultimately, the email returns to what had been discussed for some time between Ng and Bui, namely finding the right corporate structure that would reflect the cap table of OOPA in the new entity (the Y value). As Ng explained towards the end of the same email, “[a]ll interest of [Bui] in Telio shall be first recognised as OnOnPay’s; parties could figure how to implement mechanics to allow [Bui] to continue to hold his interest directly. In other words, [Bui] holds 40.15% of diluted interests of Telio and investors through OnOnPay holds 59.85% of diluted interest of Telio”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The reference in this email to OOPA owning the IP is significant.

</div> The IP included the merchant list and the domain name “ononpay.com”.  Bui’s counsel argued that the Deed of Assignment should be disregarded, among other reasons because it was not shown to have been entered into with the intention to create legal relations, was not acted upon and would not relate to future IP of OnOnPay. I do not accept that this is the case. That OOPA protected its position by an assignment of OnOnPay’s IP to itself was a logical step as the holding company and there is no reason not to give it effect. Moreover, arguments that seek to separate what belonged to OnOnPay and what belonged directly to OOPA miss the point. OOPA wholly owned OnOnPay, and in the conduct of OnOnPay’s business had the final say. That is why Bui reported to the board of OOPA about the business of OnOnPay. It was not enough for OnOnPay’s board (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> Bui) to agree to move resources of OnOnPay to Telio. OOPA’s approval was also required. In fact, it was OOPA which was entitled to decide whether the CSB should remain within OnOnPay or be spun off into the new entity Telio. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did OOPA pursue the CSB?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In asserting that OOPA was not pursuing the CSB, Bui makes three arguments. First, he says that OOPA’s board had never agreed to pursue the Central Supply Business. It was not enough for OOPA to show that the participants in the Facebook Messenger chat group known as OOP Inner Council were keen on the CSB. This is because it only included three of the five directors of OOPA, namely Bui, Ng and Liu. Of the other two directors, only one testified and he indicated he only learned of the CSB in mid-January 2019.

</div>
</div>
</div> Moreover, no board resolution had ever been passed concerning the CSB. But that is not the sum total of OOPA’s case. Bui did report to the entire board of OOPA in his email dated 16 January 2019. He referred in the first paragraph of that email to speaking to each of the recipients about the CSB in the previous few days. None of the board members of OOPA objected to the pursuit of the CSB. Moreover, it is not a general rule that a company can only pursue a particular opportunity upon the making of a formal board resolution. It may well be within the authority of one director or even an employee to pursue an opportunity on behalf of a company. It is a question of fact how any particular company has organised itself in terms of levels of authority. In this case, prior to 16 January 2019 the CSB was already actively being pursued and generating revenue for OnOnPay. This could not be said to have been unauthorised. Bui, as a director of both OnOnPay and OOPA, had caused OnOnPay to pursue it, and had consulted and kept informed two of his fellow OOPA directors, including via the Facebook Messenger chat group known as OOP Inner Council. It is illuminating to consider the flipside of Bui’s arguments. If he is right that the CSB could not have been pursued without first obtaining a board resolution from OOPA to that effect, then he would have been acting without authority. No one ever said that to him about the CSB business, and had the allegation been made it would have been straightforward for him to respond that he had the support of two of the other directors of OOPA (and from mid-January 2019, the agreement or, at the very least, the acquiescence of the remaining two members of the board). It is wrong to think that a company only actively pursues a business if there is a formal board resolution to do so. Authority may be given formally or informally. It may be delegated to one or more directors. Moreover, perusal of the OOP Inner Council messages shows that it operated to facilitate discussion among a smaller group of directors who were more involved and interested in operational matters. Nothing in it suggests any element of factionalism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Bui’s second argument is that OOPA did not want to pursue the CSB itself but only wanted to own Telio, which would be the entity to undertake the CSB. It is correct that OOPA as a Singapore holding company never intended to carry out the CSB itself. It would necessarily have to do so through a Vietnamese operating company, whether OnOnPay or a new entity such as Telio. However, this fact does not mean that OOPA was not pursuing the CSB. That a new business, for ordinary commercial reasons, will be housed under a new subsidiary does not make that business any less of an opportunity for the holding company. Moreover, given how it had structured matters in the past in relation to OnOnPay, the plan would probably have been for OOPA (or any substituted Singapore holding company) to own the IP relating to the CSB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Bui’s third argument is that at most OnOnPay was pursuing the CSB business, and OOPA was not doing so. This argument again tries to use the form of separate legal personality to avoid the substance of his breach of fiduciary duty. But in accepting that a business opportunity of OOPA’s may be carried out through its subsidiary it does not follow that the court would be conflating OOPA and OnOnPay or flouting the doctrine of separate legal personality of companies.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Issue 2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It follows from the answers to the three questions posed at [32] above that when Bui moved the CSB into Telio, denied OOPA’s ownership of Telio and caused Telio to enter into arrangements with Surge that OOPA did not know of, let alone consent to, he usurped a maturing business opportunity pursued by OOPA and hence breached his fiduciary duties to OOPA. Bui is liable to OOPA for these breaches of duty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Express trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 OOPA’s pleadings also raise the question of whether Bui held the shares in Telio on an express trust in favour of OOPA. The creation of an express trust requires three certainties to be present. These are certainty of intention, certainty of subject matter and certainty of the objects of the trust. All three were contested by Bui.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The company secretary of OOPA also incorporated Telio. A review of the email correspondence shows that it was contemplated at that time in January 2019 that Bui would thereafter at OOPA’s direction transfer all or part of the shareholding of Telio to such entity or entities as would fit with the new corporate structure that would be agreed upon. It is helpful to recap some excerpts in chronological sequence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 16 January 2019, Bui suggested “to establish a new entity… [whose] cap table shall fully reflect OnOnPay’s current one”.

Either Option 1 or Option 2 was to be implemented, and both involved Bui transferring his shares in Telio in accordance with what might eventually be agreed. From this contemporaneous correspondence, I hold that everyone involved, including Ng and Bui, had the common intention that Bui was incorporating Telio on behalf of OOPA and for the purpose of the CSB. I hold that Bui understood that he would have to transfer his shares in Telio in accordance with the outcome of the discussions about the new corporate structure. Naturally, Bui would have a say in what the eventual structure would be, both because of his shareholding in OOPA and his expected role in Telio. Nonetheless, until such time as those discussions concluded, he held the shares in Telio on behalf of OOPA and subject to OOPA’s direction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For completeness, I consider each of the three certainties in turn, starting with certainty of intention. That Bui intended to hold his shares in Telio on trust for OOPA is clearly inferred from his 16 January 2019 email to the directors and shareholders of OOPA when he made the suggestion that he carried out a few days later of establishing a new entity to hold the CSB and whose cap table would “fully reflect OnOnPay’s current one”.

</div> This can only be read as the assurance that the new entity was being established for structuring purposes, so that the CSB would be held by a company for which the CSB would be its only business and asset, and which would be free from any legacy liabilities of OnOnPay. Having a new entity to hold the CSB would facilitate attracting mew investors, who would be spared having to due diligence on OnOnPay. While he did not expressly say that upon incorporation of the new entity he would hold its shares on trust, this is the only inference to be drawn. The email cannot be reasonably read as Bui saying that he would hold the shares in the new entity in his own right as beneficial owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Certainty of subject matter is also established. While the argument could be mounted that ultimately OOPA would only own one of the three components of Telio’s shares and that some would go to founders and some would go to new investors, at the point of incorporation all the shares would be held on trust for OOPA. Under Option 1, all of those shares would be transferred to the new OOPA holding company, and this would happen upon a direction from OOPA following the board resolution of OOPA that the company secretary was expected to prepare. Even under Option 2, where only some of the shares would be transferred to OOPA or OOPA’s shareholders, the direction for transfer of the shares would be OOPA’s to give. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As for certainty of objects, it was clear that the beneficial owner of Bui’s shares in Telio was OOPA, and no one else. Returning to the correspondence, there is no suggestion that OnOnPay would own shares in Telio. That would not have fitted with how parties had gone about structuring the business. They followed the usual model of a Singapore incorporated holding company and a Vietnamese incorporated operating company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Having determined that Bui held the shares in Telio as OOPA’s nominee, it is not strictly necessary to decide whether imposing a constructive trust would be the proper remedy in respect of Bui’s usurpation of the CSB. Nonetheless, for completeness, including in case some of the shares registered in Bui’s name were issued to him at a later date, I will proceed to deal with that alternative. Before doing so, I need to consider whether Bui should be excused in whole or in part from liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Excuse under Companies Act s 391(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Bui sought to be excused under Companies Act s 391(1).

I do not agree with this as a blanket proposition, as the section’s invocation depends on first establishing honesty and reasonableness on the part of the individual seeking relief. Determining honesty and reasonableness may require examination of facts that would not necessarily have been put in issue by the plaintiff’s plea of breach of duty.

This is evident from the contemporaneous documents. In addition to Bui’s email to the board of OOPA on 16 January 2019 described at [--34] above, his email of 28 January 2019 to OOPA’s company secretary described at [40] above, and his email of 30 January 2019 to Ng described at [42] above, there is much else on record that shows that Bui knew the CSB belonged to OOPA. Two further examples will suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The first example concerns how Bui reached out to potential investors for Telio. When he did so, he referred to and relied on the track record the CSB as a business undertaken by OnOnPay.

</div> In this conversation he described the CSB, mentioning that it had been launched one and a half months previously and was now serving mom-and-pop shops and F&amp;B outlets, with monthly revenue of US$200,000. He talked up the high retention rate of the business, with each merchant doing at least four orders per month. He explained that it would be separated from OnOnPay and put under Telio and indicated that they were looking for $200,000 in investment with the new entity being valued at US$1 million. Discussions with Nextrans did not reach a final conclusion.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I reject this evidence. I find that Mr Bui was telling the truth in his Facebook post and equivocating in his evidence to the court. Mr Bui knew that the CSB had begun as a business undertaken by OnOnPay, using the IP owned by OOPA, and knew that it was not a matter of his giving the OOPA investors free shares in Telio, but a matter of Telio belonging to OOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 What is fair to say is that OOPA and its shareholders were either unwilling or unable to fund the CSB or Telio at an adequate level to facilitate its take-off. This lack of will or ability was acknowledged by OOPA’s investors, including Captii, and that is why discussions were held with potential investors, including Nextrans, with the consent of all concerned. When discussions with Nextrans did not bear fruit, it is simple to infer that Bui would have felt justifiably frustrated. As noted at [46] above, a fiduciary, at least in a commercial context such as this one, of an entrepreneur who became a director of a start-up company, is not obliged to be entirely selfless. Bui was entitled to look after his own interests. For example, he could have threatened to resign (which would have made it much harder for OOPA to make a success of the CSB) or bargained for a higher percentage for himself or for new investors. But he was not entitled to conceal what he was doing, nor to deal secretly with OOPA’s property as if it was his own. While OOPA and its shareholders were ready to involve potential new investors, OOPA never gave up the CSB as a business, or disclaimed its interest in pursuing it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 A fiduciary is under twin duties of loyalty and candour to his principal. Bui breached those duties when he dealt secretly with Surge in relation to Telio. While Bui was evasive in his answers during cross-examination, he did accept that he did not inform OOPA about his discussions with Surge or that Telio had entered into the investment agreement with Surge on 19 March 2019.

</div> In any case, the evidence is clear that he did not keep OOPA informed concerning his dealings with Surge in regard to Telio. This lack of candour is different from how he had generally kept OOPA informed in the past, both about the operations of the CSB and about earlier potential investors such as Nextrans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Given the evidence, I find that Bui did not act honestly or reasonably. Consequently, the question of exercising a discretion to relieve him from liability under Companies Act s 391(1) does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Bui contends that even if he is liable for breach of fiduciary duty to OOPA by his usurping the CSB, OOPA is not entitled to a declaration that he holds his shares in Telio on trust for OOPA. Bui’s counsel relied on the statement of principle in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Simonet</span> [2001] 2 BCLC 704 at [96]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the underlying basis of the liability of a director who exploits after his resignation a maturing business opportunity of the company is that the opportunity is to be treated as if it were property of the company in relation to which the director had fiduciary duties. By seeking to exploit the opportunity after resignation he is appropriating for himself that property. He is just as accountable as a trustee who retires without properly accounting for trust property. In the case of a director he becomes a constructive trustee of the fruits of his abuse of the company’s position which he has acquired in circumstances where he knowingly had a conflict of interest, and exploited it by resigning from the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The argument made is that Bui’s shares in Telio are not the fruit of his usurpation of the CSB; rather, Telio is the garden in which the CSB tree was planted, with the fruit being the generated profits.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 This argument misses the point. The corporate opportunity of the CSB belonged to OOPA. As it proceeded, it was rebranded as Telio (see for example Bui’s Facebook post described at [68] above). That is why the name of the new entity was also Telio. When Bui incorporated Telio, he did so for the purpose of taking over the CSB as an opportunity that belonged to OOPA. The shares he holds in Telio represent the gain he obtained from his breach of fiduciary duty. They are the fruits of his breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 This case bears a strong resemblance to the facts in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1097. That case concerned a partnership that owned and operated a restaurant, bar and club in Bali known as “Ku De Ta”. Subsequently, one of the partners incorporated a company in Singapore that then registered two trade marks for “Ku De Ta”. The Court of Appeal held that there was an express trust over the trade marks in favour of the partnership, but also considered that if an express trust had not been found to exist, they would have declared a constructive trust over the trade marks in favour of the partnership. There, the usurped corporate opportunity was the development of the “Ku De Ta” name and business in Singapore. Registering trade marks for that name in Singapore would be part of pursuing that corporate opportunity. In this sense, they were the fruits of the defendant’s usurpation of that corporate opportunity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the same way, had I not found that an express trust existed in the present case, I would have declared a constructive trust over the shares in Telio held by Bui, in favour of OOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: Equitable allowance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77  Bui sought an equitable allowance.

</div>
</div> This point was not developed very much by his counsel. I decline to exercise my discretion to grant an equitable allowance, for the reason that Bui did not act honestly or reasonably. As  explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Singaravelu Murugan</span> [2014] 1 SLR 847 at [23], “the power to grant an allowance to a fiduciary in breach should be exercised sparingly in order not to encourage fiduciaries to act in breach of their duties.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Fortunately for Bui, he will share in the profits of Telio via his interest in OOPA. It is also the case that to the extent he made any loans to OnOnPay these debts would remain owing to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It is true that had Bui been candid from the start, he would probably have been able to negotiate an agreement that some of the shares in Telio should be his beneficially, and so the net result of his dishonesty is that he has ended up in a worse position than he might have been in had he acted honestly from the start.  That this is so is simply the consequence of Bui’s own breach of fiduciary duty. Bui’s breach of fiduciary duty lay in taking for himself the shares in Telio for which he was accountable to OOPA. This was a breach of his custodial stewardship duty owed to OOPA in respect of the shares in Telio registered in his name, and by this judgment Bui is required to restore to OOPA what he took in breach of that duty. The fact that if he had not done so, he might have subsequently reached agreement with OOPA for him to have the beneficial interest in some of those shares is irrelevant, because at the time when he took them for himself they belonged to OOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 No evidence was adduced that Bui paid any part of the incorporation expenses for Telio, or contributed any equity capital to Telio in respect of the shares registered in his name. If he did so, when the shares are transferred to OOPA, OOPA must reimburse him for this expenditure by him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 It appears from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority records adduced in evidence that Bui holds 99,181 ordinary shares out of the 146,500 issued.

</div> No evidence was adduced concerning whether all of these shares were registered in his name from the start or whether some of them were issued by Telio subsequently, and if so when. Strictly, my finding of an express trust would only apply to such of the shares as were issued during the initial period in early 2019. Shares that were issued to him subsequently, for example at the same time as the entry of Surge into Telio, would not be held by him on express trust.

</div> OOPA also sought costs in respect of three interlocutory summonses, namely $700 costs and $877.52 disbursements for its application to serve out of the jurisdiction, $750 costs and $207.60 disbursements for the summons for directions and an unspecified amount of costs in relation to Bui’s application to give evidence by video link.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Costs should follow the event, and I award costs to OOPA. I accept the costs figure of $87,000 provided by them as eminently reasonable for the trial which took almost six days, two rounds of written submissions and a further half day for oral submissions. Its reasonableness is also supported by the fact that Bui claimed much higher costs if his defence succeeded. Turning to the disbursements, the only aspect which requires consideration is the item for Mr Potter’s fees. As I noted at [44] above, some of his evidence rested on a document that was not proven and so I have had to disregard that part of his evidence. In the end, his evidence was not germane to my decision, as I did not need to rely on it to discern that the CSB was an active business that used OOPA’s and OnOnPay’s resources: Bui’s own contemporaneous statements made that crystal clear. It has also not been necessary to rely on his valuation of the Telio business because I have found that the proper remedy is to declare that Bui holds the shares in Telio on trust for OOPA. This does not however mean that this disbursement was unreasonably or improperly incurred. Indeed, it was entirely reasonable for OOPA, in the face of denials and equivocation by Bui, to support its case by having an accountant review OnOnPay’s records and thereafter testify on them. I therefore award OOPA its disbursements of $146,407.93.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I also award OOPA costs and disbursements for the three summonses, namely $700 costs and $877.52 disbursements for its application to serve out of the jurisdiction, $750 costs and $207.60 disbursements for the summons for directions and $200 costs in relation to Bui’s application to give evidence by video link.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Bui as a director of OOPA owed it both loyalty and candour. While the success of the CSB was due in part to his efforts, he was not entitled to move the CSB into Telio and deny that he held Telio on OOPA’s behalf. Having secretly made a deal with new investors, he is accountable for the gain made by him flowing from his breach, and holds his shares in Telio on trust for OOPA.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Choon Guan Daniel (Eldan Law LLP) (instructed), Richard Yeoh Kar Hoe, Koong Len Sheng and Tan Kee Ming Glen (David Lim &amp; Partners LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Niklas Wong See Keat, Nguyen Vu Lan and Uma Jitendra Sharma (TSMP Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
