Affandi revealed that “dalam kereta ade something”, which meant there is something in the vehicle.

These findings were presented to show the connection of Fadzli and Affandi to the methamphetamine that were recovered from the two vehicles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) also assisted the prosecution by raising rebuttable presumptions against Fadzli and Affandi. As Fadzli admitted that he was in charge of SGW 4282 Y, and Affandi admitted that he was the owner of SJW 9386 M, they were presumed under s 21 read with s 18(2) of the MDA, to know of the nature of the drugs recovered from their respective vehicles. The provisions read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21. If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Section 17 MDA creates another presumption, that a person who is proved to have in his possession more than 2 grams of diamorphine or 25 grams of methamphetamine shall be presumed to have that drug for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Review of the Prosecution’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 To facilitate easier understanding, the review will be carried out according to the subject matter rather than the alphabetical order of the charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic">(i) <span class="font-weight-bold">Charge E</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The evidence is that Affandi informed the CNB officers about the eight bundles in his vehicle. He had in his contemporaneous and cautioned statements admitted that he knew them to be “panas” and that “Abut” (who is Fadzli) had instructed him to collect and store them for him to come and take them when he wanted to. By this evidence, Affandi either knew that the eight bundles were diamorphine (if he knew “panas” was diamorphine), or if he did not know that, he was presumed under s 18(2) to know that they were diamorphine. By storing them for Fadzli’s collection, he had them for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic">(ii) <span class="font-weight-bold">Charge A</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On the basis of Affandi’s admissions, Fadzli had abetted Affandi to have possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. It is noted that in his cautioned statement Affandi stated that from his point of view, Abut/Fadzli did not know that he (Affandi) had collected eight bundles because the other transaction involved one or two bundles. However Affandi’s surmise was unfounded because he did not know the arrangement Fadzli had with the supplier for that transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic">(iii) <span class="font-weight-bold">Charge F</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Affandi agreed in the SAF that the four packets of white crystalline substance recovered from his vehicle contained not less than 8.14 grams of methamphetamine.

Questions were raised over the time at which the exhibits were handed from one officer to another, the bags in which the exhibits were put into between the time of recovery and the time they were brought back to the CNB offices for marking, photographing and weighing, and manner in which they were stored by W/Insp Ng when they were in her custody.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It transpired that the officers did not record their involvement with the exhibits when that took place, and were largely relying on memory when they gave their evidence. There were inconsistencies in their evidence on the time when the exhibits changed hands and the colour of the bags in which the exhibits were held.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However it was not established that there was any break in the chain of custody in the sense that the exhibits had left the control of CNB officers and went in the control of unknown parties, or were otherwise unaccounted for.  Counsel contended that there was a real possibility of there being a break in the chain of custody without going further, with no indication as to when and how the chain of custody may have been broken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 While counsel was seeking to get from the officers a single clear and consistent account of the handing of the exhibits, it must be remembered that the drugs were recovered and retained when the officers were actively carrying out investigations, and took custody of the exhibits as a team.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It would take more than to allude to a real possibility of a break of custody by pointing to inconsistencies which do not add up to a break. In this case CNB officers had seized and taken custody of the exhibits, and the same exhibits were sent by them to the HSA for analysis.  To support the contention there must something put forward to show that the exhibits have left the custody of the officers, or that unauthorised parties had access to them at some time during that period, or that the exhibits have been interfered with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lai Kam Loy v PP</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 143 held at [38] (and reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">Satli bin Masot v PP</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 931 at [15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it cannot be that in every drug case it lies on the Prosecution to laboriously call every single witness to establish the chain of possession of the seized drugs. The need to do so only arises where a doubt as to the identity of an exhibit has arisen. This may arise for instance where it has been established that there was a shortfall in numbers or a failure to mark the exhibits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">it is not sufficient to contend that there is a break in the chain of possession without pointing to when, where and how the break may have occurred.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There was another issue raised with regard to the marked exhibits.  This was that while they were in custody of W/Insp Ng, she did not keep them in her office safe because there was no room for them. She kept them overnight on the floor of her office which she would lock. It was not put to W/Insp Ng that the exhibits should not have been stored in that way, or that any person could have gained access to the exhibits without her knowledge or consent.  There was no basis for this complaint.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Surveillance at the MBS carpark</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Mr John Abraham, counsel for Fadzli, was critical over the manner in which the CNB officers kept observation of Fadzli, Affandi and their vehicles in the MBS carpark. The officers’ evidence on the positions of the vehicles and the interaction of Fadzli and Affandi when they met and parted was sketchy, particularly in respect of Fadzli’s actions as he returned to his vehicle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However they were not prejudiced by that because one officer in the operation, Station Inspector Lim Chin Tat, testified that he observed that after meeting with Affandi, Fadzli returned to his vehicle with his arms by his side and appeared to be carrying something.  This was consistent with and corroborated the evidence of Affandi and Fadzli that Fadzli was collecting from Affandi groceries to be donated to an orphanage and had carried two large bottles of cooking oil to his vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Affandi’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Affandi retracted his contemporaneous statement and cautioned statement.

</div>, and all of them were tendered in evidence without objection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Affandi’s defence kept to the narrative in those subsequent statements. However his counsel did not go through each of them with him and have him confirm them although he was referred to parts of them when he was giving his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 He started with his account on the eight bundles. In his examination-in-chief on 11 July 2013, he said one Malaysian by the name “Mamak” had asked him to do him a favour as his (Mamak’s) car had been broken down, and to meet Mamak’s friend at a heavy vehicle carpark at Kranji near the Ten Mile Junction (“the Kranji carpark”). Affandi thought that he was to collect money from Mamak’s friend to deliver it to Mamak, as he had done on previous occasions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Affandi’s evidence was that he did not go directly to the carpark. He first drove to Johor Bahru sometime before midnight and when he returned to Singapore at almost 3 a.m. on 12 July, he went to the Kranji carpark.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 He entered the carpark, drove one round, and as he was about to exit, a person knocked on the passenger side window of his vehicle, and when he wound down the window the person put a plastic bag into the car. When Affandi asked what were in the bag, the person told him to wait for Mamak’s call, and walked away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Affandi then left the carpark and drove to MBS as he wanted to have his pre-dawn meal there before he started work as he was observing the Muslim fasting month. When he reached MBS, he took out eight bundles from the plastic bag but he was not sure what they were and he hid them under the third row of seats in his vehicle. He tried to call Mamak but Mamak’s number was not in use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 He then realised that he had left his work pass at home, and went back to get it. He had his pre-dawn meal at home and took a lift from a colleague to work at about 8 a.m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Subsequently Mamak called him. However, he was busy working at that time. He told Mamak he was busy, and terminated the call without asking about the bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 At about 3 p.m., Fadzli telephoned him. Fadzli had asked him two days previously to donate groceries to an orphanage, and called him at that time to check if the groceries were ready for collection, and they agreed to meet. When they met, and Affandi delivered groceries from his vehicle to Fadzli.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This was corroborated by evidence of the CNB officers in the operation that groceries consisting of two bottles cooking oil, two packets coffee powder, a few packets of instant noodles and two packets detergent powder were recovered from Fadzli’s vehicle after his arrest.

There were records of six communications between Affandi and Mamak between 4.14 a.m. and 4.35.50 a.m. consisting two outgoing calls from Affandi, two SMS messages from Affandi and two SMS messages from Mamak.

</div>. Affandi was at the time of arrest and not long before making of the statements in a co-operative frame of mind, telling the officers searching his locker that there was something in his vehicle, and offering to tell them “A to Z”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I find that Affandi had gone to Johor Bahru in the early hours of 12 July 2013 and returned to Singapore at 3.30 a.m., but he did not drive to the Kranji carpark. Instead, he went to the MBS carpark directly, hid the eight bundles between a row of seats, left the vehicle there, and went home. He returned to MBS later in the morning when he met Fadzli at his vehicle, and Fadzli collected something from him and drove off.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Did Affandi know that the bundles were diamorphine? There was no direct evidence that he knew the eight bundles stored in his vehicle were diamorphine. He knew them to be “panas” but did not know what panas was, and that was not contradicted by any evidence. He may have not known that the bundles were diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Nevertheless, he was presumed to have knowledge of the diamorphine. The question was whether he had rebutted the presumption. To rebut the presumption, Affandi had to show positively that he did not know that the bundles were diamorphine, but Affandi could only say that he thought the bundles were panas, which he suspected to be something illegal, but he did not enquire about them or examine them. The confusion, equivocation and falsehood in his evidence undermined his creditability and his effort to rebut the presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 We can now examine his position on each of the charges he faced. With reference to <span class="font-weight-bold">charge</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> E</span>, Affandi’s Closing Submissions states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. The 2nd Accused (Affandi) humbly submits there is a reasonable doubt cast on the Prosecution’s case as to whether the 8 bundles of powdery/granular substances seized from the 2nd Accused’s vehicle bearing registration SJW9368 M (“SUV”) seized were the same as the 8 bundles analysed by the Health Sciences Authority to contain not less than 132.82 grams of diamorphine and produced in Court marked as P135 – P151.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">on the basis that there was a break in the chain of possession of the eight bundles recovered from Affandi’s vehicle. I have dealt with this submission and had rejected it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The undisputed fact is that Affandi was in possession of the eight bundles. He was presumed under s 18(2) to know that they contained diamorphine, and by his admission that he had collected the bundles and was keeping them for Fadzli, he had them for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The onus was on him to rebut the presumption by presenting credible evidence and showing on a balance probabilities that he did not have the knowledge, and he failed to do that. In the circumstances he is guilty on this charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 With regard to <span class="font-weight-bold">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold">harge F</span>, it was undisputed that Affandi had the four packets of methamphetamine in his possession. He knew that the packets were “ice” which is the street name for methamphetamine, and said he had it for his own consumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In this case, Affandi’s possession of the 8.14 grams of methamphetamine did not raise the presumption under s 17 that he had them for the purpose of trafficking, and the prosecution did not present any evidence of such a purpose. To the contrary, when a cautioned statement was recorded from Affandi in relation to this charge, he stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ice that is found with me is for my own consume, not for trafficking.

He paid Man Topak a $320 top-up for the drugs and had intended them for his own consumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Fadzli absolutely denied any involvement with the methamphetamine recovered from Affandi’s vehicle referred to in <span class="font-weight-bold">charge D</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Review of Fadzli’s defences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The first matter for consideration is the effect of Affandi’s contemporaneous statement and cautioned statement on Fadzli. Affandi had tried to retract both statements. If he had succeeded to show that he was not speaking the truth when he made them, then he and Fadzli would not to be troubled by them. However I have found that Affandi was not confused, scared or pressurized and was not lying when he made the admissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Affandi’s admissions may be used against Fadzli under s 258(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Explanation – </span>“Offence” as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 This provision was in our laws as s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) before it was re-enacted as s 258(5) CPC on 2 January 2011.  Its effect has been explained in two seminal decisions. In <span class="font-italic">Chin Seow Noi and others v PP</span> [1993] 3 SLR (R) 566 the Court of Criminal Appeal held at [84]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the plain and literal meaning of s 30, read together with illus (<span class="font-italic">a</span>), is that the confession of a co-accused may be made part of the substantive evidence against the accused in the same manner it forms part of the evidence against the confessing co-accused. It is trite law that an accused person may be convicted solely on the basis of his confession. There is nothing in the section or in the Act itself which would point ineluctably to the conclusion that there must exist “independent” evidence against the co-accused before the confession of his co-accused can be used against him. The natural interpretation of s 30 is that it allows the conviction of an accused person to be sustained solely on the basis of a confession by his co-accused, provided, of course, that the evidence emanating from that confession satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. A narrower construction would emasculate s 30.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In <span class="font-italic">Goh Joon Tong and another v PP</span> [1995] 3 SLR (R) 90, the Court of Appeal reviewed the effect of the Explanation to s 30. It referred to the Indian Evidence Act which has an identical s 30 and Explanation as s 30 of our Evidence Act (before it became s 258(5) CPC) and held at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As is stated in Woodroffe and Amir Ali’s <span class="font-italic">Law of Evidence</span> (15th Ed) at p 1005:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Prior to the insertion of the Explanation to this section, the commission of an offence and the commission of its abetment were held to be different offences. Thus, it had been held that, upon the trial of A for murder, and of B for abetment thereof, a confession by A implicating B could not be taken into consideration against B under this section. Act III of 1891 has, however, by the insertion of the explanation to this section, altered the law in this respect. But this Explanation applies only to cases where one person is charged with an offence, and another is actually charged with and tried for, abetment of it, or attempt to commit it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Court than went on to find at [43] that s 30 applied in that case in which the first accused was charged with abetting murder and the second and third accused were charged with murder, because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the explanation to s 30 extends its operation to the confession of a co-accused charged with the particular offence where the other co-accused is charged with abetment of or attempt to commit that offence, or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The law applicable to the present case, as established in these two cases is that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) when two or more persons are tried jointly for the same offence, the confession of one accused may be substantive evidence against his co-accused, and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) when the accused persons are charged with:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) an offence (“the principal offence”), and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the abetment or attempt of the principal offence (“the associated offence”),</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">the principal offence and the associated offence are treated as the same offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Accordingly, Affandi’s confessions are admissible evidence against Fadzli, and that leads to two questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Are the admissions in Affandi’s contemporaneous statement and cautioned statement confessions? and if they are,</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) What weight is to be placed on them?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Affandi’s statements set out in [9] and [10] are confessions. He admitted that he had possession of the eight bundles and that he was keeping them for Fadzli. Although he claimed that he did not know they contained diamorphine, he was presumed to have known that, and he failed to rebut the presumption (see [75] and [76] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It hardly needs reminding that admissibility does not imply weight. As Professor Jeffrey Pinsler cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> (4th Ed, LexisNexis 2013) at para 5.076:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Despite the Court of Appeal’s assurance in <span class="font-italic">Chin Siew Noi</span> that the courts are to exercise caution in admitting evidence under the former s 30, real concerns remain about the potential injustice which may result. There is a real likelihood that the maker of the statement might falsely incriminate his accomplice so as to preserve his chance of acquittal or to minimise the significance of his role in the crime. Such a consequence is all the more likely in the course of interrogation as the maker is strongly encouraged to give information concerning the crime. Furthermore, if the maker does not testify, he cannot be cross-examined by his accomplice or the prosecution. Consequently, the court would be entitled to assess potentially false evidence against an accused who has had no opportunity to challenge it. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As to the weight of the confessions, I have found that they are Affandi’s voluntary and true statements (see [70] above). When he made his defence Affandi did not explain why he made the contemporaneous statement, beyond an oblique reference that the recording officer told him that he was facing the death sentence (see [56] above). He did not say the effect that had on him, or that he had falsely incriminated Fadzli to preserve his chance of acquittal or to minimise the significance of his role in the crime. There was no reason for Affandi to falsely incriminate his friend Fadzli when he could have said that he had collected and held the bundles for Mamak, if that were true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 With regard to his cautioned statement, his explanation was that it was made to accord with his contemporaneous statement, and that he was making up more lies to save himself although he could not say why he needed to do that (see [58] and [59] above). I found Affandi’s reasons for retracting the confessions in the contemporaneous statement and the cautioned statement unworthy of belief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 But these statements did not stand alone. There were other facts:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Fadzli and Affandi made two calls each to the other in the morning of 12 July 2013 when the eight bundles were delivered to Affandi (see [68] and [69]),</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Fadzli’s failure to recognise Affandi by his photograph, and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) his denial that he was “Abut”, the name by which Affandi knew him (see [107] and [108] below)</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">which indicated that there was something going on between him and Affandi in connection to their arrests which he was trying to conceal (see [108]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Great care should be exercised before deciding to use the confession of an accused person against his co-accused. I reviewed the matters referred in the foregoing paragraphs before concluding that Affandi’s confessions should stand as substantive evidence against Fadzli as I found that Affandi was telling the truth on how he came into possession of the eight bundles and who they belonged to when he made the confessions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Did Fadzli commit the offence in <span class="font-weight-bold">C</span><span class="font-weight-bold">harge A</span> by issuing the instructions to Affandi? This brings on the question of his (Fadzli’s) knowledge of the contents of the bundles. This calls for an examination of the facts. Fadzli wanted Affandi to collect the bundles in the darkness of night, shrouded in stealth. Fadzli arranged for the bundles to be delivered and kept by Affandi, because he (Fadzli) was the owner of the bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Fadzli must know what was to be collected and kept for him – he cannot possibly be ignorant of or indifferent to that. There was also no likelihood that he had intended for something else other than diamorphine to be collected and kept. Bulk transactions of drugs are serious and risky undertakings carried out with care and planning. When diamorphine is intended, diamorphine will be delivered; it is inconceivable for diamorphine to be delivered by mistake. The irresistible inference is that Fadzli knew the bundles were diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Fadzli’s defence, however, should not be disregarded.

</div>. In other words, he did not consume methamphetamine between Monday morning and Friday night. As 12 July 2013 (the day of arrest) fell on a Friday, Fadzli would not need any methamphetamine before the night. There was no reason for him to take the risk of having all the methamphetamine with him rather than carrying just what he needed. This cast serious doubts whether the methamphetamine was for his own consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Another point of note was Fadzli’s non-disclosure of Man Topak’s telephone number. Fadzli said that Man Topak had given him his handphone number, and he had entered and saved the number in his handphone without Man Topak’s name. He had called Man Topak on the number in March 2013 after he won the bet, but subsequently Man Topak’s handphone was switched off and he did not have contact with Man Topak until he ran into him by chance in July 2013, when the repayment with drugs proposal was made
