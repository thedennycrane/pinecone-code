        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, the plaintiff, Nikolay Vorobiev,
                    had sued the defendants, John Frederick Peters Lush (“Lush”),
                    Francois Ostinelli (“Ostinelli”) and Alexander Novoselov
                    (“Novoselov”) for fraudulent/negligent misrepresentation and
                    conspiracy. The immediate issue at hand is whether this action should be stayed
                    on the ground that Singapore is not the appropriate forum because Switzerland is
                    the more appropriate forum. An assistant registrar had made a stay order, and
                    the plaintiff had appealed against the order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background of the action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Petroval SA (“PSA”), a company
                    incorporated under the laws of Switzerland, was part of the Yukos Group, and had
                    been described as being solely owned by Yukos International UK B.V. PSA had a
                    representative office in Singapore which managed and marketed PSA’s oil
                    products in the Far East. In 2004, the representative office was upgraded into
                    Petroval Pte Ltd (“Petroval Singapore”), a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. The plaintiff, a permanent resident of Singapore was appointed to be
                    its first director with more directors appointed subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant, Lush, was formerly the
                    General Manager of PSA and is a director of Petroval Singapore since 19
                    September 2005. The second defendant, Ostinelli, was formerly the Chief
                    Financial Officer of PSA and is a director of Petroval Singapore since 19
                    September 2005. The third defendant, Novoselov, was formerly an employee of PSA
                    and later a director of Petroval Singapore from 19 September 2005 to 17 October
                    2008. One Artem Zakharov (“Zakharov”) was a former employee of
                    PSA. Zakharov had died in July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff’s case was that, in February
                    2006, Zakharov informed him that the majority shareholder of Petroval Singapore
                    might be selling its stake in Petroval Singapore, and that the plaintiff
                        <em>might be offered</em> a stake in Petroval
                    Singapore. In March 2008, <em>an offer was made</em> to the
                    plaintiff in Geneva by the defendants to buy a stake in Petroval
                        Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff accepted the offer and
                    acquired a 20% shareholding in Petroval Singapore by acquiring a 20% stake in
                    Stainby Overseas Ltd (“Stainby”) which held all the shares of
                    Petroval Singapore. For the 20% shareholding of Stainby (and through that a 20%
                    shareholding of Petroval Singapore), the plaintiff paid US$3,810,000 and
                    received through his nominees 20% of the shares of Stainby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequent to the purchase of the 20% interest
                    in Petroval Singapore through Stainby, the plaintiff made two loans to Petroval
                    Singapore. In May/June 2006, the defendants, the plaintiff and Zakharov agreed
                    to make a loan of US$10m to Petroval Singapore, and the plaintiff paid his 20%
                    share of the US$10m loan, amounting to US$2m (“the first
                    loan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In September 2006, the defendants, the plaintiff
                    and Zakharov agreed to make a further loan of US$5m to Petroval Singapore, and
                    the plaintiff paid his 20% share of the further loan amounting to US$1m
                    (“the second loan”). These two loans extended by the plaintiff
                    have not been repaid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff sued the defendants in connection
                    with the US$3,810,000 payment for the Petroval Singapore shares and the US$3m he
                    lent to Petroval Singapore. The plaintiff’s action is founded on
                    fraudulent/negligent misrepresentation and conspiracy. The claim in
                    misrepresentation was that the defendants had misrepresented that they had the
                    authority of the beneficial owners of the Petroval Singapore shares to deal with
                    the shares, and that they were authorised by the beneficial owners of the
                    Petroval Singapore shares to offer 20% of the shares to the plaintiff for
                    US$3,810,000. The plaintiff’s case was that the defendants had made these
                    representations with the intention that he would act on them, and that he did
                    rely on and act on them<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The conspiracy claim was based on the same facts
                    as the claim on misrepresentation, <em>ie</em>, that they
                    had, wrongly and dishonestly and with the intent to injure the plaintiff,
                    conspired and agreed to make the representations to induce the plaintiff to make
                    payments of the US$3,810,000 and US$3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff claimed that he had subsequently
                    found out that the representations were false. In June 2006, the defendants
                    informed him that PSA had claimed that the defendants were holding the PSA
                    shares on trust for PSA, and that PSA had accused the defendants of having acted
                    in breach of trust by dealing with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In December 2007, PSA commenced proceedings in
                    the British Virgin Islands (“the BVI proceedings”) against the
                    defendants, Stainby and others over the Petroval Singapore shares. These
                    proceedings have been stayed on the ground of <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em>. In February 2008, PSA commenced proceedings in
                    Singapore in Suit No 103 of 2008 (“the Singapore
                    Proceedings”) against the defendants and others in respect of the same
                    shares. In the Singapore Proceedings, PSA asserted that Lush and Ostinelli had
                    executed Letters of Confirmation acknowledging that they held the first two
                    subscriber shares in Petroval Singapore on trust for PSA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. However, PSA and the defendants came to
                    a settlement and the action against the defendants was discontinued, but the
                    terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The plaintiff was not a party in the
                    Singapore Proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on <em>forum non
                conveniens</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The law on <em>forum non
                        conveniens</em> is set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime
                        Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> [1987] AC 460 (“<em>Spiliada</em>”). The law, commonly referred to as the
                        <em>Spiliada</em> principles, has been discussed in a
                    host of local decisions, and it is sufficient to refer to the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort
                        Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 543 where it explained at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The gist of these principles is that, under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, a stay will only be granted
                        where the court is satisfied that there is some other available and more
                        appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The burden of establishing
                        this rests on the defendant and it is not enough just to show that Singapore
                        is not the natural or appropriate forum. The defendant must also establish
                        that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more
                        appropriate than Singapore. The natural forum is one with which the action
                        has the most real and substantial connection. In this regard, the factors
                        which the court will take into consideration include not only factors
                        affecting convenience or expense (such as the availability of witnesses) but
                        also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places
                        where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If the court
                        concludes, at this stage of the inquiry (“stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test”), that there is no other
                        available forum which is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the
                        action, it will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, at this stage, it concludes
                        that there is some other available forum which <em>prima
                            facie</em> is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the
                        action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by
                        reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused.
                        In this connection, the court will consider all the circumstances of the
                        case. For this second stage inquiry (“stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test”), the legal burden is on the
                        plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first defendant’s application and the connecting

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first defendant applied for the
                    plaintiff’s action to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum
                        non conveniens</em> in that Switzerland is a more appropriate forum
                    than Singapore. The first defendant submitted that there was a multitude of
                    factors that connected the dispute to Switzerland.</p>

<p class="Judg-2">Three classes of documents in Singapore which
                    can be significant in the determination whether the defendants held the Petroval

                    in the possession of Petroval Singapore’s corporate secretaries, DrewCorp
                    Services Pte Ltd (“DrewCorp”), secondly, documents and

<em>The Singapore Proceedings</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The defendants in
                    the present action are also the defendants in the Singapore Proceedings, and the
                    central issue in both proceedings is whether the shares of Petroval Singapore
                    are held on trust for PSA. If the present action is transferred to Switzerland,
                    there is a risk of inconsistent decisions on the trust issue in Singapore and in
                    Switzerland. (This factor should probably come within stage two rather than
                    stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, but in either
                    case, its significance is limited because the Singapore Proceedings were

                        Plaintiff’s claims</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The applicable law to
                    determine the law of tort is <em>lex fori</em>. The tort of
                    fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation is committed when
                    the representation is relied on. As the majority of the representations were
                    received and relied on in Singapore, it would follow that the conspiracy by
                    unlawful means took place in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the connecting factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The connecting factors relied on by the
                    opposing parties have to be evaluated. The review should not be a counting
                    exercise. While a factor may connect to one jurisdiction or the other, the
                    nature of a factor and its effect on the full and fair determination and
                    disposal of the dispute carry greater weight than the sum of the
                factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Of the factors identified by the first
                    defendant, the compellability of witnesses could be a strong factor if the
                    intended witnesses would not attend court without compulsion, and if Swiss law
                    is the law governing the alleged wrongdoings, that is also a strong connecting
                    factor. The domicile of the defendants and the place of Petroval
                    Singapore’s day-to-day business are less important because the issues do
                    not involve the personal law or the law of domicile of the defendants, and have
                    nothing to do with the day-to-day business of Petroval Singapore. Similarly, the
                    Swiss criminal hearing is not a material consideration because they had
                    concluded with no finding of wrongdoings. The other factors were likewise
                    insubstantial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Turning to the plaintiff’s
                    Singapore-connecting factors, if the law governing the alleged wrongdoings is
                    Singapore law, that is a strong connecting factor. The location of the documents
                    in Singapore can be a significant factor if the documents will shed light on the
                    beneficial ownership of the Petroval Singapore shares the plaintiff purchased.
                    However, it is pertinent to note that in the Singapore Proceedings, PSA had
                    asserted that Lush and Ostinelli had executed Letters of Confirmation only in
                    relation to the first subscriber shares, but not the other Petroval Singapore
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Both parties recognised that the law governing
                    the wrongdoings is a major factor in deciding whether Switzerland or Singapore
                    is the more appropriate forum, but they disagreed over which is the governing
                    law. The first defendant contended that it is the law of Switzerland, and the
                    plaintiff submitted that it is Singapore law. The underlying facts are not in
                    dispute. The plaintiff had alleged that, in February 2006, Zakharov informed him
                    that the majority shareholder of Petroval Singapore might offer to sell to him a
                    stake in those shares and that, in March 2008, the offer was made to him in
                    Geneva and he accepted the offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff did not identify the place where the information was given in February
                    2006. As he was contending that Singapore is the appropriate forum for the
                    action, he would have stated that the information given in February 2006 was
                    given in Singapore if that was the case. As matters stand, the only known
                    location is Geneva, where the offer was made and accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff submitted that “(t)he
                    courts have accepted that the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent
                    misrepresentation is committed when the representation is communicated to the
                    plaintiff and when the representation is relied on”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>, citing <em>inter
                        alia</em>, <em>Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal
                        Ltd</em> [1979] 2 WLR 228 (“<em>Diamond</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>Diamond</em> the
                    English Court of Appeal had to decide on the jurisdiction which governed the
                    tort of fraudulent misrepresentation on an aborted sale of sugar negotiated
                    between a London commodity broker acting for the buyer and American brokers
                    acting for the sellers. Lord Denning MR held at p 234:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation it seems to me that the
                        tort is committed at the place where the representation is received and
                        acted upon; and not the place from which it was sent. Logically, it seems to
                        me, the same applies to a negligent misrepresentation by telephone or by
                        telex. <em>It is committed where it is received and acted
                            upon</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and Stephenson LJ held at pp 236-7 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The choice between the plaintiff and the defendants in this case depends
                        on the nature of the tort of deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation and the
                        correct analysis of the different stages by which the tort is complete and
                        the cause of action is founded upon it. It begins with the statement issuing
                        from the defendant by word of mouth or through recording by telex or in
                        writing. That statement is then received, believed and acted upon by the
                        plaintiff to his resulting damage and loss. All these different stages may
                        be divided from each other in time and space. If A speaks his representation
                        to B in the same room, there is no appreciable change of time or space until
                        B comes, perhaps later, to act upon the representation. If A writes his
                        representation to B on the other side of the world, the appreciable changes
                        begin at the beginning, and what begins on one date and in one place takes
                        effect at a later date and in another place. But it is settled law that
                        A’s misrepresentation, however fraudulent and morally wrong, does not
                        become tortuous until B not merely receives it but acts upon it: ...
                        Although A’s part of the tort is committed when and where he speaks or
                        telexes or writes the misrepresentation, B’s part is needed to
                        complete the tort by acting upon the representation, and <em>the tort is committed, in my judgment, when and where he does so
                            act</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On that basis, the tort of misrepresentation
                    took place when the plaintiff relied on the representations and accepted the
                    offer in Geneva, and the applicable law is Swiss law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The conspiracy allegation is essentially the
                    misrepresentation allegation from the perspective that the defendants had agreed
                    to make those misrepresentations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> When it
                    comes to the conspiracy allegation, the law is laid out in Halsbury’s Laws
                    of Singapore, Vol 18 (LexisNexis, 2009 Reissue) at para 240.688:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to make out a case of conspiracy the plaintiff must establish (1)
                        an agreement between two or more persons, (2) an agreement for the purpose
                        of injuring the plaintiff, and (3) that acts done in execution of that
                        agreement resulted in damage to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     There is no information on where the
                    conspiracy was hatched and no suggestion that the defendants were present
                    together in Singapore before or when the offer was made. As the defendants are
                    domiciled in Switzerland, if they had agreed to make the false representations
                    to the plaintiff to induce him to buy the Petroval Singapore shares, it was most
                    likely that they did that in Switzerland. In any event the plaintiff had not
                    alleged that the agreement was made in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After the place of the alleged torts of
                    misrepresentation and conspiracy is established to be Switzerland, the law
                    governing the torts has to be determined. As the plaintiff had pointed out in
                    its submissions<em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></em>, the law applicable to determine
                    the law of the tort is the <em>lex fori, ie</em>, the law
                    applicable will be determined by the law of Singapore. By the law of Singapore,
                    in deciding the law applicable for a tort, the “substance of the
                    tort” test is used. It was explained by Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in
                        <em>Wing Hak Man and another v Bio-Treat Technology Ltd and
                        others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 446 at [26] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The test requires the court, in deciding where the alleged conspiracy
                        took place, to “look back over the series of events”
                        constituting the elements of the tort and ask where in substance did the
                        cause of action arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As I have found that the misrepresentation and conspiracy took place
                    in Switzerland, the applicable law for both causes of action is the law of
                    Switzerland.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The accepted thinking is that all things being
                    equal, it is preferable that a dispute be determined by a court applying its own
                    law rather than a court applying a foreign law because a court would be more
                    familiar with the former than the latter. The Court of Appeal has ruled in
                        <em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von
                        Uexkull</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [43] and in <em>JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<em>JIO
                        Minerals</em>”) at [96] that the mere fact of the application
                    of a foreign governing law may be accorded due weight in the absence of evidence
                    of the content of the foreign law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is also settled law that the place of the
                    tort is <em>prima facie</em> the natural forum – see
                        <em>JIO Minerals</em> at [106]. On this basis,
                    Switzerland would be regarded as the natural forum in the normal case, and there
                    was nothing to displace the rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In view of these findings, Switzerland is a
                    more appropriate forum for the determination of the dispute than Singapore. The
                    applicant has fulfilled the <em>Spiliada</em> stage one
                    requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     That leads to stage two of the test –
                    whether justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The
                    plaintiff argued that there is a risk of substantial injustice if the
                    proceedings were stayed in favour of Switzerland. The plaintiff made three
                    points in support<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Risk of inconsistent decisions on the same trust
                            issue in the event that the Singapore Proceedings

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The plaintiff is unable to have documents in the
                            possession of PSA and Petroval Singapore admitted in evidence;

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The plaintiff should be allowed access to the

                            those papers.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On ground (a), PSA had filed Notices of
                    Discontinuance of its claims against Lush, Ostinelli and Novoselov. Furthermore,
                    no step has been taken by any party in the proceedings for more than a year, and
                    the whole action is deemed to be discontinued under O 22 r 2(6) of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed). In the circumstances, there will
                    be no decision, and no likelihood of inconsistent decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Grounds (b) and (c) arise out of the same
                    concern. They are that if the plaintiff has to commence proceedings in
                    Switzerland, he would not be able to compel witnesses from DrewCorp and Petroval
                    Singapore to produce documents in connection with the trust issue and produce
                    cause papers of the Singapore Proceedings in their possession in Switzerland.
                    The plaintiff made these submissions in general terms, without identifying any
                    documents known or believed to be in the possession of DrewCorp and Petroval
                    Singapore which are relevant to the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In respect to the cause papers of the
                    Singapore Proceedings, the plaintiff’s submissions proceeded on the basis
                    that he will not have access to the cause papers in the Singapore Proceedings if
                    he were to bring his action in Switzerland. That may not be the case because all
                    three defendants in the present proceedings were defendants in the Singapore
                    Proceedings, and they would have the cause papers in their possession. That
                    being the case, the plaintiff may be able to compel them to produce the cause
                    papers; that would be possible under our Rules of Court, and the plaintiff has
                    not stated that he will not be able to do that in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The examination did not support the submission
                    that substantial injustice would result if the matter is heard in Switzerland,
                    and the stay application is not defeated by the second <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the circumstances, the plaintiff’s
                    appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
