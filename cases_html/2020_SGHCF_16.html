</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I agree with the Husband that the bank and CPF accounts should be valued as of the IJ date. The assets are not the accounts themselves, but the moneys in the accounts. Money is, in that sense, distinct from the other categories of assets, because its “value” is, for the purposes of the division exercise, simply the amount of money that is available. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14  Originally, a significant dispute between the parties was in relation to the valuation of various portfolios that the Husband had kept his assets in. These were referred to as the “UOB Portfolio”, “Indosuez Portfolio”, “UBS Portfolio”, and “DBS Portfolio”. The same issue arose in relation to the parties’ Joint DBS Account No ending in 9686 (“DBS Account 9686”). These are mixed portfolios, in that they include bank accounts and various investment assets. As a matter of principle, therefore, I considered that the IJ date ought to be used to value the bank accounts and their balances, while the AM date ought to be used to value the assets. As there was little information concerning the latter, I had asked the Husband to provide documents for the valuation of the assets at the AM date and to correspond with the Wife accordingly. Subsequently, counsel from both sides came to an amicable agreement on how these portfolios were to be treated. As indicated in a letter dated 20 August 2020 to the court, parties agreed to use the IJ date to value the above portfolios and DBS Account 9686. As such, I have treated these assets as agreed assets with agreed valuations, utilising the undisputed documentary evidence to arrive at the value of these assets closest the IJ date, with the exception of the UOB Portfolio, in respect of which the Wife had raised other objections and sought an adverse inference to be drawn for allegedly dissipated assets.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In order to properly understand the nature of s 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) WC, it is important to see it in the context of s 112 as a whole. Section 112(1) WC sets out the court’s power to “order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale or any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable”. This power is supplemented by ss 112(3) and (4) WC, which read:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The court may make all such other orders and give such directions <span class="font-italic">as may be necessary or expedient to give effect to any order made under this section</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is in the context of ss 112(3) and (4) WC that s 112(5) provides a list of orders that the court <span class="font-italic">may</span> make (without prejudice to the generality of those previous provisions), including s 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A]n order for any matrimonial asset, or the sale proceeds thereof, to be vested in any person (including either party) to be held on trust for such period and on such terms as may be specified in the order …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Seen in this light, s 112(5) WC only provides examples of orders that <span class="font-italic">supplement</span> and <span class="font-italic">give</span> <span class="font-italic">effect</span> <span class="font-italic">to</span> the primary orders under s 112(1) WC for the division of matrimonial assets. The court is not entitled to pre-empt the division exercise and to declare certain assets as held on trust. Instead, the court must undertake the division exercise according to what is just and equitable. It is only after deciding on the appropriate orders to be made, that a court can then consider what <span class="font-italic">other</span> orders (including an order under s 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) WC) are necessary or expedient to give effect to the orders for division. Hence, in the present case, the French and Tanglin properties could not be removed from the division exercise simply by the declaration of a trust over the properties in favour of the Children. They had to be considered as part of the division exercise, following which, if necessary or expedient, a trust could be declared <span class="font-italic">in order to give effect to</span> the division order made under s 112 WC. Therefore, I consider that the French and Tanglin properties should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division. In the absence of an existing trust over the properties, it was not within the court’s power to order that the properties be held on trust before considering how the matrimonial assets should be divided.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It is convenient for me to now deal with the closely linked issue of whether a trust would ultimately be appropriate in this case. I do not see any facts that suggest that a trust would be necessary to give effect to the division of matrimonial assets. First, the Wife referred to an alleged agreement and common understanding between the parties that the properties would be held on trust. I was not pointed to any evidence of such an agreement – the Husband is correct to say that positions taken during negotiations were not sufficient, since there is no evidence of a settled agreement on this issue.

However, the division exercise is not primarily concerned with the Children’s future well-being, but with the fair apportionment between husband and wife of the economic fruits of the marriage. The concerns raised by the Wife are better addressed under the issue of maintenance, if at all. In this regard, it must be recognised that an order under s 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) WC is different from the power to order security to be furnished for the purposes of providing maintenance, under s 115(2) WC. Section 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) WC is intended to give effect to the <span class="font-italic">division</span> exercise, not to ensure that sufficient assets remain available for the payment of maintenance. In any case, given the total value of the assets involved, the risk highlighted by the Wife is not significant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Therefore, I also conclude that it is not necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the orders for division to order that the French and Tanglin properties be held on trust under s 112(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) WC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having decided that the French and Tanglin properties are to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, I turn to their valuations.

The Husband urged the court to deduct the loan that was repaid by a lump sum <span class="font-italic">after</span> the IJ date, such that the net value of the property would be €385,927.69. The Wife proposed that the gross value of the property be used, since the loan has been completely repaid. As the loan was repaid after the IJ date but before the AM date, and as I have valued the bank accounts at the IJ date, I decide to deduct the loan that was repaid, because that amount would be adequately accounted for in valuation of the bank accounts. Otherwise, there would be a double-counting of the amount in the bank account at the IJ date and of the amount used to pay off the debt by the AM date. Therefore, I adopt the Husband’s valuation of €385,927.69 (being €550,000 - €164,072.31

</div> The car was later traded in and the sum of S$205,000.00 was given to the Wife in September 2020. At this point, a dispute arose as to whether the Husband, in seeking the Wife’s agreement for the trade-in, had agreed to exclude the proceeds from the pool of matrimonial assets. No affidavits were filed, but screenshots of messages were presented as part of correspondence from the parties. Having considered the material before me, I do not find that the Husband had agreed to exclude the proceeds from the pool of matrimonial assets – his statement that the proceeds were the Wife’s assets can be understood to refer to the fact that the car was always to be treated as an asset in her name for the purposes of division. In any case, as noted above, the principle for identification is that the assets should be identified at the date of the IJ. Therefore, I find that the car should be considered as part of the pool. As for the sum of the proceeds, it was agreed between parties that the Wife received S$205,000.00. I use this sum as the valuation of the car as I consider it to be the better approximation of the value of the car as of the AM hearing date.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Loans owing to the Wife’s sister</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Wife argued that her debt of S$601,424.35 owing to her sister should be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets.

</div> The Husband disputed this, on the basis that the debt was purely the Wife’s and was taken after the IJ date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I agree with the Husband. First, the loan was taken after the IJ date. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, therefore, this was a liability incurred after the date on which the matrimonial assets were to be identified, and should not be included in the pool. Second, even if part of the purpose of the loan was to support herself and the Children, it is undisputed that the Husband did voluntarily provide a sum for maintenance each month. Insofar as she complained that the maintenance was insufficient, it was open for her to apply to court for an order relating to maintenance. No such application was filed. She chose to take the loan from her sister instead, and there is no basis for the court to now say that the Husband ought to have paid maintenance to her to the tune of around S$600,000 and that the whole liability should be accounted for in the pool of matrimonial assets. Since it was her unilateral decision to incur that liability for her own expenses, it is fair to both parties that she bears the liability herself. Otherwise, spouses in her position may be able to unilaterally impose liabilities on the other spouse simply by taking out loans rather than applying for interim maintenance orders, which would bypass the safeguard of having judicial oversight of maintenance. In any event, insofar as the loan was used to pay her legal fees for the divorce, recovery of legal fees in this manner is not permissible. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Shares in Company [X]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There are two sets of shares in Company [X] that are the subject of dispute: one set of 2,500 ordinary shares that the Company [X]’s buyer would issue to the Husband if the 2018 KPIs are met (which I refer to as the “2018 KPI Shares”) and one set of 2,974 ordinary shares that are conditional on the 2019 KPIs being met (the “2019 KPI Shares”). The KPIs for both sets of shares were essentially (1) meeting a certain level of consolidated income less expenses, and (2) meeting a certain number of monthly active users for the application developed by Company [X].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Wife argued that the shares in Company [X] which will be issued to the Husband upon the KPIs being met should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. This was so because the SPA under which the 95% of shares in Company [X] was sold was executed during the marriage. The sale was therefore done during the marriage and any consideration from the sale should be considered a matrimonial asset. The Wife cited cl 3.1 of the SPA, which defined the consideration as follows:

</div> I note here that <span class="font-italic">AFS</span> did not deal with the question of whether stock options should be treated as matrimonial assets as such, but was concerned with the identification of direct and indirect contributions towards the acquisition of shares and moneys which had been funded by the exercise of a previously granted stock option: <span class="font-italic">AFS</span> at [52]. Hence, I do not address this case further.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I first consider the Wife’s argument that the shares under cl 5.4.1(ii) and cl 5.4.1(iii) should be treated as consideration for the purchase of the Husband’s 95% share in Company [X]. The Wife’s argument appears to be that since Company [X] was founded during the marriage, the shares held by the Husband were all matrimonial assets, and the consideration for the sale of the shares should be included into the pool as matrimonial assets as well. In my judgment, the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares should not be included as matrimonial assets on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  In the first place, I note that the wording of cl 3.1 of the SPA is ambiguous as it refers to the entirety of cl 5, but only cl 5.3 and cl 5.4.1(i) refer to any adjustment to the consideration. Clause 5.3 refers to this in the heading, while cl 5.4.1(i) includes the sentence: “For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of such US$3,000,000 to the Seller [<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Husband] shall be regarded as an adjustment to the Consideration”. In contrast, there is no such reference in cll 5.4.1(ii) and (iii). In other words, it is not entirely clear from the wording of the contract whether everything in cl 5 is intended to be an adjustment to the consideration, or whether it is only specific clauses within cl 5 that should have that effect. As the buyer of the shares has clarified in a response to a letter from the Husband’s solicitors (requested by the court),

</div>
</div> cll 5.4.1(ii) and 5.4.1(iii) were not intended to be consideration for the purchase of the Husband’s shares, but were intended to be “performance incentives” for the Husband. For the purposes of these proceedings, I prefer the buyer’s interpretation, since the buyer is a third-party at arm’s length and this interpretation accords with the absence of reference to adjustment to consideration in cll 5.4.1(ii) and (iii) (in contrast to cl 5.4.1(i)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any case, in my view, the Wife’s argument is not entirely accurate as it is not the <span class="font-italic">entire consideration</span> that should automatically be treated as matrimonial assets. The concept of consideration is not entirely equivalent to the concept of sale price. In other words, there may be payments that are <span class="font-italic">promised</span> as part of the consideration for the sale of the shares which are not intended to be part of the sale price of the shares -– the payments are “consideration” for the shares in the sense of deriving contractual force from the sale, but are not meant to reflect the value of the shares directly. This is so in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having decided that the entitlement to the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares should not be matrimonial assets simply on the basis of the SPA, I deal next with the Wife’s argument that the Husband’s entitlement to the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares should be treated as stock options and included as matrimonial assets accordingly. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([43] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [28]-[29] held that unvested stock options, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>“a contract to grant an option upon fulfilment of a condition”, were choses in action that could be treated as matrimonial assets under s 112(10) WC. By analogy, I accept that in principle, the contractual entitlement to shares upon fulfilment of certain conditions could be treated as matrimonial assets. However, the question is whether the specific entitlements in question should be considered matrimonial assets. For that question, the Court of Appeal’s further guidance in <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span> at [37] is instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We would hasten to add that even as between the second and third categories of stock options, there is a need to differentiate between them. Whereas, in respect of the second category stock options, they were already vested (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> already earned), the same is not so in respect of the third category stock options. The husband had to continue rendering services to Dell beyond the date of the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> to acquire the options. So in respect of these third category stock options, they were given not just for services rendered prior to the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> but also for services to be rendered post the decree. Otherwise there would have been no necessity to postdate the vesting of options. In this regard, we would adopt the “time rule” advocated in <span class="font-italic">Hug</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) by the Court of Appeal of California. <span class="font-italic">The effect of that rule is to treat only that portion of the stock options as matrimonial assets as is obtained by multiplying the stock options in question by the fraction obtained between the period in months between the commencement of the husband’s employment with Dell and the date of the decree nisi as the numerator and the period in months between his commencement </span><span class="font-italic">of the employment with Dell and the date when the stock option was exercisable by him as the denominator.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Only that portion of the third category stock options as so computed would be reckoned as matrimonial assets</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In other words, after identifying unvested stock options as “assets” that could fall within s 112(10) WC, the Court of Appeal went on to determine to what extent they could be treated as <span class="font-italic">matrimonial</span> assets. Given that the condition for vesting the stock options in that case turned on the length of service, the Court of Appeal determined that only the proportion of the stock options that could be attributed to the period of service performed <span class="font-italic">during</span> the marriage could be treated as matrimonial assets. Hence, <span class="font-italic">Chan Teck Hock</span> does not stand for the broad proposition that all entitlements to shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the contractual right to have shares or a share option in the future) obtained <span class="font-italic">during</span> the marriage would automatically be treated as matrimonial assets. Instead, the court has to consider the nature of the conditions upon which the relevant party would become entitled to the share option or, in this case, the shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, the 2018 and 2019 KPI Shares are conditional on certain conditions being met for Fiscal 2018 (“FY 2018”) and Fiscal 2019 (“FY 2019”) respectively. Clause 1.1 defines FY 2018 as the fiscal year ending 31 December 2018 and FY 2019 as the fiscal year ending 31 December 2019. The IJ date was 26 January 2018. Hence, it is clear that the 2019 KPI Shares were conditional on work done and targets achieved after the marriage had ended. There is no basis for including any of the entitlements to the 2019 KPI Shares as matrimonial assets. The same is not true for the 2018 KPI Shares, since around a month of work, from 1 to 26 January 2018, would have arguably contributed to the achievement of the 2018 KPIs. While it is not certain that there is a linear relationship between the time spent working and the achievement of the KPIs, a proportion based on time is a suitable estimate as a matter of determining the proportion of the entitlement to be treated as matrimonial assets. Taking a broad-brush approach to estimating the portion of the 2018 KPI Shares that should be treated as matrimonial assets, I take the fraction of <img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAAbCAYAAACnZAX6AAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAABSSURBVDhP7ZBbCgAgCAT3/pc2Cg2xtMdHEDiwH7ZMiKALfpMAtERM25SYY6kKEo/4S4c7Sa+zHZaPSIlpkpzSos+s6dNQBLMrWd5ItltK4ztRAZcj/zl7vnepAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"/>, being one month out of 12. Estimating the value of the 2018 KPI Shares according to the value of shares as purchased under the SPA (on the adjusted consideration of US$20,000,000, and taking the proportion of that attributable to work done before the IJ, I arrive at the following calculation:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><img alt="Math Equation" class="img-fluid" src="data:image/Png;base64, 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"/>US$97,465.89</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Converting this based on the agreed currency exchange rate used by both parties, this gives the sum of S$134,021.44. Therefore, the share of the 2018 KPI Shares that are treated as matrimonial assets would be worth S$134,021.44.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) Expenses relating to Company [X]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Husband had incurred expenses for professional fees relating to the sale of Company [X]. In particular, he paid a sum of S$137,492.26 in November 2018 to bankers who assisted with the sale of Company [X]. He argued that these sums should be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets, since the US$3m that was earned (which has been included in the pool) should be netted against these expenses. The Wife argued that they should not be deducted, as the fees were paid after the IJ date. The Husband responded that the quantum of fees payable was based on what the Husband received from the sale. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I agree with the Husband that these sums should be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets as these were expenses related to the US$3m which has been added into the pool of matrimonial assets. While the specific payment in question was paid after the IJ date, the fees were in fact incurred <span class="font-italic">before</span> the IJ date, since the services were obtained for the sale of Company [X] earlier. The later payment was apparently due to the arrangement that the quantum of the fees would be conditional on the amount earned, and so an adjustment was made to account for the additional US$3m paid to the Husband. It would be more appropriate to treat these expenses together with the assets earned under the SPA. I therefore deduct the sum of S$137,943.26 from the pool of matrimonial assets.

He argued that the sums should be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets, while the Wife argued that there was no such need. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Given that the payments were made after the IJ date, and they were gratuitous and not part of any contract, I decide not to deduct these sums from the pool of matrimonial assets. These payments were not mandated and were given out of the Husband’s goodwill. While the efforts of the staff contributed to the US$3m pay-out under cl 5.4.1(i) of the SPA, the bonuses were not required under the SPA or any other contract. As such, these should be treated as gifts made by the Husband after the IJ date out of his funds. Given that I have decided to value the bank accounts at the IJ date, it follows that these payments to the staff are out of the Husband’s “own” assets and it is not necessary to address them further in the division exercise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(7) Loan to Husband’s sister</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Husband had loaned €25,000 (~ S$37,991.95) to his sister on 9 February 2018. As this is after the IJ date, and given that I have chosen to value the bank accounts as of the IJ date, I do not see any reason to add this sum back into the pool of matrimonial assets as this would already be accounted for. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) Gift to Husband’s niece</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 On 26 November 2017, the Husband gave his niece €15,000.00 to assist her in purchasing a property. The Wife argued that this sum should be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. I agree with the Wife. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK </span>[2017] 1 SLR 609 (“<span class="font-italic">TNL</span>”) at [24]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he issue is how the court should deal with substantial sums expended by one spouse during the period: (a) <span class="font-italic">in which divorce proceedings are imminent</span>; or (b) after interim judgment but before the ancillaries are concluded. We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives. The spouse who makes such a payment must be prepared to bear it personally and in full. In the absence of consent, he or she cannot expect the other spouse to share in it. What constitutes a substantial sum is, of course, a question of fact and we do not propose to lay down a hard and fast rule in this regard, except to emphasise that it is not intended to include daily, run-of-the-mill expenses. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In this case, the writ was filed on 9 October 2017.

The Wife had a putative interest in the funds and did not agree to the transfer, and even though the transfer was intended to benefit a relative, that does not prevent the sum from being returned to the pool. The sum of €15,000.00 is a substantial sum and is not a “daily, run-of-the-mill expense[]”: <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> at [24].

This sum was not disputed by the Wife. As I have adopted the IJ date for the valuation of these assets, and the depreciation above was calculated from that date, the figures are logical and consistent with my findings above. Following discussions between the parties, it was agreed that the Wife would bear her share of the COVID-19 Losses. The parties updated the court by way of letter on 26 May 2020 that the parties had agreed to a mechanism by which the COVID-19 could be shared. On 18 September 2020, the parties confirmed that they had agreed to the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Parties agree that the total quantum of the alleged losses suffered by the Plaintiff arising from the COVID-19 situation is taken to be SGD 2,773,920.11 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">COVID-19 Amount</span>"). The Defendant's share of the COVID-19 Amount shall be calculated by applying the percentage figure of the Defendant's share of the matrimonial assets, as determined by the Court during the Ancillary Matters proceedings, to the figure of SGD 2,773,920.11. It is agreed that the two children of the marriage shall be the beneficiaries of the Defendant's share of the COVID-19 Amount.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendant agrees to execute a will in favour of the two children of the marriage within six (6) months of the Plaintiff making full payment of the Defendant's share of the matrimonial assets to her pursuant to the Ancillary Matters Order of Court. For the avoidance of doubt, the Defendant's share of the matrimonial assets encompasses the Defendant's share of the COVID-19 Amount. The will executed by the Defendant shall provide that the Defendant's share of the COVID-19 Amount is distributed to the two children in equal shares upon her demise. The Defendant shall provide the Plaintiff with a redacted copy of her will reflecting such part of the will showing the distribution of the COVID-19 Amount within one (1) week of execution. The Defendant shall not take any steps to revoke or amend this will in relation to the distribution of the COVID-19 Amount thereafter save in accordance with Paragraph (c) below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendant is entitled to subsequently distribute her share of the COVID-19 Amount directly to the two children of the marriage at any time after the Defendant has complied with her obligations at Paragraph (b) above. If the Defendant chooses to do so then she shall provide the Plaintiff with written notice of her proposed alternate mode of distribution. After the two children of the marriage have received their respective entitlements to the value of the COVID-19 Amount pursuant to Paragraph (a), the Defendant may revoke or amend her will as she deems fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 What remains to be dealt with is the apportionment of the COVID-19 Losses, which would be the same as the ratio of division of the matrimonial assets. I now turn to that issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Division of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Having identified and valued the pool of matrimonial assets, the question is how the assets should be divided. The Husband advocated using the structured approach found in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v</span><span class="font-italic"> ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ</span>”) while the Wife argued that the approach in <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>([55] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was more appropriate as the marriage should be characterised as a single-income marriage. This was a marriage of 12 years, in which the Wife had worked for approximately five to six years (around one year in France and between 2009 and 2013 in Singapore). The question is whether the facts of this case suggest that the approach in <span class="font-italic">TNL</span> should apply instead of the structured approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In addressing this issue, I take guidance from the High Court Family Division’s decision in <span class="font-italic">UBM v UBN</span> [2017] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">UBM</span>”) at [48]–[50]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, the Court of Appeal defined “Single-Income Marriages” as marriages where “one spouse is the sole-income earner and the other plays the role of homemaker”; it distinguished this from “Dual-Income Marriages”, which it defined as “marriages where both spouses are working and are therefore able to make both direct and indirect financial contributions to the household” (see [42]–[43]). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 <span class="font-weight-bold">The words “Single-Income Marriage” ought to be interpreted sensibly in the spirit in which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TNL v TNK</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> was decided</span>. I do not think the Court of Appeal intended to draw a thick black line separating cases where the main homemaker worked intermittently for a few years in the course of a long marriage from cases where the homemaker had not worked a single day, applying the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> ([2] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) only in the former situation while excluding it in the latter. To do so may place a full-time homemaker (who has not worked at all during marriage) in a better position than a homemaker who also worked but brought far less income into the marriage than the main breadwinner. This is because the former may obtain near equal division of the assets following <span class="font-italic">TNL v TNK</span>, while the latter may obtain substantially less than that share if <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK </span>is applied to her (or his) case and her direct contributions are very low.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 <span class="font-weight-bold">It appears from the judgment in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TNL v TNK</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> that a “Single-Income Marriage” would include a marriage where one party is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">primarily</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> the breadwinner and the other is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">primarily</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> the homemaker.</span> The Court of Appeal cited, as examples of Single-Income Marriages, two cases where the spouse who took on the role of the main homemaker had also made some financial contributions, for example, through employment or through investments. Thus, it appears that “Single-Income Marriages” are not limited to those where one spouse focuses exclusively on the homemaking role without contributing financially at all, while the other is the sole breadwinner. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Hence, it is not the case that as soon as one spouse works any amount of time that the marriage cannot be treated as a “Single-Income Marriage” and that the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> must apply. In my view, the present case falls within the scope of a “Single-Income Marriage” even though the Wife had worked for slightly under half of the marriage. The most significant factor, in my view, is that the Wife was a homemaker in the period when the Husband was working in Company [X]. This same period saw a massive increase in the wealth of the family arising from that company, which dwarfed any contributions that the Wife had made financially to the marriage. Even though she had worked earlier, it is clear from the calculations put forward by both parties that between 96% and 99% of the direct financial contributions would have been made by the Husband, and the indirect financial contributions would also be tilted significantly in the Husband’s favour. Taking a look at the balance of responsibilities and contributions between the Husband and the Wife in this particular case, it was artificial to treat this as a dual-income marriage, since the income of each was so disparate, the Wife’s income being a small fraction of the Husband’s income, and considering that the Wife had worked for only part of the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I derive further support for this conclusion from the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">reasons</span> for not applying the structured approach in certain cases. In <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [44], the Court of Appeal noted that since the structured approach gave recognition to financial contributions under both direct and indirect contributions, the “non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged”. This would apply to a case where one party has earned <span class="font-italic">significantly</span> more overall in such a way that the financial contribution of the other party becomes almost negligible. At [45], the Court of Appeal recognised that if the structured approach was used and adjustments sought to be made to reflect the “mutual respect … for spousal contributions, whether in the economic or homemaking spheres” (citing <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [18]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[G]iving effect to this principle in the context of a Single-Income Marriage and within the framework of the <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> approach would almost inevitably result in some degree of artificiality: the court would either have to ward the non-working spouse a very high percentage in Step 2 (which may appear to disregard the working spouse’s indirect financial contributions), or accord a very high weightage to Step 2 at Step 3. In some, if not most, cases, the court would have to do both.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In a recent judgment, the Court of Appeal has noted that for short marriages (apparently without distinguishing between single- or dual-income marriages), the structured approach in <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([61] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) should apply: <span class="font-italic">USB v </span><span class="font-italic">USA</span> [2020] SGCA 57 at [37]. That case dealt with a marriage of five years. The present marriage of 12 years was not short, but neither was it long. Rather than to focus simply on the length of the marriage, and in recognition of the factors in the present case identified above, I was of the view that the structured approach was not appropriate in the present case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 However, I recognise that the disagreements over whether <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> or <span class="font-italic">TNL</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([55] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)  should apply are not, in the final analysis, the most important issue, since the aim, regardless of the approach taken, is to arrive at a just and equitable division of assets. Regardless of which approach was used, I would not be surprised if the results were similar. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Direct financial contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The parties are agreed that the Husband had provided the vast majority of direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Husband assessed his contributions at between 96% to 99%, and the Wife adopted the figure of 96% in her submissions. While these numerical values are not required under <span class="font-italic">TNL</span>, and should not take on inordinate weight, I state them here as helpful guides for characterising the overall financial situation in the marriage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Turning to the indirect financial contributions, I note that there is no need to assign a numerical value to the indirect contributions. I make the following observations on the parties’ respective contributions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In terms of the indirect financial contributions, given the Husband’s overall earnings, and the less time that the Wife spent working, the majority of the expenses would have been financed by the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Wife was the primary caregiver for the two Children. She was the one in charge of their daily care, their feeding, cleaning, playing, and education.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Wife had made sacrifices in her career to take care of the Children as she left her job in 2013 to become a full-time homemaker: see <span class="font-italic">ARY</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([11] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) While the parties had hired domestic helpers, I agree with the Wife that this does not <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> reduce the Wife’s contribution to the marriage. At the same time, it is also true that having domestic helpers would tend to relieve the burden of some aspects of the family’s upkeep and maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) I recognise that Company [X] was not a “family business”, and that the Wife never worked for the Company. At the same time, I acknowledge that in a marriage where one spouse is involved in building a business, the other spouse may give indirect support. This is part of the principle that the marriage is a partnership.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adjustments for adverse inferences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Wife further argued that adjustments should be made to the division to account for the loans and gifts to the Husband’s family members, and the bonuses given to the staff of Company [X]. As I have already addressed them at [52]–[56] above, there is no need to account for them again by adjusting the division of the matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Final division ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOR v BOS and another appeal</span> [2018] SGCA 78 at [113] observed that in “moderately lengthy marriages” in the range of 15 to 18 years, the courts have awarded the homemaker about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. The Court of Appeal also noted (at [113]) that “[f]or marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool”, citing <span class="font-italic">UGG v UGH (</span><span class="font-italic">m.w.)</span> [2017] SGHCF 25 and <span class="font-italic">ABX v ABY and others</span> [2014] 2 SLR 969.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The primary factor that I consider important is that the bulk of the matrimonial assets was earned by the Husband’s efforts at building up Company [X]. Even in the structured approach of <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> ([61] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), after accounting for the direct and indirect contributions, the Court of Appeal recognised (at [27(b)]) that “[i]f the pool of assets available for division is extraordinarily large and all of that was accrued by one party’s exceptional efforts, direct contributions are likely to command greater weight as against indirect contributions”. While there is no need to specify the ratios and adjustments when not using the structured approach, I find that the same logic is compelling when addressing an exceptionally large pool of assets which are largely the result of one party’s efforts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Wife argued that a division of 50:50 between the parties would be just and equitable. In my view, this failed to account for the assets that the Husband had earned by his work with Company [X]. She further argued that “it has always been the parties’ understanding” that “the matrimonial assets will be shared in equally”, and that this was the prevailing outcome in French family law.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 While I recognise that the agreement of parties is a factor for the court to consider under s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) WC, the Wife’s argument faced significant difficulties in this case. The evidence concerning the agreement was very weak and consisted purely of her own assertions. There was no document evidencing any such agreement. Even if there were some agreement against the backdrop of French family law, the assertion that equal division was the likely outcome in France was not proved by any expert evidence. When it came to the alleged 2009 agreement in Singapore, there is, once again, no evidence of that agreement. I do not give this weight in my determination of the appropriate ratio. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Husband’s argument that he should be awarded 81.75% of the assets, with the Wife receiving 18.25%, went too far the other way and failed to reflect the Wife’s indirect contributions to the marriage, recognising the principle of the marriage as a partnership: <span class="font-italic">ANJ</span> at [17].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having regard to the assets in this case, and the fact that the Wife was the primary caregiver of the Children, but recognising also that this was a marriage of a short-to-moderate length and the Husband was also involved in the Children’s lives, I decide that an appropriate division is 70:30 in favour of the Husband, on a broad-brush approach. In arriving at this determination, I found the High Court Family Division’s comments in <span class="font-italic">UBM</span> ([62] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [60] particularly helpful:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Divorcing couples were once in an intact, functioning relationship; they chose to marry each other, for better or for worse. The mutual emotional support each gave the other in the marriage cannot be measured in monetary terms. Who is to say that had one spouse not been present in the life of the other, the latter would have been as financially successful and thus able to contribute a greater share to the pool of matrimonial assets? Conversely, one cannot, on hindsight, tell with certainty whether the presence of the other spouse in one’s life had any negative effect on one’s career. Countless decisions, small and large, are made in the course of a marriage. Many significant forks in life’s road occur during the course of a marriage. The broad brush approach is thus a key feature in the resolution of disputes over the division of matrimonial assets. The final ratio also ought to reflect the philosophy of marriage as an equal partnership of different efforts. Matrimonial disputes are best managed, and families better supported, by a sensible, broad-brush process which does not incentivise calculative behaviour. Parties need to be bigger, kinder and wiser after a divorce; they need to look ahead and recast their future to focus on healing themselves and parenting their children. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apportionment of the pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is S$36,830,541.81.

In the following, I proceed on the basis that the two Children should be kept together, which is, in my view, consistent with their welfare. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Should shared care and control be granted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In my judgment, shared care and control is not suitable. As the High Court Family Division recognised in <span class="font-italic">TAU v TAT</span> [2018] 5 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">TAU v TAT</span>”) at [12], the court has to consider “factors such as that particular child’s needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement, and whether it is easy for that child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week.” The following factors weighed on my mind in the present case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Both children were either of schooling or near schooling age. Given this, it seemed to me that greater stability in their home lives would be in their interest, to enable them to settle down well after school and be prepared for the next day’s activities. Having them shuttle between different living situations after school does not appear to be conducive to their welfare.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The parties have shown themselves to have a fraught relationship and there is a real risk that a shared care and control arrangement would be unworkable. This is especially so given the multiple allegations and complaints made by each party about the other.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I do not consider that the Husband’s concern over the Wife’s Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (“OCD”) was entirely justified and reject his argument that a shared care and control order was needed to account for her OCD. I will elaborate on this below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The mere fact that it is in the Children’s interest for both parents to be continually involved in their upbringing, which the Husband emphasises and which is not disputed, does <span class="font-italic">not</span> require a shared care and control order to be granted: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">TAU v TAT</span> at [25]–[26].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Who should be granted care and control?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89   In my judgment, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I am of the view that the Wife should be granted care and control of the Children, with access given to the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I do not find that the Wife’s OCD is such as to prevent her from being the primary caretaker for the Children. I take guidance from the evidence tendered on behalf of the Wife, which show that having OCD does not, in and of itself, impair the Wife’s capacity to be a parent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The psychologist who had been treating the Wife since August 2016 tendered an affidavit and report dated 21 November 2017 stating that the Wife’s condition was “Moderate”, and that individuals with OCD “do not pose a danger to others, including children, just because of their condition.” Specifically, the psychologist observed that the Wife had a “caring and loving relationship” with Child [B] (based on primary observation), and that the Wife actively sought advice on how to ensure that her condition did not negatively impact Child [A].

The Wife has always been the primary caretaker for both Children since their birth. She would be most prepared to take on the responsibility of caring for the Children after the divorce.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, weekend access was to be varied such that the Husband would have access every other week, from Friday after Child [A]’s school day ends to Sunday 8.30pm. During the weeks that the Husband does not have weekend access, he is to have access on an additional weekday evening from 5pm to 9pm before that weekend.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, although the Wife was amenable to the Husband having half the school holidays, she sought an order that would ensure that the Husband would not have access for a continuous period of more than seven days at a time.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the Wife was agreeable to have the Children spend any religious holidays with the parent of that religion, and that the Children will spend Mother’s Day and the Wife’s birthday with the Wife, and Father’s Day and the Husband’s birthday with the Husband. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, in the event of any overseas travel, the Husband shall bring both Children on the trip.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I deal first with weekend access. In RAS 22/2018, I had considered that an alternate weekend access would not be in the Children’s interest, given that they had been spending every weekend with the Husband. However, I recognise that as both Children grow up and attend school, the weekends become ever more precious to the parents. The interim order at present provides that the Husband has access on Friday morning to Saturday night, while the Wife will spend Sunday morning onwards with the Children. Now that both Children attend school, the Husband sought access to commence on Thursday morning. I do not think that this is appropriate, since that would result in instability when two full days of the week are part of the Husband’s access. Further, I consider that the Wife’s concerns are valid. Under the interim order, the Husband is given access to the Children on the only two nights which are not “school nights” in the week. I accept that this gave the Husband much more time with the Children for leisure and recreational activities, like birthday parties and sleepovers. The downside to the Wife’s proposal was that the Husband’s contact with the Children would be less regular, but I am satisfied that the Wife’s proposal that the Husband be given a weekday evening access during the weeks he does not have weekend access to be sufficient. Rather than limit this to the week prior to the weekend where he does not have access, I think that this weekday access can be granted any day in the five days before or after the weekend in question. Moreover, in this scenario, the Husband is given a full Sunday with the Children as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As for the holidays, I recognise the Wife’s concern with the Husband being granted continuous access for more than seven days. In my view, such a limitation to seven days was not entirely justified. While the Wife has provided evidence that the Children were not used to extended access with the Husband,

</div> I am of the view that there were no serious problems. I acknowledged that some limitation was justified by the evidence, but given the prior two-week trip as well as the fact that the Wife’s primary concern was with very lengthy periods up to a month, I conclude that the limit should be placed at <span class="font-italic">14</span> days (not seven) until the Children grow more accustomed to spending extended periods of time away from the Wife and with the Husband. As for how the religious holidays were to be spent, the parties were in agreement and I see no reason to order otherwise. Similarly, I accept that the Children are to spend Mother’s and Father’s Days, and the Wife’s and Husband’s birthdays with the respective parent. The Wife further asked for an order that if the Husband wishes to bring Child [A] or Child [B] overseas for travel, he would have to bring <span class="font-italic">both</span> Children. I do not see a reason for imposing this restriction, as it appears to be overly restrictive and there is no pressing need for it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 At the hearing on 18 September 2020, the parties also agreed that the interim orders made concerning electronic access and handover arrangements to continue, and for the parties to keep each other informed of what the school communicates to each party about the children.

In my judgment, the sum that the Wife will receive, if invested properly, and even if the Wife chooses not to seek employment, would be more than sufficient to maintain the Wife. Therefore, I do not make a maintenance order in favour of the Wife in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Children</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The Wife sought maintenance for the Children as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I first consider the claimed monthly expenses of each child.

In that regard, the High Court has also observed that “maintenance is ordered in order to meet the reasonable needs of the child and if the child’s lifestyle is overly extravagant, the husband should not be made to bear the costs of it”: <span class="font-italic">APE v APF</span> [2015] SGHC 17 at [43]. I agree with the Husband that these expenses are excessive. In respect of Child [A], I do not see why S$1,500.00 is needed every month for shopping. For both Children, I find that the expenses for food delivery and restaurant dining are excessive given their age. I note also that the Children appear to have meals at school. Entertainment, similarly, for such children ought not to reach S$450.00 per month. The annual birthday expenses, based on the Wife’s accounting, would amount to around S$6,579.96 per child. In my view, that is excessive as well. In his submissions, the Husband proposed instead that Child [A] has reasonable expenses of S$4,688.89

</div> In the round, I am satisfied that Child [A] can be allowed S$5,000.00 per month and Child [B] S$4,000.00 per month as reasonable expenses. These are relatively high simply because of the parents’ “means and station in life” (see s 68 WC, which applies by virtue of s 127(2) WC). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I note that the Wife has also tabulated the household expenses. I do not intend to go through each of these items. I am only concerned with the expenses that can be attributed to the Children and which they have a share in enjoying. First, the rental cost of their current unit is S$11,800.00 per month. In my judgment, the Wife cannot claim for the whole of this rent. While account must be given to the standard of living to which the Wife and family are used to, the court must also consider that the situation after the breakdown of marriage has changed. If the Wife claims that she is not able to earn an income, there is no reason why she is not able to move to a residence with lower monthly rent. The Wife is not entitled simply to throw this cost on the Husband. Having regard to the parties’ lifestyle, I am of the view that a reasonable expense for monthly rental would be around S$9,000.00 per month. I note that the Husband is also renting a unit for around S$8,300 per month.

</div> Second, food delivery and eating out have already been accounted for in the tabulation of the Children’s expenses. There is no reason to account for that again. Further, given that “entertainment” is an expense accounted for in the Children’s expenses, I do not see the need to account for them in terms of the various subscriptions in the household expenses. Third, I accept the expenses of a domestic helper or cleaner, as well as utilities and transport, but make adjustments for what can be considered reasonable. Having regard to all of the numbers, I consider that a monthly household expense of approximately S$11,000.00 to be reasonable. The Children’s share of the expenses would be approximately S$7,300 per month (being approximately two-thirds of the household expenses).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105  I do not consider the various overseas travel and holiday expenses in my determination. These can be funded by either party individually when they choose to bring the Children on holidays. Similarly, presents for the Children are within each parties’ individual expenditures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Taking each child’s reasonable expenses and their share of the household expenses together, I find that the Children have a total of S$16,300.00 per month in expenses (being S$5,000.00 + S$4,000.00 + S$7,300.00). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I turn now to consider how this should be borne between the two parties. The Wife argued that the Husband should pay for all of the Children’s expenses. I could not agree. There was no basis for saddling the Husband with such payments entirely given that the Wife would be receiving a significant share of the matrimonial assets (which could be used to generate an income) and given that she could find employment. Given the large pool of matrimonial assets, I do not consider it appropriate to rely on income entirely in this case.
