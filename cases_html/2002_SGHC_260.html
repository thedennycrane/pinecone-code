<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1.

        This Originating Motion sought an order to

admit Gerald Godfrey, Queen’s Counsel to practise as an Advocate and Solicitor of the

Supreme Court for the purpose of appearing on behalf of Anthony Wee Soon Kim, the

Plaintiff in High Court Suit No. 834 of 2001, against the Defendant, UBS AG. It was filed

by Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners and supported by an affidavit by Mark Goh Aik Leng. </font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SUMMARY OF FACTS IN SUIT NO. 834

OF 2001</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.

        The following facts appear in the aforesaid

affidavit as well as in the affidavit of Philippa Kilburn-Toppin, Executive Director of

the Defendant, filed on 14 October 2002 to oppose the Originating Motion.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        Anthony Wee Soon Kim is a 72 year old retired

lawyer suffering a serious heart ailment complicated by diabetes and renal failure. UBS AG

is an international private bank carrying on business in Singapore in accordance with the

Association of Banks in Singapore’s Code of Conduct. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        In August 1997, Anthony Wee’s son,

Richard, received a tip that the Malaysian Ringgit (‘RM’) was likely to

strengthen and decided, with his father’s consent, to use his father’s account

with the bank to purchase RM35 million against a US$ loan. However, the RM weakened

against the US$. By December 1997, Anthony Wee was deeply concerned about the mounting

losses he was suffering as a result of that transaction. He therefore asked the bank for

suggestions on how he could effectively manage his losses.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        The bank offered him the following 3

alternative strategies :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(1)    keep his

    existing RM position and do nothing;</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(2)    cut his RM

    position immediately and convert it into US$, realizing his losses;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3)    adopt the

    ‘DFF Strategy’ which consisted of an investment in the bank’s US$

    denominated Dynamic Floor Fund (‘DFF’) and a 12-month Forward Foreign Exchange

    trade buying RM against the US$.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After several meetings, Anthony

Wee decided to adopt the DFF Strategy.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        Around the middle of 1998, interest rates for

the RM shot up to almost 30% per annum as the Malaysian government aggressively raised

interest rates in order to fend off speculative attacks on the RM. When Anthony Wee

eventually unwound the DFF Strategy on 28 July 1998, it had yielded him a positive return

of about RM915,000. He would have been much better off financially had he kept his RM

position intact in December 1997. In September 1998, as a result of the capital measures

imposed by Bank Negara, the bank converted Anthony Wee’s RM deposits at US$1 to RM4,

the rate adopted by the Association of Banks in Singapore</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        On 4 July 2001, Anthony Wee commenced this

action against the bank, alleging that the bank’s representatives misrepresented the

DFF Strategy to him. He also claimed that the conversion of his RM deposits was wrongful

and took issue with various charges and fees debited against his account. Engelin Teh, SC

and Thomas Sim represented Anthony Wee while the bank was defended by Davinder Singh, SC

and his assistants.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        The trial began on 26 February 2002. At the

commencement of Anthony Wee’s cross-examination, his then counsel requested that he

be cross-examined in the morning sessions only as he was not fit enough to continue the

full day. That was granted by the trial judge. During the course of the cross-examination,

Anthony Wee also asked for breaks on account of his medical condition. The

cross-examination thus took up the three weeks fixed for the trial. The trial was then

scheduled to continue for a further six weeks from 22 July to 30 August 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        In the meantime, Anthony Wee discharged his

lawyers ‘because of differences with Mr Thomas Sim as to the conduct of the

case.’ He then engaged the services of Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners who, on 9 July

2002, filed and served the Notice of Appointment of Solicitors to act for Anthony Wee.

However, in their letter to the bank’s solicitors, the new solicitors stated that

they were the solicitors on record and that Anthony Wee ‘will still be conducting his

own case as counsel’ and ‘will be assisted by his co-counsel Mr Mohan

Singh’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        On 15 July 2002, the parties appeared before

the trial judge for the hearing of an interlocutory application. Anthony Wee turned up

accompanied by Mark Goh and Mohan Singh. Mohan Singh informed the judge that he had been

instructed to have conduct of the application in the event Anthony Wee was not medically

fit to continue. Mark Goh told the judge that Anthony Wee would be arguing the application

himself. The judge ruled that Anthony Wee could not do so as he had solicitors acting for

him. He then stood the matter down for Anthony Wee and his solicitors to discuss the

matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        When the parties returned to the judge’s

chambers, Mark Goh applied to discharge himself on the basis that Anthony Wee insisted on

arguing the application himself. He was discharged accordingly but was permitted to remain

to assist Anthony Wee as a ‘McKenzie friend’. The interlocutory application was

subsequently dealt with.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        On 19 July 2002, Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners

filed a second Notice of Appointment of Solicitors but did not serve it on the bank’s

solicitors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        The trial resumed on 22 July 2002. Anthony Wee

was absent as he was unwell. Mark Goh and Mohan Singh attended the proceedings introducing

themselves as the ‘friend’ and the ‘co-counsel’ respectively. Mohan

Singh told the trial judge he had been instructed, in view of Anthony Wee’s age and

condition, to assist him in the event he was unable to carry on and to cross-examine and

re-examine such witnesses as directed by Anthony Wee, who would remain a litigant in

person. The judge took issue with this. The hearing was then adjourned to 24 July 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        On 24 July 2002, only Mark Goh attended on

behalf of Anthony Wee. He informed the judge that Anthony Wee had instructed Mohan Singh

to withdraw from the action. The judge permitted Mark Goh to act as the ‘friend’

but refused his application for leave to address the court on Anthony Wee’s behalf.

An appeal against this ruling is pending before the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 81

of 2002, due to be heard in November 2002. The judge also directed that a medical

certificate in respect of Anthony Wee be produced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        On 26 July 2002, Mark Goh produced a medical

certificate stating that Anthony Wee was unfit to attend court for 60 days from 24 July

2002 to 21 September 2002. The trial dates were thus vacated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.

        Later that day, Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners

faxed the second Notice of Appointment of Solicitors to the bank’s solicitors. At

around the same time, the parties were informed to attend before the trial judge again at

4 pm that day to clarify the position on the second Notice. When they attended before the

judge, Mark Goh explained that the said second Notice was filed in error and that Anthony

Wee remained a litigant in person.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        Four days later, on 30 July 2002, the same firm

of solicitors wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court on behalf of Anthony Wee to

request further arguments on the interlocutory application. On 1 August 2002, the

Registrar replied stating that the judge had instructed that such a request should come

from Anthony Wee as he was a litigant acting in person.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        Anthony Wee sent a response to the Registrar on

2 August 2002, arguing that his duly appointed lawyer had ‘the lawful right to act on

my behalf, and on that footing to request for further argument regardless of my status as

a litigant in person’. An exchange of correspondence between the Registry and Anthony

Wee followed. On 12 August 2002, Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners wrote to the Registrar with

the concluding paragraphs of that letter stating : </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"In view of the

    uncompromising directions and our client’s life threatening heart disease aggravated

    by the difficulties thrown his way as regards the filing of the various Court documents,

    he has, with great reluctance, instructed us to advise you to treat his Notice of

    Intention to Act in Person as withdrawn so that the perceived legal impediments may cease

    to exist.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the premises, we trust that we

    will now be able to represent Mr Wee to the fullest extent the Legal Profession Act (Cap

    161) would allow."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        On 2 October 2002, the present Originating

Motion was filed by Goh Aik Leng &amp; Partners. </font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The law on admission of Queen’s Counsel

under section 21 of the Legal Profession Act is clear. As set out in <i>Re Caplan Jonathan

Michael Q</i>C <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=44205&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 1 SLR 432</a> at 435 and applied in many subsequent cases, an

application for admission under that section has to satisfy a three-stage test. At the

first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in which he seeks to appear

contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require

elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s Counsel. Such difficulty or complexity is

not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to admit is still a matter for

the court’s discretion. At the second stage, therefore, the applicant must persuade

the court that the circumstances of the particular case warrant the court exercising its

discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, the applicant has to satisfy the court of

his suitability for admission. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        According to Mark Goh Aik Leng, the factual

matrix of the action was complex and difficult. The difficulty was compounded by the

presence of allegedly altered documents and the bank’s campaign of selective and

misleading disclosure. Accordingly, the facts would ‘require considerable acumen on

the part of any counsel for (Anthony Wee)’. It was also submitted that there were

many legal issues involving negligence, fraud, fiduciary and equitable duties and breach

of contract. It was pointed out that the law in respect of fiduciary duties owed by a

private banker to a client had undergone significant evolution in recent years to keep

pace with the changes in the banking industry and that there was no local authority that

definitively addressed the issues relating to private banking. The applicant’s

written submissions (at paragraph 56) state:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"In essence, the issues in

    Suit 834 of 2001 relate to the basic principles stemming from contract, tort and equity,

    albeit in a novel and undeveloped area of the law from the perspective of a special

    relationship of a private investment banker versus a high net worth customer."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        The above view as to the complexity and

difficulty of the case in fact and in law was not shared by all the other parties to this

application. The bank’s view was that the issues concerned essentially the

relationship between a bank and its customer and allegations of misrepresentation and/or

fraud. It was argued that the issues were largely factual and were not unique or complex

and that such issues have been considered in many local decisions argued by local counsel.

The law in respect of banker-customer relationship, it was submitted, was no different for

private bankers. The Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Law Society of Singapore

were also of the same view.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.

        I agree that the facts and the legal issues in

the proceedings between Anthony Wee and the bank are not of sufficient difficulty and

complexity to warrant the admission of Queen’s Counsel. A long story is not always a

complicated one. New factual situations, like new business practices, will always arise.

With each new permutation of facts, the law is applied, sometimes by way of extension, at

other times by refinement, of the principles involved. The existing local case law and

legal treatises would probably be more than adequate to dispose of the legal issues that

arise. Even if reference has to be made to decisions elsewhere, and that is hardly unique

to this case, I do not see why that should necessarily elevate the case to such level of

difficulty or complexity that it would require elucidation or argument by Queen’s

Counsel. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        I now consider the other circumstances in this

case. The applicant submitted that the ability and the availability of local counsel to

handle this case was not by itself an absolute bar to the admission of a Queen’s

Counsel. In <i>Re Beloff Michael Jacob</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=56784&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 2 SLR 782</a>, the defendants (Singtel)

appointed local Senior Counsel to argue their case. The plaintiffs (Japura) did not

attempt to engage local counsel but successfully sought the admission of Stuart Lindsay

Isaacs QC to argue their case. Following that, the defendants decided that they also

wanted a Queen’s Counsel to argue their case. In allowing the defendants’

application to admit their Queen’s Counsel, Yong Pung How CJ said :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"13.    

    Japura’s first objection was that Singtel was already ably represented by Senior

    Counsel Mr Michael Hwang SC and junior counsel, and therefore did not require the services

    of Mr Beloff. The first point to note is that the availability and ability of local

    counsel is not <i>per se</i> an absolute bar to admission of a Queen’s Counsel –

    at the second stage of the test for admission, the court is required to engage in a

    balancing exercise, and the ability and availability of local counsel is only one of the

    factors to be placed on the scales: see <i>Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC (No 2)</i>[1998]     1 SLR 440. The second point to note is that there is no general rule that prohibits a

    litigant from engaging both a Queen’s Counsel and a local Senior Counsel to argue his

    case. What the court is concerned with in each case is whether, having found that the

    issues of fact and law are of sufficient difficulty or complexity to justify the admission

    of a Queen’s Counsel, there are circumstances in that particular case which point the

    court towards either exercising or not exercising its discretion in favour of the

    applicant. Each case must be decided on its own facts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14. … In my judgment, having

    held that the factual and legal matrix of the case were sufficiently complex and difficult

    to warrant the admission of Mr Isaacs on Japura’s behalf, it was important to ensure

    a level playing field by also allowing Singtel to engage a Queen’s Counsel, if it so

    wished. I found no reason to penalise Singtel simply because it had already retained local

    Senior Counsel. After all, the fact that Japura had not made any attempt at all to engage

    local Senior Counsel was not held against it when it sought to admit Mr Isaacs."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        In the present case, let us examine how Anthony

Wee came to be in the predicament he found himself in where the issue of legal

representation is concerned. Mark Goh Aik Leng’s affidavit makes the following

statements (with Anthony Wee referred to as ‘the Plaintiff’) :</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"53.    The

    Plaintiff has previously appointed a leading local Senior Counsel to act for him. However,

    much to his dismay, he found that her strongly recommended assistant also refused to take

    the Plaintiff’s instructions and on that basis she offered to withdraw. The Plaintiff

    was thus compelled to act in person. However, the Plaintiff’s health and age

    precludes him from continuing to act as a litigant in person.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54.    Senior

    Counsel Davinder Singh of Drew &amp; Napier acts as lead counsel for the Defence. In the

    course of his illustrious career, her has acquired a daunting, if not absolutely fearsome

    reputation as Singapore’s foremost litigator.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55.    Mr Davinder

    Singh acted for UBS AG Singapore and commenced an Originating Summons No. 546 of 1999

    against the Plaintiff, his wife Betty Wee and his son Richard Wee as the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>

    &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> Defendants respectively for an order that the Plaintiff’s

    personal assets held under his personal account with UBS AG Hong Kong Branch be delivered

    to the Plaintiff’s and/or his wife’s and/or son in Singapore on the false

    premise that said personal assets were previously held in their joint account No. 110628

    in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56.    On the

    recommendation of a fellow lawyer, the Plaintiff then instructed Senior Counsel Harry

    Elias and his partner one Lawrence Quahe to resist the aforesaid OS 546/99 as well as to

    commence an action against UBS AG in Singapore. Regrettably, at the hearing before a

    Judicial Commissioner, Mr Elias SC did a <i>volte face </i>and strongly advised the

    Plaintiff to accept the delivery of the assets in question. As an inducement, Mr Elias SC

    even offered to waive his costs without a fight. The other inducement was that the

    Plaintiff would be free to commence the intended action without delay. His partner Mr

    Lawrence Quahe opposed the taxation of the bill of costs submitted by Drew &amp; Napier

    which was claimed at $56,563.07 in an uncontested application.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57.    In the

    result, the Plaintiff was not able to find a local Senior Counsel that he could be

    comfortable with. This is particularly so, in view of his experience with his Senior

    Counsel Engelin Teh of Engelin Teh Practice LLC and Senior Counsel Harry Elias."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        It was said in court that Anthony Wee did not

wish to go into the reasons why he was not comfortable with the two Senior Counsel who had

acted for him previously. Mohan Singh was only willing to play a supporting role and the

case was said to be too complex for Mark Goh Aik Leng’s one-man firm. Due to his age

and the poor state of his health, Anthony Wee was unable to handle the case himself and

‘was compelled to seek assistance of a Queen’s Counsel whose ability and more

importantly whose integrity (he) is comfortable with.’ </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        The crux of all that is set out above appears

to be that there is no dearth of local lawyers able and willing to handle the case and to

act for Anthony Wee but he is not willing to have them for his lawyers. It would seem

that, of the two lawyers in Singapore he is comfortable with, one is willing to assist

only but not to conduct the case while the other feels totally inadequate for the task.

Even assuming his feelings about the two Senior Counsel are justified, is it reasonable of

him to assume that the twenty or so other Senior Counsel would disappoint him in like

fashion ? Surely not. What about the 3,000 other practising members of the local Bar? His

unjustifiable stance in this case does not warrant the court exercising its discretion in

his favour.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.

        I was also urged to take into consideration the

large amount of money involved in the case and the fact that Singapore aims to be the

regional hub for financial and banking services. I do not see how disallowing the

application to admit Queen’s Counsel in the circumstances here would detract from

this objective. It is patently clear that there is no shortage of local lawyers who are

more than capable of handling the factual and legal issues for Anthony Wee in his dispute

with the bank.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.

        I now consider the qualifications of Gerald

Godfrey QC. He practised at the Chancery/Commercial Bar in England for 30 years, 15 of

which were as a Queen’s Counsel. He appeared frequently in the High Court and the

Court of Appeal in England and in Hong Kong as well as in the House of Lords and the Privy

Council. He has also appeared in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Bahamas and Kenya. He is

an experienced arbitrator and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. He is

also a member of the International Academy of Estate and Trust Law and of the Insolvency

Practitioners Association. He has addressed many international law conferences in his

various fields of expertise and has given lectures by invitation at Harvard and Tufts

Universities in the USA.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        In 1981, he was appointed Chairman of the team

investigating the affairs of St Piran Ltd ordered by the United Kingdom’s Director of

Trade. The matter involved allegations that a financier who had acquired a public listed

company was stripping its assets to the detriment of the minority shareholders. It was

submitted that this illustrated the Queen’s Counsel’s ‘expertise and skill

went beyond his extensive Chancery/Commercial practice into the field of fraud by crooked

financiers’ and that he is therefore eminently qualified to assist the court in

determining whether Anthony Wee had been defrauded by the bank.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        In 1986, Gerald Godfrey QC was appointed a High

Court Judge in Hong Kong. In that capacity, he delivered many landmark judgments in

conveyancing, trust, arbitration, revenue and company law. In 1993, he was appointed to

the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong and in 2000 he became the Vice-President of that Court.

He retired on 29 July 2001 and was honoured with a CBE on 31 December 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        The bank submitted that the Queen’s

Counsel did not meet the criterion of ‘special qualifications or experience for the

purpose of the case’ [section 21(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act]. It argued that

there was no evidence he had conducted or had been involved in cases involving

banker-customer issues, fraud or breach of fiduciary duties. The landmark decisions

delivered by him as a Judge also did not concern these issues. This view was shared by the

Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Law Society of Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        With the greatest of respect to Gerald Godfrey

QC, despite his very impressive achievements and ability, his qualifications and

experience do not quite meet the requirements of the case before the court. It is not

immediately obvious from all that has been stated in the documents before me that he has

special qualifications or experience in the area of banking law, private or otherwise. The

criterion set out in the said section 21(1)(c) has therefore not been satisfied.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        For the above reasons, I dismissed the

Originating Motion with costs fixed at $5,000 to be paid by Anthony Wee to the bank.</font></p>
