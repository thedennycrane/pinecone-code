Rather, the question is whether they intended the same institution, whether they had in mind different ones or whether it is impossible to tell either way. Only in the latter two cases does the misnomer affect the validity of the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The applicant, Shanghai Xinan Screenwall Building &amp; Decoration Co., Ltd.

</div> Great Wall took the position that the Order was the first document to be properly served, because it was served at its new registered address. Strikingly, even at the time of the hearing before me on 31 January 2022, almost six months after the Order was served, Great Wall had not apparently filed any challenge to the Award in China nor sought an extension of time to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Xinan objected to leave being granted for the filing of Mr Liu’s affidavit.

</div> Having missed two filing deadlines which resulted in the vacation of the original hearing date, Great Wall only filed the Opinion almost three months’ later on 25 November 2021. There was no explanation of when they had first sought the Opinion from Mr Liu. They did not explain whether they were delayed in seeking the Opinion or he was delayed in giving it.

There are three distinct legal bases for this finding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, Great Wall is a Singapore company, and is thus subject to the provisions of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”). Section 387 of the CA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A document may be served on a company by leaving it at or sending it by registered post to the registered office of the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Delivery of a document to a company’s registered office is sufficient service of a notice of arbitration, as it is for any other document. This provision of the CA rests on the simple principle that a company must have a registered office and must organise itself to be able to receive documents at that address. It is irrelevant that the company does not do business at those premises or even leaves them vacant. In any case, the notice of arbitration was delivered before 15 July 2020, the date that Great Wall claimed it physically shifted its offices from its registered address to its new address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Secondly, the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the “Model Law”) (with the exception of Chapter VIII) has the force of law by virtue of s 3(1) of the IAA.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Zhou’s 1st Affidavit at p 81 and p 125.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Where an address is given in a contract, it is a simple inference that the address has been included to facilitate communication between the parties. Thus, in the absence of any manifestation of a contrary intention, service of a notice of arbitration in respect of that contract at that address will usually amount to proper notice of the arbitration unless prior to the date of service the respondent has notified the claimant of a change of address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Great Wall has contended that reliance on deeming provisions may be displaced by evidence that the intended recipient did not in fact receive the document, citing the Hong Kong decision of <span class="font-italic">Sun Tian Gang v Hong Kong &amp; China Gas (Jilin) Ltd</span> [2016] HKCFI 1611. In that case, when the arbitration claimant’s solicitors were informed that the respondent no longer worked at the address on which they had served the notice, it was held that they were not entitled to proceed with the arbitration relying on service effected in accordance with Article 3(1) of the Model Law as deemed service. While I agree that deemed service may be rebutted by appropriate evidence of non-receipt, that is not the case here. Great Wall is a company and the address where the notice of arbitration was served was both its registered office and its place of business at that time. Great Wall provided no explanation of the system it put in place for the receipt of documents or how that system might have failed in this case. I find on a balance of probabilities that Great Wall’s officers saw the notice of arbitration but chose to ignore it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I reject this ground of challenge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Award has become binding</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  There was one document that was delivered after the change of Great Wall’s registered office, namely, the Award. Accordingly, Xinan cannot rely on s 387 of the CA for the service of the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36  However, Great Wall did not notify Xinan of its change of address. Xinan sent the Award to the address provided by Great Wall in the Contracts to which the Award related. On the second and third bases discussed in the preceding section, there was good service of the Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 More fundamentally, Great Wall is wrong in law to suggest that an arbitration award only becomes binding upon service. Section 19B of the IAA makes clear that an award is binding once made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 At the same time, it is true that the time limit for applying to set aside an award runs from the date of receipt of that award, which in this case was 3 December 2020. Thus, accepting that in China the time limit is six months rather than three months as it is in Singapore, Great Wall could have filed an application in China to set aside the Award any time prior to 3 May 2021. As noted at [19] above, Great Wall has made no such application to set aside the Award in China to date, nor sought any extension of time to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I reject this ground of challenge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the arbitration agreement was valid </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40  Great Wall contended that under Articles 16 and 18 of the Arbitration Law of the People’s Republic of China, parties must select an arbitral institution. Where one is not selected in the original arbitration agreement, there must be a supplementary agreement between parties choosing an arbitral institution. Otherwise, the arbitration agreement is void. If the arbitration agreement is void, then parties would have to seek recourse in a national court that has jurisdiction over the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  I accept that this is indeed the position under Chinese law. The relevant articles were included as part of Great Wall’s bundle of authorities, rather than by way of affidavit.

</div> This position under Chinese law is common knowledge in the international arbitration community. It remains the case, however, that because neither party properly adduced expert evidence on Chinese law, the evidence of Chinese law before the court is limited. Consequently, I have assumed that Chinese law is the same as Singapore law where the evidence before the court is insufficient to prove otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Great Wall argued that because the arbitration agreements in the Contracts named an arbitral institution that technically did not exist, they were void by virtue of Article 18.

Thus, my task is to construe the arbitration agreements in the Contracts to determine whether CIETAC was right to conclude that it was indeed the selected arbitral institution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I have set out the English text of the arbitration agreements at [4] above and noted at [5] that the English text takes priority. The question is then whether “China International Arbitration Center” as stated in the Contracts meant CIETAC in the context of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As has been explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Insigma Technology Co Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 936 (“<span class="font-italic">Insigma</span>”) at [30], an arbitration agreement is to be construed like any other commercial agreement, with a view to giving effect to the intention of the parties as objectively expressed in it. The Court of Appeal also referred to the principle of effective interpretation in the law of arbitration, the aim of which is to facilitate and protect party autonomy by striving to make an arbitration clause effective and workable: <span class="font-italic">Insigma </span>at [31]. Similarly, Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“Born”) states at pp 775<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">–</span>776: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the parties have evinced an intention to resolve their disputes by arbitration, as opposed to by other means, then that intention should be given effect; it constitutes an agreement to arbitrate and defects or uncertainties in the implementation of this agreement should not preclude its enforcement. Consistent with this analysis, courts from virtually all jurisdictions have displayed a pronounced willingness to disregard or minimize imperfections in the parties’ arbitration agreement, to imply missing terms and/or to adopt liberal interpretations in order to supply omitted terms or to reconcile apparently inconsistent terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The starting point is that parties in this case intended to resolve their disputes by arbitration, that this take place in China and that it be administered by the institution that they called “China International Arbitration Center”. It is not that they chose a non-existent institution to administer their arbitration. Rational commercial parties would not deliberately choose a non-existent institution any more than they might invent a fictitious country as the seat. The objective intention of the parties must be that an existing arbitral institution administer the potential arbitration. The question is thus whether the arbitration agreements evince a common intention that CIETAC would be that arbitral institution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Parties did not adopt the official name or designation of CIETAC in the arbitration agreements. However, this does not mean that they did not express the common intention to choose CIETAC as the arbitral institution. Keeping in mind that the primary text is the English text, parties used the first two words in CIETAC’s name, namely “China” and “International”. They also used another word contained in CIETAC’s name, namely “Arbitration”. They omitted two other words which are present in CIETAC’s name, namely “Economic” and “Trade”. Finally, they used the word “Center” instead of “Commission”, which is used in CIETAC’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the Opinion, Mr Liu helpfully listed five of the major arbitral institutions in China.

</div>
</div> The first is CIETAC. The others are Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration, Beijing International Arbitration Center, Shanghai International Arbitration Center and China Maritime Arbitration Commission. Thus, three of the others do not even contain the critical national name of “China” and instead adopt the names of cities. I have no hesitation in concluding that none of these three was intended by either party. The fourth does use the word China but immediately qualifies it with the word “Maritime”. Objectively, commercial men would not think of a maritime arbitral institution for resolution of non-maritime disputes such as those which could arise from the Contracts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I conclude that when parties agreed on “China International Arbitration Center”, they in fact agreed on CIETAC. Inaccuracy in the name used in the arbitration agreements does not nullify the parties’ consent to arbitration or their choice of CIETAC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Courts in other jurisdictions have taken similar approaches to arbitration agreements which name so-called “non-existent” institutions, striving to give effect to parties’ choice of arbitration by identifying the intended but misnamed institution. Born at p 780 notes that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…Other courts and tribunals have construed references to nonexistent entities generously, finding ways to equate them to institutions which do exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 To be clear, I would not put the point in the way that Born does, as I consider it unlikely that parties (whether subjectively or objectively) intended to choose a non-existent institution. Ordinarily, it is more accurate to say that they chose an arbitral institution to which they gave an imprecise or incorrect name. The real question is whether parties agreed on the subject matter in their contract, by whatever name called. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Thus, the reference to “China International Arbitration Center” is properly to be construed as a reference to CIETAC. Accordingly, an arbitral institution was duly selected for the purpose of Articles 16 and 18 of the Arbitration Law of the People’s Republic of China. I reject this ground of challenge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For completeness, I consider the second of what Great Wall described as “raw sources” of Chinese law, namely the Civil Ruling of the Zhejiang Higher People’s Court (2016) Zhe Min Xia Zhong No. 278 – Appeal Case of Dispute over International Goods Sales Contract between Shennong Resources Limited and Ningbo Cimei International Trade Co., Ltd (the “Shennong decision”).

</div>
</div>
</div> The Shennong decision concerned an objection to the court’s jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute in that matter was to be referred to arbitration administered by “China International Arbitration Center”, which, it was argued, referred to CIETAC. This objection was rejected by the Ningbo Intermediate Court, whose decision was upheld by the Zhejiang Higher People’s Court. The court held that the specified arbitral institution was not to be read as referring to CIETAC and thus did not exist. Consequently, the arbitration clause was invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is important to note that this was an interpretation of a different contract between different parties. The Shennong decision does not stand for a rule of Chinese law that any arbitration clause selecting “China International Arbitration Center” is invalid. In truth, it reflects the same principle as that of Singapore law, namely that the exercise is one of contractual interpretation to ascertain whether parties objectively intended to refer to a specific arbitral instruction by the misnomer. As it happens, in that case the Chinese court concluded that it was “impossible to infer a specific arbitration institution”.

</div>
</div>
</div> When considering an arbitration clause, the court must consider what parties’ intention was, as objectively evinced from the words used in their commercial context. I have undertaken that exercise in this case and concluded that the objective intention of the parties to the Contracts was that their disputes should be referred to CIETAC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 There is one other point which ultimately I have not relied upon. Great Wall took this objection only at the last minute (on 24 November 2021), even though its representative Mr Qin Guanglin took every other conceivable point in his affidavit dated 20 August 2021 (including alleging that the stamp used on the Contracts was not Great Wall’s).

</div>
</div>
</div> It is tempting to draw the inference that Great Wall was not surprised by the reference of the dispute to CIETAC, and therefore CIETAC must have been agreed upon by parties. However, I do not rely on any such inference. Subsequent conduct can be an uncertain guide to contractual intention, as has again been cautioned by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">MCH International Pte Ltd and others v YG Group Pte Ltd and others and other appeals</span> [2019] 2 SLR 837 at [20]–[21]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I end this section by noting that once it is accepted that parties chose CIETAC, then CIETAC Rules may be relied on for the purpose of establishing good service. Article 8(3) provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any arbitration correspondence to a party or its representative(s) shall be deemed to have been properly served on the party if delivered to the addressee or sent to the addressee’s place of business, place of registration, domicile, habitual residence or mailing address, or where, after reasonable inquiries by the other party, none of the aforesaid addresses can be found, the arbitration correspondence is sent by the Arbitration Court to the addressee’s last known place of business, place of registration, domicile, habitual residence or mailing address by registered or express mail, or by any other means that can provide a record of the attempt at delivery, including but not limited to service by public notary, entrustment or retention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This is therefore a further ground that the notice of arbitration and the Award, as well as the other documents, were all validly served on Great Wall.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether the arbitral procedure was in accordance with parties’ agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60  The final ground that Great Wall raised to resist enforcement is that the arbitral tribunal applied the wrong procedure when it said that “the dispute in this case does not involve foreign-related factors” and so referred to Chapter V “Special Provisions on Domestic Arbitration” in the CIETAC Rules.
