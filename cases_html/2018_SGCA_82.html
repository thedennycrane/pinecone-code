HPK was the plaintiff in an action against the respondent, Revitech Pte Ltd (“Revitech”) in Suit No 36 of 2006 (“S 36/2006”). On 2 August 2010, following the determination of liability in S 36/2006, the court ordered costs to Revitech on its counterclaim. It also ordered that, in the event HPK was unable or unwilling to pay Revitech costs when taxed or agreed, Revitech would be at liberty, after giving due notice to Mr Ho, to make Mr Ho pay such costs personally (“the Costs Order”) on the basis that Mr Ho was the <span class="font-italic">alter ego</span> and the moving force behind HPK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On 24 May 2017, Mr Ho filed Originating Summons No 563 of 2017 (“OS 563”) seeking to be added as a party to S 36/2006 and to set aside the Costs Order. OS 563 was heard and dismissed by Lai Siu Chiu SJ (“the Judge”) on 29 January 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Before us, Mr Ho sought an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against the Judge’s decision in OS 563. Having heard from the parties, we dismissed Mr Ho’s application on the basis that OS 563 was devoid of merit and had no prospect of success. OS 563 was simply an attempt to re-open matters that have long been concluded. We now set out the facts and the brief reasons for our decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Brief facts and procedural history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 We provide here a summary of the salient events in this matter. A more detailed chronology appears in the annexure at the end of our grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In 2006, HPK commenced S 36/2006 against Revitech over a construction dispute. Revitech filed a counterclaim. Mr Ho was HPK’s representative during the trial and was its main factual witness. The trial was heard in three tranches. On 2 August 2010, after the conclusion of the trial, the Judge ordered costs on a standard basis against HPK on Revitech’s counterclaim. She also made the Costs Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 30 September 2010, the Court of Appeal heard HPK’s appeal from S 36/2006. The appeal was in the main dismissed although the Court of Appeal directed that the Costs Order be suspended pending the assessment of damages, with liberty to either party to apply after the completion of the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Damages were eventually assessed in Revitech’s favour. The suspended Costs Order came up for further consideration before the Court of Appeal on 11 July 2014 (“the 11 July 2014 hearing”). As HPK’s solicitors had been discharged prior to this hearing, Mr Ho represented HPK at the hearing.  Mr Ho addressed the Court of Appeal on the merits of the Costs Order. After hearing Mr Ho and Revitech, the Court of Appeal restored the suspended Costs Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Dissatisfied with the Court of Appeal’s decision at the 11 July 2014 hearing, HPK filed several applications in 2014 and 2015 supported by affidavits by Mr Ho seeking to set aside, stay and vary the decision.

While OS 563 was underway, the Attorney-General (the “AG”) applied pursuant to s 74 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) to restrain Mr Ho (and HPK) from continuing proceedings connected with S 36/2006 on the basis that Mr Ho was a vexatious litigant. Mr Ho consented to the AG’s application and a consent order was recorded (“the vexatious litigant order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 As a result of the vexatious litigant order, Mr Ho required leave of court to continue with OS 563.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In fact, Mr Ho claimed that he had notice of the Costs Order only as late as 23 August 2016 when costs were taxed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Mr Ho’s claims could not be correct. He would have been the person instructing HPK’s counsel at the hearing on costs on 2 August 2010 and he did not allege that his then counsel failed to inform him about the Costs Order after it was made by the Judge. Mr Ho was not only present at the 11 July 2014 hearing concerning the Costs Order, he also represented HPK. It is plain to us that Mr Ho was aware of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The documentary evidence on record – including Mr Ho’s own affidavits filed in support of HPK’s subsequent successive applications to challenge the Costs Order – proved this to be so. In his affidavit dated 21 July 2014, Mr Ho detailed exchanges between himself and the Court of Appeal at the 11 July 2014 hearing. At that hearing, Mr Ho addressed the Court of Appeal on why he should not be made personally liable for costs. The suspended Costs Order was explained to Mr Ho and was then restored. On at least three further occasions after 11 July 2014, Mr Ho had the opportunity to ventilate his case on the Costs Order before the Court of Appeal. There could therefore be no doubt that Mr Ho had notice of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest and had been heard on the same issue several times. Indeed, many of the grounds raised before us appeared to have similarly been raised before the Court of Appeal on those prior occasions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Mr Ho’s application in OS 563 was merely another attempt to re-open the proceedings in S 36/2006 and the Court of Appeal’s decision on the Costs Order. Such matters have long been concluded. In our view, the Judge was therefore entirely justified in dismissing OS 563. Mr Ho’s appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of OS 563 would ultimately be a non-starter. Accordingly, we dismissed his application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Observations on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ex parte</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Before we conclude, we think it is useful to address one other point canvassed by counsel for Mr Ho. As Mr Ho was subject to the vexatious litigant order, he had to satisfy the High Court that his intended proceedings were not an abuse of process of the court and that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> ground for the proceedings: s 74(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SCJA. It was submitted that since Mr Ho had succeeded in obtaining leave to continue proceedings in the two applications before Chan J, OS 563 could not be an abuse of process and had a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> chance of success.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Mr Ho’s applications were made <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>, in Revitech’s absence. The court’s attention was not brought to the fact that Mr Ho had had the opportunity to address the Court of Appeal on multiple occasions on the merits of the Costs Order. Mr Ho’s affidavits and submissions before Chan J claimed that he had notice of the Costs Order only on 23 August 2016, which, as shown above, could not be correct. They made no mention of the 11 July 2014 hearing or his three applications thereafter to set aside, stay and vary the Costs Order. Other than a cursory reference to Mr Ho’s affidavit filed in OS 563, which in turn made passing reference to the Court of Appeal’s reinstatement of the Costs Order, none of the materials either directly or indirectly explained that the Court of Appeal had considered and upheld the Costs Order after submissions were made on whether Mr Ho should be made to pay costs personally. Had the full history of the proceedings been brought to the court’s attention, leave to continue might not have been granted as OS 563 and the intended appeal from its dismissal would be frivolous and completely hopeless in merit.  In those circumstances, Mr Ho could not rely on the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> proceedings as evidence of the merits of his proposed appeal from OS 563. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 For the above reasons we dismissed the present application with costs.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

Court of Appeal Originating Summons No 9 of 2018
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Tay Yong
Kwang):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: CoA gives its reasons for dismissing an application for extension
of time to appeal on the basis that the putative appeal would have no
prospect of success.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The applicant was a director and shareholder of Ho Pak Kim Realty Pte Ltd
(“HPK”). HPK was the plaintiff in an action against Revitech Pte Ltd
(“Revitech”) in Suit No 36 of 2006 (“S 36/2006”). On 2 August 2010,
following the determination of liability in S 36/2006, the High Court
ordered costs to Revitech on its counterclaim. It also ordered that, in the
event HPK was unable or unwilling to pay Revitech costs when taxed or
agreed, Revitech would be at liberty, after giving due notice to the
applicant, to make him pay such costs personally (“the Costs Order”) on the
basis that he was the <em>alter ego</em> and moving force behind HPK.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 On 24 May 2017, the applicant filed Originating Summons No 563 of 2017
(“OS 563”) seeking to be added as a party to S 36/2006 and to set aside the
Costs Order. OS 563 was heard and dismissed by the High Court on 29 January
2018.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 About a month after the time to appeal against OS 563 had lapsed, the
applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal
against the High Court’s dismissal of OS 563. The Court of Appeal dismissed
the application.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Court of Appeal’s decision</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 On the facts of the case, the primary consideration in deciding whether
to grant the extension of time was whether the applicant’s intended appeal
against the dismissal of OS 563 was so hopeless that granting the extension
of time would be an exercise in futility. In the Court of Appeal’s view,
the intended appeal against OS 563 had no chance of success: at    <strong>[15]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The applicant’s main contention was that he had not been given an
opportunity to address the court on 2 August 2010 before the Costs Order
was made. He claimed that he only became aware of the Costs Order on 23
August 2016. However, this could not be correct:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
a The applicant would have instructed HPK’s counsel at the costs hearing on
2 August 2010 and did not allege that his then counsel failed to inform him
of the Costs Order after it was made: at <strong>[17]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
b The applicant was aware of the Costs Order by 11 July 2014 at the latest.
On that date, he represented HPK in a hearing before the Court of Appeal
regarding whether the Costs Order, which had been suspended pending the
assessment of damages in S 36/2006, should be reinstated. At this hearing,
the applicant addressed the Court of Appeal on why he should not be made
personally liable for costs: at <strong>[17]</strong>,    <strong>[18]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
c On at least three further occasions after 11 July 2014, the applicant had
the opportunity to ventilate his case on the Costs Order before the Court
of Appeal. There could therefore be no doubt that the applicant had been
heard on the same issue several times. Indeed, many of the grounds raised
before the Court of Appeal appeared to have similarly been raised before
the Court of Appeal on those prior occasions: at <strong>[18]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 OS 563 was merely another attempt to re-open the proceedings in S 36/2006
and the Court of Appeal’s decision on the Costs Order. Such matters had
long been concluded. The High Court was therefore entirely justified in
dismissing OS 563. The applicant’s appeal against the dismissal of OS 563
would ultimately be a non-starter. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused
to grant the extension of time: at <strong>[19]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 As the applicant was the subject of a vexatious litigant order, he had to
obtain leave from the High Court to continue proceedings in OS 563 and to
pursue his appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of the same. The
applicant submitted that since he had succeeded in obtaining such leave, OS
563 could not be an abuse of process and had a <em>prima facie</em> chance
of success. However, those applications had been made <em>ex parte</em> and
the court’s attention was not brought to the fact that the applicant had
previously addressed the Court of Appeal on multiple occasions on the
merits of the Costs Order. Had the full history of the proceedings been
brought to the court’s attention, leave might not have been granted. In
those circumstances, the applicant could not rely on the <em>ex parte</em>
proceedings as evidence of the merits of his proposed appeal from OS 563:
at <strong>[21]</strong>.
