In response, the defendant says that the claimant had transferred funds to him (the defendant) so that the claimant (or his associates) could “piggyback” on the defendant’s transaction to acquire another “Vantage Rapid Thermal Processing Unit” (“Vantage Unit”). I understand the term “piggyback”, which the defendant uses, to mean that the claimant can make use of the defendant’s transaction to acquire one Vantage Unit for the claimant’s own benefit. In essence, the defendant is saying that the loan from the claimant is not what it appears to be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After hearing the parties and considering their submissions, I dismiss the appeal and uphold the learned AR’s decision in SUM 104.

I thus adjourned the hearing to allow the claimant to file a reply affidavit and for parties to file their submissions in relation to the amendment application.

</div> According to the claimant, the defendant had been interested to purchase two Vantage Units, so that he could refurbish and sell them for a profit. However, the defendant could only afford to purchase one Vantage Unit. As such, in order to finance the purchase of the other Vantage Unit, the defendant asked the claimant for a loan of US$1.1m, which was the approximate purchase price of one Vantage Unit. Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the claimant extended a sum of US$1.1m to the defendant. In exchange, the defendant agreed to repay the claimant a sum of US$1.95m within approximately six months. Thus, the claimant’s case is premised on the repayment of a sum provided for in the Loan Agreement.

However, it is important that such proceedings “should not be allowed to become a means for obtaining, in effect, an immediate trial of the action” (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) at para 14/1/2, as well as Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>(LexisNexis, 2022) at para 23-6).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Accordingly, to obtain summary judgment, a claimant must first show that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment. If he fails to do that, his application ought to be dismissed. However, once the claimant shows that he has a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, the tactical burden then shifts to the defendant who, in order to obtain leave to defend, must establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence (see the High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management &amp; Consultancy Services Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1342 (“<span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [43]–[44] and <span class="font-italic">M2B</span><span class="font-italic"> World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko</span> [2015] 1 SLR 325 (“<span class="font-italic">M2B</span><span class="font-italic"> World</span>”) at [17]). The court will not grant leave to defend if the defendant only provides a mere assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the basis of his defence (see <span class="font-italic">M2B</span><span class="font-italic"> World</span> at [19], citing the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Prosperous Credit Pte Ltd v Gen Hwa Franchise International Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 53 at [14]).

</div> It also provides that the “Lender” is the claimant and the “Borrower” is the defendant. It further states that in exchange for the claimant extending to the defendant a loan in the sum of US$1.1m (described as the “Loan Amount”), the defendant is to repay the sum of US$1.95m (described as the “Equipment Sale Price”) to the claimant in accordance with a prescribed schedule (described as the “Repayment Schedule”). The Repayment Schedule provides for repayment to be made in three tranches between December 2018 and March 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 It is not disputed that the claimant had paid the Loan Amount to the defendant. It is also not disputed that the defendant has failed to make any repayment to the claimant. The claimant has therefore made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for judgment since the defendant is in breach of his obligation to repay the Equipment Sale Price. This is similar to many cases in which the courts have found a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case and entered summary judgment on the basis of signed loan documents. For example, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Lek Peng Lung v Lee Investments (Pte) Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">others </span>[1991] 2 SLR(R) 635 (“<span class="font-italic">Lek Peng Lung</span>”), the plaintiff sued the defendants for moneys that her late husband had lent to the defendants’ pawnshop. The plaintiff produced two receipts which were signed by the third defendant on behalf of the pawnshop that stated that “[t]his is a receipt for a loan, not a deposit”. Warren L H Khoo J dismissed the defendants’ appeal against summary judgment. Khoo J had decided so on the basis that, among other reasons, the defendants had not discharged their burden of showing why the receipts, which clearly stated that the sums were loans and not deposits, should be treated as deposits instead (see <span class="font-italic">Lek Peng Lung </span>at [21]–[23]). Similarly, in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">DBS Bank Ltd v Lam Yee Shen and </span><span class="font-italic">another </span>[2021] 5 SLR 1202, Aedit Abdullah J found that the plaintiff had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case with its documentation showing the existence of a mortgage, as well as account statements proving that the defendants had defaulted on their monthly instalments (at [16]). Abdullah J’s decision was upheld by the Appellate Division of the High Court (the “AD”) in <span class="font-italic">Lam Yee Shen and another v DBS Bank Lt</span><span class="font-italic">d </span>[2022] 1 SLR 671. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Accordingly, I find that the claimant has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for summary judgment against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant has not shown that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Given that I have found that the claimant has established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for summary judgment, the tactical burden shifts to the defendant. In order to obtain leave to defend, the defendant must establish that there is a fair or reasonable probability that he has a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence (see above at [17]). In this regard, the defendant raises a number of arguments. As I have said above, the defendant’s primary argument is that the claimant’s and Bryan’s intentions to purchase the Vantage Unit for themselves evince the true nature of the Loan Agreement. Second, the defendant says that the claimant’s conduct prior to the commencement of OC 406 (and subsequent to the purchase of the Vantage Unit) has superseded the Loan Agreement in its entirety.

</div> The correspondence between Korbett and Macquarie is relevant because Macquarie was the seller of the Vantage Unit. The defendant’s case is that the claimant (or his associates) had “piggybacked” on his transaction to acquire a Vantage Unit for himself, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the claimant. Therefore, the evidence shows that the defendant was only invoiced for one Vantage Unit, as opposed to two.

</div>
</div> I understand the defendant to be saying that this shows that he continually monitors the prices of Vantage Units, so it is no surprise that there would be an invoice from Macquarie showing the price for two of such machines. However, there is a crucial difference between the “Similar Macquarie Invoice” and the document exhibited by the claimant – the “Similar Macquarie Invoice” is marked as being a “Quotation”, whereas the document exhibited by the claimant is marked as an “Invoice”. Thus, the document exhibited by the claimant does show the defendant being invoiced for <span class="font-italic">two </span>Vantage Units. This effectively counters the defendant’s argument that the claimant had intended to purchase one of the Vantage Units by “piggybacking” on the transaction since, in that scenario, the defendant would have been invoiced for only one Vantage Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Moreover, even if the claimant had intended to “piggyback” on the defendant’s purchase of Vantage Units by having the defendant own the two units legally but hold one of them on trust for the claimant, this account fails to explain the Loan Agreement. This is because the Loan Agreement clearly obliges the defendant to <span class="font-italic">repay</span> the Equipment Sale Price to the claimant. If the defendant were holding one of the Vantage Units on trust for the claimant, then it is inexplicable why the defendant would owe the purchase price of one unit to the claimant. Instead, the defendant would simply have been obliged to transfer the legal title of the Vantage Unit concerned to the claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In any event, the defendant’s own evidence in this regard is inconsistent. In his Defence, the defendant states that the claimant and Bryan apparently “expressed interest to similarly acquire a Vantage Equipment Unit” “sometime in August 2018”.

</div> However, in his affidavit filed in SUM 104, the defendant alleged that “[t]here was an oral discussion between [the defendant,] the [c]laimant and Bryan, where they told [the defendant] that they wanted to purchase 1 Vantage Tool [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what I have termed as “Vantage Unit”]”.

</div> Subsequent to this purported oral discussion, the defendant alleged that he then “instructed Samuel [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the general manager of Korbett] to enquire on the possibility of acquiring the two Vantage Units … Samuel did so on <span class="font-italic">31 May 2018</span>” [emphasis added].

</div> As can be seen, the defendant’s account in his Defence is that the claimant expressed an interest in purchasing a Vantage Unit in August 2018. However, this is contradicted by his affidavit where he said that he reached out to Samuel in May 2018, in furtherance of the claimant’s supposed interest. In fact, the defendant’s counsel admitted at the hearing of SUM 104 that the defendant’s evidence was inconsistent in this regard.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this shows that the defendant’s account of events is unreliable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is nothing wrong with the claimant’s conduct subsequent to the Loan Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, as to the defendant’s argument about the claimant’s conduct prior to the commencement of OC 406, this is really about the claimant’s conduct <span class="font-italic">subsequent </span>to the Loan Agreement. In this regard, the defendant first says that if the Loan Agreement was really a loan between the parties, then it is inexplicable why the claimant remained silent for four years, since the repayment was due before the claimant subsequently pursued a claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, this is not a credible defence. In the first place, the defendant is not alleging, nor has he particularised, that the parties had entered into a subsequent contract which either varied or superseded the Loan Agreement. At its highest, the defendant’s case is that there was an implied contract that arose by virtue of the parties’ subsequent conduct and the effect of this contract was to vary the Loan Agreement. Because of this variation, the claimant cannot enforce the Loan Agreement. I disagree even on this characterisation of the defendant’s case because it is well established that contracts will not be lightly implied (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Higgins, Danial Patrick v </span><span class="font-italic">Mulacek, Philippe Emanuel and others and another suit </span>[2016] 5 SLR 848 at [52], citing the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal </span>[2016] 4 SLR 728 at [29]). Therefore, given the lack of any particularisation as to how this implied contract was even formed, I do not think that the defendant has established a triable issue. More broadly, the correct approach to take in relation to the claimant’s silence for four years is that, subject to the relevant limitation period, it is entirely up to a claimant whether he wishes to pursue a claim. As such, I disagree that the mere fact that the claimant here did not raise a claim for four years shows that the claimant did not think that the Loan Agreement is a loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 For completeness, I deal with two cases which the defendant raises in support of his argument that the claimant’s silence after the Loan Agreement ought to be given weighty consideration. The first of these is the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Thong Soon Seng v Magnus Energy Group </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd </span>[2023] SGHC 5 (“<span class="font-italic">Thong Soon Seng</span>”), where Vinodh Coomaraswamy J considered the plaintiff’s conduct in the run up to the litigation (at [33]). This was one of the learned judge’s considerations in deciding that the sum of $4m that the plaintiff paid to the defendant was not for the purpose of the alleged loans. However, <span class="font-italic">Thong Soon Seng </span>can be easily distinguished because the alleged loan agreements were orally made. Unlike the present case, there was no written contract in that case. In those circumstances, it is entirely understandable why the High Court attributed more weight to the parties’ conduct, including any inaction. In stark contrast, the Loan Agreement here is written and bears the unmistakable hallmarks of being a loan on its face. Similarly, the second case which the defendant relies on, being the AD decision of <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hock v Teo Cher Koon and another and another </span><span class="font-italic">appeal </span>[2022] 2 SLR 314, was also based on an alleged <span class="font-italic">oral </span>loan agreement. There is no need to repeat myself save to say that it is entirely understandable why the AD placed greater weight on the respondent’s long delay in filing his action (at [103]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Moving on, the defendant also says that in March 2020, the claimant (or his associates) had arranged for one of the Vantage Units to be shipped to HLK. In support of this, Mr Sreenivasan referred me to, among other documents, a tax invoice which Korbett issued to Apek on 19 March 2020 for the associated shipping costs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was supposedly done pursuant to the claimant’s beneficial ownership of the Vantage Unit. This is, therefore, so the defendant argues, consistent with his narrative that the claimant had purchased one of the Vantage Units and had transferred money to the defendant to do just that. The defendant also relies on the claimant’s instructions as being an assertion of ownership over the Vantage Unit concerned, which should be construed as the defendant repaying the loan under the Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, I fail to see how this argument affects the characterisation of the Loan Agreement. Even if the defendant is correct that the claimant had intended to own one of the two Vantage Units, that still does not explain why the parties had entered into the Loan Agreement which clearly provides for the defendant to <span class="font-italic">repay </span>the claimant the Equipment Sale Price. While the defendant may have other claims arising from this alleged transfer, I am not convinced that the defendant has raised any real defence that is particular to the Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">It is too late for the defendant to argue that the Loan Agreement is not authentic </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, as to the defendant’s argument below that the Loan Agreement is not authentic, I agree with the claimant that the defendant has left it too late to raise this challenge. However, to be fair to the defendant, this is not a point that he is pressing in this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and another v Chia Chin Yan and another </span><span class="font-italic">matter </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1371 (at [42]–[43]), a defendant cannot rely on a fresh defence that has not been pleaded in his defence to resist summary judgment, unless the defence is amended or the case is an exceptional one. To my mind, if the Loan Agreement was really forged, then the defendant would surely have raised such an important matter in his Defence. Indeed, it is important to emphasise that the defendant intentionally stated in his Defence that he does not recall signing the Agreement.

</div> This is deliberately framed. As the High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Super Group Ltd v Mysore </span><span class="font-italic">Nagaraja Kartik </span>[2019] 4 SLR 692 (at [117]), saying that one did not sign a document is quite different from saying that one does not recall signing a document. This is because the former disavows the signature completely whereas the latter leaves open the possibility that the signature is genuine but the signor has forgotten about it. In the present case, the defendant’s careful framing in his Defence leaves open the possibility that he had signed the Loan Agreement. The corollary of this is that the defendant cannot dispute the authenticity of the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, even if I were to allow the defendant to amend his Defence to say that the signature is forged (albeit he did not include this proposed amendment in SUM 1463), I would also have concluded the same that he has not shown a plausible defence. In this regard, the defendant says that his signature on the Loan Agreement does not have the distinctive “circle” in his real signature,

</div> However, it is clear that the courts do not refuse to enforce an agreement just because it is uncommercial.
