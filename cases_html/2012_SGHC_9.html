        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Originating Summons No 364 of 2011 was an
                    application by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”)
                    pursuant to s 94(1) read with s 98(1) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to this court for
                    orders that Michael Chong Wai Yen, Kenneth Tan Chong Peng, Yap Kok Kiong and
                    Siow Jit Thong (“the first respondent”, “the second
                    respondent”, “the third respondent” and “the fourth
                    respondent” respectively or “the four respondents”
                    collectively, as the case may be) be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the Act.
                    Having heard submissions from all parties, we granted the application and
                    ordered that the<sup></sup>third respondent be struck off the roll, and that each of the
                    remaining respondents be suspended for a period of thirty months. We further
                    ordered that the costs of the proceedings before us be borne by all the four
                    respondents, with the costs of proceedings below pertaining to the fourth
                    respondent to be taxed if not agreed and to be borne by him. We now give our
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       These proceedings emanated from investigations
                    by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) into five
                    law firms for having purportedly given gratifications to a company named Asprez
                    Loans Connections Pte Ltd (“Asprez”) in consideration for Asprez
                    referring conveyancing related matters to them. The investigations revealed that
                    Asprez was set up by a former business development manager of the<sup></sup>third respondent named Tan Sinn Aeng Ben (“Ben
                    Tan”). On the instruction of the<sup></sup>third respondent, Ben Tan registered Asprez on 7 June 2004.
                    At all material times, Asprez effectively operated under the stewardship of
                        the<sup></sup>third respondent. The main function of Asprez was to procure
                    conveyancing business by promise of payment of referral fees to real estate
                    agents. In return, the real estate agents were expected to refer clients to
                    Asprez. Upon engaging the services of Asprez, real estate agents would select a
                    lawyer from Asprez’s panel of lawyers to attend to the conveyancing
                    aspects of each transaction so referred by them. The firms of the four
                    respondents were, at different periods, on Asprez’s panel of lawyers. At
                    the end of its investigation, CPIB, on 15 October 2008, referred the matter
                    to the Law Society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Charges were subsequently preferred by the Law
                    Society against the four respondents for making payments to Asprez in
                    consideration of the latter’s referrals of conveyancing work. A
                    Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) was appointed on 7 July 2010 to
                    conduct formal investigations and to hear the charges brought against them. Save
                    for the fourth respondent, the other respondents admitted to the charges
                    preferred against them. Having heard the guilty pleas of the first, second and
                    third respondents and after a full hearing in respect of the fourth respondent,
                    the DT found that causes of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed
                    under s 83 of the Act against the four respondents pursuant to
                    s 93(1)(c) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Pursuant to the findings of the DT, the Law
                    Society instituted the present show cause proceedings against the four
                    respondents. At the hearing before us, the fourth respondent maintained his
                    position taken before the DT that the charges preferred against him had not been
                    proven. We rejected this argument which we will now explain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The case against the fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges against the fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The fourth respondent faced two charges,
                        <em>viz</em>, one under s 83(2)(<em>e</em>) and another under s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, and two alternative charges under
                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act (although nothing
                    turned on the alternative charges). The charges on which the fourth respondent
                    was found guilty by the DT were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After the Agreement was entered into, the fourth
                    respondent’s firm, David Siow, Chua &amp; Tan LLC, was placed onto
                    Asprez’s panel of lawyers. During the period of 6 February 2006 to
                    1 August 2006, the fourth respondent made seven payments totalling $33,850
                    to Asprez. These payments constituted the basis of the charges against the
                    fourth respondent. The fourth respondent did not dispute that the payments were
                    made to Asprez. What he disputed was the <em>purpose</em>
                    for which the payments were made. The Law Society’s case was that the
                    fourth respondent made these payments in consideration of Asprez’s
                    referrals of conveyancing work to his firm. However, the fourth respondent
                    contended that the payments were for consultancy and training services rendered
                    by Asprez to him or his firm. We pause, parenthetically, to observe that all
                    three purposes, <em>ie</em>, provision of consultancy,
                    training and referrals of conveyancing services, were listed in the preamble of
                    the Agreement (at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings of the DT against the fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In finding the fourth respondent guilty of the
                    charges, the DT relied upon two main pieces of evidence, <em>ie</em>, the Agreement and various invoices seized from the office of
                    Asprez during a raid conducted by CPIB (collectively referred to as “the
                    invoices”). Each of the invoices was addressed to the fourth
                    respondent’s firm. The details of the invoices were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Invoice No. 06/D0201 dated
                        6 February 2006 for $600;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Invoice No. 06/D0301 dated 2 March 2006 for
                        $2,400;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Invoice
                        No. 06/D0401 dated 4 April 2006 for $7,800;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Invoice No. 06/D0501 dated
                        4 May 2006 for $4,350;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_e"></a>(e)     Revised Invoice No. 06/D0501 dated 4 May 2006
                        for $3,850;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_f"></a>(f)     Invoice No. 06/D0601 dated 1 June 2006 for
                    $6,400;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_g"></a>(g)     Invoice
                        No. 06/D0701 dated 1 July 2006 for $6,000; and</p>

                        1 August 2006 for $6,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Attached to each of the invoices
                        (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) was a list which
                    purportedly detailed conveyancing transactions undertaken by the fourth
                    respondent or his firm (collectively referred to as “the attached
                    lists”). The contents of the attached lists tallied with the<sup></sup>conveyancing register of files of the fourth respondent’s
                    firm. In the DT’s view, the totality of the evidence was compelling to
                    prove the charges against the fourth respondent. At [15] of the DT’s report against the fourth respondent as
                    contained in <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Michael Chong Wai
                        Yen and Others</em> [2011] SGDT 6, the DT stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To reiterate the Law Society’s case, it rested on Asprez’s
                        invoices which were duly paid by the Respondent. What the payments were for
                        was shown in the attached lists. The Respondent argued that the origin of
                        each of the seven undated lists attached to each invoice was
                        “shrouded in mystery”. But the transactions referred to in the
                        lists seized by CPIB corresponded that (<em>sic</em>)
                        the transactions recorded in the Respondent’s Conveyancing Register.
                        The DT is therefore convinced that the (<em>sic</em>)
                        each list detailed the transactions that went to the Respondent’s firm
                        for which payment per the invoice was due.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our views on the DT’s findings against the fourth
                respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was held in <em>Law Society
                        of Singapore v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
                        (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”) that this court
                    would be slow to disturb findings of fact made by a DT, previously known as a
                    disciplinary committee (see [27] of
                        <em>Phyllis Tan</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In this connection, we would also reiterate that the practice of
                        this court in relation to findings of fact made by the [disciplinary
                        committee] is the same as the practice of an appellate court in relation to
                        findings of fact made by a lower court, <em>ie</em>,
                        this court will not lightly disturb such findings unless the findings are
                        clearly wrong or against the weight of the evidence: see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Lim Cheong Peng</em> [2006]
                        4 SLR(R) 360 at [13].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As the fourth respondent neither disputed
                    having entered into the Agreement nor disputed having made the payments which
                    formed the subject matter of the charges against him, the <em>purpose</em> for which the fourth respondent made the payments to
                    Asprez was critical. In the present case, it was necessary for this court to
                    reassess the DT’s finding in this regard because it was premised upon
                    hearsay evidence. At this juncture, we would observe that the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) applies to proceedings before a DT by virtue of
                    rule 23(1) of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (Cap 161,
                    R 2, 2010 Rev Ed):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Application of Evidence
                            Act</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23.—(1) The Evidence Act (Cap. 97) shall apply to
                        proceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal in the same manner as it
                        applies to civil and criminal proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The fourth respondent’s challenge to the
                    DT’s finding was founded on the premise that the DT should not have taken
                    cognisance of the invoices and the attached lists in arriving at its conclusion
                    because the makers of those documents had not testified before the DT. Only two
                    witnesses were called to testify for the Law Society, <em>ie</em>, Ben Tan and Vincent Lim (an investigator from CPIB), neither
                    of whom was the maker of the invoices and the attached lists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In our opinion, this submission of the fourth
                    respondent had merits. The contents of the invoices and the attached lists were
                    clearly hearsay. In Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <em>Evidence and the
                        Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    Ed, 2010) (“<em>Pinsler’s </em><em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em>”), the
                    concept of hearsay was explained thus (at para 4.01):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a fundamental principle that evidence adduced to prove a fact must
                        be reliable. Therefore a witness who gives oral evidence must generally
                        testify as to what he himself directly perceived, rather than to facts in
                        issue or relevant facts which were perceived by other persons and which were
                        recounted to him. Similarly, a document adduced to establish the facts it
                        refers to in the absence of direct evidence of the facts contained in it
                        would be generally inadmissible. This principle is embodied primarily by the
                        hearsay rule which also seeks to ensure the ‘best evidence’ is
                        put before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the light of the fact that the DT had
                    relied upon hearsay evidence in determining the fourth respondent’s guilt,
                    which it should not have, it became necessary for us to consider whether,
                    without relying upon the invoices and the attached lists, the critical finding
                    that the payments made by the fourth respondent to Asprez were for the specific
                    purpose of procuring conveyancing legal work was clearly wrong or against the
                    weight of the <em>admissible</em> evidence.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Apart from the invoices and the attached
                    lists, the other crucial pieces of evidence adduced by the Law Society were the
                    Agreement, the fact that the fourth respondent had admitted to having made the
                    material payments to Asprez, and a publicity flyer of Asprez aimed at enticing
                    housing agents to use the services of Asprez (“the publicity
                    flyer”). As the publicity flyer was an important piece of evidence, it

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     From the publicity flyer, it was clear that
                    Asprez was soliciting referrals of conveyancing work from housing agents through
                    promise of financial reward. Upon such referral of conveyancing work to Asprez,
                    housing agents were to select a lawyer from Asprez’s panel of lawyers to
                    provide legal representation. It was also abundantly clear that the scheme, as
                    described in the publicity flyer, was to induce housing agents, by the use of
                    monetary reward, to engage Asprez’s panel of lawyers – a panel which
                    included the fourth respondent’s firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On the basis of existence of the Agreement and
                    the publicity flyer, we were satisfied that a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case against the fourth respondent had been made out. The
                    Agreement listed referrals of conveyancing work to the fourth respondent and/or
                    his firm as one of its objectives (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). After the Agreement was entered into, the publicity
                    flyer was created and payments were effected by the fourth respondent to
                    Asprez.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The effect of the Law Society having
                    established a <em>prima facie</em> case against the fourth
                    respondent was that the evidential burden shifted to him to disprove that
                    payments were made to Asprez in consideration of referrals of conveyancing legal
                    work. The concept of shifting of evidential burden (albeit in the context of a
                    criminal case) is explained in <em>Pinsler’s Evidence and
                        the Litigation Process</em> (at para 12.08):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unlike the legal burden, the evidential burden can shift throughout the
                        trial. Put another way, the state of the evidence can shift so that at one
                        moment the prosecution’s case is strong enough to satisfy the standard
                        of proof (proof beyond a reasonable doubt) and at another, it is not. In the
                        former situation, the evidential burden shifts to the accused in the sense
                        that if he does not adduce evidence to bring the prosecution’s case
                        below the standard of proof (ie by creating a reasonable doubt), he would
                        lose. As a matter of practice, the court does not consider the incidence of
                        the evidential burden at different moments in the proceedings. The crucial
                        time for this purpose is at the end of the prosecution’s case. He must
                        discharge the evidential burden by then in order for the accused to be
                        called upon to enter his defence. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Fourth respondent’s rebuttal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We turn now to consider the fourth
                    respondent’s evidence and whether it sufficed in discharging the
                    evidential burden. The fourth respondent denied that Asprez had ever referred
                    conveyancing legal work to him. In addition, he denied that there was ever any
                    agreement with Asprez that the latter would refer conveyancing legal work to him
                    and/or his firm. This position was maintained by the fourth respondent in his
                    Statement of Defence (see paras 7, 8, 11 thereof) as well as during his
                    testimony before the DT, notwithstanding the explicit wording of the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In rebuttal, the fourth respondent claimed
                    that one David Foo, a director of Asprez, provided consultancy and training
                    services to his firm (see para 9 of his Statement of Defence). Further, the
                    fourth respondent claimed that Asprez had expanded his network with bankers and
                    conveyancing agents by enabling the fourth respondent to give presentations on
                    various legal topics to such persons. It was for these services provided by
                    Asprez that the fourth respondent claimed to have made the payments to Asprez
                    which formed the subject matter of the charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We will now consider the fourth
                    respondent’s evidence in respect of the Agreement. He admitted to having
                    drafted the Agreement. Therefore, it was incumbent upon him to explain why he
                    had included the phrase “referrals of conveyancing services” as
                    one of the objectives of the Agreement (at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) when, according to him, no such services were desired
                    or actually provided by Asprez. When cross examined on this issue by counsel for
                    the Law Society at the hearing before the DT, the<sup></sup>fourth respondent’s answers were nebulous and evasive (see
                    Notes of Evidence, Day 5, at pp 40 – 42):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    You used the word “referral”. This is
                            your agreement, okay. This didn’t even come from Asprez. What did
                            you intend or what did you mean by the use of the word
                            “referral’ in the header of this agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I think I have to explain this in totality why this
                            agreement was draft... put up by them. It’s not just one word
                            because I mentioned earlier on that when I prepared this agreement, I
                            make reference to the Professional Conduct Rules. This is the reason why
                            I imported the terms in the rules into this agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    ...Why was the word “referral” used
                            in this agreement? Why is this called a “Referral/Consultancy and
                            Training Agreement”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It’s a… matter of choice of words but
                            it doesn’t end there. It has a slash consultancy and training
                            agreement. But you must also look at the subsequent
                        recital.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Let’s look at the header first,
                            Mr Siow.</p>

                            header? You see, up to now from what I understand... there has been no
                            mention of Asprez referring any work to your firm yet. Am I
                            correct?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Right. So why did you put the word
                            “referral” in this agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It was not a referral agreement. But it was
                            “Referral/Consultancy and Training
                        Agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    All right. So if I take out the word
                            “referral”, “consultancy and training” can
                            stand on its own. Why did you need to put the word
                            “referral” in front?”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    That is you have to read together with the recital.
                            That’s what you have to look at the agreement in
                        totality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is quite plain, from the exchanges above,
                    that the fourth respondent simply could not provide any explanation as to why he

                    Agreement. Instead, he doggedly maintained that he had abided by the Legal

                    Rules”), both sets of rules being explicitly referred to in the Agreement
                        (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). However, as
                    pertinently pointed out by counsel for the Law Society whilst cross examining
                    the fourth respondent, there would have been absolutely no need to make
                    reference to the relevant Professional Conduct Rules or the Publicity Rules if
                    all that Asprez was providing to the fourth respondent and/or his firm was
                    merely consultancy and training services (see Notes of Evidence, Day 5, at
                    pp 40 – 41):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    … For somebody to provide you training and
                            consultancy, you don’t need an agreement actually in the first
                            place. I…I can understand you wanting to formalise an agreement.
                            Why did you need to look at the Professional Conduct Rules even if there
                            was going to be no reference of work to your firm? Why… would you
                            even be looking at the Professional Conduct Rules? I’m trying to
                            understand this. If somebody is merely providing you consultancy and
                            training, why was there a need… for you to look at the
                            Professional Conduct Rules? Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Yes, of course. As I mentioned earlier on, this
                            agreement is for consultancy and training. I have looked through the
                            Professional Conduct Rules. My learned counsel mentioned that it’s
                            only relevant to referral but it doesn’t confine to that because
                            when I enter into this agreement for consultancy and training, I want to
                            ensure that Asprez did not cause [David Siow, Chua &amp; Tan LLC] to run
                            foul of the rules. So I want to comply with the rules. So having a
                            consultancy and training agreement doesn’t mean that it prohibits
                            me from using these rules to tie Asprez’s hands. So I thought that
                            would be the safest way to tie Asprez’s hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Quite simply, this answer of the fourth respondent to the question
                    posed by counsel for the Law Society is a <em>non
                        sequiter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The<sup></sup>fourth respondent further testified that he had expressly referred
                    to Rule 11B which was introduced <em>vide </em><em>s </em>410/2001, <em>viz</em>,
                    Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) (Amendment) Rules 2001 (“Rule
                    11B”)) whilst drafting the Agreement in order not to fall foul of the
                    relevant Professional Conduct Rules. We will now see in what way Rule 11B was
                    germane. It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11B. —(1) In addition to rule 11A, when an advocate and

                        the case may be, shall ensure that the agreement is made in writing and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the referror must not do anything to impair
                            the right of the client not to appoint the advocate and solicitor
                            or law practice or in any way influence the right of the client to
                            appoint the advocate and solicitor or law practice of
                            his choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The advocate and solicitor or law practice,
                            as the case may be, must forthwith terminate the agreement if the
                            referror is in breach of any term referred to in paragraph (1) or
                            if there is reason to believe that the advocate and solicitor or
                            law practice is in breach of such term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Where the advocate and solicitor or law
                            practice has terminated an agreement under paragraph (2),

                            practice was instructed prior to the termination but should not
                            accept any further referrals from the referror.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Clearly, Rule 11B deals solely with agreements
                    for referrals of conveyancing services. Given the<sup></sup>fourth respondent’s position that the Agreement only
                    pertained to training and consultancy services, it was incumbent upon him to
                    explain why Rule 11B was incorporated into the Agreement which he had drafted.
                    When pressed by counsel for the Law Society as to why Rule 11B was even referred
                    to when, according to him the Agreement had nothing to do with the referral of
                    conveyancing services, the fourth respondent was again evasive and gave a wholly
                    incoherent answer (see Notes of Evidence, Day 5, at pp 47 –
                        48):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Right. So why were you looking at rule 11B if at
                            that point in time you had no discussion between yourselves and Asprez
                            for referral of conveyancing files or conveyancing work? Why was this
                            rule even relevant? This is a relevant rule only for agreements for
                            referrals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I think I have answered this question. I have
                            entered into an agreement of consultancy and training. But as I
                            mentioned, I want to tie Asprez’s hands. I do not want Asprez to
                            cause my firm, [David Siow, Chua &amp; Tan LLC], to run fouls [sic] of
                            the rules. I want to comply with the rules. This is the reason why I
                            made reference to 11B and to import the terms in the rules into this
                            agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     From the matters referred to in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above, we were satisfied that the
                    fourth respondent was either less than truthful or he just could not provide any
                    credible answer. His attempted replies to those very pertinent questions simply
                    did not make sense. Thus, the inevitable conclusion was that the fourth
                    respondent and Asprez had entered into an agreement for referral of conveyancing
                    work from the latter to the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     While from the foregoing it was plain that the
                    fourth respondent intended to receive referrals of conveyancing work from Asprez
                    by entering into the Agreement, the fourth respondent could still disprove the
                    charges by showing that the payments made to Asprez were not in consideration
                    for having received such referrals. We will now turn to consider his
                    explanations for having made the payments to Asprez. In this regard, the fourth
                    respondent claimed to have been accorded opportunities to deliver presentations
                    to bankers and property agents, as well as mingle with such persons, at events
                    organised by Asprez. It was for such business opportunities which were made
                    available by Asprez to the fourth respondent that the payments were effected to
                    Asprez. However, he was unable to furnish any evidence, other than his bare
                    assertions, which showed that Asprez had in fact organised such events or
                    activities (see Notes of Evidence, Day 6, at p 6):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    So, Mr. Siow, is it your evidence that everything
                            was oral and there’s not one single piece of written communication
                            or email between Asprez and your company informing you of any single
                            networking event?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    ... But there are no correspondence (<em>sic</em>) between Asprez. There’s no need for
                            correspondence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In respect of the alleged presentations made
                    by him at events purportedly coordinated by Asprez, the fourth respondent
                    – while claiming to have used materials whilst making such presentations
                    – was not able to furnish any evidence of those materials which he had
                    used to make the presentations. This was conceded during cross examination (see
                    Notes of Evidence, Day 6, at p 8):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    ... Did you… have something in writing that
                            you presented or you just went there and talk again?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    No, we have materials, yes, of
                        course.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    ... have you exhibited any of these
                            materials?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    Exhibited not in the
                        affidavit…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The fourth respondent further claimed that
                    some of the payments made were in respect of logistical and administrative
                    expenses incurred by Asprez for arranging the events and yet he was unable to
                    state exactly what he was paying for. He simply did not know how much he would
                    be billed by Asprez in respect of such expenses as could be seen from his
                    answers in cross-examination (see Notes of Evidence, Day 5, at pp 30
                    – 31):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    What was the discussion on payment with
                            Mr David? Did Mr David Foo tell you... how much you had to
                            pay?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    As I mentioned, all the… logistical and
                            administrative expenses were incurred by Asprez, and it will be
                            substantial expenses. So… I am agreeable to pay a reasonable sum
                            to chip in into the portion of these expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Did you know how much you were going to be
                            billed?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    I will not be able to know.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q:    Then how can you enter into an arrangement when you
                            don’t know how much you’re going to be billed?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A:    It depends on the number of events that I’ve
                            lined up. It depends on the number of talks, number of seminars and the
                            events… for the month. That’s the reason why I will need to
                            know estimated cost at the beginning of the month for what are the
                            events that’s lined up for me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The fourth respondent’s evidence in respect of the alleged
                    services rendered by Asprez to him and/or his firm lacked credibility. He not
                    only failed to adduce any documentary evidence to prove that he had indeed made
                    presentations at the purported business gatherings, he also could not provide
                    any reasonable account for the sums of monies paid to Asprez. At the hearing of
                    the show cause proceedings before us, in order to give him a further opportunity
                    to prove what he alleged, we enquired if the fourth respondent had diary entries
                    pertaining to his attendance at the events purportedly organised by Asprez. His
                    counsel answered in the negative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our findings against the fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the premises, we found that the fourth
                    respondent failed to rebut the <em>prima facie</em> case
                    presented by the Law Society against him. It was evident that the Agreement
                    which the fourth respondent entered into with Asprez involved referrals of
                    conveyancing work to the him and/or his firm, and, viewing it together with the
                    publicity flyer (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), we
                    had no hesitation in holding that the payments to Asprez were made pursuant to
                    the Agreement in consideration for such referrals. In the result, we hold that
                    the charges against the fourth respondent had been proven beyond a reasonable
                    doubt even without having to rely on the invoices and the attached lists, which
                    we have earlier ruled to be hearsay evidence (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The respective cases against the<sup></sup>first, second and third respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charge against the first respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We now set out in brief the case raised
                    against each of the other three respondents. As against the first respondent,
                    the Law Society proceeded only with one charge under s 83(2)<em>(h)</em> of the Act to which he pleaded guilty. The charge
                    (as amended on 28 October 2010) read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That you, <b>MICHAEL CHONG WAI YEN</b>, an Advocate
                        and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, are guilty of such

                        Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning
                        of section 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Legal Profession
                        Act, to wit, by paying a total sum of approximately S$157,900.00 to Asprez

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The first respondent was an advocate and
                    solicitor of 11 years standing. During the material times, he was a partner at
                    Messrs Chee &amp; Michael Chong Partnership. In circumstances similar to that of
                    the fourth respondent, the first respondent joined Asprez’s panel of
                    lawyers towards the end of 2005 on the understanding that Asprez would, in
                    exchange for payment, refer conveyancing legal work to the first respondent
                    and/or his firm. Thereafter, from December 2005 to August 2006, a period of nine
                    months, the first respondent made payments to Asprez which totalled $157,900.
                    The payments were in consideration of Asprez referring conveyancing legal work
                    to the first respondent and/or his firm. The first respondent pleaded guilty to
                    this charge.</p>

                    second respondent pleaded guilty. The charge read:</p>

                    sometime in 2004 on the understanding that Asprez would, in exchange for
                    payment, refer conveyancing legal work to the second respondent and/or his firm.

                    solicitor of 17 years standing prior to him ceasing practice in January 2007. At
                    all material times, he was the sole proprietor of KK Yap &amp; Partners. As
                    stated at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, Asprez was set up by Ben
                    Tan on the instruction of the third respondent with the aim of using it to
                    obtain referral of conveyancing legal work from real estate agents for
                    consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     From June 2004 to August 2006, using funds
                    provided by the third respondent and/or his firm, Asprez paid sums of
                    approximately $200 to various unidentified real estate agents for each file
                    and/or client referred to Asprez. Such work and/or client were, in turn,
                    referred to the third respondent and/or his firm. Plainly, the payments made
                    were referral fees provided by the third respondent and/or his firm to the said
                    estate agents in consideration of work and/or clients referred to him and/or his

                    March 2006, the third respondent and/or his firm paid Asprez a sum of $410,000
                    in respect of the referrals of conveyancing work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As noted in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>, <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> and <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above, the first, second and third
                    respondents pleaded guilty to the respective charges proceeded against them. We
                    now turn to the appropriate sanction that should be imposed on the four
                    respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submission on the appropriate sanctions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In this regard, we will first refer to the
                    mitigating factors highlighted by counsel for each of the
                respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     His counsel underscored the fact that the
                    first respondent was a first time offender who demonstrated contrition by
                    pleading guilty at the first available opportunity. In addition, the first
                    respondent submitted that he was not the perpetrator of the agreement between
                    him and/or his law firm and Asprez. Instead, he was approached by David Foo who
                    mooted the idea of liaising with Asprez. The first respondent also submitted
                    that his act of terminating the agreement with Asprez was a clear demonstration
                    of his genuine remorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The second respondent pointed out that he ran
                    foul of the professional rules as a result of being solicited by Ben Tan of
                    Asprez. In any event, he was truly remorseful for his conduct and this was
                    evidenced by his terminating the agreement with Asprez even before CPIB
                    commenced investigations. In support of his submission that he was of good
                    character, the second respondent provided evidence of voluntary services
                    rendered to several organisations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The third respondent contended that all three
                    charges against him were essentially based upon the same conduct complained of.
                    As such, he submitted that this court should not enhance his punishment based on
                    the number of charges he faced. In this regard, he argued that all three charges
                    were really different ways of complaining about the same conduct. In support of
                    this contention, the third respondent relied on the case of <em>Law Society of Hong Kong v Solicitor</em> [2009] HKEC 271 where the
                    Hong Kong Court of Appeal stated at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Where, as here, the tribunal’s disapproval is of a course
                        of conduct over a period of time, it is inappropriate and unsatisfactory, to
                        say the least, to frame the complaint as two separate complaints by
                        artificially isolating the beginning and the end of that course of conduct
                        and in making those the subject matter of two separate complaints. Rather,
                        it should have focused on the overall course of conduct and have made that
                        the subject matter of the complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In this regard, we ought to mention that
                    s 40 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed)
                    (“Interpretation Act”) which applies only to the commission of
                    criminal offences, although not referred to by the third respondent, is
                    nevertheless germane as disciplinary proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature
                    which could lead to the imposition of punitive sanction(s). That section
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Provision as to offences under 2 or more
                            laws</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    Where any act or omission constitutes an
                            offence under 2 or more written laws, the offender shall, unless
                            the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and
                            punished under any one of those written laws but shall not be
                            liable to be punished twice for the same offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The statutory predecessor of s 40 of the
                    Interpretation Act, <em>ie</em>, s 41 of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1985 Rev Ed), was considered in the case of
                        <em>Tan Khee Koon v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 404 (“<em>Tan Khee
                    Koon</em>”). In that case, the appellant was tried and convicted on
                    a charge of having attempted to corruptly receive gratification of $20,000, as
                    well as on a separate charge of having received gratification amounting to
                    approximately $5,260. In respect of the latter charge, the evidence revealed
                    that out of the sum of $5,260, $4,500 was actually in part payment of the sum of
                    $20,000 which the appellant attempted to receive. The question then was whether
                    there was “double counting” in respect of the charge for having
                    received $4,500, and the attempt to receive $20,000. The court ruled in the
                    affirmative. The reasoning of the court, at [104] – [109], was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104    The Prosecution's
                            argument was that s 41[of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1,
                            1985 Rev Ed)] did not assist at all as it deals with two or more
                            written laws. On the contrary, it must follow, <em>a
                                fortiori</em>, that the prohibition must apply where the
                            offences are under the same written laws. It was noted by the
                            Prosecution correctly though that the effect of the provision is that
                            while the same set of facts may establish liability under two or more
                            written laws, there cannot be double punishment for the same
                            offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105    The term "same
                            offence" was dealt with in <em>Jamali bin Adnan v
                                PP</em> [1986] 1 MLJ 162, where it was considered by
                            Seah SCJ that whether two or more offences were the same offence entails
                            the existence of the same essential ingredients. Regard must be had to
                            the ingredients of attempt and commission to determine whether they are
                            essentially the same. While it is possible to find similarities in the
                            elements, a substantive difference is that an attempt necessarily lacks
                            some part of the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em>. It is possible then to say that attempts and
                            commissions are separate offences. This may be construing the phrase
                            "same offence" all too narrowly, but an alternative reasoning will be
                            applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106    Though the
                            ingredients of attempt and commission may differ and the <em>Jamali bin Adnan</em> test may not be satisfied, the
                            charges preferred are still defective, as attempt and commission are
                            mutually exclusive, that is that an act cannot be both an attempt as
                            well as a commission of a particular
                            offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">107    No definition is
                            given in the Act or the Penal Code of what constitutes an attempt. In
                            the context of s 511 of the Malaysian Penal Code, <em>in </em><em>pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 511 of our code, it was said
                            by Ajaib Singh J in <em>Thiangiah v PP</em>
                            [1977] 1 MLJ 79 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Stephen's time-honoured definition of an attempt is valid and strong
                            as ever today: An attempt to commit a crime is an act done with intent
                            to commit that crime, and forming part of a series of acts, which would
                            constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">108    From this definition, it is evident that a
                            criminal act is no longer an attempt when it completes the commission of
                            an offence. The same definition would apply to s 6(<em>a</em>). A single transaction cannot be both an
                            attempt and a commission. Similarly neither could a single act be both
                            an agreement to accept and acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">109    Attempts and commissions thus cannot overlap. A
                            person who attempts to commit murder logically cannot be charged with
                            murder as well. Either he completed the act or he did not. There can be
                            no intermediate state. It may be argued that provisions of the CPC
                            actually recognise the possibility that attempts and commissions may be
                            charged separately. Such an argument is seen to be misconceived once the
                            provisions are examined closely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     An analysis of the three charges against the
                    third respondent (at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) reveals
                    certain common elements. The gravamen of the first charge was that the third
                    respondent made payments amounting to $200 for each file which was referred to
                    him by real estate agents <em>via</em> Asprez in the period
                    from June 2004 to August 2006. As for the second charge, the third respondent
                    was charged for having procured or attempting to procure legal business through
                    Asprez by paying a sum of $410,000 from October 2005 to March 2006, with the
                    emphasis being on procurement of legal business through payment incentive.
                    Finally, in respect of the third charge, the third respondent was charged with
                    having made arrangements to reward Asprez with $410,000 for referring legal
                    business to him or his firm from October 2005 to March 2006, with the emphasis
                    being on making arrangements to obtain legal work through monetary
                    incentive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It would be apparent that the elements of the
                    second and third charges are very similar, <em>ie</em>, to
                    obtain legal work by the payment or offer of monetary incentive. The conduct of
                    the third respondent which was the basis of the first charge against him could
                    be regarded as the follow-up to the acts which formed the basis for the second
                    and third charges. What the principle in <em>Tan
                        </em><em>Khee Koon</em> prohibits is the charging
                    of a person for having arranged (or attempted) to cheat the victim <em>and</em> (emphasis added) the actual act of cheating itself.
                    While it would appear that the second and third charges were distinct from that
                    of the first charge, it is clear that, following the spirit of the principle
                    enunciated in <em>Tan Khee Koon</em>, the real wrongdoing
                    of the third respondent in respect of all three charges was in sharing legal
                    fees earned with someone who was not entitled to enjoy any portion of the fees.
                    Thus in determining the appropriate punishment, the number of charges brought
                    against an advocate and solicitor in such circumstances should not be given much
                    weight. Instead, the relevant factors would be, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the period during which the wrongdoing was carried out and
                    the quantum of the fees shared with someone who was not entitled to receive
                    those fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     We pause, at this juncture, to observe that
                    the same principle (discussed at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above) applies equally to the charges
                    against the fourth respondent. The first charge against the fourth respondent
                    was for having procured employment for himself and/or his firm through Asprez by
                    paying $33,850 for the period February 2006 to August 2006. The second charge
                    was for having rewarded Asprez with the same sum of money over the same period
                    for referring clients to him and/or his firm. These two charges were based on
                    the same wrongdoing, the difference being that each charge emphasised a
                    different aspect of the wrongdoing. The acts of procuring legal business through
                    paying Asprez and rewarding Asprez through payment for referrals were
                    essentially the same acts. Thus we accepted the submission that the fourth
                    respondent should not be punished as if he had committed two separate offences.
                    At this juncture, we would observe that the practice of preferring multiple
                    charges based upon the same misconduct should be eschewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In addressing the court on the appropriate
                    sentence, the third respondent submitted that he was remorseful and highlighted
                    the fact that he had voluntarily ceased practise since January 2007, soon after
                    CPIB sought his assistance in its investigations. His departure from KK Yap
                    &amp; Partners was premised on his desire not to compromise the reputation of
                    the firm. He left the legal profession in January 2007 as he did not wish to
                    enhance the “risk of embarrassing the profession” arising from the
                    present wrongdoing. The third respondent submitted that he was really contrite
                    and thus did not challenge the allegations at the inquiry stage before the
                    Inquiry Committee and pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him by the
                    Law Society before the DT. He did not file any defence either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the significance of his voluntary act of
                    ceasing practice since January 2007, which amounted to a “four year
                    suspension”, he relied upon the case of <em>Law Society of
                        Singapore v Tan Chwee Wan Allan</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 699
                        (“<em>Allan Tan</em>”) in support of the
                    argument that his voluntary cessation of legal practise constituted a weighty
                    mitigating factor. In <em>Allan Tan</em>, this court stated
                    at [51]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We also noted that the respondent had voluntarily left practice for over
                        two years after he was informed of his breaches of the SA Rules [<em>ie</em>, Legal Profession (Solicitors' Accounts) Rules
                        (Cap 161, R 8, 1999 Rev Ed)]. This would have been an extremely
                        lucrative and profitable period of practice for a conveyancing solicitor.
                        According to counsel for the respondent, Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair
                        (“Mr Mohan”), for a solicitor with a standing of about 15
                        years, leaving practice for two years was a drastic self-imposed punishment.
                        Mr Mohan added that his client was extremely remorseful and that the
                        disciplinary proceedings had taken a severe toll on the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Lastly, the third respondent made the point
                    that he was of good character, and that his offending conduct did not compromise
                    his clients’ interests in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In mitigation, after this court had made its
                    determination on the finding of guilt, counsel for the fourth respondent
                    submitted that the latter was of good character, and that he was remorseful for
                    having committed the offences. In addition, the fourth respondent strongly
                    asserted that there was little public interest in imposing a suspension of a
                    protracted period due to the shortage of lawyers in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In considering the appropriate sanctions, we
                    would refer to two previous cases where similar wrongdoings, albeit of a wholly
                    different magnitude, were committed, <em>ie, Law Society of
                        Singapore v Tan Buck Chye Dave</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 581
                        (“<em>Tan Buck Chye Dave</em>”) and
                        <em>Phyllis Tan.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In <em>Tan Buck Chye
                        Dave</em>, the respondent, who pleaded guilty to three charges under
                        s 83(2)(<em>e</em>) of the Legal Profession Act
                    (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the LPA”), attempted to procure
                    employment in respect of conveyancing matters by offering to pay varying sums of
                    money to estate agents. This court, in imposing a suspension of 6 months, stated
                    (at [31] of <em>Tan Buck
                        Chye Dave</em>) that “there were strong mitigating factors in
                    the present case. If they had not been present, we would have been compelled to
                    impose an even more severe sanction on the respondent.” The mitigating
                    factors referred to by the court were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     None of the conveyancing
                        transactions (tainted by payment of referral fees) were actually completed
                        (at [19] of <em>Tan
                            Buck Chye Dave</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     The respondent’s inability to complete the
                        conveyancing transactions was due to his own volition (at [20] of <em>Tan Buck Chye
                            Dave</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     The respondent pleaded guilty at the first opportunity (at [22] of <em>Tan Buck Chye
                            Dave</em>); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was no proven dishonesty on the part of the
                        respondent (at [23] of <em>Tan Buck Chye Dave</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The factor stated at (b) above warrants
                    elaboration. The respondent there was approached by an entrapping investigative
                    agency which sought to know what the respondent would be willing to offer the
                    former for introducing clients to the latter. The entrapping agency and the
                    respondent struck an agreement under which for every conveyancing business
                    referred, the respondent would pay the entrapping agency $200 per deal. After
                    the agreement was reached, the respondent did not follow up on the agreement at
                    all by contacting the entrapping agent. It was through this voluntary omission
                    on the part of the respondent that no conveyancing deals were actually done
                    under the offending arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It was quite clear that <em>Tan
                        Buck Chye Dave</em> represented a case in which the respondent was
                    contrite soon after the arrangement was reached. He was guilty of an attempt to
                    commit the offence and the only reason why he did not carry out what was agreed
                    upon was his belated sense of realisation that what he had agreed to do was
                    wrong. The conduct of the respondent in <em>Tan Buck Chye
                        Dave</em> represented culpability at the lower end of the
                    scale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The respondent in <em>Phyllis
                        Tan</em>, on the other hand, was preferred with one charge for
                    professional misconduct under s 83(2)(<em>e</em>) and
                    an alternative charge under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the
                    LPA for attempting to procure employment in respect of a conveyancing matter by
                    offering remuneration in the form of a gift voucher worth $200
                        (see [2] of <em>Phyllis Tan</em>). The respondent contested the charges but was
                    eventually found guilty of both the main and alternative charges. The respondent
                    was suspended for a period of 15 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the appropriate punishments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     We must, at this juncture, observe that the
                    misconduct committed by the four respondents in these proceedings involved the
                    most severe of illicit referral agreements that have been dealt with by this
                    court. Previous cases involving similar misconduct paled in comparison with the
                    pecuniary magnitude of the offending conduct of the four respondents. The
                    systematic manner in which referrals were obtained by the four respondents in
                    the present cases, <em>via</em> Asprez, was also
                    unprecedented and audacious, as compared to the previous cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Quite clearly, all four respondents should be
                    punished with sanctions far exceeding those imposed in <em>Tan
                        Buck Chye Dave</em> and <em>Phyllis Tan</em>.
                    Save for the pleas of guilt of the first to third respondents, the mitigating
                    factors present in <em>Tan Buck Chye Dave</em> (at
                        <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above]), which this court gave much
                    weight to, were absent in respect of the four respondents. The four
                    respondents’ offending conduct emanated from pure avarice, and extended
                    over protracted periods of time. Their misconduct was systematic, involving
                    large number of referrals and significant sums of money, unlike that of an
                    isolated misconduct involved in <em>Phyllis
                    Tan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first and second respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The culpabilities and mitigating factors of
                    the first and second respondents were largely similar notwithstanding the
                    differences in the period during which the offending conduct was carried out and
                    the sums involved. The first respondent paid remuneration amounting to $157,900
                    over a period of approximately 9 months, whilst the second respondent paid the
                    sum of $79,400 over a period of approximately 15 months. Evidently, the first
                    respondent had paid a larger sum of money over a shorter period of time as
                    compared to the second respondent. The mitigating factors put forth by counsel
                    (at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above]) for both respondents also did
                    not differ substantially.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Bearing in mind that for an isolated act of
                    misconduct in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> a penalty of 15 months
                    suspension was imposed, it must follow that a much more severe penalty should be
                    imposed on the first and second respondents. In our judgment, doubling the
                    period of suspension imposed in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> for
                    both these two respondents would be amply warranted and we accordingly so
                    ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Law Society recognised that the third
                    respondent should receive a heavier sentence than the first and second
                    respondents. In this regard, the Law Society highlighted the fact that the third
                    respondent was the brain which hatched this scheme of paying estate agents in
                    return for referral of conveyancing work to listed legal firms and who, for the
                    purpose of implementing that scheme, created the entity, Asprez. Secondly, the
                    Law Society underscored the fact that, unlike the first and second respondents,
                    the third respondent had previously been involved in disciplinary proceedings
                    for similar offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>The Law Society of
                        Singapore v Ong Poh </em><em>Pway Lina and
                        Another</em> [2002] SGDSC 1, the third respondent and his partner
                    offered to refund half of the legal fees paid by the owners of a collective sale
                    of residential units in Phoenix Mansion if such owners were to engage them to
                    act in the purchase of a new property within 6 months from completion. The
                    Disciplinary Committee found that no cause of sufficient gravity existed for
                    disciplinary action.  The third respondent and his partner were each
                    reprimanded pursuant to s 93(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    LPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In <em>The Law Society v Yap
                        Kok Kiong</em> [2006] SGDSC 14, the third respondent pleaded guilty to
                    a charge under s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the LPA for
                    having “engaged in the practice of giving rewards in the form of gift
                    vouchers to real estate agents who referred clients and business to M/S K K Yap
                    &amp; Partners”. The Disciplinary Committee found that no cause of
                    sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed and the third respondent was
                    again reprimanded by the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We agreed with the submission of counsel for
                    the Law Society that the third respondent’s culpability far exceeded that
                    of the other three respondents. We noted that not only had he previously been
                    reprimanded for similar misconduct, and never seemed to have learned, he had in
                    the present case gone from bad to worse, by conjuring an illicit business model
                    – by orchestrating the setting up of Asprez – and committing the
                    same misconduct on a larger scale and in the process, encouraging and
                    facilitating the other three respondents to commit the same misconduct. In
                    short, he was the mastermind and the villain, and seemed to us to be
                    incorrigible. In the circumstances, and in the interest of upholding the
                    integrity of the profession, we felt that he ought to be struck off the Roll and
                    we so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The fourth respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In determining the appropriate penalty to be
                    imposed on the fourth respondent, we noted that unlike the other respondents,
                    the fourth respondent did not admit to the charges but claimed trial. However,
                    we also noted that the amount which he had paid to the estate agent was the
                    smallest among the four respondents which would necessarily mean that he had
                    received the least number of referrals from the estate agents. Moreover, the
                    period of his involvement in the scheme was also the shortest among the four
                    respondents. Notably, his challenge based on the inadmissibility of part of the
                    Law Society’s evidence (at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above), was not entirely without
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     All considered, we felt that imposing on him a
                    similar penalty as that imposed on the first and second respondents would not be
                    inappropriate, because while he had (unlike the first and second respondents)
                    claimed trial and had taken a technical objection against the Law
                    Society’s case (though as stated not without merit), this had to be
                    balanced against the fact that he received the least number of referrals and was
                    involved in the scheme for the shortest period.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third respondent’s argument on costs for the present
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Finally, we will address an argument raised by
                    the third respondent where he contended that no order on costs should be made
                    against him in relation to the present proceedings. He submitted that the Law
                    Society should not have referred this matter to the court of three Judges, it
                    being superfluous, as he had given an undertaking not to practise for 5 years
                    (“the Undertaking”). At the hearing before the DT, the third
                    respondent stated that he was willing to furnish the Undertaking to the Law
                    Society and the DT, as well as pay a penalty of $20,000 as evidence of his
                    remorse. The third respondent contended that the Undertaking, if accepted, would
                    have fulfilled the sentencing aims as advanced by the Law Society, <em>viz</em>, protection of the public, and the third respondent
                    would also have been punished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In response to this argument, the Law Society
                    averred that, based on s 93 of the Act, the DT “simply did not have
                    the power to accept and give effect to the third respondent’s
                    Undertaking.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     It was abundantly clear that this argument of
                    the third respondent is wholly without merit. It showed a lack of understanding
                    of the disciplinary process under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The disciplinary process under the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     After hearing a matter referred to it, the DT
                    can, in conclusion, only make one of three findings as provided for in s 93
                    of the Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        determine that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    no cause of sufficient gravity

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    while no cause of sufficient gravity for
                            disciplinary action exists under that section, the advocate and
                            solicitor should be reprimanded or ordered to pay a penalty sufficient
                            and appropriate to the misconduct committed; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    cause of sufficient gravity for
                            disciplinary action exists under that section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Upon the DT’s finding that cause of
                    sufficient gravity exists pursuant to s 93(c) above, s 94 of the Act
                    requires the Law Society to make an application under s 98 of the Act.
                    Section 94 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94.—(1) If the determination of the Disciplinary Tribunal

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an
                            advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member
                            of an honourable profession;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The crux of the third respondent’s
                    argument was that the DT should have accepted the Undertaking and made a finding
                    under s 93(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act that
                    “while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists
                    under that section, the advocate and solicitor should be reprimanded or ordered
                    to pay a penalty sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed”.
                    In our opinion, this argument distorts the statutory duty of the DT under
                    s 93(1) of the Act which requires the DT to consider all the circumstances
                    of the case and make a determination accordingly. The effect of the third
                    respondent’s argument amounts to saying that the DT should not have made a
                    determination that a cause of sufficient gravity existed when the evidence
                    clearly justified the making of such a determination and for the case to proceed
                    further before the court of three Judges to be dealt with under s 83(1) of
                    the Act. The third respondent’s argument would subvert the disciplinary
                    process under the Act and consequently usurp the jurisdiction of the court of
                    three Judges to impose the appropriate punishment for the misconduct in
                    question: see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani
                        d/o Daniel</em> [2010] 3 SLR 390 (“<em>Jasmine Gowrimani</em>”) at [24] and [26]. The
                    argument is wholly without merit and seems to be premised upon the untenable
                    assumption that this court would only impose a punishment of a 5 year suspension
                    and a penalty of $20,000 on the third respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     We therefore rejected the argument and held
                    that the costs of the Law Society in the present proceedings be borne by all the
                    four respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     We reiterate our view in <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above that the misconduct on the part of the
                    four respondents was most severe in terms of scale and magnitude as compared to
                    those which have been previously dealt with by this court. In the light of all
                    the relevant circumstances, we ordered that the first, second and fourth
                    respondents be suspended for a period of 30 months and that the third respondent
                    be struck of the roll.</p>
