<strong>
<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><font color="#800000"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        On 12 July 2002, the

Plaintiffs, Guan Chong Cocoa Manufacturer Sdn Bhd commenced in personam action against

shipowners, Pratiwi Shipping S.A., a Panamanian company, claiming damages for loss of

and/or damage to two consignments (with a total gross weight of approximately 609 mt) of

Sulawesi cocoa beans in bags lately laden on board the vessel "PRATIWI" pursuant

to bills of lading nos. 01/PRT/PL/VII/01 and 02/PRT/PL/VII/01 both dated 13 July 2001 at

Palu. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        The Plaintiffs, as cargo

interests, sued the Defendants, Pratiwi Shipping S.A., for breach of contracts of carriage

evidenced by the two bills of lading, breach of duty as bailees of the cocoa beans and/or

negligence of the Defendants, their servants or agents in or about the carriage, custody

and care of the two consignments of cocoa beans.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        The Plaintiffs’ claim

arose as a consequence of a fire on board the "PRATIWI" which started in the

engine room on or about 17 July 2001 during the voyage from Pantoloan, Palu, Indonesia to

Pasir Gudang, Malaysia. The "PRATIWI" was towed to Banjarmasin, Indonesia where

the bags of cocoa beans were discharged. The "PRATIWI" was a constructive total

loss and was eventually sold for S$50,000. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        Since the Defendants

abandoned the voyage at Banjarmasin, the two consignments of cocoa beans were forwarded to

Pasir Gudang on another vessel "SUN RAY". The damaged cocoa beans were

eventually disposed in a salvage sale. The Plaintiffs’ loss is computed at

$904,164.22 plus interest and costs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        On 29 July 2002, the

Plaintiffs applied for a worldwide mareva injunction to freeze the assets of the

Defendants within and outside Singapore up to the value of the Plaintiffs’ claim of

$904,164.22 plus costs. The assets sought to be injuncted included the hull proceeds of

the "PRATIWI", the net sale proceeds of "PRATIWI", the vessel

"LANGSA" or if sold, the net sale proceeds after payment of any mortgage. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        M/s Kenneth Tan

Partnership ("KTP") was appointed in June 2002 to represent the Defendants and

their liability insurers, China Insurance Co Limited. M/s Chui, Sim, Goh &amp; Lim

("CSGL") represented the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        On 30 July 2002, counsel

for both the Plaintiffs and Defendants attended before Justice Lai Kew Chai. The

Plaintiffs obtained leave to serve the in personam Writ on Foong Sun Shipping (Pte) Ltd

("Foong Sun"), the managers of "PRATIWI". Justice Lai directed the

ex-parte application for a mareva injunction to be heard inter parte.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        I heard the application on

2 August 2002. It transpired during the course of the hearing that the vessel

"PRATIWI" had no hull and machinery insurance and her sister ship, the

"LANGSA", had been sold for US$150,000. The only asset, which could conceivable

be attached was the sale proceeds of the "LANGSA". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        It was not the

Defendants’ case nor was it suggested then that the sale of the "LANGSA"

was a sham. This could not be clearer than from CSGL’s letters dated 5 and 6 August

2002 requesting further arguments. In both letters, Counsel stated: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We are instructed to write under section 34(1)(c) of the Supreme

    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and Order 56 rule 2 of Rules of Court for further

    arguments in respect of the Plaintiffs’ application for mareva injunction in

    connection with the sale proceeds of the motor vessel "LANGSA" only. "</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        I dismissed the

Plaintiffs’ application. The Plaintiffs, being dissatisfied with my decision, filed

Notice of Appeal on 19 August 2002. I now publish my reasons for dismissing the

application.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Affidavits</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        The Plaintiffs’

filed one affidavit in support of the application. This was the affidavit of Hia Cheng

filed on 29 July 2002. Hia Cheng is the Finance &amp; Trading manager of the Plaintiffs.

The Defendants filed one affidavit to oppose the application. On 2 August 2002, Elaine

Quek Ee Ling ("Elaine") affirmed an affidavit on behalf of the Defendants.

Elaine is the manager of Foong Sun.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        On 5 and 6 August 2002,

the Plaintiffs filed two other affidavits. Those two affidavits were sworn by the

Plaintiffs’ counsel, Lawrence Lee, in support of the Plaintiffs’ application for

further arguments. The Defendants naturally objected to their use as they were filed

without leave and after I had dismissed the application. For completeness, I should

mention that I declined to hear further arguments.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Plaintiffs’ case</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        In this interlocutory

application, the Defendants did not touch on the Plaintiffs’ assertion that they have

"a good arguable case", prefering to resist the application on the ground that

the Plaintiffs have not establised any risk of dissipation of assets. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        It was said on behalf of

the Plaintiffs that a risk of dissipation of the assets is to be inferred from the

following facts:</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(i) the Defendants became a one-ship company after "PRATIWI"

was sold. The Defendants subsequently sold their only asset "LANGSA". The

Defendants appeared to be no longer in business.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(ii) the timing of the sale of the "LANGSA". The sale was on

22 June 2002 after the Defendants were informed that the Plaintiffs’ cargo

underwriters had repudiated liability and after M/s Zaid Ibrahim &amp; Partners and CSGL

had written to the Defendants and China Insurance demanding payment of the claim. The

Plaintiffs had earlier informed Foong Sun that they would claim from their cargo

underwriters.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(iii) the length of time the Defendants have been in business. The

Defendants appeared to have started business from early 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(iv) Asset to be attached is the sale proceeds, which by its very

nature is easily dissipated. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(v) The Defendants are not incorporated in a country where a Singapore

judgment may be registered. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(vi) The Defendants’ liability cover is for S$500,000 and the

Plaintiffs’ claim is for S$904,164.22.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The Defendants’ case</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        Elaine denied the

Plaintiffs’ accusation that the Defendants were "trying to hide their

assets". The Defendants had in the past on numerous occasions shipped cargo on board

the "LANGSA". The "PRATIWI" and "LANGSA" used to ply

regularly between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. She was perplexed to see Hia

Cheng’s statement that the Plaintiffs did not know until July 2002 that the

Defendants also owned the "LANGSA". The Plaintiffs’ lawyers had ascertained

the ownership of "LANGSA" from Lloyds’ Register. It was wrong to state that

it was not easy to trace the ownership of "LANGSA" to the Defendants. The

insinuation that the Defendants carry on business in an elusive manner was baseless. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        I should mention that

this business relationship with Foong Sun appeared more than cordial as the Plaintiffs

were able to discreetly obtain from Foong Sun’s staff, information such as (i)

"PRATIWI" had no hull cover and (ii) the "LANGSA" had changed name to

"SRI BAHARI". The "SRI BAHARI" is managed by Foong Sun and the

Plaintiffs in July 2002 had shipped cargo on board that vessel. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        Elaine said in paragraph

18 of her affidavit that the "LANGSA" was sold to an Indonesian concern PT Fajar

Sribahari Sakti for US$ 150,000. The Bill of Sale was dated 22 June 2002.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Decision</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        The Plaintiffs’

application is to attach assets belonging to the Defendants within and outside the

jurisdiction. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        In <i>SSAB Oxelosund AB v

Xendral Trading Pte Ltd</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 600</nobr>, the defendants successfully set aside the

ex-parte order prohibiting the defendants, their servants or agents from disposing the

hull proceeds following the sinking of the vessel "PROTEKTOR" with her cargo on

board in severe weather. Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she then was) held that a worldwide mareva

injunction order is a draconian measure to be ordered only in exceptional circumstances.

See also <i>Wallace Kevin James v Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd</i> <nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 785</nobr> at 793 and <i>Republic of Haiti &amp; Ors v Duvalier &amp; Ors</i> [1990] 1QB 202 at

215. The situation must be so exceptional as to "cry out" as a matter of justice

to the plaintiffs for an order covering foreign assets of the defendants before judgment:

Kerr LJ in <i>Babanaft International Co SA v Bassatne</i> [1990] Ch 13 at 33</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        In my view, the facts in

evidence relied upon by the Plaintiffs do not even satisfy the test for a mareva

injunction of assets within Singapore let alone an order to attach assets outside the

jurisdiction where a more stringent test is demanded. A plaintiff seeking to freeze assets

within the jurisdiction must as a pre-condition to the grant of the injunction adduce

"solid evidence" of a risk of dissipation: <i>Choy Chee Keen Collin v Public

Utilities Board</i> <nobr>[1997] 1 SLR 604</nobr>; <i>Petromar Energy Resources Pte Ltd v Glencore

International AG</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 609</nobr>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        I was not persuaded by

the Plaintiffs that on the affidavit evidence taken as a whole the behaviour of the

Defendants was such as to seek to frustrate, or was in a way designed or calculated to

frustrate a judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        It is true that the

Defendants became a one-ship company after the "PRATIWI" was sold. It is

generally an accepted way of ship owning and doing business in the shipping world. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she

then was) in <i>SSAB Oxelosund AB v Xendral Trading Pte Ltd</i> at p 607 observed that

one-ship company "is a norm rather than an exception in the shipowing industry".

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        Again, Amarjeet JC In <i>The

Skaw Prince</i> <nobr>[1994] 3 SLR 379</nobr> at p 386 said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is well known that businesses engaged in shipping set up and

    utilize one-ship companies within their corporate structure for the purpose of limiting

    liability. The device has been around and recognized by the courts as a legitimate one

    .."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        Chan Sek Keong J in <i>European

Grain &amp; Shipping Ltd Compania Naviera Euro-Asia SA &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1990] 2 MLJ 291</nobr> at

294 commented:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">".. There was nothing wrong, from a commercial stand point of

    view, for SSC from carrying on its business through Panamanian companies; this was a

    normal method of carrying on shipping business and, in my view did not imply dishonesty or

    craftiness(in its derogatory sense) on the part of the directors or shareholders." </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In that case, SSC was a substantial company and the way it carried on

business did not cast suspicion in the Judge’s mind as to the bona fides of the SSC

group in the way it had carried on its businesses. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        The Defendants are a

company incorporated in Panama. The very fact of incorporation there might have resulted

in an adverse inference being drawn against such entities in some cases. But in the

present case, there exists other evidence that tended to countermand or mitigate the

negative effect of a Panamanian incorporated company. It cannot be said that the

Defendants before and after the casualty had been elusive in the way they did business and

held assets.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        The Defendants have

business presence here through managers, Foong Sun. They had properly insured against

liability arising from their activities as shipowners and carriers well before the

casualty and their liability insurers, China Insurance Limited, carry on business in

Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        I agree with the

Defendants’ contention that if indeed the Defendants were attempting to make

themselves judgment proof, they would have sold the "LANGSA" shortly after the

fire instead of waiting for almost a year. In the course of the year, prior to 22 June

2002, the Defendants continued to do business with their remaining vessel

"LANGSA".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        Hia Cheng in his

affidavit asserts that there was an ownership change and change of name of the

"LANGSA" to "SRI BAHARI". Elaine in her affidavit confirmed the sale

of "LANGSA" on 22 June 2002. She deposed that the Defendants have not yet

received the sale proceeds of US$150,000 from the buyers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        I should mention that the

acknowledgement of receipt of the sale proceeds on the standard form Bill of Sale was

inconsistent with Elaine Quek’s evidence. This apparent discrepancy was not lost on

Counsel for the Plaintiffs. However, he submitted that he was not taking issue with this

inconsistency, preferring to accept the evidence that the proceeds of sale have not yet

been paid.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        Counsel for the

Plaintiffs in his letter dated 8 August 2002 for further arguments, however questioned

whether the sale of "LANGSA" was an attempt to dissipate the Defendants’

asset. He argued that the sale of "LANGSA" could not have been in the

"ordinary and proper course of business". Having regard to the timing of the

sale and no explanation being afforded for the sale. The Bill of Sale was signed by Elaine

for the Defendants and "SRI BAHARI" is now managed by Foong Sun. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        I do not agree with

Counsel’s contention. If that were so, I see no reason for Elaine to disclose in her

affidavit that the sale proceeds have not yet been paid. It would have been easy enough

and consistent with nefarious conduct to rely on the acknowledgement of receipt in the

Bill of Sale, which would have left the Defendants with no known asset and the Plaintiffs

no chance to attach intact the sale proceeds of US$150,000. Elaine’s disclosure is

contrary to any manifest intention to avoid a judgment in the Plaintiffs’ favour. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        It was said that the sale

took place after the Plaintiffs’ lawyers came on the scene and demanded payment of

the claim. The Defendants were aware that the Plaintiffs would be claiming under their

cargo policy. They were also subsequently aware that cargo underwriters had repudiated

policy liability in April 2002 and the Plaintiffs would therefore be looking to the

Defendants for compensation. I cannot see how from those facts an inference can be drawn

that the Defendants had rid themselves of their only asset the "LANGSA" to

render themselves judgment proof. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        The Defendants would

inevitably be faced with a suit regardless of whether or not cargo underwriters paid under

the cargo policy. The only difference is that if cargo underwriters paid on the claim, the

latter would be pursuing a recovery action by way of subrogation. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        What is obvious is that

neither cargo underwriters nor their insured took steps immediately after the casualty to

enhance their recovery prospects. Ordinarily, whenever there is a shipping casualty of

this kind, a pre-emptive strike would invariable have been taken in early days by cargo

underwriters (albeit without prejudice to policy liability) with the cooperation of the

insured for mutual benefit. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        The Defendants were aware

at the outset that the Plaintiffs had held them responsible for the damage to the cocoa

beans. Foong Sun had denied liability on behalf of the Defendants. In October 2001, Foong

Sun disclosed to cargo surveyors, McLarens Toplis International Loss Adjusters, that the

Defendants are insured with China Insurance for shipowner’s liability as carrier

under Hague/Hague-Visby Rules up to a maximum sum of S$500,000 for any one accident. Foong

Sun even provided the Plaintiffs with a copy of the cover note in June 2002. The cargo

liability cover is subject to a deductible of $10,000 for each and every claim. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        Hia Cheng in paragraph 18

of his affidavit deposed that Tey How Keong of the Plaintiffs had in early 2002 informed

Elaine that the Plaintiffs intended to seek compensation from Foong Sun. On 16 May 2002,

the Plaintiffs’ Malaysian lawyers, Zaid Ibrahim &amp; Co, wrote to China Insurance to

claim RM 1,948,253.08. China Insurance sent on 14 June 2002 a standard reply stating that

they were looking into the matter. On 18 June 2002, KTP on instructions of China Insurance

wrote to the Malaysian lawyers denying liability. They advised that under Art IV R2(b) of

Hague–Visby Rules, the carrier would have a complete defence to the cargo claim. The

Plaintiffs were invited to withdraw their claim. On the same date, CSGL wrote to the

Defendants c/o Foong Sun. They demanded payment of RM1,948,253.08 by 21 June 2002 failing

which legal action would be taken. KTP repeated the Defendants’ defence to the

Plaintiffs’ claim. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        CSGL disagreed with KTP

and told them so on 20 June 2002. They advised that the Plaintiffs intended to press on

with their claim unless the Defendants admitted liability and pay RM1,948,253.08. In the

same letter, they requested details of the Defendants such as place of incorporation,

address and assets.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        Hia Cheng complained in

his affidavit that the Defendants were being deliberately evasive about disclosing their

registered address and assets. It would be nave to expect the Defendants to willingly

respond to the request knowing as KTP did that the Plaintiffs were making the inquiries

with a particular objective in mind. KTP were not wrong. It was admitted in CSGL’s

letter of 8 August 2002 that the information requested was to support the application for

mareva injunction. Of course, if the Plaintiffs had on Hia Cheng’s affidavit

established a prima facie inference of a risk of dissipation, the Defendants would have to

adduce rebuttal evidence. Elaine’s response that they were advised that they were not

under a legal obligation to assist would not have been good enough. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        There is no cogent

evidence that the sale of the "LANGSA" was a sham. This is obvious from

CSGL’s letter dated 6 August 2002 wherein they wanted to verify the sale by asking

for information concerning the relationship between the Defendants, their managers and

buyers of the "LANGSA". KTP pointed out in their letter of 7 August 2002 that

the Plaintiffs were simply fishing for information to test the genuineness of the sale and

perhaps with a view to proceedings against the "LANGSA" in rem. The Plaintiffs

had issued an in rem writ on 12 July 2002 against the "PRATIWI". The in rem writ

was amended on 16 July 2002 to include the vessel "LANGSA".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        It is probably true that

after the sale of the "LANGSA", the Defendants are no longer in business. It is

not an unreasonable inference. However, neither can it be said that the situation is bound

to be a permanent one. Although the Defendants did not specifically address this point,

there is evidence that the Defendants were minded to see an amicable resolution of the

matter, which in my view, went some way to neutralise the inference. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        Hia Cheng said in his

affidavit that Elaine’s preference was to settle the matter without legal

proceedings. But as it turned out the Plaintiffs’ instructed Malaysian and Singapore

lawyers to deal with the claim. In fact KTP on 26 July 2002 after commenting on the tenor

of CSGL’s letter of 26 July 2002 remarked: "..we assume that your fax of today

is not part of any attempts at an amicable resolution of this matter."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        There is also no evidence

that the Defendants’ liability insurers would not pay on the claim if liability

against the Defendants were established. In fact KTP are defending the claim on

instructions from China Insurance. The fact that the liability cover is less than the

Plaintiffs’ claim amount cannot merit the court granting a mareva injunction. It is

the sort of commercial risk any cargo interests in the position of the Plaintiffs would

face. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        For those reasons, I
