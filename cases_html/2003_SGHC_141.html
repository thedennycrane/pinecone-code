<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The First Defendants’ main contract with the Ministry of Defence for the project had a value of $23.5 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The First Defendants engaged the Plaintiffs to construct a three cell box culvert for a total of $423,000 based on unit rate measurement and to carry out temporary access works for $8,500.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> These works were independent of the other works in the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A performance bond for 10% of the contract sum amounting to $43,150 was obtained.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">4<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Under the first sub-contract, the Plaintiffs were to take possession of the site by 1 February 2000 and complete the works by 31 May 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> However, the First Defendants encountered delay in their own works, particularly the piling works undertaken by other sub-contractors which had to be completed before the Plaintiffs could carry out the box culvert works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Plaintiffs, in a letter dated 4 April 2000, informed the First Defendants they had completed the excavation works and were waiting for the First Defendants to complete the piling works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They also wrote to the First Defendants on 23 August 2000 to state that they had stopped their culvert works since 29 July 2000 due to the stoppage of piling works by the relevant sub-contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The First Defendants wrote to that sub-contractor the next day to note that piling works had ceased since 15 July 2000 and to instruct that the remaining 99 piles be completed before 11 September 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The letter also stated that they had received a complaint from the Plaintiffs on this matter.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> On 22 August 2000, the project’s architect granted the Plaintiffs an extension of 6 weeks after the completion of piling works to complete the box culvert works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The revised Master Programme dated 11 October 2000 showed the revised completion date for the box culvert works as 10 November 2000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The piling works were completed on 22 September 2000 and the box culvert works were completed satisfactorily in November 2000, within the time frame stipulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was no complaint by the First Defendants, MINDEF or the project’s consultants until the first performance bond was called upon on 3 January 2003, about 26 months later.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">7<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The second sub-contract pertained to road/road kerb works at the project for an estimated sum of $2 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The performance bond in question was for 10% of this amount, that is $200,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Plaintiffs were to take possession of the site forthwith and complete the works within five and a half months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Here again, there was delay in the First Defendants’ works – five to nine months at the various zones for their mechanical and electrical (M &amp; E) works and three to four months at the various zones for the drainage works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Many parts of the Plaintiffs’ road works could only commence after each stage of the First Defendants’ said works was completed or substantially completed. Due to such delay, the Master Programme was revised four times and the completion date for the Plaintiffs’ road works was re-scheduled to May 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">8<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The correspondence between the project’s architect, the First Defendants and their external electrical sub-contractor (Nylect Engineering Pte Ltd) showed that as at 25 July 2000, the external M &amp; E works were only 15% completed and as at 18 October 2000, 60% completed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In late December 2000, the First Defendants were still chasing Nylect and demanding that they proceed with their external electrical works so as not to delay the other works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In July 2001, changes were still being made to the external electrical works which disrupted the Plaintiffs’ completed road works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The project’s architect confirmed in a letter dated 7 February 2003 to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors that the liquidated damages deducted by MINDEF were in respect of the overall delay by the First Defendants and not in respect of specific items and that MINDEF took out works (such as the drainage and M &amp; E works) from the First Defendants as a result of the First Defendants’ delay in commencing works in accordance with the contract.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">9<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Despite the constraints on site, the Plaintiffs completed substantially all of the road works in June 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The laying of the last layer of premix could only be done upon the instructions of the First Defendants or their consultant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The other works were completed in December 2001 and the Plaintiffs laid the last layer of premix accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was evidenced by the Plaintiffs’ progress claims for July 2001 to January 2002 which showed that the only substantial difference between the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> claims for July 2001 and for January 2002 was in respect of work done for the laying of the last layer of premix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The external works were handed over by the First Defendants to MINDEF on 15 November 2001 and on 24 December 2001.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">10<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Plaintiffs’ final statement of account showed a sum of $376,944.99 as due and owing by the First Defendants to the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The First Defendants’ account on 22 August 2002 showed an alleged overpayment of $3,371.08 to the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was due to some $137,265 having been deducted as costs of removal of surplus earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The overpayment ballooned to $238,980 in the First Defendants’ account rendered five months later on 23 January 2003. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was due in part to the costs of removal of surplus earth having been increased to $287,838.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In addition, another $81,532 was deducted by the First Defendants for new items such as shoring work and late completion of box culvert works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">11<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Plaintiffs argued that this exercise of increasing the costs of removal of surplus earth and of including additional items was an after-thought and was ‘simply conjured up in (an) attempt to establish over-payment of $238,980 (which is suspiciously close to the total bond sum of $243,150 that was called)’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The correspondence from the Plaintiffs to the First Defendants complaining about the piles of earth on the site hindering their works showed that they were not responsible for the costs of removal of surplus earth deposited by the other sub-contractors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">12<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The First Defendants called on the first performance bond on 3 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Plaintiffs were informed a week later by the Second Defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This call was made some eleven months into the defects liability period which expired on 15 February 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was also more than two years after the completion of the box culvert works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The call on the second bond was made on 4 January 2003 with the Plaintiffs being informed by the Third Defendants on 10 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Again, this call was made some eleven months into the defects liability period and one year after completion of road/road kerb works.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">13<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The calls on the bonds were made in bad faith as the First Defendants were in serious financial difficulties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They had also called on the performance bond procured by Nylect Engineering Pte Ltd, their electrical sub-contractor in the same project, for payment of $310,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On 17 March 2003, Nylect obtained an injunction against the First Defendants in Suit 124 of 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The calls were made with the intention of using the money payable under the bonds to pay their creditors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">14<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> There were thirty seven actions commenced in the High Court and in the Subordinate Courts against the First Defendants in 2001 and in 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At least ten sub-contractors involved in the project in question have commenced action against the First Defendants, resulting in a winding-up petition which was subsequently withdrawn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Garnishee proceedings taken out by a creditor resulted in the recovery of only $3,900 from the First Defendants’ bank account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In the said ten suits, the First Defendants counterclaimed a total of $4.3 million in liquidated damages from their sub-contractors while the actual deduction made by MINDEF was only about $977,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> No details were given on how the liquidated damages were apportioned among the various sub-contractors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">15<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The First Defendants were inconsistent in the amount of liquidated damages that they sought to impose on the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> At first, it was $792,000 for purported delay from 1 October 2000 to 31 October 2001 in the second sub-contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Now, in their Counterclaim, they sought to impose $976,000 for purported delay from 1 October 2000 to 31 January 2002.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">16<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Similarly, the First Defendants did not explain how they computed their alleged costs of removal of surplus earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They continued to allege that piling works were within the Plaintiffs’ scope of works in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They first alleged this on 9 December 2002, one month before calling on the performance bonds.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">17<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> M &amp; E works were also not within the scope of works of the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The project’s architect, in a reply dated 7 February 2003 to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors, stated that ‘the employer has taken out other works from BKB such as the drainage works and M &amp; E works owing to BKB’s delay in commencing works in accordance with the contract’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> For better co-ordination, MINDEF also took back the Plaintiffs’ road works in some zones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> While that was done for six zones on 7 August 2000, the commencement date for the Plaintiffs’ road works was 21 September 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When MINDEF took back the road works in three other zones on 14 December 2000, the areas in issue were not even ready for the Plaintiffs to commence their road and kerb works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was therefore clear that MINDEF’s actions were not due to any default of the Plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">18<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The First Defendants were in the midst of arbitration proceedings against MINDEF when they called on the bonds here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The trial of this action has been scheduled to commence on 1 September 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was a high risk that the Plaintiffs would not be able to recover the money paid out under the performance bonds should they succeed at the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, there would be no prejudice at all to the First Defendants if the injunction was granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They would not suffer any additional damages as the project had long been completed and the defects liability period had expired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The balance of convenience was clearly in the Plaintiffs’ favour.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Headg-1" style="MARGIN: 12pt 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>THE FIRST DEFENDANTS’ CASE</strong></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">19<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The performance bonds were unconditional and irrevocable in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Plaintiffs’ action was directly contrary to the express terms of the sub-contract as well as the bonds.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">20<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Plaintiffs had not only failed to produce sufficient evidence to show any alleged fraud or unconscionable conduct, they were in fact the party in breach of the two sub-contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The first sub-contract clearly stated that it was to commence on 1 February 2000 and that the works were to be completed by 31 May 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Plaintiffs admitted the works were completed only on 30 November 2000 and were therefore liable for liquidated damages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The second sub-contract stipulated the completion date of 18 September 2000 but the Plaintiffs completed the external works in January 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Liquidated damages were imposed for the period 1 October 2000 to 31 October 2002 and they amounted to $360,000 and $792,000 respectively.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">26<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The First Defendants failed to explain the discrepancies in their final statements of account over the five months between 22 August 2002 and 23 January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The costs of removal of surplus earth and the additional items included in the later set of accounts were in respect of works completed some time back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was difficult to see how the First Defendants could have made such a blunder in their accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If they had failed to quantify some items of costs initially, they could not produce any documents to support their contention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In particular, they failed to show how the costs of removal of surplus earth ballooned from some $137,000 in August 2002 to about $287,000 in January 2003.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The changes to the final accounts appeared to have been arbitrarily made and buttressed the Plaintiffs’ contention that they were done to show overpayment of an amount suspiciously close to the total amount payable under the bonds.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">27<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> The Plaintiffs have also produced cogent evidence to support their contention that they were not in default of their contractual obligations and that there was therefore no reason to call on the bonds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The entire circumstances of the case suggested strongly that the First Defendants had an ulterior motive in calling on the bonds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It did not appear to be based on any <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">bona fide</i> claim they had against the Plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although they staved off the attempt to wind them up and were not on the brink of financial ruin, they could not be said to be in good financial health either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The calls on the bonds appeared to have been made to ameliorate their cash flow problems.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 6pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">28<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> For these reasons, I granted the Plaintiffs the injunctions sought against the First Defendants.</span></p>
