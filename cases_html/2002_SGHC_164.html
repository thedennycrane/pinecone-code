<p align="justify">The facts</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">1.        C M Van Sillevoldt

Specerijen BV (the plaintiffs) are a Dutch company which deals in the processing and sale

of pepper. The Owners of the <b>ASL POWER</b> (the tug) are Capitol Marine Pte Ltd (the

defendants) which tug, at the material time, was chartered to Sindo Damai Marine Pte Ltd

(the Third Party) to provide towing services to the Third Party's dumb barge <b>INTAN 6 </b>(the

barge).</p>
<p align="justify">2.        By a contract dated 23

April 1999 (the contract), the plaintiffs bought from an Indonesian company PT Putrabali

Adyamulia (the sellers) 45 metric tons of muntok white pepper to be shipped from Pangkal

Pinang, Indonesia to and be delivered at, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Negotiations for the

contract on the sellers' behalf were conducted by Keijzer &amp; van Schilt (the brokers)

while the plaintiffs negotiated through their representative Henricus Peter Tijssen

(Tijssen). The contract was only one of several the plaintiffs had made over the years

with the sellers, transacted through the same brokers. The brokers became the sellers'

exclusive agents for Europe in 1999. </p>
<p align="justify">3.        Under the contract, the

first shipment of 15 metric tons (the cargo) was scheduled to be delivered in January

2000, with the balance to follow in two (2) shipments in the subsequent two (2) months.

The contract was on C &amp; F basis; other terms relevant for our purpose are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">(i) Payment: Cash

    against documents at first presentation, buyer bank must release payment to seller bank

    maximum 14 days after B/L date. Any delay payment automatically buyer's bank have to pay

    the interest charges 11% per year and added to the invoice value. Sellers guarantee to

    present full set of documents to buyers bank within 14 days after B/L date.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) This contract is made upon the terms and conditions including the

    rules of arbitration and appeal (of which the parties admit they have knowledge and

    notice) of contract no. 5 of the International General Produce Association</p></font>.

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4.        The cargo was shipped by

the sellers through Sea Hawk Freight Pte Ltd (Sea Hawk) who issued an ocean bill of lading

dated 27 January 2000 (the bill of lading) for combined transport or port to port

shipment. The cargo was stuffed into a container and carried on the barge from Pangkal

Pinang to Singapore after which it would be shipped on the vessel <b>HANJIN DALIAN</b> for

the voyage to Rotterdam. The barge towed by the tug left the port of Pangkal Balam for

Singapore on or about 30 January 2000. Unfortunately, due to heavy seas and gale force

winds (according to the tug Master's report) encountered during the course of the voyage,

the barge sank on 1 February 2000 and the containers on board, including that with the

cargo inside, were lost. On 2 February 2000, the brokers notified the plaintiffs of the

loss.</p>
<p align="justify">5.        After the cargo had been

loaded onto the barge and the bill of lading (3 sets) was issued by Sea Hawk, the sellers

forwarded (on or about 22 February 2000) the bill of lading together with other documents

such as the commercial invoice and packing list through Rabobank Duta Indonesia (the

sellers' bank) to the plaintiffs' bank Mees Pierson (Mees Pierson), for the purpose of

negotiating the letter of credit (for US$91,500) which the plaintiffs had established for

the contract. The bill of lading named the plaintiffs as the notify party while the

consignee was stated as <i>'to order of Rabobank Duta Indonesia'</i>. The cargo was

insured by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">6.        Notwithstanding the loss

of the cargo, the sellers received payment under the plaintiffs' letter of credit. The

plaintiffs in turn claimed on their insurers (Central Beheer) and were eventually paid

US$100,650 for the value of the cargo, plus 10% for loss of profit. Hence, this claim is a

subrogated right of the said insurers.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The pleadings</p></i>
<p align="justify">7.        The plaintiffs filed this

action on 3 March 2000. To pre-empt the arrest of the tug or her sister ships, the

defendants' protection and indemnity club (the P&amp;I Club) furnished security to the

plaintiffs for this claim by way of a letter of undertaking dated 19 April 2000. The

P&amp;I Club agreed therein to submit to Singapore jurisdiction and agreed that Singapore

law would apply, for any claim arising out of the loss of the cargo.</p>
<p align="justify">8.        In the (amended) statement

of claim, the plaintiffs alleged that they were the owners of the cargo at the time the

barge sank. The plaintiffs pleaded that the defendants owed them a duty of care in tort to

take reasonable care of the cargo, which duty they breached when the cargo was lost due to

the sinking of the barge. </p>
<p align="justify">9.        In the (amended) defence,

the defendants pleaded that they were neither the carriers of the cargo nor the issuers of

the bill of lading; neither were they involved in nor responsible for, the loading of the

cargo or other containers on the barge. They averred that the tug was chartered to the

Third Party to tow the barge from Pangkal Balam to Singapore. Consequently, the defendants

pleaded, they had no contractual or other relationship with the plaintiffs such as to give

rise to a duty of care. In the alternative, if such a duty of care did exist, it extended

only to the provision of towing services for the barge which the defendants did provide.</p>
<p align="justify">10.        In the further

alternative, the defendants pleaded that in providing towing services to the barge, the

tug's crew were the servants or agents of the Third Party. Hence the defendants were not

in breach of any duty as alleged or at all.</p>
<p align="justify">11.        Numerous other

alternative defences were raised by the defendants which for purposes of this trial, are

not necessary to be dealt with for reasons which will appear below.</p>
<p align="justify">12.        Shortly after the

defendants had entered an appearance to the writ of summons, the defendants filed a Third

Party Notice and subsequently, joined the Third Party to these proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">13.        By an order of court

dated 3 December 2001 made pursuant to the defendants' application for further directions,

it was ordered that the following preliminary issue be first tried and determined before a

trial of the plaintiffs' claim on its merits:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">Whether the

    plaintiffs were on 1 February 2000, the date of loss of the cargo in respect of which

    action is brought, the owners of the said cargo and/or have title, interest or <i>locus

    standi</i> to sue the defendants in tort for the loss thereof or to maintain the present

    action? </p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<i>
<p align="justify">The evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify">14.        The preliminary issue

only concerned the plaintiffs and the defendants, not the Third Party. For determination

of the preliminary issue, both sides called expert testimony on Indonesian law.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(i)    the plaintiffs' case</p></i>
<p align="justify">15.        Besides their expert, the

plaintiffs called a witness of fact. He was Tijssen, who was in charge of purchasing.

Tijssen (PW1) testified that the plaintiffs gave written instructions to Mees Pierson on

23 February 2000 (1AB46), to release payment to the sellers on their letter of credit;

presumably payment would have been released a day later. Tijssen referred to a letter

(dated 3 February 2002) from Mees Pierson, forwarding to the plaintiffs documents which

the bank had received, for purposes of negotiating the letter of credit. The documents

included the bill of lading which reverse side (see 1AB12) had by then, been endorsed by

Mees Pierson and the sellers' bank. After recording receipt of the documents, the

plaintiffs returned them to Mees Pierson (on or about 4 February 2000) save for the bill

of lading which they retained (and which reverse side they also endorsed), to enable them

(through their agents) to obtain delivery of the cargo from the shipping line, upon the

arrival of the vessel <b>HANJIN DALIAN</b> at Rotterdam.</p>
<p align="justify">16.        Although he was said to

be a witness of fact, it was very clear from Tijssen's cross-examination that, apart from

negotiating the contract on the plaintiffs' behalf and perusing the documents for

negotiation of the letter of credit, Tijssen had no personal knowledge of <u>either</u>

the events leading to and the loss, of the cargo or, of what transpired between the

sellers and the brokers at the time the contract was negotiated. No representative of the

plaintiffs visited Indonesia after the sinking. Consequently, the court could not have

regard to what was told to Tijssen by Mr Apeldoorn from the brokers' office, including

Apeldoorn's telephone assurance (given sometime in 1999) that the sellers had agreed that

property and title in the cargo would pass to the plaintiffs upon shipment,

notwithstanding the express payment terms stated in the contract. Unfortunately, no

representative from the sellers' or brokers' office(s) came forward to testify either.

Indeed, counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court that the brokers refused to testify

(N/E 27). Cross-examined on the payment terms, Tijssen had said payment had nothing to do

with ownership of the cargo but, he confirmed he had no direct contact with the sellers.

However, the plaintiffs and even the brokers, had always regarded the cargo as the

plaintiffs' once it was shipped. Tijssen testified that the second and third shipments of

the pepper were received by the plaintiffs as scheduled.</p>
<p align="justify">17.        As earlier stated, each

side called experts who testified on Indonesian law. The plaintiffs' expert was Achmad

Suhardi Kartohadiprodjo (Achmad) who is a partner in a law firm in Jakarta and has been in

practice since 1969. In arriving at his opinion that property in the cargo passed to the

plaintiffs upon shipment and hence they had title to sue, Achmad (PW2) looked at:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the contract;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) the International General Produce Association Rules, contract no.

    5 (the IGPA Rules);</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) the commercial invoice issued by the sellers;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) the bill of lading;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) the letter dated 3 February 2000 from Mees Pierson to the

    plaintiffs;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) a fax advice from the sellers’ bank to Mees Pierson enclosing

    the draft shipping documents.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">However, Achmad was not shown or told about the letter of undertaking

from the P&amp;I Club, until informed by counsel for the defendants, in the course of his

cross-examination.</p>
<p align="justify">18.        In arriving at his

conclusion that the plaintiffs had title to the cargo at the time of the loss, Achmad said

he had to satisfy himself (which he did) that:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs were entitled to avail themselves of the rights and

    obligations under Indonesian law; </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(ii) the plaintiffs would have been entitled to bring this action in

    Indonesia;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Indonesian law would apply.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.        It would be appropriate

at this juncture, to set out the salient Articles (as translated) of the Indonesia

Civil/Commercial Code which Achmad (and the defendants' expert) relied on:</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><b>
<p align="center">Civil Code</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></b><p align="justify">612 -- The delivery of movable goods, with the exception of those

        which are intangible, shall be made by means of their simple delivery by the owner or on

        his behalf, or by the delivery of the keys to the building where the goods concerned

        exists.</p>
<p align="justify">Such delivery is not required in the event that the goods to be

        delivered is, by virtue of another title, already under the control of the person who is

        to receive the delivery of such goods.</p>
<p align="justify">1457-- A sale and purchase is an agreement whereby one party binds

        himself to deliver a good whereas the other party binds himself to pay the price agreed

        upon.</p>
<p align="justify">1458 -- A sale and purchase shall be deemed as having taken place

        between two parties as soon as the said parties reach an agreement as to the good and the

        price, even though the good concerned has not been delivered and the price concerned has

        not been paid. </p>
<p align="justify">1459 -- The ownership title to a sold good is not transferred to the

        purchaser as long as the said good has not been delivered in accordance with the

        provisions of Article 612, 613 and 616. </p>
<b><p align="center">Commercial Code</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></b><p align="justify">504 -- A shipper may request a carrier to issue a bill of lading on

        received goods which are going to be delivered, by withdrawing a Mate's Receipt, if the

        Mate's Receipt has been issued.</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand a carrier is responsible to inform on all information

        required to fill in the bill of lading.</p>
<p align="justify">517(a)--The delivery of a bill of lading before goods is delivered is

        considered as the delivery of the said goods.</p>
</font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">20.        Cross-examined, Achmad

revealed that whilst he was familiar with bills of lading and sale of goods transactions

and he had handled 1-2 shipping claims to-date, he specialised more in aviation

law/aircraft leasing. Achmad explained that in determining Indonesian law applied to the

contract, he looked at the connecting factors namely, the sellers were an Indonesian

company, the cargo was Indonesian and, the accident/loss happened in Indonesian waters.</p>
<p align="justify">21.        Achmad opined that a

buyer and seller to a transaction can always agree to foreign law being applied instead of

Indonesian law. If there was a dispute, Indonesian law would recognise foreign law if

parties had agreed foreign law would apply, unless it was contrary to the public policy of

Indonesia. Achmad agreed that Article 1459 of the Civil Code does not say that when

delivery of goods is made, ownership passes. He did not dispute that the parties had

agreed English law would apply to the contract, pursuant to cl 25 of the IGPA Rules. </p>
<p align="justify">22.        It was Achmad's view that

a bill of lading performs three (3) functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) it is evidence of a contract of carriage;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) as a cargo receipt for shipment;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) as a document of possession</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">and a bill of lading needs to be presented to obtain delivery of the

cargo from the carrier at the port of final destination.</p>
<p align="justify">23.        Questioned, Achmad said

delivery to the carrier of the cargo would constitute delivery under Article 612 of the

Civil Code, the reason being that the carrier acts as agent to the buyer and the seller's

obligations would cease once delivery was effected and, control of the cargo passes to the

buyer or his agent. The position would not be any different even if the bill of lading was

issued to the seller by the carrier as, that is only an administrative matter. However,

retention of the bill of lading by the seller does not mean there was no delivery to the

buyer as, Article 612 has to be read with Article 1459 on the issue of title. If the

carrier is not the buyer's agent, the seller's obligations would cease once he transfers

delivery to another party. Achmad explained that Indonesian law is akin to French law

under which, upon conclusion of a sale, transfer from the seller to the buyer is

completed.</p>
<p align="justify">24.        Achmad's testimony was to

the effect that, physical possession/transfer of the cargo determined who has title to the

bill of lading, not transfer of the shipping documents per se. According to him, once the

cargo was released to the carrier, the plaintiffs had title to sue. Achmad drew a

distinction between claims in tort (which was the plaintiffs' claim) where Indonesian law

applied and claims in contract where the contractually agreed law (English law) would

apply. Hence, under contract law, if the plaintiffs did not pay for the cargo, the sellers

could retake possession, under Article 1267 of the Civil Code, by dissolution of the

contract by a court of law.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii)    the defendants' case </p></i>
<p align="justify">25.        The defendants' expert

Arsul Sani (Sani) was the defendants' only witness. Not unexpectedly, he disagreed with

Achmad's views. Sani has fifteen (15) years' practice in various fields of law, including

commercial litigation (in maritime and sale of goods disputes). His views were sought and

he gave his opinion, on the following questions:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) where an Indonesian party enters into a contract with a Dutch party

    to sell goods to the latter and it is expressly agreed in the contract that the same shall

    in all respects be governed by English law, whether English law or Indonesian law governs

    the contract? </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) on the assumption that Indonesian law governs the contract, when

    does property in the goods pass to the buyers under the contract?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">26.        Besides Articles 612 and

1459 of the Civil Code, Sani also relied on Articles 1338, 1457 and 1458 thereof as well

as Articles 504 and 517A of the Commercial Code and, cl 25 of the IGPA Rules for his

opinion that:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) English law was the law binding the sellers and the plaintiffs.

    Both parties had agreed that English law would apply to the contract. In accordance with

    the principle of freedom to make contracts under Article 1338 of the Civil Code, English

    law would determine at which point title or property would pass to the plaintiffs; </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) as a consequence of the principle of freedom to make contracts,

    the provisions on contract law such as Article 1459 assume the character of optional law

    and are not applicable to this case;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) assuming Indonesian law governs the contract and applying

    Articles 612, 1457 and 1459, transfer of title/ownership in the goods will pass from the

    sellers to the buyers after delivery of the goods to the buyers has taken place. However,

    where goods are to be delivered by sea carriage, then delivery of the goods as provided by

    Article 612 will be considered as taking place by delivery of the bill of lading, as

    provided in Article 517A;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) even if Indonesian law governs the contract, title and ownership

    in the cargo was transferred to the plaintiffs as buyers not earlier than 22 February

    2000, (that being the date when the bill of lading was delivered to Mees Pierson by the

    sellers' bank).</p>

<p align="justify">In other words, Sani answered the preliminary issue in the negative.

His opinion was premised on the bill of lading having been delivered to Mees Pierson on 22

February 2000 with payment for the cargo being made by the plaintiffs against the shipping

documents subsequently. When cross-examined, Sani was told that Tijssen received the bill

of lading on 4 not 22 February 2000; in that case, he said title would have passed to the

plaintiffs on 4 February 2000. </p>
<p align="justify">27.        The basis for Sani's

opinion that the parties had agreed English law was the applicable law is cl 25 of the

IGPA Rules which states:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Domicile: This

    contract shall be deemed to have been made in England and the construction, validity and

    performance thereof shall be governed in all respects by English law. Any dispute arising

    out of or in connection therewith shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance the

    Rules of the Association. The serving of proceedings upon any party by sending same to

    their last known address together with leaving a copy of such proceedings at the offices

    of the Association shall be deemed good service, rule of law or equity to the contrary

    notwithstanding. </p></font>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">read with Article 1338 of the (Indonesian) Civil Code which states:- </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

    agreements that have been constituted legally shall be law to those having undertaken

    that are provided by law. These agreements shall be carried out in a bona fide manner.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">28.        Sani pointed out that

Indonesian law draws a distinction between passing of title and passing of risk. Under a C

&amp; F contract, although <u>risk</u> in the cargo passes to the buyer upon shipment, the

seller <u>retains</u> ownership/title until the buyer makes payment. Delivery of the bill

of lading constitutes '<i>delivery</i>' under Article 612 and delivery is not dependent on

payment being made for the cargo. However, if the carrier is appointed by the buyer, then

delivery takes place when the cargo is handed over to the carrier. Otherwise, the carrier

would be the seller's agent save where the bill of lading is endorsed by the seller, which

endorsement amounts to an assignment of rights. The seller's rights would pass to the

endorsee or holder of the bill of lading, from the date of endorsement. I should point out

that in re-examination, Sani clarified this statement; he said the seller would not have

lost his rights if endorsement of the bill of lading was for some purpose <u>other</u>

than passing of rights such as, in order to obtain payment for the cargo.</p>
<p align="justify">29.        As for the carrier, Sani

said it owed a duty to the seller to carry the cargo and discharge it at the discharge

port in good order and condition whilst, to the consignee, the carrier owed a duty to

deliver the cargo.</p>
<p align="justify">30.        Sani had placed reliance

on Article 1792 of the Indonesian Civil Code which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">A mandate is

    an agreement by which one person empowers another, the latter accepting such power, to

    carry out some business for and in the name of the principal</p></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">for his view that a carrier who is appointed by the seller at the

buyer's request, remains the seller's agent, unless the seller identifies himself to the

carrier as the buyer's proxy. In the context of Indonesian law, Sani described Mees

Pierson as the agent of the plaintiffs for purposes of receiving and retaining the bill of

lading and other documents and, to make payment on their behalf.</p>
<p align="justify">31.        I had earlier made my

observation (para 16) on the shortcomings in Tijssen's testimony. Consequently, the court

was left with only the testimony of the two (2) experts for determination of the

preliminary issue. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The submissions</p></i>
<p align="justify">32.        In determining the

preliminary issue, the first question that needs to be answered is, what is the law

applicable to this claim? Is it Indonesian law as the plaintiffs assert or, English law as

the defendants contend.</p>
<p align="justify">33.        The starting point would

be to look at the contract itself, which salient clauses I have already set out in para 3

above. Then, there are the terms of the IGPA in particular cl 25 (see para 27 <i>supra</i>).

Reading the two (2) terms/clauses, it seems to me that the parties to the contract had

indeed agreed that English law should apply to any dispute between them. However, the

dispute before this court is <u>not</u> between the sellers and the buyers but, between

one party to the contract (the buyer/plaintiffs) and an outsider (the defendants), with

whom under English and Singapore law, the plaintiffs have no privity of contract. The

question which arises is, would that make a difference?</p>
<p align="justify">34.        The only document which

connects the plaintiffs and the defendants is the letter of undertaking furnished by the P

&amp; I Club which paras 2, 3 and 4 (see 1AB52) read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">2. We agree to

    submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore in respect of any

    claim arising against us pursuant to this undertaking and guarantee to obey any order or

    judgment of the High Court in Singapore in respect of the premises as if our head offices

    were within the jurisdiction of the said court and when and so far as it may be necessary

    that any instrument or order issued from the High Court in Singapore or any appeal

    therefrom should be served on us in proceedings to be taken for the enforcement of the

    undertaking and guarantee hereby given, we agree and consent that the service of such

    instrument or order on us by leaving the same at the registered office of Spica Services

    (S) Pte Ltd shall be in all respects as operative and effective as if the same were our

    principal office and such instrument or order had been served on the Officer in charge of

    the same.</p>
<p align="justify">3. We confirm that we have instructions from our Member [the

    defendants] that they warrant that ASL PROGRESS was not on a demise charter on 1 February

    2000 and that the owners of ASL PROGRESS shall unconditionally submit to Singapore

    jurisdiction for the determination of the claim arising out of and in connection with the

    above incident, with Singapore law to apply.</p>
<p align="justify">4. We further undertake that we will, within 14 days of the receipt

    from you for a request to do so, instruct solicitors to accept on behalf of the owners of

    the ASL PROGRESS service at your option of in personam or in rem proceedings brought in

    connection with the above incident and we warrant that we have received irrevocable

    authority from the owners of ASL PROGRESS to instruct solicitors as aforesaid and to give

    this letter of undertaking in these terms.</p>
</font></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">35.        The plaintiffs had

attempted (through Achmad's testimony) to argue that the letter of undertaking would not

bind them as it was not a document entered into between themselves and the defendants.

With respect, that argument is not tenable, as is clearly reflected in the above extracts

— the letter of undertaking was addressed to the plaintiffs by the P&amp;I Club on

behalf of the defendants. The defendants had provided consideration to the plaintiffs for

not arresting the tug and or any other vessels they owned; the plaintiffs cannot be

allowed to resile from their position or renege on the terms and conditions spelt out in

that document for the provision of the P&amp;I Club's undertaking. </p>
<p align="justify">36.        Another argument raised

by the plaintiffs (again through Achmad's testimony) for their contention that Indonesian

not Singapore, law applied was that this claim was in tort, not in contract. That

statement itself seemed to suggest that the plaintiffs conceded that contractual claims

would be subject to Singapore/English law in which case, passing of title would be

governed by the Sale of Goods Act Cap 393 (the Act).</p>
<p align="justify">37.        Indeed, both parties had

relied on ss 17, 18 and 19 of the Act for opposite arguments on whether title in the cargo

did or did not pass to the plaintiffs upon shipment; the sections state:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

    parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties,

    regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the

    circumstances of the case.</p>
<b><p align="justify">Rules for ascertaining intention </p>
</b><p align="justify">18 — Unless a different intention appears, the following are

    rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property

    in the goods is to pass to the buyer:</p>
<p align="justify">Rule 1 — Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of

    specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when

    the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of

    delivery, or both, be postponed.</p>
<p align="justify">Rule 2 — Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods

    and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into

    a deliverable state, the property does not pass until the thing is done and the buyer has

    notice that it has been done.</p>
<p align="justify">Rule 3…………</p>
<p align="justify">Rule 4…………. </p>
<p align="justify">Rule 5(1)………</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods

    to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee or custodier (whether named by the buyer or

    not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of

    disposal, he is to be taken to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the

    contract. </p>
<b><p align="justify">Reservation of right of disposal </p>
</b><p align="justify">19 — (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific

    goods or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the

    terms of the contract or appropriation, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until

    certain conditions are fulfilled; and in such a case, notwithstanding the delivery of the

    goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or to other bailee or custodier for the purpose of

    transmission to the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the

    conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are

    deliverable to the order of the seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie to be taken

    to reserve the right of disposal.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">38.        Applying s 17(2) of the

Act, the plaintiffs' counsel submitted that, this being a C &amp; F contract, the

title/risk in the cargo would have passed to his clients once the cargo was loaded on

board the barge. A C.I.F contract by definition (see <i>Benjamin's Sale of Goods</i> 5 ed

p 1247 para 19-001) is an agreement to sell goods at an inclusive price covering the cost

of the goods, insurance and freight. The essential feature of such a contract is that a

seller, having shipped or bought afloat, goods in accordance with the contract, fulfills

his part of the bargain by tendering to the buyer the proper shipping documents; if he

does this, he is not in breach even though the goods have been lost before such tender. In

the event of such loss, the buyer must nevertheless pay the price on tender of the

documents and his remedies, if any, will be against the carrier or against the

underwriter, but not against the seller on the contract of sale. A C &amp; F contract is

similar save that the buyer not the seller, is responsible for insuring the goods.</p>
<p align="justify">39.        It bears remembering

that, in a C.I.F or C &amp; F contract, the duties (see <i>Benjamin's Sale of Goods</i> p

1255 para 19-010) of the seller are:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">a. first to

    ship (or procure a shipment of) goods in accordance with the contract and, where

    necessary, to appropriate such goods to the contract;</p>
<p align="justify">b. secondly, to procure or prepare the proper shipping documents;</p>
<p align="justify">c. thirdly, to tender these documents to the buyer or as the buyer

    directs</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">.

  



<p align="justify">The seller is not under any duty to ensure the actual physical delivery

of the goods at the C.I.F/C &amp; F destination, though he is under a duty not to take

active steps to prevent such delivery. </p>
<p align="justify">40.        The defendants however

relied on s 19 of the Act read with the contract's payment term: <i>cash against documents</i>

for their argument that the sellers had reserved their rights and title to the cargo until

the plaintiffs made payment which, by the plaintiffs' own evidence, could not have been

earlier than 23/24 February 2000. Even accepting Achmad's testimony, assuming Tijssen/the

plaintiffs received the bill of lading from Mees Pierson on 4 February 2000, title would

have passed to the plaintiffs only as from that day. Consequently the defendants

submitted, when the barge sank three (3) days earlier (1 February 2000), the plaintiffs

did not have title to the cargo and had no locus standi to sue for its loss. In this

regard, <i>Benjamin's Sale of Goods</i> said (at p 1135 para 18-158):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">In overseas

    sale, the passing of property thus depends on the provisions of the contract, the form of

    the shipping documents and, the way in which the documents have been dealt with.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">41.        The above submissions

would be relevant only if Singapore or English law applied. Hence, I would first have to

consider the plaintiffs' argument that there is a difference between claims in contract

and tort and, that Indonesian law applied to the latter/this claim because of the various

connecting factors with that country. In making that submission, the plaintiffs were in

effect relying on Rule 116 of <i>Dicey &amp; Morris' The Conflict of Laws</i> (13 ed). The

defendants on the other hand relied on the exception to Rule 116 and on Rule 118 of the

same book as well as two (2) cases (<i>Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA</i> [1994] 3 All ER 749; <i>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49611&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 579</a>) for their contrary

argument.</p>
<p align="justify">42.        Rule 116 of <i>Dicey

&amp; Morris</i> (p 963 para 24R-001) states: </p>

    </font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Further reliance was placed by the defendants on the following

commentary on the <b>Exception</b> in the book (at p 969 para 24-017):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">The lack of

<p align="justify">43.        It is interesting to note

that in the footnote to the above commentary, the authors referred to <i>Benjamin's Sale

of Goods</i> paras 25-98 onwards. I append herewith the relevant extracts from the

passages in <i>Benjamin's Sale of Goods </i>starting with para 25-098: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></b><p align="justify">It is established in modern conflicts law [the author referred in

    turn to <i>Dicey &amp; Morris]</i> that from the point of view of proprietary rights the

    law governing particular transfers of title to goods, whether by sale or otherwise, is in

    general the <i>lex situs</i>……… </p>
<p align="justify">Para 25-100: <b>Goods in transit</b>. </p>
<p align="justify">The <i>lex situs</i> principle is subject to an important limitation:

    it does not apply when at the relevant time the goods are "in transit". The

    phrase "in transit" in this particular context within the conflict of laws has

    not been authoritatively defined, though it seems clear that the "transit" in

    question has a different point of commencement, and a different endpoint, from the

    "transit" during which the English remedy of stoppage in transit can be invoked

    by a seller. It is submitted that, for the purpose of conflict of laws, goods are "in

    transit' when, while being carried from one country X to another, Z, they are for a time

    not situated in any country at all (being, for example, on a ship on the high seas), or

    are only casually and fortuitously in an intermediate country,…In such circumstances,

    the <i>lex situs</i> principle is inapplicable; even if the goods can be said to have a

    legal <i>situs</i> at all, the fortuitous nature of such <i>situs</i> and the fact that it

    may not be known to the relevant parties make the principle

    inappropriate………</p>
<p align="justify">Para 25-101: <b>The proper law of the transfer</b>.</p>
<p align="justify">Where goods are in transit, the role normally played by the <i>lex

    situs</i> is taken over by other laws;…..one of these laws which may act as a

    "substitute" for the <i>lex situs</i> requires preliminary explanation. This is

    "the proper law of the transfer"; it means, broadly speaking, the law having the

    "closest and most real connection" with the transfer of property rights which

    takes place by virtue of the sale. The proper law of the transfer is ascertained by a

    process similar to that employed in ascertaining the law governing the contract of sale,

    according to common law rules, though without (it is submitted) taking account of any

    purported choice by the parties in the contract of sale itself. In many cases, it will be

    the same law as the law governing the contract of sale itself.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">44.        The defendants relied on

Rule 118 as, the bill of lading had been endorsed to the plaintiffs by the sellers' bank

and Mees Pierson; the Rule (at p 977 para 24R-046 of <i>Dicey &amp; Morris</i>) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p align="justify">(b) the law governing the right to which the assignment relates

      determines its assignability, the relationship between the assignee and the debtor, the

      whether the debtor's obligations have been discharged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(2)      But in other cases (<i>semble</i>),

</font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">45.        The two (2) cases cited

by the defendants concerned what is generally referred to as the double-actionability

rule. <i>Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA</i> was an appeal to the Privy Council

from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal whilst <i>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</i> was a later

decision of our appellate court.</p>
<p align="justify">46.        <i>Red Sea Insurance</i>

was a dispute relating to a joint venture for construction of buildings in Saudi Arabia;

the respondents (from Hong Kong) were members of the joint venture, which was subject to

Saudi Arabian law. When structural damage was discovered in the buildings, the respondents

issued proceedings in Hong Kong claiming an indemnity for loss and expense incurred in

respect of repairing or replacing the structural damage. The insurers resisted the claim

and counterclaimed against those respondents known as the PCG consortium (who had

contracted to supply precast concrete units for the project) alleging that, PCG had

supplied faulty precast units and, if the insurers were liable under the policy of

insurance for the loss suffered by the other respondents, they were entitled to recover

the amount of such loss by way of subrogation to the other respondents' rights. PCG

applied to strike out the counterclaim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action on the

basis that under Hong Kong law, the insurers could not claim to be subrogated unless they

had paid the respondents other than PCG, which they had not done. The insurers thereupon

applied for leave to amend in order to claim that the relevant law was that of Saudi

Arabia, under which the insurers were entitled to sue PCG direct for the damage caused to

the other respondents. The judge held in favour of the respondents and struck out the

counterclaim and refused the insurers leave to amend. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal

allowed the insurers' appeal to the extent of setting aside the order striking out the

counterclaim but upheld the decision refusing leave to amend, on the ground that the

insurers could not sue PCG directly for negligence relying solely on the law of Saudi

Arabia, the <i>lex loci delicti</i>, since the law of Hong Kong, the <i>lex fori</i>, did

not recognise any such direct liability in tort. The insurers appealed in respect of that

ruling. </p>
<p align="justify">47.        In allowing the appeal,

the Privy Council inter alia held: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">(i) As a general

    rule, an act done in a foreign country was a tort and actionable as such in England only

    if it was both actionable as a tort according to English law and actionable according to

    the law of the foreign country where it was done. The rule of double actionability was not

    however inflexible, and it was possible to depart from it on clear and satisfying grounds

    in order to avoid injustice by holding that a particular issue between the parties to

    litigation should be governed by the law of the country which, with respect to that issue,

    had the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties. That

    exception to the general rule could be applied not only to enable a plaintiff to exclude

    the <i>lex loci</i> <i>delicti</i> in favour of the <i>lex fori</i> but also, in an

    appropriate case, to rely on the <i>lex loci delicti</i> if his claim would not be

    actionable under the <i>lex fori</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) In the circumstances it was clear that all the significant factors

    in the claim had either occurred in Saudi Arabia or were connected with that country or

    were governed by the law of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p align="justify">48.        Counsel for the

defendants also drew my attention to the following passage (at p 763) from Lord Slynn's

judgment:</p>
<blockquote>

    in this case is based on a number of factors relied on by the appellant, which need to be

    Saudi Arabian law, the project was to be carried out in Saudi Arabia and the property was

    owned by the government. The main contract, the supply contract and HOK + 4 Consortium's

    service contract are all subject to the law of Saudi Arabia and were to be performed

    there. The breaches and the alleged damage occurred in Saudi Arabia. The expense of

    repairing alleged damage occurred in Saudi Arabia. The appellant though incorporated in

    Hong Kong, had its office in Saudi Arabia.</p></font>

respondents, whereby the appellant (an Indonesian) was engaged as a rigger on a dumb

barge, which was Singapore-registered. While the dumb barge (and the appellant) was

engaged in pile-driving operations off the coast of Rangoon (Yangon), Myanmar, an accident

occurred which resulted in the appellant sustaining serious injuries. The appellant sued

the respondents for damages for the injuries he suffered, alleging they were caused by an

unsafe system of work, based on breach of provisions in the Factories Act Cap 104 and

under common law. The trial judge found that the Factories Act did not apply but that the

respondents had breached their common law duty to take reasonable care for the appellant's

safety, although he also concluded that the appellant was  to blame. The appellant

appealed against both the finding that the Factories Act was inapplicable and on the

apportionment of liability. The appeal was allowed in part (on the apportionment of

liability which was adjusted to <font face="Bookshelf Symbol 4"></font> against the

respondents). The Court of Appeal inter alia (per Chao JA) held:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">(i) the applicable

    choice of law rule in Singapore with respect to torts committed overseas was that the

    wrong had to be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in

    Singapore and that the act could not have been justifiable by the place where it was done.

    It was also incontrovertible that the exceptions to the double-actionability rule was part

    of our law.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) As neither party had pleaded Myanmar law with respect to the

    alleged negligence or raised any point of Myanmar law, it was the Singapore common law of

    negligence which applied. The <i>lex loci delicti</i> was treated as the same as the <i>lex

    fori</i> </p>
</font><i>
</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The decision </p>
<p align="justify">50.        Before I make my

determination on the preliminary issue, I need to refer to the pleadings. In the (amended)

statement of claim, the plaintiffs did not plead that Indonesian law applied. Indeed, all

that was pleaded (in para 2) was: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">It was the

    intention and understanding of the parties that title would pass upon shipment, and the

    plaintiffs aver that title passed accordingly</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">.

  



<p align="justify">I had earlier observed (para 16), this plea was not proven as no

representative of either the sellers or the brokers testified to corroborate what Tijssen

said he had been told by the brokers. In this regard, I reject the submission of counsel

for the plaintiffs, that the court can consider what Tijssen said he was told by the

brokers' Mr Apeldoorn (that the title/property in the cargo would pass to the plaintiffs

upon shipment), under s 94(b)(f) of the Evidence Act Cap 97. Firstly, the testimony was

hearsay and of no probative value whatsoever and secondly, it would be inconsistent with

the express terms of the (C &amp; F) contract relating to payment.</p>
<p align="justify">51.        I should point out that

it was only in the (re-amended) Reply, that the plaintiffs for the first time, raised the

issue of Indonesian law being the applicable law; in para 3 they alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">The sale

    contract between PT Putrabali and the Plaintiffs was expressly subject to English law. The

    Plaintiffs will aver that title to the goods passed to the Plaintiffs under the sale

    contract at time the cargo was shipped on board the board the "Intan 6" as this

    was the intention and understanding between PT Putrabali and the Plaintiffs with regard to

    the passing of property under the contract. In any event, even if (which is denied) title

    had not passed to the Plaintiffs by the time that the cargo was lost, the proper law of

    the tort is Indonesian law. As a matter of Indonesian law, property in goods passes and/or

    a party obtains title to sue in respect of loss or damage to goods as from the time that

    that party becomes contractually obliged to pay the purchase price of the goods, i e. in

    the case of goods sold on costs and freight terms, upon shipment of the goods. </p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">52.        In response to the above

pleading, the defendants applied to court for and obtained, leave to file a Rejoinder

wherein they pleaded (in relation to para 3 of the Reply) that the defendants had

furnished security for the plaintiffs' claim on the basis that Singapore law/jurisdiction

would apply. They averred that the plaintiffs were estopped/precluded from relying on

Indonesian law. The defendants relied on Articles 1320 and 1338 of the Indonesian Civil

Code as well as on Articles 504 and 517a of the Commercial Code. They added that even if

Indonesian law applied (which they denied), property in the cargo did not pass to the

plaintiffs upon shipment, relying on the terms of the contract.</p>
<p align="justify">53.        I need to digress at this

stage and refer to three (3) other cases cited by the parties. The first is <i>The Ciudad

de Pasto</i> [1988] 2 Lloyd's LR 208, relied on by the defendants for their proposition

that title in the cargo did not pass to the plaintiffs on shipment, because the sellers

had reserved their rights, under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p align="justify">54.        That case concerned a

shipment of prawns which a Colombian company Vikingos (Vikingos) sold on FOB terms to a

Japanese company Colombia Fisheries (the second plaintiffs), which had a separate sales

contract for the prawns with another Japanese company Mitsui (the first plaintiffs).

Vikingos had an arrangement with the United States subsidiary of the first plaintiffs

whereby the subsidiary would advance 80% of the value of the prawns when they were ready

for shipment. On 29 August 1980, the prawns were loaded onto the defendants' vessel <i>Ciudad

de Pasto</i> at Cartagena, Colombia bound for Yokohama, Japan. The shipment was made under

five (5) bills of lading issued by Vikingos which named the first plaintiffs as the notify

party. On 8 and 9 September 1980, the prawns were transhipped onto another vessel of the

defendants the <i>Ciudad de Neiva</i> which carried the consignment to Yokohama where, it

was discharged onto an insulated barge cooled with dry ice. When the consignment was

eventually landed, 13.7% was found to be damaged. The issue for determination was whether,

as at September 1980, the plaintiffs had any title to sue the defendants (the writ was

issued in 1982). The English Court of Appeal inter alia held, that title in the prawns

passed to the second plaintiffs and remained in them until after completion of discharge

at Yokohama; as between the second and the first plaintiffs, the evidence was clear that

the first plaintiffs did not acquire their title at any time earlier than the arrival of

the goods in Japan and their involvement at earlier stages was as agents for the second

plaintiffs; the consignment was bought FOB by the second plaintiffs so that title passed

to the second plaintiffs at the time of shipment. Further, by the bills of lading, the

prawns were deliverable to the order of the sellers; consequently, the prima facie

presumption which (unless displaced), meant that the property in the prawns did not pass

to the buyers until the balance of the price (20%) had been paid. Vikingos took bills of

lading to their own order and in accordance with the presumption, they retained the

property in the prawns until the balance of the price had been paid. It was not proved

that this occurred before the prawns were damaged.</p>
<p align="justify">55.        The defendants urged the

court to follow the decision in <i>The Seven Pioneer</i> [2001] 2 Lloyd's LR 57, a New

Zealand case. There, the plaintiffs had an agreement with an Indonesian company

(Indocement) for the purchase of cement which it on-sold to various customers in other

countries. The purchase was on FOB terms out of Jakarta, the cargo would be shipped in

June 1998 and Indocement would be both supplier and shipper of the cement. The agreement

provided that the plaintiffs would pay against receipt of bills of lading from Indocement.

Four (4) bills of lading were issued for the June 1998 shipment naming Indocement as

shipper and the plaintiffs as consignee, and expressed to be governed by Indonesian law.

The cement was shipped on board <i>The Seven Pioneer</i> which vessel had been

voyage-chartered by the plaintiffs from its head-charterers, a Scottish company. The bills

of lading were signed by the local agents of the vessel's owners as agents on behalf of

the master of the vessel. During the voyage, heavy seas were encountered and the cargo was

damaged. The plaintiffs never paid for the shipment nor had they ever been an indorsee or

holder of any of the bills of lading. The defendants (shipowners) maintained that the

plaintiffs had no claim against the vessel and the question framed for the court's

consideration was, did the plaintiffs have sufficient interest to sue the defendants

whether in tort or contract?</p>
<p align="justify">56.        In answering the question

in the negative, Hansen J inter alia held:</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">where the contract provided for payment against the bill of lading the

    normal inference should be that the seller had reserved the right of disposal until

    payment in accordance with the contract had been made; there was nothing in the terms of

    the contract or the circumstances of this case to displace that inference; however, the

    bills of lading were never released to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs acquired no

    rights to the bills of lading until payment was made; therefore Indocement retained a

    right of disposal over the goods and property did not pass to the plaintiffs under New

    Zealand law; the plaintiffs did not have a sufficient interest in the goods at the time

    they were damaged to found a claim in negligence. </p></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The judge relied on Article 1338 of the Indonesian Civil Code as

affirmation of the right of contracting parties to contract out of the general law. </p>
<p align="justify">57.        The plaintiffs on their

part relied on <i>East West Corporation v DKBS 1912 and Another; Utaniko Ltd v P &amp; O

Nedlloyd BV </i>(2002) 582 LMLN for their entitlement to sue. </p>
<p align="justify">58.        In the <i>East West</i>

case, the plaintiffs (2) were related parties who sold goods to a Chilean company Gold

Crown (GC). In 1998, they agreed to sell further consignments to GC on terms of cash

against delivery. The plaintiffs shipped goods to Hong Kong in containers on liner

services for delivery in Chile. Those that were carried by the defendants in the first

action (Maersk) were shipped between September and October 1998 and those carried by the

defendants in the second action (P&amp;O) were shipped on 5 February 1999. The plaintiffs

had made arrangements with their bankers for the shipping documents to be remitted to

banks in Chile so that the documents would only be released on payment. Liner bills of

lading were duly issued for each of the nine (9) shipments and delivered to the

plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were named as the shippers in each bill of lading and the

notify party was GC. The goods were consigned to the order of named Chilean Banks in all

the bills of lading, save one (1) of the Maersk bills, where the goods were simply

consigned to a named Chilean bank and not to its order. Those banks were to act as the

correspondents of the plaintiffs' bankers to obtain payment from GC in return for the

bills of lading. The bills of lading were endorsed by the plaintiffs and sent by the

plaintiffs' bankers to their correspondent bankers in Chile for them to obtain payment. In

accordance with the customs laws of Chile, as duty had not been paid in advance, the

containers had to be placed on arrival in a licensed customs house. After customs duties

had been paid, four (4) of the seven (7) containers carried by Maersk were released (to

GC's customs agents) in November 1998, two (2) after 19 January 1999 and one (1) on an

unknown date. The containers carried by P&amp;O were released on 15 March 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">59.        Although GC made some

payment to the plaintiffs, they did not pay for the goods in two (2) of the containers

carried by P&amp;O and in seven (7) of the containers carried by Maersk. The banks were

requested to return the bills of lading (which were subject to English law) to the

plaintiffs which they did without endorsing them back. The plaintiffs commenced

proceedings on the basis that the carriers had delivered the cargo without presentation of

the bills of lading. One (1) of the four (4) defences raised was that the plaintiffs had

no title to sue on which issue Thomas J held:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">In relation

    to all the bills of lading (other than the Maersk bill), the Chilean banks to whom the

    bills of lading were sent initially were the consignees identified in the bills of lading

    within the ordinary meaning of those words in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992.

    Accordingly, the banks became the lawful holders in accordance with s 5(2)(a) of the 1992

    Act, and the plaintiffs' rights were extinguished under s 2(5)….Nor were the rights

    of suit extinguished transferred back to the plaintiffs when the bills of lading were

    delivered back to the plaintiffs. The reason was that when the bills were delivered back

    to the plaintiffs they were never endorsed by the banks to them…However, the

    plaintiffs did have title to sue in negligence based on their proprietary interest in the

    goods. Such a claim was outside the scope of and independent of the 1992 Act. In relation

    to the Maersk bill, that was a 'straight' or 'non-negotiable' bill, and therefore the

    plaintiffs' rights were not extinguished by the provisions of the 1992 Act. The bill was

    not a document of title at common law and the transfer did not operate as a transfer of

    constructive possession. The carrier was bound to deliver to the consignee without

    presentation of the bill. Thus, on issue one (1), the plaintiffs did have title to sue.</p></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Counsel for the defendants sought to distinguish the above case from

ours. He pointed out that although the shipper plaintiffs had lost their rights under the

bills of lading, they nevertheless had title to sue as ownership did not pass to GC; he

submitted that The Bills of Lading Act Cap 384 does not deal with the proprietary rights

of parties.</p>
<p align="justify">60.        I now return to the

question raised earlier — is there a difference between making a claim in tort and in

contract? If the answer is in the positive, then the plaintiffs' argument that, the

sinking of the barge/loss of the cargo is more closely connected with Indonesian law is

certainly persuasive, based on the 'overwhelming circumstances' test propounded in the <i>Red

Sea Insurance</i> case. Conversely, if the answer is in the negative, the preliminary

question would in consequence also be answered in the negative as, the parties had agreed

to apply English law, pursuant to cl 25 of the IGPA. It would follow that, based on the

endorsements in the bill of lading and in accordance with ss 2(1)(a), 2(5) and 5(2)(a) of

the Bills of Lading Act (Cap 384) which are <i>in pari materia</i> with the same sections

of the (United Kingdom) Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, title in the cargo would only

have passed to the plaintiffs <u>after</u> the sinking of the barge, namely on or about 22

February 2000, when they become the holders for value of the bill of lading, after Mees

Pierson paid the sellers/the sellers' bank on the letter of credit.</p>
<p align="justify">61.        The sections of the Bills

of Lading Act/Carriage of Goods by Sea Act referred to above are set out below:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">2 (1) Subject to

    the following provisions of this section, a person who becomes —</p>
<p align="justify">(a) the lawful holder of a bill of lading;</p>
<p align="justify">shall (by virtue of becoming the holder of the bill or, as the case may

    be, the person to whom delivery is to be made) have transferred to and vested in him all

    rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract.</p>
<p align="justify">………………… </p>
<p align="justify">………………….</p>
<p align="justify">5) Where rights are transferred by virtue of the operation of

    subsection (1) in relation to any document, the transfer for which that subsection

    provides shall extinguish any entitlement to those rights which derives —</p>
<p align="justify">(a) where that document is a bill of lading, from a person's having

    been an original party to the contract of carriage; </p>
<p align="justify">but the operation of that subsection shall be without prejudice to any

    rights which derive from a person's having been an original party to the contract

    contained in, or evidenced by, a sea waybill and, in relation to a ship's delivery order,

    shall be without prejudice to any rights deriving otherwise than from the previous

    operation of that subsection in relation to that order. </p>
<p align="justify">5 — (2) References in this Act to the holder of a bill of lading

    are references to any of the following persons:-</p>
<p align="justify">(a) a person with possession of the bill who, by virtue of being the

    person identified in the bill, is the consignee of the goods to which the bill relates;</p>
<p align="justify">and a person shall be regarded for the purposes of this Act as having

    become the lawful holder of a bill of lading wherever he has become the holder of the bill

    in good faith.</p>
</font></blockquote></blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">62.        Having reviewed the cases

cited by both parties, I am of the view that the parties should be held to their agreement

under the IGPA Rules to apply Singapore/English law to this claim. The cargo was sold

C&amp;F to the plaintiffs; the sellers were responsible for shipment and hence, the

carrier was the seller's agent under Article 1792 of the Indonesian Civil Code.

Consequently, title did not/could not have passed to the plaintiffs until after they had

paid for the cargo, well after the bills of lading were endorsed to them for the purpose

of taking delivery. Even if Indonesian law applies to the claim because:</p>
<p align="justify">(i) the cargo was purchased from an Indonesian seller, and </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) was lost in Indonesian waters;</p>
<p align="justify">the fact remains that Article 1338 of the Indonesian Civil Code allows

the parties to contract out of Indonesian law. Moreover, even Article 517(a) of the

Indonesian Commercial Code states that delivery of a bill of lading before goods are

delivered is considered as delivery of the said goods.</p>
<p align="justify">63.        As for the testimony of

Achmad and the plaintiffs' argument that, there is a difference between claims in contract

(where English law is to be applied) and tort/negligence (where Indonesian law applies

because of the connecting factors with Indonesia), I do not think that proposition of law

is supported by the decision in the <i>East West</i> case. It should be noted that in that

case the Maersk bill of lading was an exception to the rule that, endorsement of the other

bills of lading passed title to the banks named as consignees therein. Here, the bill of

lading named the plaintiffs as the notify party, while the sellers' bank was named the

consignee or to order. Mees Pierson was obliged to pay the sellers' bank within 14 days of

receipt after the bill of lading date (27 January 2000) namely by 9 February 2000. As it

was, the plaintiffs paid on or about 23 February 2000. The sellers had clearly reserved

their title. Even if it can be said that mere delivery of the bill of lading constituted

passing of title, on the plaintiffs' own testimony, the bill of lading was only received

by them on or about 4 February 2000. Whether the claim lies in contract or in tort, the

plaintiffs have no locus standi to sue unless they were the owners of the cargo as at the

date of the loss.</p>
<p align="justify">64.        As for the references to

Rule 116 in <i>Dicey &amp; Morris</i> by the plaintiffs, it would appear from both <i>Benjamin's

Sale of Goods</i> and the exception to Rule 116, that the <i>lex situs</i> principle would

not apply to goods in transit. </p>
<p align="justify">65.        If the

double-actionability rule is applied, the plaintiffs would again fail as, the claim in

tort would not have succeeded either in Singapore or in England. Consequently, I answer

the preliminary issue in the negative and hold that the plaintiffs had no title to the

cargo and hence, no right of action as at 1 February 2000, against the defendants.

Accordingly, the plaintiffs' claim is dismissed with costs to the defendants.</p>
