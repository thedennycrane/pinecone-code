</div> According to the plaintiff, it was only sometime in April 2017 that it discovered that the defendant was reproducing listings from the PG website pursuant to the PA Service. No step was taken to amend the pleadings. Yet, at the trial, the plaintiff adduced evidence of the copying of one property listing with nine photographs by a property agent, Ms Tong, from the PG website to the 99 website by way of the PA Service (“the PA Service reproduction”). At the appropriate junctures below, I will consider the implications of this failure to plead the matters in relation to the PA Service, as well as other deficiencies in the plaintiff’s pleadings.

It is not disputed by the parties that the purpose of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the objectively-ascertained expressed intentions of the contracting parties as it emerges from the contextual meaning of the relevant contractual language. In line with this, a number of key principles must be borne in mind. First, both the text sought to be interpreted and its context must be considered. Second, it is the objectively-ascertained intentions of the parties, and not their subjective intentions, which are relevant. Third, given that the object of interpretation is the verbal expressions used by the parties, the text of their agreement is of first importance: see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 at [30]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Although Mr Rautiainen and Mr Cheung were cross-examined as to what they thought the meanings of certain terms in the Settlement Agreement were, I do not think these exchanges are material in interpreting the disputed clauses.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, the defendant breached cl 2.1(a), but only in respect of the PA Service reproduction, and not in respect of the January and February 2016 reproductions. I will make three observations about cl 2.1(a) before explaining why I take this view.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Meaning of “the Content” in Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 My first observation concerns the dispute over the meaning of “Content”. I find that “Content” refers to listings that had already been reproduced by the defendant prior to the date of the Settlement Agreement. In this regard, I agree with the plaintiff’s position as set out at [34(b)] above. This is for two reasons. First, the word “Content” is defined in the preamble as referring to content that the defendant “had accessed and reproduced”. The use of the past tense is significant as it suggests that the “Content” referred to is what has already been reproduced by the defendant, and not what might be reproduced by the defendant in future. Second, the phrase “Content” is also used in cll 2.1(c) and (d). Pursuant to these clauses, the defendant was obliged to delete “any of the Content” from its website and destroy materials prepared based on such “Content”. Again, this suggests that “Content” refers to what had already been reproduced before entering into the Settlement Agreement. There is really no reason to impose an obligation on the defendant to delete what it would copy in future given that the whole point of the Settlement Agreement is to prevent it from continuing to copy any listings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  However, it should be noted that cl 2.1(a) obliges the defendant not to reproduce “any of the <span class="font-italic">Content</span>”, as well as “any <span class="font-italic">contents</span> found on <span class="font-italic">any website</span> owned by [the plaintiff]” [emphasis added]. It is evident that this latter phrase is to prevent the defendant from reproducing any listing found on the PG website, even those which are posted after the date of the Settlement Agreement. I digress to state that it is my view that the January and February 2016 reproductions and the PA Service reproduction are of “<span class="font-italic">contents</span>” (and not of “<span class="font-italic">Content</span>”). These materials were clearly posted on the PG website after the date of the Settlement Agreement.

</div>
</div> In other words, the defendant had a grace period of 30 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my view, on an objective reading of cl 2.1, both these interpretations do not appear to be correct. One should not assume that the period for compliance is the same in respect of cll 2.1(a), (b), (c) and (d). The addition of “<span class="font-italic">where applicable</span>” at the end of the phrase “within 30 days of the date of this agreement, and where applicable” suggests that there are certain sub-clauses under cl 2.1(a) for which there had to be compliance within 30 days, whereas this period might not be applicable to other obligations. In particular, it seems to me that the period would not be applicable to continuing obligations. As to which obligations are continuing obligations and which are not, the answer must be derived by looking at each sub-clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is evident to me that cll 2.1(c) and (d), under which the defendant had to delete the Content from the 99 website and destroy copies made of the Content, contain the obligations that had to be executed within the fixed 30-day period. These obligations relate to the Content which led to the Settlement Agreement, and should be completed within the given period. To allow the defendant an indefinite period of time for compliance would make the obligation a hollow one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As for cll 2.1(a) and (b), these appear to me to contain continuing obligations. Broadly speaking, cl 2.1(a) is meant to stop the defendant from reproducing the contents of the PG website. The Settlement Agreement would be of very limited utility if the defendant only had to cease doing so for 30 days. Hence, the obligation within cl 2.1(a) must necessarily be a continuing one. As for cl 2.1(b), likewise, it imposes a negative obligation (an obligation on the defendant <span class="font-italic">not</span> to do something that the plaintiff took objection to). It would also make sense for this to be a continuing obligation rather than one that only needed to be complied with for a fixed, and somewhat brief, period of time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conduct meant to be regulated by the Settlement Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 My third observation is about the kind of conduct cl 2.1(a) is meant to regulate. I find that cl 2.1(a) is meant to prevent the defendant from taking listings from the PG website and reproducing them on the 99 website. It is not intended to make the defendant liable for all “Content” or “contents” found on the 99 website regardless of who had reproduced them. The following are my two reasons for saying this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The first is the contractual language. Clause 2.1(a) says that the defendant cannot ““whether <span class="font-italic">by itself</span> or by <span class="font-italic">its</span> affiliate companies, affiliate websites, administrators, officers, managers, and/or agents, substantially reproduce” either the Content or any contents [emphasis added]. The exception to cl 2.1(a) begins with “nothing precludes [the defendant] from taking…”. All this plainly means that it is the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span>, as someone capable of accessing the PG website just like any other individual or property agent, who is not allowed to substantially reproduce Content or contents. As a corporate entity, the defendant is liable if such reproduction is done by anyone who is under its control, such as its administrator, officer, manager and/or agent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The second reason has to do with the background to the Settlement Agreement. It was the defendant’s scraping of listings from the PG website which led to the Settlement Agreement. This is recorded in the preamble where it is stated that what led to the Settlement Agreement was the accessing and reproducing of contents “<span class="font-italic">by [the defendant]</span>” [emphasis added]. It would be consistent with that background to the Settlement Agreement to read cl 2.1(a) as only restricting the defendant or anyone who is under its control from actively reproducing contents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this regard, I note that cl 2.1(a) prohibits the defendant from reproducing Content or contents by itself or “by its… <span class="font-italic">agents</span>”, and that the exception states that “nothing herein precludes 99 from taking Content pertaining to a user or <span class="font-italic">agent</span> pursuant to the user or <span class="font-italic">agent’s</span> request”. In my view, the word “agent” is used in two different senses in the same clause. In the former instance, “agent” refers to a person with whom the defendant has the legal relationship of principal and agent, one which is analogous to the relationship it has with an “officer” or “manager”. In the latter instance (within the exception), “agent” refers to a “property agent”, one who is a “user” of the website just like any other individual who accesses the 99 website to post or view listings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I reject the plaintiff’s submission that the property agents should be regarded as the defendant’s “agents in law”, thus making the defendant liable as principal for their actions.

</div> In law, an agent is one who performs an act on behalf of another, being the principal, and whose acts are intended to affect the principal’s legal relations with third parties.

As such, I find that there is no breach of cl 2.1(a) by the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I should start by giving more details of the January and February 2016 reproductions. These comprised 41 listings in January 2016 and 30 listings in February 2016.

As for the remaining photographs which do not contain the plaintiff’s watermark, the photographs on the 99 website appear identical to the photographs on the PG website. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 At this juncture, I pause to elaborate why I am of the view that the listings in these reproductions form “contents”, and not “Content”, within the meaning of the Settlement Agreement (see [38] above). As explained by Mr Rautiainen, the watermark found on these photographs was a new version, and was introduced by the plaintiff in or around December 2015 after refinements made to the previous version. After the signing of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff continued monitoring the 99 website. Then, it discovered the January and February 2016 reproductions.

</div> From the evidence, it seems clear to me that the listings were posted on the PG website after the Settlement Agreement. Contrary to the primary argument by the plaintiff (see [34(b)]), these listings form “contents” within the meaning of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 With that said, what is more critical is that it is unclear just <span class="font-italic">how</span> the January and February 2016 reproductions came to appear on the 99 website. Prior to 6 February 2016, the Xpressor Platform would not remove the plaintiff’s watermark when cross-posting listings. Sometime after 6 February 2016, MPG modified the Xpressor Platform such that when listings were cross-posted from the PG website to the 99 website, the watermark on the photographs would automatically be removed.

Instead, these <span class="font-italic">could have</span> <span class="font-italic">been</span> reproduced using the Xpressor Platform or some other means.

</div> The possibility that the photographs appeared on the 99 website because of these other applications cannot be ruled out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning to the listings with photographs without the watermark, it is still possible that the property agents had used the Xpressor Platform, and not the Xpressor App, to cross-post them. All but one of these listings was posted in February 2016. That coincided with the time when the change was made to the Xpressor Platform to ensure that watermarks would be removed from photographs that were reproduced from the PG website as per Mr Koh’s testimony. Quite apart from this, it is possible that the property agents had used other means, including other mobile applications to cross-post listings, and that such mobile applications similarly would remove the watermark, thereby resulting in the reproductions without the watermark on 99 website. I should also add that the evidence was that the Xpressor App was not available for downloading around end January 2016 (see [20]). In this regard, the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence from any of the property agents concerned to explain how the cross-postings from the PG website to the 99 website might have taken place. The plaintiff could have done this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Be that as it may, it is strictly not necessary for the purpose of the plaintiff’s claim for breach of cl 2.1(a) to decide definitively how the January and February 2016 reproductions came to appear on the 99 website. Even assuming that all the January and February 2016 reproductions were brought about as a result of the use of the Xpressor App, it does not show, in my judgment, that it was the defendant who reproduced the listings, in the sense I have referred to above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was the defendant who actively cross-posted the listings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant should be regarded as having “reproduced” the listings because it had developed and marketed the Xpressor App, as well as hosted the Xpressor App on its server.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Based on the evidence, I rule out the possibility that the appearance of Ms Tong’s listing with the nine photographs on the 99 website was due to her having cross-posted it, either by herself or using some other application with cross-posting functionalities. Unlike the January and February 2016 reproductions, I am satisfied that the PA Service reproduction was carried out by the defendant pursuant to the PA Service. By doing such an act, the defendant had reproduced “any contents” on its website and thus breached cl 2.1(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 This brings me to the defendant’s argument that it can avail itself of the exception to cl 2.1(a) (see [35(c)] above). In my view, it cannot do so. On a plain reading of the exception, it is clear that the exception only allows the defendant to take “Content”, being listings uploaded before 28 September 2015, pursuant to a user or agent’s request. The PA Service reproduction was of “contents” and not “Content” because Ms Tong’s listing was posted on the PG website after the date of the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, the exception does not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62  I should note that the plaintiff’s watermark was removed from the nine photographs on the 99 website, and that the nine photographs also carry an <span class="font-italic">additional </span>watermark in the centre of each photograph showing the property agent’s name. The additional watermark was added by the defendant. However, in my view, this still means that cl 2.1(a) was breached because the defendant’s obligation was not to “substantially reproduce” the contents on the PG website. The reproduction of the photographs, albeit without the plaintiff’s watermark and with the defendant’s additional watermark, constituted a substantial reproduction of the photographs as they appeared on the PG website.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The pleading point </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As alluded to at [25] above, the plaintiff does not specifically plead the availability of the PA Service and the PA Service reproduction. Further, I also observe that the plaintiff pleads that the defendant has been substantially reproducing and continuing to substantially reproduce “Content” (as defined in the Settlement Agreement)” (see [26] above), and does not specifically plead the reproduction of “contents”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is trite that pleadings play an important part in an action, and that the primary purpose of pleadings is to identify the issues in dispute so as to inform the parties of the case to be met. The heart of a claim of breach of contract is the term alleged to have been breached, and the act<span class="font-italic"> </span>in breach of the term. In the Statement of Claim, cl 2.1(a) of the Settlement Agreement is set out in full (which refers both to “Content” and “contents”). As I stated above, the January and February 2016 reproductions (particularised in support of the claim) constituted “contents”, rather than “Content”. As such, I am of the view that the ambit of the plaintiff’s pleading covers the reproduction of “contents”, as well as “Content” within cl 2.1(a). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Next, the <span class="font-italic">act </span>in breach of cl 2.1(a) is that of reproduction, and the plaintiff has, in effect, pleaded that defendant <span class="font-italic">continues </span>to reproduce materials. In my view, the PA Service reproduction is a further act of reproduction, and falls within the allegation of continuing reproduction by the defendant. Also, it is not strictly necessary to plead that such reproduction was carried out pursuant to the PA Service. The details relating to the PA Service serves to explain why and how the defendant came to reproduce the material, and form evidence of the surrounding circumstances which need not be pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Even if I were to be wrong on the above, I note that a court may depart from the parties’ pleadings in limited circumstances: that is, where no prejudice is caused to the other party in the trial or where it would be clearly unjust for the court not to do so (where, for example, both parties have come to court prepared to deal with the unpleaded issue), though such situations are likely to be uncommon (<span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithnilingam and another </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [40]–[41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In my view, it is not prejudicial to the defendant for the PA Service reproduction to be considered. After all, the defendant takes the position that there should not be any distinction between the “Content” and “contents” (see [35(b)]), and simply frames the issue in dispute as one of whether the defendant is to be liable for the reproduction and continued reproduction of the materials from the PG website. Specifically, the defendant does not dispute the provision of the PA Service, or any copying which might have occurred pursuant to the PA Service. It contends that such conduct is permissible because the property agents have requested for such copying (see [35(c)]). Thus, the defendant was well prepared to meet the allegations at the trial, and it would not be unjust to take on board the further act of reproduction by way of the PA Service.     </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant breached cl 2.1(b) </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Pursuant to cl 2.1(b), the defendant is not allowed to: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… connect to, for the purposes of posting property listings and/or any other information on, the Website, or any website owned by PropertyGuru, through any of 99’s websites, programs, applications, servers, or services or authorise any of its clients, users, affiliate companies, affiliate websites, administrators, officers, managers and/or agents to do the same;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The plaintiff submits

</div> that cl 2.1(b) is meant to prevent the defendant from connecting to the plaintiff’s websites to post listings and/or post any other information. The defendant neither connected to the PG website (since it was the end users of the Xpressor App who did so), much less posted any listings or other information on the PG website. Hence, the defendant did not breach cl 2.1(b). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I agree with the defendant. In my view, the reading put forth by the plaintiff is a strained one. It would not only require separating the verb “posting” from “any other information”, but would also involve reading in “copying” or “cross-posting”, such that the obligation on the defendant becomes that of not connecting to the PG website for the purposes of either: (1) “posting property listings”, and/or (2) “[copying/cross-posting] any other information”. I acknowledge that the meaning that the plaintiff attempts to shoehorn into the words of cl 2.1(b) would be consistent with the purpose of the Settlement Agreement which is to prevent the defendant from actively taking listings from the PG website by use of technological means. However, that is not a meaning which can be gleaned from the plain words of the text of cl 2.1(b), and it is the text that must be of first importance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In my view, the meaning of “connect to, for the purposes of posting property listings and/or any other information on, the Website,” is that the defendant undertakes “not to connect to <span class="font-italic">the Website</span>, for the purposes of posting property listings and/or other information on <span class="font-italic">the Website</span>…” Admittedly, the drafting of cl 2.1(b) is somewhat odd, and the clarity could have been improved with the repetition of the words “<span class="font-italic">the Website</span>” within the provision (as I have set out). Nonetheless, its meaning is clear enough. There is no evidence that the defendant posted any listings or information on the plaintiff’s websites. Therefore, there is no basis for the plaintiff to allege a breach of cl 2.1(b). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant breached cll 2.1(c) and (d)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I can deal with these alleged breaches summarily. The plaintiff argues that the defendant has breached cll 2.1(c) and (d) because it has not taken steps to prevent copying of property listings via the Xpressor App. Such steps include the blocking of the posting to the 99 website via the Xpressor App.

</div> The plaintiff’s argument fails on a number of fronts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 First, the breach of cll 2.1(c) and (d) is not pleaded.

</div> Third, and in any event, cll 2.1(c) and (d) oblige the defendant to take action in respect of “Content”, being contents uploaded before the date of the Settlement Agreement.

However, the plaintiff does not plead the particular breaches of contract which the defendant was supposed to have induced. The plaintiff merely alleges that the Xpressor App has been used by an “unquantifiable number” of end users. This appears to be an incomplete pleading because it only identifies the act of inducement, and not the particular breach or breaches of contract by way of the use of the Xpressor App which the defendant had induced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In its closing submissions, as breaches of contract induced, the plaintiff relies first, on the January and February 2016 reproductions <span class="font-italic">alleged</span><span class="font-italic">ly made using the Xpressor App</span>, and second, on the PA Service reproduction.

</div>
</div> I will address these in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The January and February 2016 reproductions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, the plaintiff’s claim as regards the January and February 2016 reproductions fails completely. Assuming for the moment that the property agents had indeed posted the January and February 2016 reproductions on the 99 website using the Xpressor App, they could have been in breach of the Terms of Use and the Acceptable Use Policy. For one, they could have been in breach of cl 10.1 of the Terms of Use, which prohibits users from reproducing materials such as “graphics” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the photographs) without the plaintiff’s consent (see [77] above). Quite plainly, they would also have been in breach of cll 21 and 22 of the Acceptable Use Policy because the Xpressor App is an “automation software…designed to access…PG’s Services” and also an “unauthorised third party software that…collects information …through [the plaintiff]” (see [78] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The key question, however, is whether it has been shown that the January and February 2016 reproductions were actually made as a result of the property agents’ use of the Xpressor App. Without proof of this critical link, there is no point in considering whether, in law, by making available the Xpressor App to the property agents for their use, the defendant had induced the alleged breaches. Here, the plaintiff’s case runs into difficulty.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 To reiterate, the evidence simply does not show that the January and February 2016 reproductions were made using the Xpressor App. I have discussed this in detail at [53] to [55], and would adopt in entirety what I said above. In the closing submissions, the plaintiff submits that it was for the defendant to explain how the listings and photographs came to be on the 99 website, if not by the use of the Xpressor App. I disagree. It was for the plaintiff to prove its assertion that the property agents used the Xpressor App to reproduce the 71 listings. For instance, it was open to the plaintiff to gather such evidence from the property agents, in the same way that Ms Tong was approached for information about how her listings came to be posted on the 99 website. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As it stands, the plaintiff’s claim fails for the reason it has not been proven that there is a causal link between the defendant’s alleged act of inducement and the alleged breaches. Without proving this, the plaintiff’s claim is unsustainable. As such, I shall not go further to consider the other aspects of this claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The PA Service reproduction  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I turn then to the use of the PA service and the PA Service reproduction. The fundamental difficulty is that in its Statement of Claim, the plaintiff does not refer to the PA service as a means by which the defendant had induced end users to breach the Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 As I stated above, a court may depart from the parties’ pleadings in limited circumstances (see [66]). However, I am not persuaded that this is such an instance. The plaintiff pleads in detail that the defendant had induced a breach of contract by means of making available the Xpressor App. However, the plaintiff now wants to take the position that the defendant had also induced Ms Tong to breach her contract with the plaintiff by means of the PA Service. This is a very different <span class="font-italic">act</span> of inducement. The plaintiff’s attempt to pin liability on the defendant based on the distinct act of inducement strays very far from the case advanced in the pleadings. At no time did the plaintiff seek to amend its Statement of Claim. The plaintiff had time and opportunity to do so. It is bound by its decision not to do so. It would be unfair to the defendant for this distinct act of inducement to be considered, and I decline to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Infringement of copyright</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Turning to the copyright infringement claim, the plaintiff pleads that it owns the photographs bearing the watermark “PropertyGuru.com.sg”,

</div> In my view, the plaintiff’s claim of copyright infringement in the watermark is a marked departure from its pleaded case.

As to when copyright subsists in such works which are derived from other works, I was referred to three cases which are instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In <span class="font-italic">Interlego AG v Tyco Industries Inc </span>[1989] AC 217 (“<span class="font-italic">Interlego</span>”), the Privy Council was asked to determine whether copies of design drawings of toy blocks, which were not visually different from the original drawings, but which had modifications to the written information on them for manufacturing purposes, were original artistic works and therefore copyrightable. Lord Oliver held that copying <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, regardless of how much skill and labour was devoted to the process, does not result in an original work (at 705), and added that there must be “an element of material alteration or embellishment which suffices to make the totality of the work an original work”. This was qualified by the view that “even a relatively small alteration or addition quantitatively may, if material, suffice to convert that which is substantially copied from an earlier work into an original work” (at 706). However, the Privy Council held that that it was “not sufficient to confer originality upon them that labour and skill was employed in the process of copying them or in the addition to them of fresh written manufacturing instructions” (at 711). In other words, even with the addition of new technical information, the copied drawings were not original works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In <span class="font-italic">The Reject Shop Plc v Robert Manners </span>[1995] FSR 870 (“<span class="font-italic">Reject Shop</span>”), the English High Court held that no copyright subsisted in photocopied and enlarged versions of copyrighted drawings. Leggatt LJ held that the photocopying of the drawings “did not result in a depiction substantially different from the drawings themselves”. The copying did not involve any “skill and labour as conferred originality of an artistic character” and the process was “wholly mechanical” (at 876).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Suncool International Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span>”) stands as a contrast to the above two cases. The plaintiff in that case turned raw cartographic data into maps that were fully coloured, readable and interactive. Lai Kew Chai J noted that the contrast between the cartographic vector data and the resulting map was “marked”. The plaintiff had added building names, locations, road networks, traffic directions, and full colour (at [12]). Citing <span class="font-italic">Interlego</span>, Lai J held that the plaintiff had met the test set out therein, namely that there was in its maps “an addition of some element of material alteration or embellishment which suffices to make the totality of the work an original work” (at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In summary, the copying, enlargement or resizing of an artistic work, such as a drawing, painting or photograph, does not make the resulting image a copyrighted work. There must be a material alteration or embellishment to the original work to confer originality (and hence copyright protection) on the resulting work. What counts as “material” for this purpose is a question of fact and degree. There was some alteration in <span class="font-italic">Interlego</span>, namely the addition of  new written information to the drawing, but this was insufficient to confer originality on what was otherwise a visually similar copy of an image. On the other hand, <span class="font-italic">Virtual Map</span> provided a clear example of a material alteration. While the alteration in that case was extremely substantial, it does not mean that alterations to an original work must necessarily be to a similar degree before the derivative work becomes original and copyrightable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 That brings me to the plaintiff’s watermarked photographs. In my judgment, they are not original works which attract copyright protection. Leaving aside the watermark, I would hold, by analogy to the result in <span class="font-italic">Reject Shop</span>, that the alterations to the original photographs in the form of resizing, tweaking the light balance and softening the edges did not result in images substantially different from the original photographs. I have compared the original photographs used by Ms Tong in her property listings (these were the only original photographs furnished by the plaintiff) with those that were uploaded onto the listings she posted on the PG website. Apart from the change in size, there is barely any discernible difference between each original photograph and its image. Absent the watermark, one would find it difficult to tell which is the original photograph and which is the modified photograph. I do not mean to say that digital editing of a photograph can never result in an altered image which is an original work in its own right. The technical possibilities for editing an image are now fairly advanced. Conceivably, a photograph might be so substantially altered, in a manner which obviously required much skill and labour of an artistic nature as to qualify for copyright protection. On the facts of this particular case, however, the original and watermarked photographs are, if not for the watermark, virtually indistinguishable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The addition of the watermark does not, in my judgment, make the altered image an original work. The watermark “PropertyGuru.com.sg” is in a grey rectangular box which also consists of the property agent’s name. This watermark (if one looks at the entire box) merely supplies information to the viewer of the photograph, in the same way as the written information in the design drawings considered in <span class="font-italic">Interlego</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did. It is true that the positioning of the watermark is a matter of judgment, with the plaintiff having considered various possible locations for the watermark

</div>
</div>
</div> before deciding on the present position on the lower right hand side of a photograph, and that the addition of the watermark to the photograph involves some skill and labour. However, it remains the case that the watermark is meant to serve to identify a photograph as one which has been posted on the PG website. The skill and labour is not deployed towards making a difference to the artistic nature of the photograph. Therefore, on the whole, I fail to see how the resulting watermarked image is a materially different image from the original photograph as to render it a copyrightable work in itself. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The contract argument </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The clauses in the Terms of Service relied on by the plaintiff do not add anything to the plaintiff’s claim for ownership of copyright of the watermarked photographs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The plaintiff has relied on cll 3.3, 3.4 and 10.1 of both the old and new Terms of Service. Cll 3.3 and 3.4 of the old and new Terms of Service were identical and imposed on the end user an obligation not to reproduce “PG Material” (which would include the watermarked photographs) on another website. These clauses only regulate the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the end user and say nothing about whether the plaintiff would own the copyright in the watermarked photographs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Clause 10.1 of the new Terms of Service states that by uploading the photographs, the end users warrant that the end users “own the copyright of the Content and thus have the requisite rights to licence it to [the plaintiff]”. It goes on to state that the plaintiff would have the right to watermark the photographs and the copyright in the final watermarked photographs would belong to the plaintiff (see [77]). The plaintiff’s assertion in cl 10.1 that the watermarked photographs are copyrighted does not make it so. When challenged, it would be a question to be determined by the court whether copyright subsists in the watermarked photographs. As I have found, there is no copyright subsisting in the watermarked photographs to begin with. Clause 10.1 does nothing to further the plaintiff’s claim that it owns copyright in the watermarked photographs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 What I said is also true of cl 10.1 of the old Terms of Service. The material part of that clause reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We reserve all intellectual property rights to the Website and PG Material, including international copyright and trade mark rights. All other names, products and marks mentioned are the intellectual property rights of their respective owners. No materials provided through the Website, including text, graphics, code, ratings, rankings, databases, aggregated information, PG Material and/or software may be reproduced, modified, adapted, distributed, published, displayed, uploaded, posted, transmitted or hyperlinked in any form without our express, prior written approval, and the approval of the respective copyright and trade mark holders. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Again, this only means that if the watermarked photographs are indeed protected by copyright, any end user who infringes that copyright would be liable to the plaintiff not just for infringement but for breaching cl 10.1. Nonetheless, cl 10.1 has no bearing on whether copyright subsists in the watermarked photographs in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In summary, I do not find that there is copyright in the watermarked photographs. For completeness, I should add that it should be cl 10.1 of the old Terms of Service which would apply to the January and February 2016 reproductions. Strangely, the plaintiff pleaded cl 10.1 of the new Terms of Service as the applicable provision. This is another instance of poor pleading on the part of the plaintiff.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Groundless threats of infringement proceedings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 This leaves me to deal with the defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff for having made groundless threats of copyright infringement. For this purpose, the defendant relies on s 200 of the Copyright Act. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Groundless threats of legal proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">200.—(1) Where a person, by means of circulars, advertisements or otherwise, threatens a person with an action or proceeding in respect of an infringement of copyright, then, whether the person making the threats is or is not the owner of the copyright or an exclusive licensee, a person aggrieved may bring an action against the first-mentioned person and may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) obtain a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) obtain an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) recover such damages, if any, as he has sustained,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">unless the first-mentioned person satisfies the court that the acts in respect of which the action or proceeding was threatened constituted, or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of copyright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The legal principles pertaining to s 200 of the Copyright Act are well settled following the Court of Appeal decisions of <span class="font-italic">Singsung Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 4 SLR 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Singsung</span>”) and, more recently in <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages Ltd v Promedia Directories Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 2 SLR 185 (“<span class="font-italic">GYP</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In general, a provision such as s 200 (there are similar provisions in other intellectual property legislation) represents a balance between protecting copyright on one hand and preventing right-holders from using the threat of legal proceedings directed at their customers or competitors as a bullying tactic to chill their legitimate activities on the other (<span class="font-italic">Singsung </span>at [129]). Section 200 “is meant to provide a statutory remedy for aggrieved parties whose business or reputation might be affected by threats emanating from another party without the need to prove the bad faith of the threatening party” (<span class="font-italic">Singsung</span> at [133]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Although the reference to groundless threats sent in “circulars, advertisements, or otherwise” seems to suggest communications addressed to a sizeable number of people, the Court of Appeal has accepted that, in principle, the threat of infringement proceedings sent in private letters of demand to a potential defendant may also give rise to relief under s 200. This the Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span> at [148] (and reaffirmed in <span class="font-italic">GYP</span>) when it considered the possibility of granting relief under s 200 based on two letters of demand that the plaintiff there had sent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 That said, relief under s 200 is discretionary. It does not follow that the court must grant relief where an allegation of copyright infringement has failed (<span class="font-italic">Singsung </span>at [148]). The factors relevant to deciding whether to grant relief under s 200 include whether the action was warranted, whether any conceivable damage flowed from the demand being made, the costs consequences from the failed action, and whether relief is required at all (<span class="font-italic">GYP </span>at [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In the present case, the defendant pleads that a letter of demand sent by the plaintiff on 10 March 2016 contained a groundless threat of infringement proceedings.

</div> deals not only with the claim for infringement of copyright, but the claims for breach of the Settlement Agreement and inducement of breach of contract as well. The defendant seeks a declaration that the threats contained therein are unjustifiable, an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from continuing to make similar threats and damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I decline to grant relief under s 200. I am guided mainly by the following considerations. First, I do not think that the plaintiff’s threat of commencing legal proceedings was unwarranted. The plaintiff’s belief that the defendant’s reproduction of the contents (which would include the photographs) on the PG website had infringed its copyright was recorded in the Settlement Agreement. Although there was no admission of liability for any copyright infringement, in the Settlement Agreement, the defendant undertook not to reproduce contents from the PG website in the future. Given that the defendant had done precisely that, there was sufficient basis for the plaintiff to think that it might be justifiable to commence proceedings for copyright infringement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Second, I do not think the defendant suffered any loss as a result of the threat of infringement proceedings over and above that which can be compensated for by a costs order against the plaintiff. The defendant alleges that the threat of the law suit affected its ability to obtain funding and strained its relationships with its investors.

</div> However, apart from this assertion, no evidence has been produced to substantiate this claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Third, as I have dismissed the plaintiff’s claim for copyright infringement, an injunction to prevent the plaintiff from making further threats in future is not necessary.
