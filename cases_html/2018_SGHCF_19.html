R, who is nine years old, has lived with the Mother in Singapore for the past eight years. The Father lives in New Zealand with his wife and their two children. The Mother, who is unmarried, applied to the Family Court for permission for R to relocate to London with her. The Father opposed R’s relocation to London on various grounds, including that it would adversely affect his relationship with R by making it more difficult for him to spend time with and contact R. The District Judge refused the application and the Mother appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The facts of this case are unlike most other relocation applications, where relocation would result in the physical separation of the child from the non-relocating parent. In this case, the Father and R have not lived in the same country for the past eight years. The parties were unable to find any authorities in which the non-relocating parent lived in a different country from the child. As will be seen, I considered this living arrangement significant in reaching my decision on the facts of this case. Having considered all the circumstances of the case, I take the view that relocation should be allowed, and therefore allow the Mother’s appeal. The reasons for my decision are set out herein.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Mother is Singaporean and resides in Singapore, where she works in a senior position in the legal department of a subsidiary of a multinational company. The Father, who is an Irish citizen, lives with the woman he married and their two children in New Zealand. He is a consultant in a property development consultancy company and also the Chief Executive Officer of another property investment company there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 R was born in Australia in July 2009. Two months later, the Mother returned to Singapore with R. The Father remained in New Zealand but visited Singapore twice or thrice between September 2009 and January 2010.

However, the parties continued their relationship, and the Father visited the Mother and R in Singapore at least once every three months. In 2012, the Mother informed the Father’s wife about her and R’s existence and their relationship to the Father. Until then, the Father had not told his wife about them.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 5 October 2017, the Mother applied to the Family Court by way of Summons (Family Justice Courts) No 3409 of 2017 pursuant to s 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev Ed) for a variation of the Consent Order, amongst other things. In particular, she sought permission for R to relocate to London with her from December 2017, as well as amendments to the access arrangements recorded in the Consent Order. The District Judge refused the application for relocation on 11 December 2017 and gave the grounds of her decision on 23 March 2018 in <span class="font-italic">UKZ v ULA</span> [2018] SGFC 32 (“the GD”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I now briefly outline the parties’ cases before summarising the reasons for the District Judge’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Mother’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Mother argued that, should she not relocate, her career path would stagnate. She would risk being overlooked for promotions, and might even be at risk of losing her job. Although she might be able to be re-employed, she would most likely suffer a pay cut. Moreover, if she remained employed in Singapore, her current work schedule would affect her health and she might burn out. Since her well-being and financial circumstances had a direct impact on R, any adverse impact on her career and health would likewise affect him negatively (the GD at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On the other hand, if she and R relocated to London, the Mother would be able to spend more quality time with him, which would benefit him. She would also hire nannies and housekeepers for support (the GD at [20]). The move would give R an opportunity to be closer to the Father’s family in Ireland and learn more about his European heritage (the GD at [21]). The Mother had also enrolled R in a London school which offered the International Baccalaureate Programme (“IB programme”) (like R’s Singapore school), had an after-school soccer programme and a nearby park, and which she described as “intimate and caring” (the GD at [23] and [37]). The Mother sought to minimise the significance of any disruption to R’s life by characterising him as young and easily adaptable, and by emphasising that she was R’s sense of security on a day-to-day basis and his primary caregiver (the GD at [38]). Moreover, R’s friends were mostly international students and might themselves relocate one day (the GD at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As for R’s relationship with the Father, the Mother did not dispute that this was a loving one. However, she submitted that the 12-hour time difference between New Zealand and London would allow calls between them before R slept and before the Father went to work (R would sleep at 9pm London time, which was 9am New Zealand time). She further alleged that the Father had business interests in London, such that travelling to London to meet R would pose no inconvenience to him. Moreover, she was willing to offer the Father even more access than currently provided in the Consent Order (the GD at [22], [25] and [39]). The Mother further pointed out that the Father had in 2015 and 2016 agreed for R to relocate to London, thus implicitly recognising that it was in R’s best interests (the GD at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Father’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Father disputed the Mother’s claim that relocation would give her a better work-life balance. He claimed that she “relished” the nature of her work and its long hours. Her claims of ill health were unsubstantiated and could in any event be addressed by restructuring her current role or seeking alternative employment in Singapore (the GD at [28] and [29]). Even if she relocated, there was no evidence that she would have a lighter workload or more quality time with R (the GD at [35] and [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Father further submitted that it would be traumatising for R to be uprooted from Singapore, where his family and friends were, particularly as the Mother did not intend to bring R’s other caregivers (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the maternal grandmother and helper) to London with her (the GD at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Father also feared that relocation would reduce his access to R. Instead of taking a ten-hour flight from New Zealand to Singapore to visit R, the Father would have to fly at least 30 hours one way from New Zealand to London. This would make regular physical contact impractical. The Father denied having business interests in London. The 12-hour time difference was also not conducive for remote access, as either one of them would be rushing to school or work, given that R sleeps at 9pm (the GD at [25], [31] and [33]). As for prior plans for R to relocate to London, those plans envisaged the Father, the Mother and R living together in London as a family. Now that the parties were no longer together, those plans had fallen apart (the GD at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Father also did not approve of the school the Mother had enrolled R in, as it lacked outdoor areas or physical education facilities, whereas R was active and enjoyed playing soccer. The school was found to have failed independent school standards and did not feature on recent IB league tables. Moreover, the accommodation which the Mother sought was located in an area that had been subjected to a number of terrorist attacks (the GD at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The District Judge’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The District Judge rightly recognised that the welfare of the child is paramount in relocation applications (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> [2015] 3 SLR 973 (“<span class="font-italic">BNS v </span><span class="font-italic">BNT</span>”) at [19]). She took the view that relocation would not be in R’s interests for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For one, the District Judge thought that the Mother’s wish to relocate was unreasonable and motivated primarily by the Mother’s professional ambition rather than R’s best interests (the GD at [6], [26], [46] and [55]). The evidence did not show that the Mother’s health was suffering or that failure to relocate would jeopardise the Mother’s prospects of promotion. Nothing suggested that the assignment was foisted upon her and she was hard-pressed to reject it. There was also no evidence that the Mother had sought out alternative pathways and less drastic avenues than relocation (the GD at [6], [46] and [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Separately, there was no evidence that relocation would be in R’s best interests (the GD at [7]). There was no evidence that the Mother would be able to spend more time with R in London, given that there was no firm indication that the Mother would be working only conventional office hours (the GD at [48]–[49]). Nor did the Mother have a clear plan of how she would spend any additional time with R. Her proposed daily schedule for R was “little more than a recitation of a basic daily routine a child can be expected to undergo, devoid of details” (the GD at [51]). The school that the Mother had enrolled R in was, according to a regulatory report produced by the Father, not one of the top IB schools and had several safety issues (the GD at [57]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 There was also evidence that relocation could be detrimental to R. First, there was a real risk of adversely impacting the Father’s relationship with R (the GD at [59]–[60]). It did not matter that the Mother was willing to give the Father more access, as there was no certainty as to when exactly the Father could have physical access (at [60]). Even if the Father flew into London frequently, there was no guarantee he would be able to meet R; the District Judge “appreciated the Father’s concern that he had little confidence in the Mother adhering to her proposals given the acrimony between parties and the fact that no specified timings had been suggested by her for any access” (at [62]). Moreover, jetlag would affect the quality of any physical access the Father enjoyed with R (at [61]). As for remote access, no timings were proposed, and the 12-hour time difference left the Father and R with only “a sliver of time to talk”, compared with the current five-hour difference between New Zealand and Singapore (at [9] and [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Finally, the transition would be disruptive to R’s life. He was used to spending his weekends with the Mother’s family and most of his weekdays with the Mother’s mother and helper. The Mother had no support network in London, and did not intend to bring R’s other two caregivers along (at [8], [52] and [54]). The Mother appeared dismissive of the Father’s concerns that R might find the transition difficult. However, R was a sociable boy and could be expected to find leaving behind his friends destabilising (the GD at [52] and [54]). For these reasons, the District Judge considered that the relocation would not be in R’s interests and dismissed the Mother’s application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The parties’ cases on appeal were essentially the same as those they mounted before the District Judge. Rather than repeat them here, I will describe their submissions in greater detail in my consideration of each of the factors which the parties have raised as relevant to the inquiry into R’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law on relocation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The principles on relocation may be stated fairly succinctly and are not in dispute between the parties. It is well-established that the welfare of the child is paramount in relocation applications and ought to override every other consideration (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> at [19]). There is no presumption in favour of allowing relocation where the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is reasonable. Rather, the relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is only relevant to the extent that there would be a transference of the relocating parent’s insecurity and negative feelings onto the child, since it is the child’s welfare that lies at the heart of the inquiry, and not the interests of the relocating parent (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> at [20]; see also <span class="font-italic">TAA v TAB </span>[2015] 2 SLR 879 (“<span class="font-italic">TAA v TAB</span>”) at [17]). There is no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy amongst the various factors to be weighed in the overarching inquiry into the child’s welfare. Where the factors stand in relation to one another depends, finally, on a consideration of all the facts of the case (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As I am dealing with this matter on appeal, I am conscious that the principles governing appellate intervention in cases involving the welfare of children are the same as those that apply to appellate intervention generally (<span class="font-italic">CX </span><span class="font-italic">v CY (minor: custody and access) </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 at [15]). The appellate court should play a “limited role”, reversing or varying the decision of the judge below only if it was exercised on wrong principles or if the decision was plainly wrong, as would be the case if the judge had exercised his discretion wrongly (<span class="font-italic">BG v BF </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [12]). That said, where no trial took place below and the parties gave their evidence by affidavit and through the production of documents – as was the case here – the appellate court may be said to be in as good a position as the first-instance court to draw inferences and conclusions from the evidence (<span class="font-italic">TSF v TSE </span>[2018] 2 SLR 833 at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my view, taking into account all the relevant factors, the relocation application should be allowed. I will address the following factors in turn:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the significance of the Consent Order recording that Singapore should remain R’s habitual residence;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the effect of relocation upon the Mother’s health, her time with R and her career;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the effect of relocation upon R’s relationship with the Father;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the potential disruption to R’s life;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) R’s education in London; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) the parties’ prior discussions about relocating to London.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The significance of the Consent Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I first briefly address the Father’s argument that the Consent Order, which provided that R’s habitual residence is Singapore, implicitly acknowledges that it is in R’s best interests to remain in Singapore. He also argues that the Consent Order was recorded fewer than four months before the Mother’s relocation application and should not be varied at the Mother’s whim.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, the fact that the parties previously agreed that Singapore would be R’s habitual residence is a relevant factor. But <span class="font-italic">equally</span> relevant is the fact that they agreed that the order is subject to any further order of court. The paramount consideration is simply whether relocation would be in R’s best interests (see [24] above). The fact that the parties previously agreed that Singapore would be R’s habitual residence cannot change this. Moreover, all the Consent Order stated was:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless expressly agreed to by parties or pursuant to an Order of Court, Singapore shall remain [R’s] habitual residence and neither party is to remove [R] from Singapore for a period of more than one (1) month without the leave of Court, save for parties’ school holiday access.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The parties’ agreement that Singapore shall remain R’s habitual residence was <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> made subject to any further order of court and agreement by the parties otherwise. The parties thus clearly contemplated the possibility of change. Moreover, the Consent Order was recorded at a time when the Mother had not yet received the assignment letter from her employer. The assignment letter, which appeared to have prompted the Mother’s relocation application, was only issued around August 2017. Although the parties had contemplated moving to London in 2016, this plan was abandoned and the Mother informed the court in April 2017 that she was <span class="font-italic">not</span> relocating because her employer had no firm plans at that point in time for her to relocate.

The Mother submits that the District Judge should not have faulted her for the lack of evidence that her working hours in London would improve, or that her health would suffer from a failure to relocate, since such evidence would be impossible to obtain until it actually happened.

In the circumstances, I accept that relocating to London would spare the Mother, at the very least, from having to make so many conference calls late at night, and for that reason would likely afford her a better work-life balance.

That said, I accept that it is difficult for the Mother to show concrete evidence that her health would suffer until it actually does, by which point it may be too late. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to think that sustaining a 15- to 18-hour work day over the long term can be deleterious to the Mother’s health, and affect her ability to care for R. By contrast, as mentioned above, the move to London would better align her working hours with that of her clients in Europe/UK, and likely to improve her working hours. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Mother’s time with R</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Mother is R’s primary caregiver. She buys his clothes and books, organises playdates for him, attends his parent-teacher conferences and takes him to appointments, save when she is travelling and when R is with the Father. The Mother describes their daily schedule as follows. The Mother gets R ready for school in the morning and sees him off on the school bus, before she goes to work. She tries to send R to school two to three days a month. After school, the school bus drops R off at his maternal grandmother’s home and the Mother tries to picks him up after his after-school activities between 6.30pm and 7pm. On Wednesdays and Fridays, the Mother sends R for soccer practice and they have dinner together. They also aim to have dinner with R’s grandmother on average at least twice a week. Except when she has evening commitments, which are infrequent, the Mother puts R to bed by 9pm and then makes work calls ending between 11pm and 1am most nights. She travels once every two to three months to London for work for about a week each time, during which time R stays with his maternal grandmother.

A Private Investigation report adduced by the Father, which describes the Mother’s and R’s schedules from 6 to 24 February 2017, supports the Mother’s assertion that she is often unable to spend as much time with R as she would like due to work commitments. The report observed that the Mother was overseas from 6 to 12 February, and that of the days which she spent in Singapore, she was often at work until R’s bedtime or would only return home at around 7.30pm to 8pm. R spent all his weekday afternoons and evenings at his maternal grandmother’s place and the Mother only took R out for dinner once, on a Sunday night. On 16 of 19 nights, R had dinner without the Mother at his maternal grandmother’s place.

</div> In fact, this seems very unlikely given the Mother’s seniority and income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 That said, I accept that the Mother stands to gain by accepting the posting to London and embarking on this next step of her career. Insofar as the posting would advance the Mother’s career while also affording her a better work-life balance, it would indirectly benefit R as well. Conversely, if the Mother is prevented from accepting the posting, the frustration and regret that she would feel – as well as any adverse impact on her career – would also be felt by R to some degree, because he depends on her. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">BNS</span><span class="font-italic"> v BNT</span> at [20]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he child’s emotional and psychological welfare is, generally speaking, intertwined with that of the primary caregiver. Hence, if the primary caregiver reasonably wishes to relocate because he or she is not emotionally and psychologically stable in his or her present environment, that has to be sensibly weighed in the balance. … [T]he relocating parent’s reasonable wish to relocate is … relevant <span class="font-italic">only to the extent</span> that it is found that there will be a transference of his or her insecurity and negative feelings onto <span class="font-italic">the child</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Similarly, the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">AZB v AYZ</span> [2012] 3 SLR 627 (“<span class="font-italic">AZB v AYZ</span>”) at [14]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is frequently the indignant retort of the parent opposing a relocation application (as the husband is doing in the present case), to emphasise that it is the welfare of the child which is the paramount and overriding consideration, not the interests of the primary caregiver. Indeed it is; I do not think that the cases suggest otherwise. What the cases do suggest, however, is that the welfare of the child is often so inextricably intertwined with the general well-being and happiness of the primary caregiver that the court is loath to interfere with important life decisions of the primary caregiver, so long as they are reasonably made and are not against the interests of the child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The High Court also cited (at [15]) the following observations of Ormrod LJ in <span class="font-italic">Chamberlain v de la Mare </span>(1983) 4 FLR 434<span class="font-italic"> </span>at 442:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]f the court interferes with the way of life which the custodial parent is proposing to adopt so that he or she and the new spouse are compelled to adopt a manner of life which they do not want, and reasonably do not want, the likelihood is that the frustrations and bitterness which would result from such an interference with any adult whose career is at stake would be bound to overflow on to children. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In other words, “the well-being of the child and that of the primary caregiver are inextricably tied together” (<span class="font-italic">AZB v AYZ</span> at [34]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, the District Judge erred by not giving due weight to the Mother’s desire to relocate and the ways in which the relocation would benefit her well-being and career. The District Judge was fairly critical of the Mother’s relocation application, which she saw as being “run on a very individual-centric, rather than child-centric basis”, to which R’s interests were incidental rather than primary (the GD at [67]). As a result, the District Judge appeared to have undervalued the ways in which the Mother might benefit from relocation. Whatever one might think of the Mother’s motivations for relocating, the fact remains that the Mother is R’s primary caregiver. She is the parent whom he sees daily and who cares for him constantly, not the Father. The Mother bears sole responsibility for bringing R up, with little support from the Father beyond the maintenance he may be ordered to pay and his occasional visits to see R. R’s well-being and happiness are profoundly connected to the Mother’s and cannot be divorced from hers. In my view, this is a factor which favours relocation, although it is not capable of precise quantification. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Father’s relationship with R</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I now turn to the strongest factor in the Father’s favour, which is that relocation might adversely affect his relationship with R. In <span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span>, the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of giving proper weight to the child’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent, particularly because it is generally in the child’s interests to continue enjoying a meaningful relationship with <span class="font-italic">both </span>parents (at [25] and [27]). Relocation “represents a serious threat to [the] ideal state of joint parenting since the left-behind parent would … become less of a presence in the child’s new life” (at [25]). That said, the Court also emphasised that this factor, like the wishes of the primary caregiver, was not to be treated as having determinative weight or as being decisive in every case. The weight to be attributed to this factor “depends on the facts, <span class="font-italic">in particular, the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child</span>” and the “resultant void in the child’s life if relocation is allowed” [emphasis in original] (at [26]). For example, severing an already-functioning relationship would “generally be both more agonising and disruptive to the child” than hindering the creation of such a relationship (at [26]). With that, I turn to the nature of the relationship between R and the Father, before examining the effects that relocation would likely have on that relationship.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Quality of relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I am satisfied that the relationship between R and the Father is a positive and loving one.

</div> It certainly seems that the Father and R both love each other dearly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As for the issue of maintenance, it was not disputed that the Father has not maintained R since November 2016, when the Mother ended their relationship.

</div> However, I do not think this suggests a lack of love or care for R, for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Father sent monthly maintenance of NZ$9,000 from mid-2011 to November 2016 for the Mother and R. The Mother was the one who, when she ended the relationship, instructed the Father to stop making these payments.

</div> I also recognise that there is no urgent need for the Father’s financial assistance given that the Mother is very well-paid (see the GD at n 1) and it was not her case that she could not afford household goods or family expenses. (That said, I do think that the Father’s passiveness in maintaining R shows that he was content for the Mother to shoulder primary responsibility for R’s daily needs and well-being, and to himself take the backseat in R’s care, which I return to at [80]–[81] below.)</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the Father appeared to be willing in principle to maintain R. In his affidavit filed in OSG 53/2017, the Father stated that he was “prepared to accept [R’s] total monthly reasonable expenses” as S$3,000 per month, and asked that this be shared equally between the parties.

</div> Be that as it may, the Father has not taken the position that he would refuse to pay maintenance over and above the figure he has suggested; he was merely making submissions on the proper sum to be ordered as maintenance.

</div> The Mother counters that the Father has business interests in London and it would pose no inconvenience for him to travel to London for access to R. Further, he has travelled to London fairly often since 2016, including twice in 2017. Should relocation be granted, the existing access orders could be varied to give the Father additional physical access to R whenever the father is in London, subject to him giving prior notice. In an affidavit filed below, the Mother offered the Father holiday access for 75% of R’s year-end holidays and half of his summer holidays, and said that she was willing to facilitate access if the Father should visit London outside of his access period, provided he gives two weeks’ prior notice. The Mother even offered to fly R to Singapore for holiday access with the Father for up to three of the five holiday access periods.

</div> suggests that he exercises substantial control over his work and the projects he is involved in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Moreover, even if the Father is not able to travel to London as often as he presently travels to Singapore, he might possibly compensate for this by spending more time with R on each occasion. I also note that the Mother was willing to fly R to Singapore to meet the Father. The District Judge was skeptical about this proposal because it “would entail R flying to New Zealand thereafter”, and “[h]aving to endure such long flights and the ensuing jet lag could not be in R’s best interests” (the GD at [63]). However, the Father need not fly R back to New Zealand. He could, for example, spend time with R in Singapore (where R’s friends and maternal relatives would be), or bring R for holidays to nearby destinations. This would allow the Father to see R without having to fly all the way to London. While such a proposal might not be feasible on a regular basis, and is dependent on R’s school schedule, it is an arrangement which can be properly planned and has the advantage of relative certainty. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Remote access</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, the Father overstates the difficulty of remotely contacting R in London. Presently, by the time R is done with his after-school activities, it is past 7pm in Singapore and midnight in New Zealand. However, if R relocates to London, the Father could call R before R sleeps and before the Father goes to work. Instead of calling R at 9pm local time, which would only give them a short time to talk, the Father could easily call R earlier (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, 7am New Zealand time and 7pm London time) so that there would be less of a rush. It may also be envisaged that sustained or increased remote access would help the Father to maintain his relationship with R even if physical access were to occur less frequently.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on this factor</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 There is no doubt that a loving relationship subsists between the Father and R. Nevertheless, the case for refusing relocation on this basis is not as compelling as it would be if R had grown up with the Father. In <span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>for example, the father played “an active, involved role” in the children’s lives, allowing them to “enjoy, to the fullest extent possible, a normal family life in which they [could] benefit from the input of <span class="font-italic">both </span>parents” [emphasis in original] (at [32]). The relationship between the children and the father in that case was described as “strong, vibrant”, “good and close” (at [30] and [31]). The Court found that, “given the very nature of the relationship”, it was preferable for the children to continue to have <span class="font-italic">personal</span> contact with their father (at [34]). Technological communication would be a poor substitute for the vibrancy of “[n]ormal family life”, which did not consist solely of spoken communication but also “joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations” (<span class="font-italic">BNS v BNT</span> at [34]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">TAA v TAB</span>, it was said that the children would “lose out on other aspects of family life such as enjoying activities with the left behind parent … as well as the closeness which comes only with face-to-face interactions, hugs and loving touches” (at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In this case, by contrast, R does not share a family life with the Father as they live in different countries. The three of them have never lived together as a family, except for the first year of R’s life. R only meets the Father once every six to eight weeks and they have managed to develop a loving relationship through the remote and physical contact permitted under current access arrangements. Any decrease in physical contact between R and the Father would not be as substantial in this case as it would be if the Father had been residing in Singapore. Less regular physical contact (particularly in conjunction with equal or increased remote contact, and physical contact for a longer duration each time) would not, I think, be as disorienting and traumatising for R as it might be if he had grown up with the Father and seen him daily. The Mother is and will continue to be R’s primary caregiver, and she has had primary care of R’s daily and long-term needs for nearly his entire (if not his entire) life. Although the Father may see R less regularly if R moves to London, they could still maintain a positive and loving relationship through a combination of physical and remote access.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I acknowledge that the quality of the Father’s access to R would in all likelihood be poorer in the event of R’s relocation to London than it presently is. However, this factor is not decisive.

</div> However, given his youth, I consider that R would be able to adapt. The fact that R is “sociable” (the GD at [51] and [54]) may even be favourable, and is at worst neutral, to the Mother’s relocation application because it bodes well for R’s ability to make new friends in London, as compared to a child who is more introverted. I also consider that the extra time and love the Mother would be able to give him in London would help to ease the transition. That said, I take the view that the Mother should bring her mother and helper along for the initial transition period, particularly as the Mother herself would be acclimatising to work. As the District Judge said, the face of a familiar family member in a foreign land would likely bring R some measure of assurance and comfort (see the GD at [54]). The Mother has stated that she would be willing to make such arrangements if the court takes the view that the maternal grandmother and/or helper should accompany them for the initial transition period.

The District Judge observed that the reports “showed that the said school was not one of the top IB schools and the said report also cited several safety concerns” (the GD at [57]). However, these safety concerns appear to relate to the inadequacy of the school’s risk assessment for one particular trip (a residential trip to India). Most of Ofsted’s feedback regarding the school was positive and complimentary. This is shown by the “Main findings” of the Ofsted report:

That report recounted a slew of measures which the school undertook to remedy the lapses discovered as a result of Ofsted’s May 2016 inspection, and concluded that the school met all the relevant requirements in respect of the welfare, health and safety of pupils, as well as the quality of leadership in and management of the school. The report concluded that the school staff, proprietor and governors had been “successful in addressing the remaining unmet parts of the standards that were highlighted at the emergency inspection in May 2016” and that all the relevant requirements were satisfied.

That situation would likely be more beneficial for R than moving to London with the Mother only, with his Father remaining in New Zealand. Assuming the plan was for all three of them to live in London, the fact that the Father was agreeable to R moving to London <span class="font-italic">under those circumstances </span>does not necessarily mean that he ought to be agreeable to R moving to London <span class="font-italic">under </span><span class="font-italic">the present circumstances</span>. Moreover, even if the plan at the time was only for the Mother and R to relocate to London (without the Father), the court must still arrive at an independent determination of whether such relocation would <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> be in R’s interests. The fact that both the parties think it would be in R’s interests does not necessarily mean that it is. Now that the relocation application is before the court, the court must decide it with reference to the child’s welfare as the paramount consideration (see [24] above), which is a matter to be decided objectively rather than by reference to what the parties may at some point in the past have agreed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The duration of the relocation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 One of the Father’s concerns was that the Mother’s posting to London would be permanent (the GD at [34]). The assignment letter from the Mother’s company dated 22 August 2017 referred to an “assignment period … from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019”, but para 8 titled “End of Assignment” stated that at the conclusion of her international assignment, the company would “consider possible options available to [the Mother]” as follows:

She would then enter into a regular contract of employment “of indefinite length” with the company in the UK. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my judgment, the possibility of the relocation being permanent does not carry much weight. It involves a great deal of speculation because it is simply not known whether the company will want the Mother to stay on in London after her two-year assignment. Indeed, it is impossible to predict with certainty what changes the next two years may bring about in terms of the Mother’s career prospects, R’s assimilation in London, his response to his new school and environment, and the Mother’s and R’s well-being generally. It would therefore be speculative to say that it would be in R’s interests to move back to Singapore at the end of two years in London. If anything, relocating permanently or for a longer duration might be less disruptive for R than relocating for just two years, which would mean uprooting him twice within a relatively short span of time. R may end up returning to Singapore anyway in order to serve National Service, but that will occur when he is nearer adulthood. Aside from the fact that a shorter relocation may be more disruptive to R’s life, the duration of the relocation does not affect my analysis of the factors above one way or the other. It merely prolongs the period during which both the positive and negative effects of relocation will be felt on R. The ultimate question is still whether these various effects tilt the balance in favour of or against R’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Balancing the factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The foregoing factors do not all point in one direction. On one hand, moving to London would benefit R through benefiting the Mother. Taking up the position in London would in all likelihood advance her career, improve her work-life balance, contribute to her well-being, and enable her to spend more time with R. R’s well-being and health are inextricably intertwined with the Mother’s, and her desire to relocate to London should be weighed seriously for that reason. On the other hand, relocation would make it difficult for the Father to have regular physical access to R. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 On balance, I consider that relocation to London with the Mother would be  in R’s interests. The Father is not a typical left-behind parent in that he lives in a different country from R and the Mother, and he and R have developed a loving relationship through a combination of physical and remote access. Being further away from the Father would not, I think, be as disturbing or disorienting for R as it would be if he were used to living in the same house or country as the Father. Moreover, R’s relocation to London need not erode the quality of their relationship, provided the parties endeavour to ensure that R is able to continue spending a substantial amount of time with his Father (for example by seeing him less frequently, but for a longer duration each time) and remain in regular remote contact with him. The Father’s main objection to relocation is that it would take him 30 hours to travel from New Zealand to London. However, this inconvenience would be mitigated on the (apparently not infrequent) occasions that the Father travels to London or nearer London for work or personal purposes. It could also be further mitigated by the Mother flying R to Singapore or other locations that the Father can have access to more easily. These difficulties are not insurmountable and, in my view, should not stand in the way of a relocation which appears to otherwise be in R’s interests.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is useful to put into perspective what this case is about. It is about the Mother who is the caregiver of a young child whom she has brought up on her own for the last 7½ years, with help from her mother and helper. The Father, who never married the Mother, lives with his own wife and children some ten hours away by flight. As I said earlier, the fact that he lives remotely from the child is a factor that I considered significant in reaching my decision (see [59]–[61] above). He has not asked for the care of the child. His role in the child’s life was limited to periodic visits and holidays with him and financial contributions towards his maintenance. These contributions, while voluntary, were limited. It was fortuitous that the Mother was well paid and did not really have to depend on them. To earn that salary, her job was no doubt a demanding one, and her time at work went beyond the conventional office hours as she had to deal with matters relating to her company’s various offices, which spanned a wide range of time zones. This has resulted in her having less time to spend with her child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Mother has now been offered a move to the London office of her company, which she said would help her in her career. Being based in London, the range of time zones of the same offices whose matters she has to deal with would be narrower, and her working hours would more closely match the conventional office hours. If the Mother relocates with the child, she would be able to spend more time with him as she would have to spend less time in the office. The other differences between that arrangement and the current <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> are that the maternal grandmother and helper would no longer be able to help the Mother with the child’s care; the child would have to leave his school and friends here behind, and go to a new school and make new friends in a new country. While the Father would have to fly 30 hours instead of ten to see the child, so that the frequency of these visits would in all likelihood reduce, he would  still be the distant father he has always been. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Finally, I should reiterate that the decision below was made on affidavit evidence. There was no trial. I therefore considered myself to be in as good a position as the District Judge to draw conclusions from the evidence adduced (see [25] above). I disagreed with her conclusions on some matters, such as whether the Mother would be able to spend more time with R in London and whether the 12-hour time difference would impede remote contact between R and the Father. The District Judge’s conclusions on these and other matters led her to exercise her discretion in a manner which was, in my view, plainly wrong. In particular, she significantly undervalued the ways in which the Mother <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">consequently R</span> might benefit from relocation (see [47] above), and thus wrongly attributed decisive weight to the increased difficulty of physical contact between the Father and R and to the disruption that relocation would cause to R’s life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 For the reasons I have given, I allow the appeal and order that R be permitted to relocate to the United Kingdom with the Mother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I also consider it advisable for the Mother to bring the maternal grandmother and helper with her to London, at least for the initial transition period, provided they are able and willing to do so. I think their presence would be in R’s interests. The duration of their stay in London, however, is a matter best left to the Mother’s discretion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In the event of relocation, the Mother seeks to vary the orders for access to the extent that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the school holidays be shared equally with the Father and, in addition, that the Father have access during the following school holidays:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) one week during the February school holidays; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) two weeks during the April school holidays; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) one week during the October school holidays; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the Father is travelling to London during the school term, the Mother will facilitate access to the Father upon the Father providing prior written notification of at least two weeks prior to his arrival; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there be regular contact through Skype, Facetime, WhatsApp or other electronic means between the Father and R, the timing of which is to be scheduled around R’s school schedules and taking into account the time difference between New Zealand and London.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Father takes issue with the access arrangements proposed by the Mother because they would essentially require him to “shuttle between New Zealand and London [five] times a year”, which he claims is not feasible. The holiday access periods which she has proposed are each at least a week long, requiring him to “take long periods of absence [from] work”, which he says is “impractical”.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Father’s position in these proceedings has consistently been that the relocation application should be dismissed because it would be impractical for him to maintain regular contact with R if R moves to London. He has not himself proposed any access arrangements. Given my decision to allow R to relocate, it would be profitable for the parties to try to agree on a set of physical and remote access arrangements that would meet R’s needs and that would be workable for the Father. If the parties are unable to agree, they may apply to the District Judge for an order varying the terms of access.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I therefore make the order that the Father’s access arrangements, the date of relocation, R’s school in London and other necessary details pertaining to the relocation are to be agreed between the parties, failing which they are to address the District Judge on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I will hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon   <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Teong Liang and Tan Hui Qing (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Ivan Cheong and Eugene Chan (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) <br/>for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
