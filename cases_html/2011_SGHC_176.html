<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For clarity, the trade mark reproduced in the
                    first row above (T73/59592H) will be referred to as “the
                    ‘Nutella’ word mark”, whereas all the three trade marks above
                    will be referred to collectively as “the ‘Nutella’ trade
                    marks”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 1 August 2007, the Defendant introduced a new
                    gourmet hot coffee beverage served in a shot glass (the
                    “‘Nutello’ drink”, or the “Defendant’s
                    product”) under the “Nutello” sign (the
                    “‘Nutello’ sign”), prepared at TCC outlets by the
                    Defendant’s baristas. I have been careful to use the word
                    “sign” in describing the term “Nutello”, as the word
                    “sign” has a specifically defined meaning in the Trade Marks Act
                    (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA”). Section 2(1) of the TMA defines
                    the term “sign” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label,
                        ticket, shape, colour, aspect of packaging or any combination
                        thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       This is the most generic description available
                    under the TMA, and it is necessary to use such a term so as to distinguish a
                    “sign” from a “trade mark”, the latter having its
                    own statutorily defined meaning of (s 2(1) of the TMA):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a]ny sign capable of being represented graphically and which is capable
                        of distinguishing goods or services dealt with or provided in the course of
                        trade by a person from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any
                        other person</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is clear from the definitions of
                    “sign” and “trade mark” reproduced above that all
                    trade marks are signs, but that the converse is not true. Some confusion arose
                    in this case as a result of counsel for the Defendant referring to
                    “Nutello” as a “mark”, when what he appeared to have
                    meant was that “Nutello” was a “sign” (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> <em>et seq</em>). To avoid such confusion, I have
                    consistently used the generic term “sign” to describe
                    “Nutello” throughout this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the Defendant’s TCC Drinks Gallery
                    Menu, the “Nutello” drink was featured under the “Espresso
                    Specialties” section. The “Nutello” drink is served in a
                    shot glass and consists of, <em>inter alia</em>, espresso,
                    milk foam, cocoa powder and “Nutella” chocolate cream spread. The
                    TCC Drinks Gallery Menu describes “Nutello” as “Espresso
                    with lashings of nutella – perfect for cocoa lovers!” Each
                    “Nutello” drink is priced at S$5.60, excluding government taxes
                    and service charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Since the launch of the “Nutello”
                    drink, the “Nutello” name has been used in various representations
                    in the Defendant’s promotional materials:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 3 December 2009, the Plaintiff issued a
                    cease-and-desist letter to the Defendant objecting to the Defendant’s use
                    of the “Nutello” name and the description “Nutello –
                    Espresso with lashings of nutella – perfect for cocoa lovers!” The
                    Plaintiff demanded, <em>inter alia</em>, payment of
                    S$50,000 as damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 15 December 2009, the Defendant requested
                    for an extension of one month, <em>ie</em> till 17 January
                    2010, to respond to the Plaintiff’s letter. However, the Plaintiff refused
                    to accede to such a request by way of a letter dated 16 December 2009. The
                    Plaintiff initiated the present action on 6 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In July 2010, by reason of an annual overhaul
                    of the entire Drinks Gallery Menu, the Defendant discontinued sales of the
                    “Nutello” drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the Plaintiff’s statement of claim,
                    the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Infringed the Plaintiff’s
                        “Nutella”
                        <em>word mark</em> under s 27(2)(b) of the TMA by using
                        a similar sign on identical and/or similar goods (hereinafter, the
                        “trade mark infringement claim”); and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Infringed the Plaintiff’s well
                        known “Nutella” trade marks by (hereinafter, the “well
                        known trade mark infringement claim”):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       using a similar sign on
                            identical and/or similar goods, which is likely to cause confusion
                            (under s 55(2) of the TMA);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       using a similar sign, in relation to <em>any</em> types of goods, such as to indicate a
                            connection between those goods and the Plaintiff, and is likely to
                            damage the Plaintiff’s interests (under s 55(3)(a) of the
                            TMA);</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       using a similar sign, in relation to <em>any</em> types of goods, which would:</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_A"></a>(A)       cause dilution
                                in an unfair manner of the distinctive character of the
                                Plaintiff’s “Nutella” marks (under s 55(3)(b)(i)
                                of the TMA); or</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_iii-p4_B"></a>(B)       take unfair advantage of the
                                distinctive character of the Plaintiff’s
                                “Nutella” marks (under s 55(3)(b)(ii) of the
                                TMA).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Committed the tort of passing off (hereinafter, the
                        “passing off claim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This judgment proceeds to address the various
                    claims made by the Plaintiff. I would note at the outset that many aspects of
                    the various claims overlap with each other, even if, at times, they do not adopt
                    the same legal parlance. Accordingly, in order to streamline the analysis,
                    extensive use of cross-referencing – even across different heads of claim
                    – will be adopted where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It should be noted that while injunctions and
                    damages may be ordered under the trade mark infringement claim and the passing
                    off claim, the only relief with regard to the claim of well known trade mark
                    infringement is limited to a restraining injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I turn first to consider the trade mark
                    infringement claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trade mark infringement claim (s 27(2)(b) of the TMA)</p>

                    claim is based only on one of the Plaintiff’s registrations, <em>viz</em>, the “Nutella” word
                mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The issues presented by the trade mark
                    infringement claim are multiple and complex. Accordingly, I shall provide a
                    brief overview on the structure of the analysis adopted in this
                judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The trade mark infringement claim is premised
                    on s 27(2)(b) of the TMA which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without
                        the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he <em>uses
                            in the course of trade</em> a sign where <em>because</em> —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the sign is <em>similar</em> to the trade
                            mark and is used in relation to <em>goods or services
                                identical with or similar to those for which the trade mark is
                                registered</em>,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there <em>exists a likelihood of confusion</em> on
                        the part of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the
                    TMA can be considered, an important threshold issue is whether the infringing
                    sign must be <em>used as a trade mark</em> in the course of
                    trade (“the threshold issue”). This issue will be dealt with in
                    greater detail below (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> <em>et seq</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Assuming the threshold issue has been resolved
                    in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff must still show three elements in
                    order to establish an infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the TMA. The three
                    elements are, namely (<em>The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop-In
                        Department Store Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 690 (“<em>Polo</em>”) at [8]; cited in <em>City Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Louis Vuitton Malletier</em> [2010] 1 SLR 382 (“<em>City Chain</em>”) at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The alleged offending sign must be
                        similar to the registered mark (hereinafter, “similarity of
                        marks”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar goods or
                        services (hereinafter, “similarity of goods”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     On account of
                        the presence of the first two conditions, there exists a likelihood of
                        confusion on the part of the public (hereinafter, “likelihood of
                        confusion on the part of the public”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     These elements will be analysed in greater
                    detail below. However, two points should be noted here. First, although there is
                    some link and overlap in the three conditions, it is clear that they are
                    distinct conditions – the fact that a sign is <em>similar</em> to a registered mark, and/or that it is used on
                        <em>similar goods</em>, <em>does not
                        automatically mean</em> that there will be a likelihood of confusion
                    on the part of the public (<em>Polo</em> at [8]; <em>City Chain</em>
                    at [44]). Second, the third question of
                    whether there exists a likelihood of confusion need not be considered if either
                    of the first two conditions is not satisfied. This is because the “global
                    assessment test” – a test which focuses on the ultimate question of
                    whether there is a likelihood of confusion – has been decisively rejected
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Polo</em> (see <em>Polo</em> at [8]; and
                    see <em>City Chain</em> at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I now consider the threshold issue of whether
                    the allegedly infringing mark must be used in a trade mark sense before the
                    issue of trade mark infringement can be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The threshold issue: Must there be trade mark use?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Court of Appeal in <em>City
                        Chain</em> considered at length the threshold issue of whether the
                    infringing sign must be used in a <em>trade mark sense</em>
                    (hereinafter, referred to as either “trade mark use” or
                    “used in a trade mark sense”) before a trade mark infringement can
                    be found (<em>City Chain</em> at [16]-[38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before proceeding to consider whether trade
                    mark use is necessary, it is necessary to first consider what amounts to
                    “trade mark use”. The cases cited to me have not provided a clear
                    definition of what “trade mark use” constitutes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meaning of “trade mark use”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In unpacking the concept of “trade mark
                    use”, the starting point is to seek recourse to the meaning of
                    “trade mark”. Flowing from this definition of “trade
                    mark” in s 2(1) of the TMA (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>), “trade mark use” must refer to the use of a
                    mark in a manner that is <em>indicative of the trade origin of
                        goods or services</em>. This is because – as is suggested by the
                    s 2(1) definition of “trade mark” – a trade mark is, in
                    essence, a <em>badge of origin</em>. In this regard, it is
                    apposite to note the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <em>R v
                        Johnstone</em> at [13] (also
                    cited in <em>Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v Oystertec
                        plc</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 (“<em>Nation
                        Fittings</em>”) at [64]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he essence of a trade mark has always been that it is a <em>badge of origin</em>. It indicates <em>trade source</em>: a connection in the course of trade between
                        the goods and the proprietor of the mark. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Therefore, where the allegedly infringing sign
                    is used for, <em>inter alia</em>, decorative or descriptive
                    purposes, this would <em>not</em> amount to trade mark use.
                    For instance, in <em>City Chain</em>, the Court of Appeal
                    found that the predominant use of the allegedly infringing sign was for
                    decorative purposes and therefore was not trade mark use (<em>City Chain</em> at [38]).
                    Again, in <em>Hölterhoff v Freiesleben</em> [2002] FSR 52
                    at [16], the European Court of Justice
                    (“ECJ”) noted that a reference made for purely descriptive
                    purposes to reveal the characteristics of the product offered for sale to the
                    potential customer was not trade mark use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It should be noted that certain types of signs
                    may not be capable of being used as trade marks. <em>Ex
                        hypothesi</em> – and this flows from the definition of
                    “trade mark” in s 2(1) of the TMA – where the allegedly
                    infringing sign is <em>not</em> capable of indicating the
                    trade origin of goods or services, it cannot be considered to be used as a trade
                    mark. However, for the avoidance of doubt, I emphasise that the allegedly
                    infringing sign does <em>not</em> have to be <em>registrable</em> as a trade mark before its use can
                    constitute “trade mark use”. Registrability is contingent on other
                    requirements as found in s 7 of the TMA, and such requirements are not necessary
                    for showing that there has been “trade mark use”. Instead, for the
                    purposes of demonstrating “trade mark use”, it is sufficient that
                    the allegedly infringing sign is shown to be capable of, and is in fact, used as
                    a badge of origin.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether trade mark use is necessary </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     A controversial issue in the law of trade
                    marks, not just in Singapore but also in other jurisdictions (and especially the
                    European Community), is the issue of whether the alleged infringer must have
                    used the allegedly infringing sign as a trade mark before trade mark
                    infringement can even be considered. In <em>City
                    Chain</em>, the Court of Appeal noted that there were two different
                    approaches to this issue, namely: (1) the traditional approach in which
                    infringing use must be trade mark use (“the traditional
                    approach”); and (2) the broader approach adopted by the ECJ (“the
                    broader Community approach”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The former approach (<em>viz</em>, the traditional approach) was considered by Andrew Phang
                    Boon Leong J in <em>Nation Fittings</em>. The learned
                    judge, albeit <em>in obiter</em>, dealt with the
                    requirement of use of the infringing sign as a trade mark. He considered,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the approaches taken by Lord
                    Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe in <em>R
                        v Johnstone</em> [2003] FSR 42 (“<em>R v
                        Johnstone</em>”), the ECJ’s decision in <em>Arsenal Football Club Plc v Reed</em> [2003] Ch 454
                        (“<em>Arsenal (ECJ)</em>”) and the
                    decision of Jacob J in <em>British Sugar Plc v James Robertson
                        &amp; Sons Ltd</em> [1996] RPC 281 (see [57], [61], [63], [64], and [67]-[69] of <em>Nation
                        Fittings</em>). After considering <em>inter
                        alia</em> the abovementioned cases, the learned judge was of the view
                    that the interpretation adopted must be consistent with logic and fairness
                        (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [72]). In the circumstances, he favoured Lord
                    Nicholls’ reasoning in <em>Johnstone</em> (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [63] and [73]),
                        <em>viz</em>, that before there can be a trade mark
                    infringement, the alleged offending use must be of the nature of a trade mark
                    use (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The latter approach (<em>viz</em>, the broader Community approach) had its genesis in the ECJ
                    decision of <em>Arsenal (ECJ)</em>. In brief, and to adopt
                    the interpretation of <em>Arsenal (ECJ)</em> taken by
                    Aldous LJ in <em>Arsenal Football Club Plc v Reed</em>
                    [2003] RPC 39 at [17] (“<em>Arsenal (CA)</em>”), the court in <em>Arsenal (ECJ)</em> held that the registration of a trade mark gave
                    the proprietor a property right, and the relevant consideration regarding the
                    allegedly infringing use is whether it is likely to “affect or jeopardise
                    the guarantee of origin which constitutes the essential function of the mark
                    [which] <em>did not</em> depend on whether the use
                    complained of was trade mark use” (emphasis added). The test is whether
                    the infringing use is liable to <em>affect the
                        functions</em> of the registered trade mark (<em>City
                        Chain</em> at [20],
                    interpreting <em>Arsenal (ECJ)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Following a detailed exegesis of English and
                    European cases as well as academic writing, the Court of Appeal in <em>City Chain</em> noted at [36] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On balance, bearing in mind the object of a trade mark law, which is
                        probably narrower than that of the law on passing off, and Art 5(5) of the
                        Directive, <em>we are inclined to take the stricter
                            approach</em> that the infringing use must be of a trade mark use.
                        However, for the purposes of the present appeal, whichever approach we
                        adopt, the same result will be obtained. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Court of Appeal noted that, on the facts
                    of the case before it, the “predominant use” of the allegedly
                    infringing mark was for “decorative purposes” rather than
                    “trade mark use” (<em>City Chain</em> at
                        [38]). However, although this
                    finding “should conclude the question of [trade mark infringement under s
                    27 of the TMA]”, the Court of Appeal recognised that this would not
                    conclude the issue under the broader Community approach (at [38]). The Court of Appeal therefore went on
                    to analyse the three elements of trade mark infringement (set out at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). It is therefore clear that the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>City Chain</em> did not have to finally
                    determine the correct approach to be applied <em>vis-à-vis</em> the threshold issue, because on the facts of that case
                    the same outcome would be reached whichever approach was taken (see <em>City Chain</em> at [36], reproduced above at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>). In other words, although the Court of Appeal favoured the
                    narrower “trade mark use” approach, this was done <em>in obiter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present case, there is no need for me
                    to decide which approach (<em>viz</em> the traditional
                    approach or the broader Community approach) to apply. This is not because the
                    same outcome would have been engendered whichever approach I took (which was the
                    case in <em>City Chain</em>), but because I find that
                        <em>there was trade mark use</em> in the present case.
                    This is sufficient to pass the threshold test under the more stringent
                    traditional approach, and <em>a fortiori</em>, also pass
                    the test under the broader Community approach. I now elaborate on my reasons for
                    finding that there was trade mark use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there trade mark use in the present case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As a preliminary matter, the Plaintiff argued
                    that the Defendant had referred to the “Nutello” sign as a
                    “mark” in its pleadings, and had used the same term (<em>viz</em>, “mark”) to refer to the
                    Plaintiff’s “Nutella” trade marks. To my mind, this is not
                    determinative of whether or not “Nutello” was used as a trade
                    mark. Indeed, I note that under the previous edition of the Trade Marks Act
                        (<em>viz</em>, Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1998 Ed)), the
                    term “mark” was statutorily defined as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[i]nclud[ing] a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature,
                        word, letter, numeral or any combination thereof;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This definition of “mark” under the previous TMA is
                    similar to the definition of the term “sign” under the present
                    version of the TMA (on which see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).
                    Therefore, the use of the term “mark” would arguably be more
                    closely linked with the use of the term “sign” under current
                    legislation, than with the term “trade mark”. Indeed, as counsel
                    for the Defendant was quick to point out, nowhere in the Defendant’s
                    pleadings did the Defendant refer to the “Nutello” sign as a
                    “trade mark”. I therefore think that the fact that counsel for the
                    Defendant had referred to “Nutello” as a mark <em>did not indicate</em> that the Defendant was making an admission that
                    “Nutello” had been used in a trade mark sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     That said, however, I do not think that the
                    Defendant should be permitted to argue that “Nutello” was not used
                    in a trade mark sense, because the Defendant had omitted to plead the same.
                    Indeed, as was openly conceded by counsel for the Defendant at trial:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are not saying that we are using it in a non-trademark sense, in a
                        descriptive sense, and therefore there is no – that is not our case.
                            <em>If that is our case, we must expressly plead as such
                            that we are using the mark in a non-trademark sense</em> ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The absence of such a pleading, and the
                    failure to apply to amend the pleadings in this regard, suggests to me that the
                    current contention – that the “Nutello” sign was not used as
                    a trade mark – was an afterthought. It was clear that even during the
                    trial, counsel for the Defendant maintained that the defence was not that the
                    “Nutello” sign was being used in a non-trade mark sense. Parties
                    should be bound by their pleadings, and accordingly, the Defendant should not be
                    permitted to raise, after the conclusion of the trial, an issue that was neither
                    pleaded nor raised at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Indeed, more than just being an afterthought,
                    I note that counsel for the Defendant repeatedly refrained from denying that the
                    “Nutello” sign was used as a trade mark, even when the Defendant
                    had ample opportunity to do so. In the Defendant’s written submissions
                    filed for an application for summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”) (dated 26 July
                    2010), the Defendant did not set out the threshold issue of whether there was
                    trade mark use of the infringing sign, and instead agreed that the issues were
                    the three elements of trade mark infringement (set out at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). Again, in the Defendant’s
                    written submissions for its application for security for costs (Summons No 453
                    of 2010), the Defendant particularised no less than 10 issues to be addressed in
                    the present case, but the Defendant neither denied that “Nutello”
                    was used as a trade mark, nor identified this as being an issue for the court.
                    Further, in the Defendant’s opening statement, there was no denial that
                    “Nutello” was used in a trade mark sense. Even when I stood down
                    the Defence’s representative witness, Mr Christopher Tan, and explicitly
                    queried counsel for the Defendant on the Defendant’s position <em>vis-à-vis</em> whether “Nutello” was being used
                    in a trade mark sense, counsel for the Defendant confirmed that the Defendant
                    was “not saying that [the Defendant was] using it in a non-trademark
                    sense”, and further confirmed that the issues were limited to the three
                    elements of trade mark infringement. After counsel for the Defendant had
                    confirmed that the threshold issue was not an issue, Mr Christopher Tan was
                    recalled from outside the court and counsel for the Plaintiff did not further
                    cross-examine him on the issue of trade mark use. It would therefore be
                    prejudicial to the Plaintiff for the Defendant to now argue that
                    “Nutello” was not used as a trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In any case, quite apart from the fact that
                    the Defendant had, prior to the closing submissions, run its case as if
                    “Nutello” was used in a trade mark sense, I am of the view that
                    the “Nutello” sign was in fact used as a trade mark. The
                    definition of a “trade mark” in s 2(1) of the TMA (reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above) requires that the allegedly
                    infringing sign must be (a) capable of being represented graphically; and (b)
                    capable of distinguishing goods and services dealt with or provided by a person
                    from goods or services so dealt with or provided by any other person. In the
                    present case, it is clear that the “Nutello” sign is capable of
                    being represented graphically (see the graphical reproduction of the
                    “Nutello” sign in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).
                    Furthermore, being an invented word, the “Nutello” sign is capable
                    of distinguishing goods and services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     With regard to this last-mentioned point
                        (<em>viz</em>, that the “Nutello” sign is
                    capable of distinguishing the Defendant’s products), I find that the
                    “Nutello” sign was not only intended and used to identify the
                    Defendant’s product, it was also perceived by members of the public as
                    providing such identification. I am fortified in this observation for the
                    reasons that follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, although Mr Christopher Tan did deny
                    during cross-examination that “Nutello” was used as a trade mark,
                    his denial should be looked at in context: it should be noted that Mr
                    Christopher Tan also denied that the Defendant’s company had any trade
                    marks, when as a matter of fact the Defendant had registered its trade mark
                    “tcc” in class 30, registration number T0313398G on 5 September
                    2003. Accordingly, Mr Christopher Tan’s bare denials that the
                    “Nutello” sign was used as a trade mark should be regarded with
                    circumspection since, with respect, he did not appear to understand what a
                    “trade mark” was.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Indeed, it should be noted that
                    notwithstanding the bare denials mentioned above, the views espoused by Mr
                    Christopher Tan during cross-examination suggest that “Nutello”
                    was being used as a trade mark. The relevant extracts of cross-examination are
                    reproduced below for easy reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     He testified that everybody knew
                        that the “Nutello” sign referred to the particular product in

                        Defendant’s company:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Second, it was clear from the Internet blogs
                    adduced in evidence that bloggers had used the “Nutello” sign to
                    refer to the Defendant’s product. In other words, the
                    “Nutello” sign had been perceived by members of the public to
                    designate the particular product produced by the Defendant. It is also evident
                    from the Defendant’s pleadings that the “Nutello” sign was
                    used in the course of trade, in relation to gourmet coffees which were sold in
                    the Defendant’s exclusive TCC cafés.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Defendant attempted, in the reply
                    submissions, to characterise “Nutello” as being <em>descriptive</em>, relying on a statement by Christopher Tan that the
                    name “Nutello” was coined to indicate that the drinks had included
                    the ingredients of espresso and the “Nutella” spread. However, for
                    the reasons given above this was, in my view, too little too late.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Therefore, I find that the use of the
                    “Nutello” sign by the Defendant to label or mark this special
                    drink at its TCC outlets and in its booklet, drinks menu and promotional
                    materials (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>) so as to inform and
                    identify for its customers and other members of the public that the drink
                    labelled or marked as “Nutello” originates from the Defendant
                    would amount to trade mark use. Such a finding concludes the threshold issue on
                    both the traditional approach and the broader Community approach. Having crossed
                    this threshold, I turn now to examine each of the three elements of trade mark
                    infringement under s 27(2) of the TMA (see [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Similarity of marks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Similarity of marks is the <em>first</em> element to be considered. Whether the
                    “Nutello” sign and the “Nutella” word mark are
                    similar for the purposes of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA is a question of fact and
                    degree for the court’s determination (<em>Polo</em>
                    at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In a recent case, the High Court in <em>Ozone Community Corp v Advance Magazine Publishers Inc</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 459 (“<em>Ozone
                        Community</em>”) adopted a two-step approach in analysing the
                    similarity of marks, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether there is <em>visual</em>, <em>aural</em> and <em>conceptual</em> similarity between the allegedly
                        infringing sign and the registered trade mark; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the registered trade mark is
                            <em>distinctive</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With regard to the former, it is trite that
                    the court will consider whether there is <em>visual</em>,
                        <em>aural</em> and <em>conceptual</em> similarity between the marks (<em>MediaCorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks plc</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 496 at [32]
                        (“<em>MediaCorp</em>”)). It is also well
                    established that the law does not require all three similarities to be made out
                    before the finding that the marks are similar can be made (<em>ibid</em>). On the other hand, the fact that one similarity is made
                    out does not necessarily mean that the marks are similar (<em>ibid</em>). The relative importance of each type of similarity will
                    depend on the circumstances at hand, including the goods and types of marks
                    involved (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With regard to the latter, it is noted that
                    the <em>Ozone Community</em> decision was made in the
                    context of determining similarity for the purposes of <em>registrability</em> of trade marks, <em>viz</em>
                    whether a sign was (un)registrable because it was similar to an earlier trade
                    mark under s 8 of the TMA. However, it should be noted that the court in
                        <em>Ozone Community</em> cited (at [45]) the Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Polo</em> (a case dealing with trade mark
                    infringement under s 27(2) of the TMA) in fleshing out the proposition that the
                    distinctiveness of the registered trade mark is an important factor in the
                    inquiry. Accordingly, the factor of distinctiveness of the registered trade mark
                    should be considered in the present case as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Before turning to undertake the two-step
                    approach just mentioned, several legal principles guiding such a determination
                    should be emphasised:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the court considers the two
                        signs/marks “as a whole” (<em>Polo</em>
                        at [8]; <em>City
                            Chain</em> at [47],
                            [50]). However, the court would
                        not take into account “any external added matter or
                        circumstances” because the comparison is “mark for
                        mark” (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33], citing <em>Caterpillar Inc v Ong Eng Peng</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 669
                        at [55] (“<em>Caterpillar</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the signs/marks are considered from the viewpoint
                        of the average consumer –
                        <em>not</em> an unthinking person in a hurry, but
                        rather, a person who would exercise some care and good sense in making his
                        purchases (<em>Polo</em> at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, when comparing the two signs/marks, what
                        is relevant is the “imperfect recollection” of the customer
                            (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33], citing <em>Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v
                            Jeffery Mark Richard</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 at
                            [30]). The court will not
                        compare the two marks side by side and examine them in detail, because
                        “the person who is confused often makes comparison from memory
                        removed in time and space from the marks” (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [33],
                        citing <em>Caterpillar</em> at [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Visual, Aural and Conceptual Similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Visual similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the case of word marks, a determination of
                    visual similarity typically involves looking at the (a) length of the marks; (b)
                    structure of the marks (<em>ie</em>, whether there are the
                    same number of words); and (c) whether the same letters are used in the marks
                        (<em>Ozone Community</em> at [49], citing Bently &amp; Sherman, <em>Intellectual Property Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd
                    Ed, 2009) at 865 (“<em>Bently &amp;
                    Sherman</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     With respect to visual similarity, it is noted
                    that both the “Nutella” mark and “Nutello” sign
                    comprise 7 letters each, with the first 6 letters being identical and only the
                    last being different. The type of similarity here alleged was considered in the
                    case of <em>Hyundai Mobis v Mobil Petroleum Company
                        Inc</em> [2007] SGIPOS 12 (<em>Mobil
                        (SGIPOS)</em>), where the marks in question were as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">In that case, the Principal Assistant Registrar (“PAR”)
                    held at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In considering visual similarity, I will take into account only the
                        Applicants’ mark as it appears on the application form and the
                        Opponents’ registered trade marks in class 4 as they appear on the
                        register. Both are in capital letters and appear as MOBIS and MOBIL.
                            <em>Both comprise 5 letters. The first 4 letters are
                            identical and only the last letter is different</em>. The
                        Applicants relied on the UK IP office decision and the hearing
                        officer’s view on visual similarity that the letters L and S will not
                        be viewed as similar. However I am of the view that <em>when
                            the marks are viewed as wholes, a large part of the marks are similar
                            and only the ending parts of the marks are different</em>.
                        Therefore the marks are visually similar. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On appeal, the High Court in <em>Mobil Petroleum Co, Inc v Hyundai Mobis</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 427 (“<em>Mobil
                    (HC)</em>”) did not disagree with the decision of the PAR
                        (<em>Mobil (HC)</em> at [18]). Indeed, the High Court agreed that there was visual
                    similarity between the marks, although it noted that the degree of resemblance
                    was limited to some extent by the differences in font, capitalisation and
                    colours (<em>ibid</em> at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The reasoning of the PAR, reproduced above at
                        <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, applies to the present case. Here,
                    both the “Nutella” word mark and “Nutello” sign are
                    of identical length (<em>viz</em>, 7 letters), the first 6
                    letters of which are identical, with only the last letter (“a”
                    <em>contra</em> “o”) being different. I note
                    that the “Nutella” word mark consists of bold, capitalised,
                    sans-serif letters, whereas the “Nutello” sign is stylised and in
                    sentence case. However, as in the <em>Mobil</em> case, such
                    differences may not be sufficient to render the marks visually dissimilar.
                    Furthermore, taking into consideration the consumer’s “imperfect
                    recollection” and that the marks are not to be compared side-by-side
                        (<em>MediaCorp</em> at [34]), the marks are visually similar when viewed
                    holistically.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     At this juncture, I address the
                    Defendant’s argument that the “Nutella” word mark and
                    “Nutello” sign bear different font, typeface and design. According
                    to the Defendant, the “Nutella” word mark consists of plain
                    letters in bold and capital letters, whereas the “Nutello” sign is
                    stylised and in sentence case. This, the Defendant submits, constitutes visual
                    dissimilarity between the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This argument is misconceived. It is trite law
                    that word-only registered trade marks render infringing any offending use in any
                    font or stylisation. As stated by the learned authors of <em>Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2005) (“<em>Kerly’s</em>”) at para 2-036:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Consider a word-only registration. The graphical representation is the
                        word in capitals in plain type. Such a registration covers the word in a
                        very wide range of typefaces. The variation in presentation is permissible
                        because the distinctive character of the mark resides in the word itself and
                        that does not change.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The above passage from <em>Kerly’s</em> was cited with approval in <em>Richemont International SA v Da Vinci Collections Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 369 (“<em>Richemont v Da
                    Vinci</em>”)). The learned judge in <em>Richemont v
                        Da Vinci</em> went on to quote from the English Court of Appeal case
                    of <em>Morny Ld’s Trade Marks, in the Matter of</em>
                    (1951) 68 RPC 131 (“<em>Morny</em>”), a
                    passage which, for its relevance to the present case, justifies reproduction in
                    full (<em>Richemont v Da Vinci</em> at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Morny</em> … , it was held that use of the
                        mark "Morny" (which had been registered as "MORNY" in plain block capitals)
                        in various stylised forms amounted to use of the registered mark. Evershed
                        MR stated at 145:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The question is: Was or is the use of the word "Morny", in the form or
                            manner which I have attempted to describe, user of the mark "Morny" as
                            registered, consisting, as I have stated, of the five letters
                            "M-o-r-n-y" in capital letters?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It seems to me that, if a name is registered, you may either register
                            it under Para. (<em>a</em>) of Sec. 9 (1) (that is
                            to say, in a particular representation) or not. And, if it is not
                            registered as a particular representation of the name, then the
                            inference, I should have thought, must be that it was not intended to
                            confine it to the form in which it was registered, but that the thing
                            that was intended was use of that particular name in any way
                            representing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Similarly, Jenkins LJ observed at 149-150:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The mark in question is "Morny" in block capitals and I should have
                            thought, as my Lord has in effect said, that it must really be obvious
                            that the registration of a word in block capitals must cover use of that
                            word in any clearly legible form of lettering and not be confined to its
                            representation in block capitals. <b><em>Otherwise the
                                registration of a mark consisting of a name in block capitals would
                                give virtually no protection at all, for anyone could use the same
                                word in some other form of type or lettering in imitation
                                handwriting or some other form of that kind</em></b>; and it would
                            obviously be impossible for anyone seeking to register a particular
                            word, such as "Morny", to cover in his application or applications every
                            conceivable form of lettering in which it might be represented.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge went on to state (<em>Richemont v Da
                        Vinci</em> at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Besides, Lord Walker's statement that "[t]he distinction between plain
                        words and stylised words is legally significant" can be explained: Where, as
                        registered, the words constituting a mark are in stylised script, as in the
                            <em>Budweiser</em> case, their use in block
                        capitals would likely fall outside the use in s 46(2) of the UK Trade Marks
                        Act 1994. In contrast, as we have seen, <b><em>the registration
                            of the word mark in plain capitals covers use of the word in any other
                            form of lettering</em></b>: see <em>Morny</em>. [emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge went on to hold that the use of the words “Da
                    Vinci” in <em>cursive</em> form constituted an
                    infringement of the registered trade mark “Da Vinci” in <em>block capitals</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The reasoning in <em>Richemont
                        v Da Vinci</em>, <em>Morny</em> and <em>Kerly’s</em> is compelling. A block letter word mark is
                    registered without any additional distinctiveness by virtue of stylisation by
                    way of font type or graphical device. It would be illogical that the protection
                    granted to a registered proprietor’s trade mark may be circumscribed
                    simply by tweaking the <em>font</em> or <em>style</em> of the lettering of the word mark, especially where the
                    registered proprietor had deliberately registered the word mark in block letters
                    to represent that the distinctiveness of the mark lies <em>in the
                        word itself</em>. It would also be impractical for the proprietor of a
                    trade mark to have to register <em>every possible stylistic
                        permutation</em> for his word mark in order to protect his trade mark,
                    just as it would be impractical for him to have to make a fresh registration
                    every time he wishes to use his word mark in a different font.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Following from the above, the
                    Defendant’s argument that the cursive font of the “Nutello”
                    sign renders it visually dissimilar from the block capital registration of the
                    “Nutella” word mark fails. In this regard, I would further note
                    that besides the use of the cursive font used in the Defendant’s menu, the
                    Defendant had also used the “Nutello” sign on its website and a
                    booklet; these “Nutello” signs were not distinguished by the use
                    of any special font whatsoever (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the final analysis, therefore, the
                    “Nutello” sign is visually similar to the “Nutella”
                    word mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Aural similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the present case, the Plaintiff’s
                    mark is “Nutella” and the Defendant’s mark is
                    “Nutello”. The Plaintiff has confirmed that the correct
                    pronunciation of “Nutella” is “<em>noot</em>ella”, based on the testimony of the
                    Plaintiff’s representative Mr Malatesta as well as the Plaintiff’s
                    video advertisements aired in Singapore. This pronunciation is borne out of the
                    Italian pronunciation of the word “nut”. To the credit of counsel
                    for the Defendant, he pointed out that an article by Adnkronos Multimedia,
                    featured on the Italian Institute for Foreign Trade’s website asserted
                    that the name is pronounced “<em>nut</em>ella” (emphasis added). The Defendant nonetheless argued
                    that – relying on the Italian pronunciation put forward by the Plaintiff
                    – the pronunciation of the Plaintiff’s mark is aurally dissimilar to
                    the pronunciation of “Nutello” (which, the Plaintiff contends,
                    begins with “nut” and stresses the last two syllables in the word
                        “nut<em>ello</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The aural difference emphasised by the
                    Defendant, however, is more apparent than real. First, it is important to
                    consider the way that the average consumer <em>in
                        Singapore</em> would pronounce the marks. In this regard, I refer to
                    the <em>Mobil</em> case, where the learned PAR held that
                    “Mobil” and “Mobis” were aurally similar. Comparing
                    both marks, only the last consonant sound (at the ending of the second syllable)
                    was different (<em>Mobil (SGIPOS)</em> at [39]). The PAR noted that although in the UK
                    the same marks were considered not to be aurally similar, such a finding was
                    based on the normal pronunciation of the marks in the UK, which did not
                    necessarily apply to Singapore (<em>Mobil (SGIPOS)</em> at
                        [39]). On appeal, the High Court in
                        <em>Mobil (HC)</em> did not disagree that there was
                    aural similarity in the two marks. Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    two of the three syllables (“<em>nut-te-</em>[la/lo]”) will be pronounced the same way by the
                    average consumer in Singapore. In this regard, notwithstanding the
                    Plaintiff’s evidence that “Nutella” is more precisely
                    pronounced (at least, by Italians) as “nootella”, it should be
                    noted that in the course of cross-examination, Mr Christopher Tan read
                    “Nutella” as “<em>nut</em>ella”
                    (as opposed to “<em>noot</em>ella”). Mr
                    Christopher Tan later confirmed that both he and his customers pronounced the
                    first syllable as “nut”. It is therefore clear that the first two
                    syllables of the word “Nutella” are pronounced in a manner
                        <em>identical</em> to the first two syllables of the
                    word “Nutello”. “Nutella” and
                    “Nutello” are accordingly aurally <em>similar</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Second, and subject to the caveat above that
                    pronunciation may differ between UK and Singapore, it is generally accepted that
                    the <em>first syllable</em> of a word is usually the most
                    important for the purpose of distinction between words because there is a
                    tendency of persons using the English language to slur the <em>termination</em> of words, although this principle should not be
                    applied in a “blanket fashion” (<em>Valentino Globe
                        BV v Pacific Rim Industries Inc</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 577 at [34], citing <em>London
                        Lubricants (1920) Ltd’s Application</em> (1925) 42 RPC 264 at
                    279). Accordingly, where the words compared terminate with vowels rather than
                    consonants, there is arguably greater aural similarity between the words
                        (<em>Opposition by The Coca-Cola Company to the registration

                    difference between “Nutella” and “Nutello” is the
                    final vowel sound (“a”
                    <em>contra</em> “o”), the Hearing
                    Officer’s observation in <em>Coca-Cola</em> is
                    especially apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the English language vowel sounds for ‘o’ and
                        ‘a’ at the ends of SOLO and SOLA could readily be mispronounced
                        or misheard. The first part of each word, SOL-, is identical. On this basis
                        … I find that the marks SOLO and SOLA COLA are deceptively
                        similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I note that the beginning syllable sounds of marks may not <em>always</em> be more important than the ending syllables
                    – there may be some cases where emphasis may be placed on some other
                    syllable. For instance, in <em>Mobil (SGIPOS)</em>, the PAR
                    found that “Mobil” and “Mobis” were pronounced with
                    emphasis on the second syllable (<em>Mobil (SGIPOS)</em> at
                        [40]). Similarly, in <em>Opposition by MCT UNILABELS SA to Trade Mark Application No 462838

                    the invented word “<em>cappé</em>” may be
                    pronounced with an emphasis on the second syllable. In my view, however,
                    “Nutella” and “Nutello” are probably pronounced with
                    an emphasis on the first syllable, and the last syllable – being a vowel
                    sound – is not sufficiently different to render the two words aurally
                    dissimilar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Third, as was exhorted in <em>Future Enterprises Pte Ltd v McDonald’s Corp</em> [2006] 4
                    SLR(R) 629 (“<em>Future Enterprises
                    (HC)</em>”) at [12], aural
                    similarity must be considered in light of “imperfect recollection”
                    and “careless pronunciation and speech”, rather than as if the
                    marks were being pronounced carefully by someone such as a “teacher of
                    elocution”. In <em>Future Enterprises (HC)</em>, the
                    court found that “MacCoffee” (pronounced
                    “mac-kof-fee”) was aurally similar to “McCafe”
                    (pronounced “mac-caf-fay” or “mc-kah-fay”).
                        <em>A fortiori</em>, “Nutella”
                    (pronounced “nut-te-la”) is clearly aurally similar to
                    “Nutello” (pronounced “nut-te-lo”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I therefore find that the Defendant’s
                    sign, “Nutello”, is aurally similar to the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” word mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Conceptual similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In considering whether there is <em>conceptual</em> similarity between marks, it is necessary to
                    consider the <em>ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier
                        mark</em> (<em>Festina Lotus SA v Romanson Co

                    866).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In <em>Festina</em>, the
                    High Court considered several cases dealing with conceptual similarity. The
                    illustrations provide some guidance on how conceptual similarity is analysed.
                    The relevant paragraphs in <em>Festina</em> are reproduced
                    here (<em>Festina</em> at [40]-[42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    A clear case of conceptual dissimilarity can be
                            seen in <em>Phillips – Van Heusen</em>,
                            T– 292/01 [2003] ECR II – 4335 where “BASS”
                            was found to be conceptually dissimilar to “PASH” as the
                            former was understood as a musical reference whereas the latter either
                            had no meaning or referred to German dice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    
              <em>Itochu Corporation v Worldwide

                            offers a more nuanced illustration of conceptual similarity. In
                                <em>Itochu</em>, the PAR (and subsequently the
                            High Court) held that the marks “CAMEL” and
                            “SWEETCAMEL” were conceptually dissimilar: the
                            “CAMEL” mark evoked a sense of “ruggedness,
                            adventure and masculinity” whereas the applicant’s mark
                            “SWEETCAMEL” which was preceded by the adjective
                            “SWEET” projected a totally opposite
                        impression.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    In the case of <em>Ozone Community
                                Corp</em>, the two marks in issue were “GLAMOUR”
                            and “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”. The PAR found that both marks were
                            in some way conceptually similar as both marks used the
                            “glamour” concept, despite one appealing to the orthodox
                            meaning while the other giving the concept a spin without completely
                            altering its texture. This finding was upheld by the High Court at
                            [64].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     On the facts of <em>Festina</em> itself, the court considered that (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">insofar as the two marks comprise an invented word, in that
                        “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” are not English terms
                        found in dictionaries, and that both employ a pictorial element that hints
                        at “class” and “status”, there are <em>some</em> conceptual similarities between the two marks,
                        as opposed to complete or significant similarities, bearing in mind that the
                        crest and crown devices evoke a sense of class but only the crown device
                        evokes a sense of royalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Considering the three cases analysed in the
                    quotation from <em>Festina</em> (reproduced at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above), the present case most closely
                    resembles the facts in <em>Festina</em> itself: the
                    “Nutella/Nutello” comparison is closer to the
                    “Festina/Jestina” comparison, than it is with the
                    “Bass/Pash”, “Came/Sweetcamel” and
                    “Glamour/Hysteric Glamour” comparisons. Conceptually, both
                    “Nutella” and “Nutello” are invented words, in that
                    they are not English words found in dictionaries. The imperfect recollection of
                    an average consumer, who does not juxtapose the two marks side-by-side, will
                    probably consider the marks to be conceptually similar. Indeed, it should also
                    be noted that Mr Christopher Tan admitted under cross-examination that the word
                    “Nutello” was <em>derived</em> from the words
                    “Nutella” and “espresso”; having been so derived,
                    and with only a minor change being made to the word “Nutella”, it
                    is difficult to see how “Nutella” and “Nutello” are
                    conceptually dissimilar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Distinctiveness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As alluded to above, the relevance of the
                    distinctiveness of the registered trade mark was discussed in <em>Polo</em>. The Court of Appeal held that the <em>distinctiveness</em> in the registered trade mark (<em>ie</em>, the “Nutella” word mark in this case) is an
                    important factor in the inquiry into the similarity between the marks, stating
                    that (at [23]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We recognise that some marks are inherently <b><em>distinctive</em></b> because they consist of <b><em>inventive words without any notional or allusive quality</em></b>. An
                        example would be “Volvo”. “Polo” is certainly
                        not an inventive word and could claim no inherent distinctiveness. <b><em>Where common words are included in a registered mark, the
                            courts should be wary of granting a monopoly in their use</em></b>:

                        original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal went on to find that the word “polo”
                    was an “ordinary English word meaning a game played on horseback”,
                    and was accordingly “not an inventive word and could claim no inherent
                    distinctiveness” (<em>Polo</em> at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The factor of distinctiveness is important
                    because it affects the question of whether marks are similar. As was noted in
                        <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> at pp 866-868 (and cited
                    in <em>Ozone Community</em> at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Distinctiveness</em>. The question of whether
                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired
                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is
                        registered). This has a number of effects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, the <em>less distinctive</em> the earlier

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, if the earlier mark is <em>highly
                            distinctive</em>, then a mark that has been <b><em>substantially modified might still be similar</em></b>. … [The

                    alluded to by the High Court in <em>The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop

                        I first have to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>Festina</em>, in
                    the context of <em>registrability</em> of trade marks under
                    s 8 of the TMA, the High Court noted that invented words such as
                    “FESTINA” possess inherent distinctiveness, and such distinctive
                    quality would be taken into account in the overall assessment of similarity
                    between the marks (<em>Festina</em> at [58]). The court further held that for such
                    invented words with inherent distinctiveness, a “<em>modification of at least a substantial degree</em> has to be done for
                    the Respondent’s mark to be found to be dissimilar to it”
                        (<em>Festina</em> at [60], emphasis added). The court went on to find that the
                    respondent’s mark (“J.ESTINA”) was similar to the registered
                    “FESTINA” mark as the latter was an inherently distinctive
                    invented word.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It is undisputed that the word
                    “Nutella” has no dictionary meaning. It is an invented word which
                    is inherently distinctive. Merely changing the last letter of the mark from an
                    “a” to an “o” is insufficient, as such a change does
                    not amount to “modification of at least a substantial degree”
                        (<em>Festina</em> at [60]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Concluding analysis: the marks are similar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As demonstrated above, there is visual, aural
                    and conceptual similarity in the marks “Nutella” and
                    “Nutello”. The “Nutella” mark, being an invented
                    word, is inherently distinctive, and the Defendant has not made sufficient
                    modification to it such as to render “Nutello” dissimilar to
                    “Nutella”. In the final analysis, I find that the marks are
                    similar, and accordingly, that the <em>first</em> element
                    of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA is made out. I would here add that although the
                    similarity of the marks is an objective inquiry to be undertaken by the court
                    (rather than by witnesses), I am fortified in my view that the marks are similar
                    by the fact that at least two of the Defendant’s witnesses, <em>viz</em> Mr Christopher Tan and Mr Robin Ng, agreed to the
                    same under cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Identity or Similarity of goods</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In order for the requirement of identity or
                    similarity of goods to be fulfilled, the Plaintiff must show that the
                    “Nutello” sign is used in relation to goods that are identical or
                    similar to those for which the “Nutella” word mark is <em>registered</em> (see s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, reproduced at

                    goods identical or similar to “[c]onfectionery, baking powder, chocolate

                        <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The identity or similarity of goods is to be
                    determined by taking into account all relevant factors, including the nature of
                    the goods, end users, method of use and whether they are in competition or
                    complementary (<em>Canon Kabushiki Kaisha v Metro Goldwyn Mayer
                        Inc</em> [1999] ETMR 1 at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Are the goods identical?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>British Sugar plc v
                        James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd</em> [1996] RPC 281 (“<em>British Sugar</em>”), Jacob J formulated a set of
                    guidelines to assist the court in assessing the <em>similarity</em> of goods (the guidelines are set out in <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> below). For the avoidance of doubt, it should
                    be emphasised that these factors are considered only in situations where the
                    goods are being analysed for <em>similarity</em>. In other
                    words, once it has been determined that the goods are <em>identical</em> from a comparison of the goods’ specifications,
                    there is no need to consider the said guidelines (<em>Richemont
                        International SA v Goldlion Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 401 (“<em>Richemont v
                    Goldlion</em>”) at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Plaintiff argued in closing submissions
                    that the “Nutello” sign was used on goods (<em>viz</em>, the Defendant’s “Nutello” drink) which
                    fall within the broad specification of “chocolate products” (for
                    which the “Nutella” mark is registered – see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above). Therefore, the Plaintiff argues that
                    the “Nutello” sign is used in relation to goods <em>identical</em> to those for which the “Nutella” mark is
                    registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     This argument depends on the Plaintiff being
                    able to show that the Defendant’s product fell within the specification of
                    “chocolate products”. To this end, the Plaintiff argued that the
                    Defendant’s product was a chocolate product for the following
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the <em>main
                            ingredient</em> in the Defendant’s “Nutello”
                        drink is the use of the Plaintiff’s “Nutella” chocolate
                        spread. The “Nutello” drink was promoted as being
                        “[e]spresso with <em>lashings</em> of
                        Nutella” (emphasis added), the word “lashings” being
                        defined as “a <em>copious</em> amount of
                        something, especially food or drink” (as defined by <em>The New Oxford Dictionary of English</em> (Oxford
                        University Press, 1998) at p 1038);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the product is <em>marketed</em> by the Defendant in the Defendant’s menu as
                        being “[p]erfect for <em>cocoa
                        lovers</em>” (emphasis added). It should be noted that Mr
                        Christopher Tan agreed under cross-examination that the Defendant attempted
                        to attract chocolate lovers when promoting the “Nutello”
                        drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the <em>manner</em> in which the
                        “Nutello” drink is served shows that it is a chocolate
                        product. In cross-examination, Mr Christopher Tan confirmed that the
                        Defendant’s customers could, when drinking the “Nutello”
                        drink, either scoop up the portions of the “Nutella” chocolate
                        spread which was not dissolved in the espresso, or scoop out the
                        “Nutella” chocolate spread before it dissolved so as to
                        consume the chocolate spread directly. The manner of consumption of the
                        “Nutello” drink, <em>viz</em> where the
                        consumer could actually consume the chocolate spread directly, was confirmed
                        by the Plaintiff’s witness Mr Ramakuddy in oral testimony. It was also
                        confirmed by other consumers of the “Nutello” drink in their
                        Internet blogs. For example, one customer noted that “[T]hey provide
                        a small spoon for you to nibble and scrape the chocolate…”,
                        another noted “[w]hen you put your spoon in, you will haul out a
                        spoonful of gooey Nutella mixed with rich coffee”, and yet another
                        noted that the drink was “a single e[s]presso shot with lotsa
                            [<em>sic</em>] [N]utella in
                    it”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth,
                        the Defendant’s customers <em>perceive</em> the
                        “Nutello” drink to be a chocolate product. The Plaintiff
                        attempted to substantiate this contention from two different sources.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_80-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       In the market survey
                            conducted by the Defendant, when survey respondents were asked regarding
                            the most likely reason for them to purchase the “Nutello”
                            drink, most (<em>viz</em>, 30%) of the respondents
                            indicated that they liked “the taste of Nutella <em>chocolate</em>” (emphasis added). A further
                            24.8% responded that they wanted to “try new drinks/new
                            flavour/new taste of <em>Nutella
                            flavour</em>” (emphasis added), while 16% said that they
                            would purchase the “Nutello” drink because they
                            “[l]ike[d] the <em>taste of
                            chocolate</em>” (emphasis added). It is notable that, of
                            the respondents who would <em>not</em> purchase the
                            “Nutello” drink, the largest percentage (<em>viz</em>, 5.2%) indicated that they would <em>not</em> purchase the drink because they “do
                            not drink <em>chocolate drinks</em>”
                            (emphasis added). Analysing the survey response, the survey report
                            concluded that with regard to the “Nutello” drink, most of
                            the surveyed respondents provided “mostly positive [feedback]
                            with people being attracted to <em>chocolate</em>
                            and <em>specifically the Nutella ingredient</em>.
                            Some would reject the drink for being too sweet or for not liking
                                <em>chocolate drinks</em>” (emphasis
                            added). It should be noted that most of the survey respondents were
                            attracted by the <em>chocolate character</em> of
                            the “Nutello” drink. It is also significant that most of
                            the survey respondents who would not purchase the drink were repelled by
                            the drink’s <em>chocolate
                            character</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_80-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       In addition, perusal of Internet blogs (which
                            were, incidentally, adduced in evidence by the <em>Defendant</em> rather than the Plaintiff) reveals that many
                            of the consumers of the “Nutello” drink emphasised the
                                <em>chocolate content</em> of the drink. For
                            example, one customer noted that “Nutello” was a shot of
                            espresso with “nutella smeared all over… I[f] you are a
                                <em>chocolate lover</em>, this is the drink for
                            you…” (emphasis added), another noted “[i]f you
                                <em>like chocolate</em>, try Nutello!”
                            (emphasis added) and yet another complimented the “<em>thick layer</em> of Nutella… [with] fragrant
                            espresso and a layer of whipped cream, finally <em>dusted
                                with cocoa powder</em>” (emphasis
                    added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Despite the rigorous arguments just outlined,
                    I am ultimately not convinced that the “Nutello” drink is a
                    “chocolate product”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, although the
                        “Nutello” drink was recommended for “chocolate
                        lovers” (see [80(b)] above), it was advertised under the
                        “Espresso Specialties” section of the Defendant’s
                        menu.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        the fact that one of the ingredients in the “Nutello” drink is
                        a chocolate spread does not <em>per se</em> make the
                        drink a <em>chocolate product</em>. I note that it is
                        possible for a product to fall within one or more categories. However, I do
                        not think that the “Nutello” drink is a “chocolate
                        product” simply by virtue of the fact that there was
                        “Nutella” chocolate spread in it. To do so would be akin to
                        describing coffee drinks as milk products (by virtue of milk being one of
                        the ingredients) and describing certain teas as fruit products (by virtue of
                        dried fruits being one of the ingredients).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Defendant rightly pointed out that
                        Class 30 of the International Classification of Goods and Services (under
                        which the Plaintiff’s “Nutella” mark was registered)
                        comprises a list of specific goods indications, which include categories of
                        goods such as “Beverages (Chocolate-based)”, “Beverages
                        (Cocoa-based)”, “Chocolate beverages with milk”,
                        “Chocolate-based beverages”, <em>etc</em>. The Plaintiff <em>could</em> have, but
                        did not or chose not to, include any beverage-related specifications in the
                        registration of the “Nutella” mark. The specification of
                        “chocolate products” thus does not appear to me to have been
                        intended to cover <em>all</em> beverages with some
                        chocolate content.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I turn next to consider whether the
                    “Nutello” sign is used in relation to goods <em>similar</em> to those for which the “Nutella” mark is
                    registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Are the goods similar?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     As alluded to above at <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>, Jacob J in <em>British
                        Sugar</em> formulated a set of guidelines to assist the court in
                    assessing the similarity of goods. The factors laid out in <em>British Sugar</em> were adopted by Singapore courts (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Caterpillar</em> at
                        [57]; <em>MediaCorp</em> at [41] and
                        <em>Ozone Community</em> at [75]). The factors are as follows (<em>British Sugar</em> at 296-297):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The respective uses of the respective goods or
                            services;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The respective users of the respective goods or
                            services;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The physical nature of the goods or acts of
                            service;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The respective trade channels through which the
                            goods or services reach the market;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">In the case of self-serve consumer items, whether
                            in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found in
                            supermarkets and in particular whether they are, or are likely to be,
                            found on the same or different shelves;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The extent to which the respective goods or
                            services are competitive. This inquiry may take into account how those
                            in the trade classify goods, for instance whether market research
                            companies, who of course act for the industry, put the goods or services
                            in the same or different sectors.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Relying on the above factors, the Defendant
                    argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the <em>uses</em> of the respective goods are different. The
                        Plaintiff’s “Nutella” product is not a beverage but a
                        bread spread, is not usually consumed by itself but in conjunction with
                        bread, and is usually consumed during breakfast. In contrast, the
                        Defendant’s “Nutello” drink is used in relation to
                        liquid gourmet coffee beverage, and is used for purposes distinctly
                        different from those of the Plaintiff’s semi-solid, semi-liquid
                        viscous cream spread.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the <em>users</em> of the respective
                        goods are different. The users of the Plaintiff’s
                        “Nutella” product are mainly ordinary shoppers looking for
                        bread spreads for breakfast for their families, while the users of the
                        Defendant’s “Nutello” drink are mainly discerning and
                        well-informed professionals, managers, executives and business
                        people.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
                        the <em>physical nature</em> of the respective goods is
                        different. The Defendant’s “Nutello” drink is a
                        concoction comprising a number of ingredients, and is served in a shot glass
                        rather than a jar. On the other hand, the Plaintiff’s product is a
                        dark brown, viscous cream spread presented in a jar.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the <em>trade
                            channels</em> of the respective goods are different. The
                        Plaintiff’s “Nutella” product is sold in supermarkets,
                        convenience stores and neighbourhood shops, on shelves alongside jams and
                        breads. In contrast, the Defendant’s “Nutello” drink is
                        promoted and sold exclusively at TCC outlets in a restaurant
                    setting.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the
                        respective goods are neither <em>competitive</em> with,
                        nor <em>substitutes</em> for, one another. The
                        Plaintiff’s goods compete with other brands of bread spreads, while
                        the Defendant’s goods compete with other coffee companies and
                        cafés.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In addition, the Defendant pointed out that in
                        <em>British Sugar</em>, Jacob J also held that in
                    construing a word used in a trade mark specification (in the present case,
                    “chocolate products”), the court is (<em>British
                        Sugar</em> at 289):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… concerned with how the product is, as a <em>practical matter</em>, regarded for the <em>purposes of trade</em>. After all, a trade mark specification is
                        concerned with <em>use in trade</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Relying on this observation by Jacob J, the Defendant argued that a
                    product specification must be construed in accordance with its <em>use in trade</em>. Accordingly, the Defendant argues that the
                    expression “chocolate products” (in the product specification
                    under which the “Nutella” word mark is registered) must be
                    construed in accordance with the Plaintiff’s products as used in practice,
                        <em>viz</em>, as a sweet bread spread rather than a
                    beverage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The arguments raised by the Defendant have
                    some weight, and do appear to suggest that the respective goods are not similar
                    under the <em>British Sugar</em> guidelines. However, in
                    the final analysis, I find that the Defendant’s “Nutello”
                    drink is <em>similar</em> to the “chocolate
                    products” specification for which the “Nutella” word mark
                    is registered. As a matter of law, in determining the similarity of goods, the
                    comparison is made not only with the actual product in use (<em>viz</em> the Plaintiff’s sweet bread spread) but with the type
                    of products for which the Plaintiff has registered its word mark
                    “Nutella”. In this case, the comparison has to be with the
                    possible range of “chocolate products” as used in the trade and
                    not only with the Plaintiff’s sweet bread spread as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     It is also important to keep in mind that the
                        <em>British Sugar</em> factors “must not be
                    regarded as requirements that must all be satisfied before the goods can be
                    treated as similar” (<em>Johnson &amp; Johnson v Uni-Charm
                        Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at
                        [18]; <em>Mobil
                        (HC)</em> at [25]). Indeed,
                    Jacob J himself cautioned that he did not think that the list “can
                    provide other than general guidance” (<em>British
                        Sugar</em> at 297).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Second, it should be noted that in <em>British Sugar</em> the goods in question fell into <em>different classes</em> of product specification – the
                    proprietor’s mark was registered in Class 30, while the alleged
                    infringer’s products fell into Class 29. As was noted in <em>Polo (HC)</em> at [33]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly, I have very little doubt that the goods carried by the
                        plaintiff and the defendant are similar, if not identical, for the purposes
                        of s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) of the TMA. The
                        plaintiff’s trade marks were registered under Class 25 of the ICGS and
                        the defendant’s products which are being complained of (mainly
                        T-shirts) <b><em>would qualify to be registered in the same
                            class</em></b>, as evidenced by their attempted registration. This
                        being the case, <b><em>it is not necessary for the court to
                            engage in the test set down in British Sugar</em></b> … . The
                        test in that case was employed because the <b><em>defendant’s product would not have been registered in the same
                            class as the plaintiff’s and thus there was a need to decide if it
                            was similar enough</em></b><b>to the plaintiff’s product</b>. It would be
                        a <b>very rare case</b>, if ever, <b><em>that a defendant could claim that its products, if listed in the same
                            classification as the plaintiff’s, were not similar</em></b>.
                        … . [emphasis in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, the <em>British Sugar</em>
                    guidelines may not have as much weight (if any at all) in a situation where the
                    respective products <em>fall within the same class of
                        products</em>. On the present facts, the Defendant had pointed out (as
                    alluded to earlier in [81(c)] above), and accordingly must be taken to concede,
                    that the Defendant’s “Nutello” drink was likely to fall
                    within the categories of “beverages”. Such beverage-related
                    specifications are still <em>within</em> the Class 30
                    classification. I also take cognisance of the arguments addressed in <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above, albeit in the context of assessing
                    whether the Defendant’s “Nutello” drink was a
                    “chocolate product”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Third, the High Court in <em>Mobil (HC)</em> noted at [25]
                    that an “important” factor to be considered in determining whether
                    the respective goods are similar is “whether such goods will be
                    considered by consumers to be similar goods”. In this regard, the point
                    made in [80(d)] above demonstrates that the consumers <em>do
                        indeed</em> consider the respective goods to be similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For the reasons stated, I find that the
                    “Nutello” drink is similar to a chocolate product although it may
                    not be regarded as a chocolate product. Accordingly, the <em>second</em> element of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA is made
                out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the
                public</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The <em>third</em>
                    element of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA is the issue of the likelihood of confusion on
                    the part of the public. Before proceeding to apply the law to the facts of the
                    present case, I will summarise the relevant legal principles governing this
                    particular issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on “likelihood of confusion”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The issue of likelihood of confusion is to be
                    determined as at the time when the alleged infringing use of the sign commenced
                        (<em>City Chain</em> at [51]), the test being whether a <em>substantial
                        portion</em> of the <em>relevant public</em> will
                    be <em>confused</em>. The three italicised portions
                    indicate three different aspects of the test. I shall address them in the
                    following order: (a) the meaning and nature of the “confusion”
                    required by s 27(2)(b); (b) the meaning and nature of the “relevant
                    public”; and (c) the requirement of a “substantial portion”
                    of the relevant public being confused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     With regard to the meaning and nature of the
                    “confusion” required, the Court of Appeal in <em>City Chain</em> noted that in determining confusion, one should be
                    cognisant of the risk that the public might believe that the goods come from the
                        <em>same source</em> or <em>economically-linked</em> sources (see <em>City
                        Chain</em> at [52]). In other
                    words, the relevant confusion is not limited to the “classic
                    confusion” scenario where consumers believe that the goods or services
                    emanate from a particular origin (when they in fact come from another origin).
                    There is instead a “broader” kind of confusion stemming from the
                    consumer’s (incorrect) assumption of some kind of economic connection
                    between the users of the marks (<em>eg</em> that the goods
                    are being provided by a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark proprietor)
                    (see <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> at p 872).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It should further be noted that, by virtue of
                    the wording of s 27(2) of the TMA, the likelihood of confusion must arise
                        <em>because</em> of the similarities in the respective
                    marks and goods concerned. It is insufficient that the confusion arises for
                        <em>any other reason</em>. For instance, it would
                    clearly not be sufficient if a member of the public appears confused as to the
                    origin of the “Nutello” drink, such confusion stemming from his
                    incapability of understanding the survey questions directed at him (<em>eg</em> his inability to understand what it means to
                    “produce” a drink, or to “licence / authorise” a
                    drink, <em>etc</em>). This has important implications on
                    the framing of survey questions, and will be dealt with in greater detail at
                        [136] <em>et seq</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     With regard to the meaning and nature of the
                    “relevant public”, it is trite that the issue of likelihood of
                    confusion is to be determined by reference to average consumers of the goods and
                    services in question. Such consumers are reasonably well-informed, reasonably
                    observant and circumspect, and will exercise ordinary care and intelligence.
                    They are also literate, educated, “constantly exposed to the world,
                    either through travel or media” and are unlikely to be “easily
                    deceived or hoodwinked” (<em>McDonald’s Corp v
                        Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 177 at [64]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     With regard to the requirement that a
                    “substantial portion” of the relevant public must be confused, it
                    is insufficient that only a “single member of the public”, or
                    “a very small unobservant section of society”, or “a moron
                    in a hurry”, would be confused (<em>Mobil Petroleum Co Inc
                        v Hyundai Mobis</em> [2010] 1 SLR 512 (“<em>Mobil (CA)</em>”) at [79], citing <em>Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd
                        v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 903
                        (“<em>Tong Guan</em>”) at [24]). The degree of confusion must be taken
                    above a “<em>de minimis</em> level”, and
                    while there does not have to be a “majority” of the relevant
                    public that is confused, there must be a “not insubstantial
                    number” (<em>Mobil (CA)</em> at [77]-[78]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I turn now to other relevant principles
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the test for likelihood of
                    confusion. First, it is now well-settled that the issue of likelihood of
                    confusion is to be addressed <em>globally</em>, taking into
                    account all the circumstances of the case. This would include, <em>inter alia</em>, the closeness of the goods, the impression
                    given by the marks, the possibility of imperfect recollection and the risk that
                    the public might believe that the goods come from the same source or
                    economically-linked sources (<em>City Chain</em> at
                        [52], <em>Polo
                        (CA)</em> at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Second, following from the phrasing of s
                    27(2)(b) of the TMA, the requirement of confusion is not automatically made out
                    just because the marks and the respective goods on which they are used are
                    similar (<em>Polo (CA)</em> at [25]). In other words, there is <em>no
                        presumption</em> that confusion arises where the marks and goods are
                    similar (<em>Polo (CA)</em> at [8]). However, it is also clear from s 27(2)(b) that the
                    likelihood of confusion which is relevant is the likelihood of confusion which
                    is <em>caused</em> by the similarity of the respective
                    marks and goods to each other. Accordingly, it stands to reason that where there
                    is <em>greater similarity</em> in the marks and the goods,
                    it would be easier to find a likelihood of confusion (<em>Mobil
                        (CA)</em>); <em>Future Enterprises (HC)</em> at
                        [22]). For the same reason, where
                    the earlier mark is <em>distinctive</em>, it is more likely
                    that a court would find that a likelihood of confusion exists (see <em>Sabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport</em> [1998] RPC 199
                    at 224).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Third, it should be noted that steps taken by
                    the alleged infringer to differentiate his goods from those of the registered
                    proprietor are also relevant (<em>City Chain</em> at
                        [53], <em>Polo
                        (CA)</em> at [28]). Where the
                    alleged infringer has taken pains to distinguish his products from those of the
                    registered proprietor, the likelihood of confusion may turn out to be
                    “merely hypothetical or speculative” (<em>City
                        Chain</em> at [53], citing
                        <em>Polo (HC)</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Finally, the “mere
                    association” of the public between the two marks based on their similar
                    use is not <em>in itself</em> a sufficient basis for
                    concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion in the absence of any
                    possibility of misapprehension as to the <em>origin</em> of
                    the goods or services (<em>City Chain</em> at [58]). I emphasise that this holding is
                        <em>not inconsistent</em> with the point made in
                        [93] above with regard to the
                    “broader” kind of confusion stemming from the consumer’s
                    (incorrect) assumption of some kind of economic connection between the users of
                    the marks. The “economic connection” point relates to the
                        <em>origin</em> of the goods or services, <em>viz</em>, the (erroneous) belief that the goods are
                    originating from a licensee of the registered proprietor’s goods. This
                    must be contrasted with the “mere association” point, which
                    relates to – as the phrase itself suggests – a <em>mere</em> association, without any confusion as to <em>origin</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Before turning to apply the law to the facts
                    of the present case, it should be noted that the question as to whether
                    consumers are likely to be confused is an issue to be determined by the court.
                    The court does not, and cannot, abdicate this decision to witnesses (<em>Payton &amp; Co, Limited v Snelling, Lampard &amp; Co
                        Limited</em> [1901] AC 308 at 311, <em>Electrolux
                        Limited v Electrix Limited</em> (1954) 71 RPC 23 at 31 <em>per</em> Evershed MR).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    For the purposes of the present case, the
                    relevant date is 1 August 2007, which was the time when sale of the
                    “Nutello” drink in Singapore commenced (see also <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a>
                    above, as well as <a href="#p1_199">[199]</a>
                below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In many of the cases cited before me, the
                    issue of likelihood of confusion was often determined without the help of direct
                    survey evidence on the point (see, for instance, <em>City
                        Chain</em> at [57]). In the
                    present case, however, separate market surveys were done by the Plaintiff and
                    the Defendant. There are, however, notorious difficulties with the probative
                    value of market surveys, and I pause to note that this case raised interesting
                    questions about the design of surveys in ascertaining whether there is a
                    likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. At appropriate junctures in
                    the analysis that follows, I will evaluate the design of the said surveys. I
                    shall consider the Defendant’s survey first, followed by the
                    Plaintiff’s, before analysing whether the element of likelihood of
                    confusion is made out in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Defendant’s survey</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The Defendant engaged a market research
                    company, Kadence International Pte Ltd, to conduct a survey on the question of
                    whether the use of the “Nutello” sign in relation to the
                    Defendant’s product would cause a likelihood of confusion. The
                    Defendant’s expert witness, Mr Piers Lee, testified as to the truth and
                    accuracy of the survey. The survey was an exit survey conducted with the
                    Defendant’s customers at 20 different TCC outlets in Singapore. The sample
                    size of the survey was 500. The results of the Defendant’s survey showed
                    that 27% of the Defendant’s consumers who were surveyed believed that the
                    “Nutello” drink was produced by the manufacturer of the
                    “Nutella” chocolate spread (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Plaintiff), and that another 3% were of the opinion that “Nutello”
                    was produced by <em>both</em> the Defendant and the
                    Plaintiff. An additional 12% of the respondents answered that they
                    “can’t say” who produced the “Nutello” drink,
                    while 58% thought that the Defendant produced the “Nutello”
                    drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    According to the Defendant’s survey,
                    therefore, <em>at least</em> 30% of the consumers would be
                    confused into thinking that the “Nutello” product was either
                    produced by the Plaintiff, or the Plaintiff in association with the Defendant.
                    This is, the Plaintiff alleges, a substantial number of the relevant public who
                    would be confused as to the origin of “Nutello”
                product.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Indeed, the Plaintiff goes on to argue that
                    had the Defendant’s survey been carried out properly, it would have shown
                    that more than 30% of the relevant public would be confused. Five arguments are
                    raised to substantiate this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the sequence in which the
                        questions were asked and the manner in which the questions were framed
                        attempted to “teach” or “lead” the survey
                        respondents to the desired answer that it must be the Defendant which
                        produced the “Nutello” drink at its TCC outlet and not the
                        Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, in the most crucial question where the survey respondents were
                        asked regarding who they thought the producer of the “Nutello”
                        drink was, the respondents were forced to make a choice between the
                        Plaintiff and the Defendant, without any option of indicating that <em>both</em> the Plaintiff and the Defendant produced the
                        drink (see Question 8, reproduced in <a href="#p1_109">[109]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the relevant question is not whether the survey
                        respondents thought that the Plaintiff produced the “Nutello”
                        drink; instead, the relevant question is whether the respondents thought
                        that the Plaintiff produced <em>or licensed</em> the
                        “Nutello” drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Defendant’s expert admitted that if
                        more facts or time had been given, some of the 12% who indicated that they
                        “can’t say” could have said that the
                        “Nutello” drink was either produced by the Plaintiff, or the
                        Plaintiff in association with the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_106-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, the Defendant’s survey was
                        conducted on the Defendant’s customers as an exit survey, <em>viz</em>, after they had patronised the Defendant’s
                        outlet and as they were leaving it. The Defendant had consistently
                        characterised its customers as being well-educated and discerning. It is
                        therefore possible that had the survey been conducted on the <em>general public</em>, the proportion of the persons who
                        would have been confused might have been higher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Although the Defendant attempted, in Reply
                    Submissions, to dismiss the abovementioned arguments as being merely
                    “speculative”, there is, in my view, much merit in the
                    Plaintiff’s arguments. I limit my elaboration to the points raised in
                    sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    With regard to sub-paragraph (a) (<em>viz</em>, the framing of the questions to
                    “teach” or “lead” the respondents to the correct
                    answer), I am reminded of the caution expressed by Whitford J in <em>Imperial Group Ltd v Philip Morris &amp; Co</em> [1984] RPC
                    293 (“<em>Imperial Group</em>”) at 303, that
                        “[<em>g</em>]<em>reat
                        importance</em> inevitably attaches to the <em>way in
                        which the questions are cast</em>” (emphasis added). The
                    framing of questions, however, is not (and should not be taken to be) an easy
                    task. Indeed, Whitford J opined that it was “<em>very
                        difficult</em> in connection with [the particular market survey in
                        <em>Imperial Group</em>] to think of questions which,
                    even if they are free from the objection of being <em>leading</em>, are not in fact going to <em>direct the
                        person answering the question into a field of speculation</em> upon
                    which that person would never have embarked had the question not been
                    put” (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Unfortunately, and with respect, the
                    Defendant’s survey fell foul of Whitford J’s specific exhortation
                    against leading questions. It is useful to illustrate this with reference to the
                    actual survey questions used in the Defendant’s survey. This should be
                    taken as a message that utmost care should be taken in framing survey questions,
                    so as to avoid “teaching” or “leading” the survey
                    respondents which may affect the objectivity of the survey and render the survey
                    results less reliable. In brief, there are two questions (<em>viz</em>, Questions 6 and 7) leading to the crucial question
                        (<em>viz</em> Question 8) which addresses the issue of
                    who – in the mind of the survey respondent – produced the
                    “Nutello” drink. All three questions are set out in full, in the
                    order in which they were asked:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q6. Are you aware that coffee chains buy ingredients <b><u>of their drinks</u></b> from the <b><u>manufacturers
                            of the ingredients</u></b>?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    Yes</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    No</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Don’t know</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q7. If the coffee chain buys the ingredients from these <b><u>other sources</u></b>, and makes the drink in their coffee
                        chain using these ingredients, who in your view who [<em>sic</em>] produces the drink? Is it…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    The manufacturer of the ingredients</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The Coffee Chain</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Both equally</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Other (write in)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Don’t know</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q8. There is a drink on the TCC menu called ‘Nutello’ that
                        uses the <b><u>Nutella chocolate spread</u></b> as an
                        ingredient in the drink. In your view would the drink ‘Nutello’
                        be produced by the manufacturer of the Nutella chocolate spread or by TCC
                        themselves?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    Nutella – the manufacturer of the
                            ingredients</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    TCC – the coffee chain</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Other (write in)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Can’t say</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Question 6, which purports to determine
                    whether the survey respondents are aware that coffee chains buy ingredients of
                        “<b><u>their</u></b>” (emphasis in original)
                    drinks from manufacturers, is not relevant at all to the issue of whether the
                    relevant public would be likely to be confused <em>vis-à-vis</em> the origin of the “Nutello” drink. In my
                    view, it appears that the leading nature of Question 6 laid the ground work and
                    injected new information into the minds of the survey respondents, preparing
                    them for the questions to follow. It subtly teaches the survey respondents that
                    coffee chains do buy ingredients of “<b><u>their</u></b>” drinks from the manufacturers of the ingredients.
                    Furthermore, the emphasis on the possessive term “their” may have
                    created the impression that the drinks were <em>produced by the
                        coffee chain</em> – a subtle but nonetheless possibly
                    significant suggestion that the Defendant, being the “coffee
                    chain”, produced <em>their</em> own
                drinks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    Although Question 7 is framed as a
                    hypothetical, nevertheless it does inject new information into the minds of the
                    respondents. Not only does it repeat the point that coffee chains buy the
                    ingredients of their drinks from “<b><u>other
                        sources</u></b>” (emphasis in original), it attempts to clarify
                    that coffee chains still “<em>make</em>[] the drink
                    in their coffee chain” using the ingredients they had bought (emphasis
                    added). In cross-examination, the Defendant’s expert witness, Mr Piers
                    Lee, admitted that Question 7 had indeed injected these two pieces of
                    information. Once again, it appears to be a subtle but nonetheless possibly
                    significant suggestion that the Defendant, being the “coffee
                    chain”, <em>made</em> the drinks and not the
                    manufacturer of the ingredients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The framing of Question 8 – which was
                    the most crucial question in the survey – impacts on both the concerns
                    expressed in [106] sub-paragraphs (a)
                    and, especially, (b). The survey respondents were asked who they thought
                    produced “Nutello”. However, they were not given an option of
                    indicating their (incorrect) belief that <em>both</em> the
                    Plaintiff and the Defendant produced the “Nutello” drink. This was
                    in stark contrast to an earlier (and more generic) question where the survey
                    respondents had been given the option of “both equally” when asked
                    whether it was the “manufacturer of the ingredients” or the
                    “coffee chain” which could be considered to have
                    “produced” the drink (see Question 7, reproduced in <a href="#p1_109">[109]</a> above). Had the option of “both
                    equally” been similarly given when asking the crucial Question 8, this
                    may have increased the number of survey respondents who would (incorrectly)
                    indicate that the “Nutello” drink was produced by <em>both</em> the Plaintiff and the Defendant (which must have
                    meant that they thought that the “Nutello” drink was produced by
                    the Plaintiff in association with the Defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In my view, instead of Questions 6 to 8, it
                    would have been more appropriate for the surveyor to simply show survey
                    respondents the menu containing the “Nutello” drink and ask them
                    who – in their opinion – had produced the drink. This would perhaps
                    provide for a more neutral context, without teaching the survey respondents
                    about what happens in practice, who bought what ingredients, that coffee chains
                    make their own drinks from ingredients that they purchase from outside sources
                        <em>etc</em>. It is crucial for framers of surveys to
                    take into consideration the manner of framing questions, so as to avoid any
                    “skewing effect” which leads me to question the credibility of the
                    Defendant’s survey.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    With regard to sub-paragraph (c) in
                        <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> (<em>viz</em>, the issue of whether the Plaintiff produced or licensed the
                    “Nutello” drink), the way that the questions were framed and the
                    sequencing of the questions in the Defendant’s survey did not allow the
                    respondent a chance to contemplate at least two additional possibilities,
                        <em>viz</em> (1) the possibility of a <em>ready-made drink</em> being produced by the Plaintiff (and
                    simply poured into the shot glass by the Defendant in the kitchen); and (2) the
                    possibility that the Plaintiff had <em>licensed</em> the
                    manufacture of the drink to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    When questioned, the Defendant’s
                    expert witness Mr Piers Lee admitted that the survey was undertaken from the
                    perspective of “what happens in reality within the TCC chain”, and
                    therefore the survey “[did not] allow for other options like opening it
                    from a jar… or a licensing arrangement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In this regard, it has earlier been observed
                    in <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a> above that there is instead a
                    “broader” kind of confusion stemming from the consumer’s
                    (incorrect) assumption of some kind of economic connection between the users of
                    the marks (<em>eg</em> that the goods are being provided by
                    a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark proprietor). The failure to allow
                    survey respondents to contemplate the possibility of <em>licensing</em> meant that the results generated from the survey may
                    not be as credible as they may have been had the questions been framed in a more
                    open-ended fashion. Hence, before undertaking a survey, the methodology of
                    survey questioning should have been carefully scrutinised to ensure that it will
                    produce a more accurate set of results to assist the court in deciding whether
                    or not there is any likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant public
                    arising out of the identical nature or similarity of the signs/marks and the
                    goods or services in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Plaintiff’s survey</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The Plaintiff had also engaged a market
                    research company, FORBES Research Pte Ltd, to conduct a survey on the question
                    of whether the use of the “Nutello” sign in relation to the
                    Defendant’s product would cause a likelihood of confusion. The
                    Plaintiff’s expert witness, Dr Chan Wai Ming, testified as to the truth
                    and accuracy of the survey. Unlike the Defendant’s survey, which was an
                    exit survey conducted on the Defendant’s customers, the Plaintiff’s
                    survey was targeted at the general public. A total of 410 respondents were
                    interviewed for the Plaintiff’s survey at 10 different locations across
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The first two questions of the
                    Plaintiff’s survey were in relation to each respondent’s awareness
                    of “Nutella”. Of the 410 survey respondents, 363 indicated
                    awareness of “Nutella”. These 363 respondents were thereafter
                    shown a picture of the Defendant’s menu with the “Nutello”
                    drink and its accompanying description, and asked:</p>

                    “Nutella”, 3 declined to answer this question, thus reducing the
                    sample size to 360. Of the 360 respondents, 104 (28.90%) were of the (incorrect)
                    view that it was <em>likely</em> that
                    “Nutello” was produced by the manufacturer of
                    “Nutella”, while 106 (29.40%) were of the (correct) view that it
                    was <em>unlikely</em> that the manufacturer of
                    “Nutella” produced “Nutello”, and 150 (41.70%)
                    indicated that they “don’t know” about the likelihood that
                    the manufacturer of “Nutella” produced

                    following question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Question 4B</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Likely</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Unlikely</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    It should be</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of these 106 respondents, 2 declined to answer. Of the remaining
                    sample size of 104 respondents, 16 (15.40% of this group) felt that it was
                    likely that the manufacturer of Nutella had <em>authorised</em> the Defendant’s coffee chain to use the name
                    “Nutello” for the drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I must, at this juncture, make two comments
                    regarding the framing of Question 4B.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, I express my doubts as to
                        the meaning and relevance of the third option to Question 4B (“[i]t
                        should be”). There was some uncertainty as to what this option meant,
                        and the label in Dr Chan’s graph somewhat confusingly presented the
                        third option as “Don’t Know”. I therefore disregard the
                        7 respondents who answered this question by indicating the third option.
                        Accordingly, all that matters for present purposes is that 16 of the 104
                        respondents who did not decline to answer this question indicated that it
                        was <em>likely</em> that the manufacturer of
                        “Nutella” authorised the use of the name
                        “Nutello”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, I note that although (unlike the
                        Defendant’s survey) the Plaintiff’s survey provided for the
                        possibility of a licensing arrangement (“how likely is that the
                        manufacturer of NUTELLA sweet spread <em>authorized</em> the TCC coffee chain outlet to use the name
                        NUTELLO”), the framing of the question was not the most ideal. As I
                        had noted in <a href="#p1_115">[115]</a> above, questions in
                        general and the “licensing” question in particular should be
                        framed in a more open-ended fashion. The manner in which the
                        Plaintiff’s survey respondents were asked the question may have
                        planted the possibility of licensing in their minds when they would not, of
                        their own accord, consider such a possibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The 150 respondents who answered that they
                    “[d]on’t [k]now” about the likelihood that the manufacturer
                    of “Nutella” produced “Nutello” were asked the
                    following question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><u>Question 4C</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>You said that you do not know if the drink named
                            NUTELLO is produced by the manufacturer of NUTELLA sweet spread, how
                            likely is that the manufacturer of NUTELLA sweet spread authorized the
                            TCC coffee chain outlet to use the name NUTELLO?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Likely</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Unlikely</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    It should be</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of these 150 respondents, 17 respondents declined to answer or
                    indicated that they did not know the answer. Of the remaining sample size of 133
                    respondents, 27 (20.30% of this group) thought that it was likely that the
                    manufacturer of Nutella had authorised the Defendant’s coffee chain to use
                    the name “Nutello” for the drink. I pause here to note that the
                    same problem regarding the third option (“[i]t should be”) arises
                    in relation to this question. I therefore disregard the 48 respondents who
                    answered this question by indicating the third option. Accordingly, I note that
                    27 of the 133 respondents indicated that it was <em>likely</em> that the manufacturer of “Nutella”
                    authorised the use of the name “Nutello”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Following from this analysis, it would
                    appear that 147 respondents in all (<em>ie</em> the 104
                    respondents in <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a>, 16 respondents in
                        <a href="#p1_120">[120]</a> and 27 respondents in <a href="#p1_122">[122]</a>) believed or perceived that
                    “Nutello” was either produced by the manufacturer of
                    “Nutella”, or that the manufacturer of “Nutella” had
                    authorised the Defendant’s coffee chain to use the name
                    “Nutello” on the drink. This represents about 35.85% of the total
                    sample size of 410 respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Defendant contended that the
                    Plaintiff’s survey did not meet the mandatory requirements regarding
                    expert reports as contained in Order 40A of the Rules of Court and Form 58 of
                    the Subordinate Courts Practice Directions (2006 Ed) (“Form 58”).
                    The Defendant cited <em>Pacific Recreation v SY Technology
                        Inc</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<em>Pacific
                        Recreation</em>”), where the Court of Appeal noted that (at
                        [65]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The requirements of an expert's report are contained in O 40A r 3(2) of
                        the Rules, and apply to all manner of experts. We will discuss each of the
                        relevant requirements in turn. For now, it is pertinent to note that these
                        requirements are <em>mandatory</em> except
                        where the court otherwise directs. We would also like to highlight Form 58
                        of the Subordinate Courts Practice Directions (2006 Ed) (“Form
                        58”). Form 58 is a note which parties are obliged to furnish to their
                        intended expert witnesses under para 152(2) of the Subordinate Courts
                        Practice Directions. Although the Supreme Court Practice Directions (2007
                        Ed) do not contain similar provisions, as a matter of good practice, the
                        same procedure should generally be adopted for proceedings in the Supreme
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Referring to the prescribed statement in
                    Form 58, the Defendant pointed out that Dr Chan’s report did not contain a
                    statement concerning his duty to the court (“the Form 58 prescribed
                    statement”). The Form 58 prescribed statement reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I confirm that insofar as the facts stated in my report are within my own
                        knowledge I have made clear they are and I believe them to be correct, and
                        that the opinions I have expressed represent my accurate and complete
                        professional opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I also confirm that in preparing this report, I am aware that my primary
                        duty is to the Court and not the person(s) from whom I have received my
                        instructions or by whom I am paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    It was confirmed in cross-examination that
                    the Form 58 prescribed statement was not in the Plaintiff’s survey report.
                    However, it should be noted that paras 2, 3 and 12 of Dr Chan’s affidavit
                    of evidence-in-chief stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    I am duly authorized to affirm this affidavit by
                            Forbes Research for the purpose of introducing a survey report that
                            Forbes Research carried on the instructions of Messrs Ravindran
                            Associates acting on behalf of the Plaintiff herein.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The facts deposed to herein are based on my
                                <em>personal knowledge</em> or are <em>based on the documents of Forbes Research to which I have
                                been given unrestricted access</em>. Insofar as they are
                            within my personal knowledge, they are <em>true</em>. Insofar as they are based on the Forbes
                            Research’s documents they are <em>true to the best
                                of my knowledge and belief</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    Though I make this Affidavit in my <em>capacity as an expert witness</em> on conducting of
                            market research surveys engaged by the Plaintiff, I understand and
                            appreciate that my <em>overriding duty to assist the
                                Honourable Court</em> in matters within my expertise, and this
                                <em>duty overrides any obligations to the
                                Plaintiff</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    These paragraphs largely resemble the
                    prescribed statement in Form 58. Indeed, referring to para 12 of his affidavit,
                    Dr Chan confirmed that the Plaintiff’s survey report complied in spirit
                    with the Form 58 prescribed statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In any case, I note that the Form 58
                    prescribed statement applies to expert witnesses in the <em>Subordinate Courts</em>. Although the Court of Appeal in <em>Pacific Recreation</em> noted at [65] that “as a matter of good practice, the same
                    procedure should generally be adopted for proceedings in the Supreme
                    Court”, on a close reading of the judgment, the court did not go on to
                    say that the Form 58 prescribed statement was <em>mandatory</em>. Instead, the court had limited its observation on
                    mandatory requirements to those contained in Order 40A rule 3. In this regard,
                    Order 40A rule 3 merely states that the report must, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, contain a statement of belief of correctness of the
                    expert’s opinion, and contain a statement that the expert understands that
                    in giving his report, his duty is to the Court and that he complies with that
                    duty. This, in my view, Dr Chan had done in paras 2, 3 and 12 of his affidavit.
                    I note that no statement is prescribed under the Rules of Court, or under the
                        <em>Supreme Court</em> Practice Directions. Therefore,
                    I do not think that the Plaintiff’s survey report should be disregarded
                    due to its omission of the Form 58 prescribed statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Analysis: Was there likelihood of confusion in the present
                case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I re-emphasise that whether or not there is
                    a likelihood of confusion is ultimately for the court to decide (see <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above). Survey results are not conclusive
                    of the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    In this regard, it should be pointed out
                    that a number of cases have cautioned that great care and circumspection must be
                    taken with respect to market surveys. This is because, as was noted by the
                    English High Court in <em>Whirlpool Corporation v Kenwood
                        Ltd</em> [2009] RPC 2 (“<em>Whirlpool</em>”) at [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The need for circumspection in the assessment of questionnaire survey
                        evidence is well-understood. The concern is that to a greater or lesser
                        degree: “Interviews and questionnaires intrude as a <em>foreign element</em> into the social setting they would
                        describe, they create as well as measure attitudes, they <em>elicit atypical roles and responses</em>, they are limited to
                        those who are accessible and will co-operate and the responses obtained are
                        produced in part by dimensions of individual differences irrelevant to the
                        topic at hand” [citing Webb <em>et al</em>,
                            <em>Unobtrusive Measures</em> (Sage Publications
                        Inc, 2000)]. … [footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The danger is that evidence obtained under
                    the circumstances mentioned in the quotation above does not constitute the
                        <em>spontaneous reaction</em> of members of the public
                    who have been exposed to the relevant signs/marks and goods in question. As was
                    noted by the English High Court in <em>O2 Holdings Ltd v
                        Hutchison 3G Ltd (No 2)</em> [2006] RPC 30 at [12], market survey evidence is sometimes
                    obtained as a result of the artificial application to members of the public of
                    stimuli directed at provoking reactions and responses “under controlled
                    conditions”. In <em>Imperial Group Ltd v Philip Morris
                        &amp; Co</em> [1984] RPC 293, the English High Court opined that
                    “[h]owever satisfactory market research surveys may be in assisting
                    commercial organisations as to how they can best conduct their business, they
                    are by and large, as experience in other cases has indicated, <em>an unsatisfactory way of trying to establish question of fact which are
                        likely to be matters of dispute</em>” (emphasis
                added).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Keeping in view the numerous difficulties
                    above mentioned, the court in <em>Whirlpool</em> suggested
                    (at [35]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is, accordingly, a practical requirement for information relating to
                        the structure, method and results of questionnaire surveys to be full enough
                        to enable the strengths and weaknesses of the research work to be
                        evaluated.  It is now the practice for the utility of any proposed
                        survey work to be considered as a matter of case management during the
                        interim stages of actions for infringement of registered trade mark and
                        passing off. [footnotes omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    This eloquently worded caution should be
                    considered by all parties seeking to do surveys in general, and, of particular
                    relevance to the present issue, surveys ascertaining the substantiality of
                    confusion amongst the relevant public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In <em>Imperial
                        Group</em>, albeit in the context of “confusion” in the
                    law of passing off, Whitford J provided useful analysis of the market surveys in
                    that case, as well as the weight to be accorded to them. The following
                    guidelines may be distilled from the learned judge’s observations. These
                    should, of course, not be taken as an exhaustive list – they are merely
                    guidelines to consider in determining the weight to be accorded to survey
                    results. The guidelines are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_a"></a>(a)     the interviewees in the survey must
                        be selected so as to represent the relevant cross-section of the
                        public;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_134-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        size of the survey must be statistically significant;</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    As was alluded to earlier (see <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a>-<a href="#p1_112">[112]</a>
                    above), the Defendant’s survey was plagued by the problem of leading
                    questions. As such, I doubt the accuracy of the results obtained in that survey.
                    Had the Defendant’s survey been carried out properly, it <em>could</em> have shown that more than 30% of the relevant
                    public would be confused. I have also noted above that the Plaintiff’s
                    survey had a similar (although less severe) issue of leading the survey
                    respondents when it explicitly asked survey respondents whether there was a
                    possibility of licensing. That said, I note that if some correction is made for
                    leading questions in both surveys, the percentage of persons confused might well
                    have hovered at around the 30-35% level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    One general shortcoming that applies to
                        <em>both</em> the Plaintiff’s and the
                    Defendant’s surveys is that neither survey actually directly ascertains
                    the <em>cause</em> of the confusion. This is unfortunate,
                    because, as was explained in <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a> above, the
                    confusion for the purposes of s 27(2) of the TMA must be <em>caused</em> by the similarities in the respective marks and goods
                    concerned. Failure to ascertain that the confusion came from the aforementioned
                    similarities would effectively result in the problem that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Polo</em> attempted to avoid – a conflation
                    of the three tests (<em>viz</em>, identity/similarity of
                    signs/marks, identity/similarity of goods, and likelihood of confusion) (see
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    On this point of ascertaining the cause of
                    confusion, I note that the Plaintiff’s survey <em>did</em> include a question for the 104 respondents who indicated
                    that it was “likely” that “Nutello” was produced by
                    the manufacturer of “Nutella”, which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q4A. You said that it is likely be [<em>sic</em>]
                        that the drink NUTELLO is produced by the manufacturer of NUTELLA sweet
                        spread. Can you state your reason or reasons for concluding so? [multiple
                        response]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the Plaintiff’s survey <em>did
                        not</em> include a similar question for the respondents who did not
                    think it “likely” that “Nutello” was produced by the
                    manufacturer of “Nutella”, but nevertheless thought it
                    “likely” that “Nutello” was
                    “authorised” by the manufacturer of “Nutella” (see
                        <a href="#p1_120">[120]</a>-<a href="#p1_122">[122]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The results to Question 4A (just reproduced
                    above) provide some indication that <em>not every respondent who
                        was “confused” into thinking that the manufacturer of
                        “Nutella” produced “Nutello” was so confused due
                        to the similarity in the respective marks and goods concerned</em>.
                    Responding to Question 4A, 55 respondents (52.9% of this group) indicated that
                    they thought it likely that “Nutello” was produced by the
                    manufacturer of “Nutella” because the name “Nutello”
                    must have <em>derived</em> from “Nutella”. 36
                    (34.6%) indicated that they thought it likely because the
                    “Nutello” drink was made using “Nutella” sweet
                    spread, while 14 (13.5%) thought that “Nutello” was a new brand
                    name given by the manufacturer of “Nutella” for drinks. One
                    respondent thought that it was possible that the manufacturer of
                    “Nutella” had expanded their product range. The remaining 4
                    respondents provided other reasons, such as the fact that the
                    “Nutello” drink had “Nutella” taste.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Therefore, it is <em>crucial</em> that questions relating to the <em>cause</em> of the confusion should have been asked. Of course, these
                    questions must not be asked in a <em>leading</em> way. One
                    possible way, and I am by no means suggesting that this is the only or best
                    possible way, of ascertaining the cause of the confusion in the present case is
                    for broad open-ended questions to be asked, for instance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q. [Interviewer shows survey respondent a picture of the
                        “Nutello” drink from the menu, and asks:] Who do you think
                        produced this product?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1    The manufacturer of
                        “Nutella”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    The coffee chain “TCC”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Both the manufacturer of “Nutella” and
                            “TCC”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    Don’t know</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[If the survey respondent responds with either (1), (2) or (3), move to
                        the next question]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q. Why do you say that the “Nutello” drink was produced by
                        (the manufacturer “Nutella”; <em>or</em>
                        the coffee chain “TCC”; <em>or</em> both
                        the manufacturer of “Nutella” and “TCC”)?
                        [open-ended response invited from survey respondent]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    In my view, these two questions would have
                    more appropriately and accurately captured the essence of the survey objective,
                        <em>viz</em>, to determine <em>whether</em>, and if so <em>why</em>, the
                    relevant public is confused as to the <em>origin</em> of
                    the “Nutello” drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Keeping in mind the difficulties associated
                    with market surveys, and also the exhortation that the issue of confusion is to
                    be determined by the court rather than by (expert) witnesses and/or their
                    surveys, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiff has, for the
                    reasons stated below, established the requirement of likelihood of confusion
                    arising out of (a) the similarity of “Nutello” with
                    “Nutella”; and (b) the similarity of Defendant’s drink
                    labelled or marked “Nutello” with “chocolate
                    products” for which the Plaintiff had registered its
                    “Nutella” mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    First, as observed in <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a> above, where there is <em>greater similarity</em> in the marks and the goods, it would be
                    easier to find a likelihood of confusion. Similarly, where the earlier mark is
                        <em>distinctive</em>, it is more likely that a court
                    would find that a likelihood of confusion exists. In the present case, there is
                    great similarity between the “Nutello” sign and
                    “Nutella” word mark. There is also similarity in the goods
                    represented by the “Nutello” sign with the product specification
                    (“chocolate products”) for which the “Nutella” word
                    mark is registered – indeed, they fall within the same class of the
                    International Classification of Goods and Services (see <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> above). Furthermore, the “Nutella” word mark,
                    being an invented word, is inherently distinctive (see <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Second, in determining the likelihood of
                    confusion, all that has to be shown is that a <em>not
                        insubstantial</em> number of the relevant public would have been
                    confused (see <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a> above). There is no
                    requirement under Singapore law, contrary to what the Defendant appeared to
                    assert, that the absence of a <em>majority</em> who would
                    be confused meant that there was insubstantial “likelihood of
                    confusion”. Indeed, I note that given the court’s reference to
                        “<em>single</em> member of the public”
                    (emphasis added), “<em>de minimis</em>
                    level”, “<em>very small</em> unobservant
                    section of society” (emphasis added), or “[where] the <em>only</em> person who would be misled would be a moron in a
                    hurry” (emphasis added), the Court of Appeal in <em>Mobil
                        (CA)</em> was not looking at a high threshold or a threshold that
                    would constitute at least a majority of the relevant members of the public when
                    using the phrase “a not insubstantial number” (see <em>Mobil (CA)</em> at [78]-[79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The survey results, although not entirely
                    satisfactory, fortify my view that the requirement of likelihood of confusion of
                    the kind as described is made out. With regard to the Defendant’s survey,
                    I have earlier expressed my view that had the survey been carried out properly,
                    it <em>could</em> have shown that more than 30% of the
                    relevant public would be confused (see <a href="#p1_135">[135]</a> above) for a variety of reasons, some of which may be
                    irrelevant for our consideration. With regard to the Plaintiff’s survey, I
                    note that the survey indicated that about 35.85% would be confused (see
                        <a href="#p1_123">[123]</a> above), also for a variety of
                    reasons, some of which may be irrelevant for our consideration. It thus appears
                    from both surveys that about 30% of the relevant public would be confused
                        <em>per se</em>. While some discount on this percentage
                    has to be made given the shortcomings I have observed in [121(b)] and <a href="#p1_136">[136]</a>-<a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>
                    above, I am of the view that the requirement of a “not insubstantial
                    number” has been made out on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on s 27(2)(b) trade mark infringement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    I have found that the Defendant’s use
                    of the “Nutello” sign amounted to trade mark use, that the
                    “Nutello” sign and “Nutella” word mark are similar,
                    that there is similarity in the goods represented by the “Nutello”
                    sign with the product specification (“chocolate products”) for
                    which the “Nutella” word mark is registered, and that because of
                    the similarity in marks and goods, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the
                    part of the public. I therefore hold that the Defendant had infringed the
                    Plaintiff’s “Nutella” word mark under s 27(2)(b) of the
                    TMA. Accordingly, the Plaintiff will be granted damages to be assessed and an
                    injunction to restrain the Defendant from infringing the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” word mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    It would have been sufficient for practical
                    purposes to conclude the case at this point. However, because the Plaintiff is
                    also seeking a declaration that the Plaintiff’s “Nutella”
                    marks are well known trade marks within the definition of s 2(1) of the TMA, and
                    is also claiming damages for passing off, it is necessary for me to proceed to
                    analyse both the well known trade mark infringement claim and the passing off
                    claim. I turn next to consider the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Infringement of “well known” trade marks (s 55 of the
                TMA)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The Plaintiff claimed relief under s 55 of
                    the TMA for protection of well known trade marks in relation to <em>all</em> its “Nutella” marks (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    As a preliminary point, the Defendant argued
                    that the “Nutella” word mark (and, <em>a
                        fortiori</em>, the “Nutello” sign) was dissimilar to the
                    other “Nutella” marks (which incorporate the device of a bread,
                    knife, hazelnuts and milk glass). The Defendant further argued that the
                    Plaintiff had to show that <em>all</em> the Nutella marks
                    were well known. I am of the view that this argument is without merit; it is
                    clear from the surveys that the general public is familiar with all the Nutella
                    marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Under s 55 of the TMA, the protection for
                    trade marks varies according to whether the trade mark is (1) “well known
                    in Singapore”; or (2) “well known to the <em>public
                        at large</em> in Singapore”. The relevant provisions are ss
                    55(2) and 55(3), which are reproduced here for convenience:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Subject to subsections (6) and (7), the proprietor of a well known
                        trade mark shall be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Singapore,
                        in the course of trade and without the proprietor’s consent, of any
                        trade mark which, or an essential part of which, is identical with or
                        similar to the proprietor’s trade mark, in relation to identical or
                        similar goods or services, where the use is likely to cause
                        confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) Subject to subsections (6) and (7), the proprietor of a

                        Singapore, in the course of trade and without the proprietor’s
                        consent, of any trade mark which, or an essential part of which, is
                        identical with or similar to the proprietor’s trade mark, in relation
                        to any goods or services, where the use of the trade mark —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) would indicate a connection between those goods or services and
                            the proprietor, and is likely to damage the interests of the proprietor;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) if the proprietors trade mark is well known to the
                            public at large in Singapore —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i) would cause dilution in an unfair manner of the distinctive
                                character of the proprietor’s trade mark; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii) would take unfair advantage of the distinctive character of
                                the proprietor’s trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    For all claims under s 55 of the TMA, the
                    Plaintiff must first establish, as a preliminary issue, that its
                    “Nutella” marks are either “well known in Singapore”
                    (for the claims under ss 55(2) and 55(3)(a)) or “well known to the public
                    at large in Singapore” (for the claim under s 55(3)(b)). I first analyse
                    whether the Plaintiff’s trade marks are “well known to the public
                    at large in Singapore” or “well known in Singapore”, before
                    turning to determine whether the claims under ss 55(2) and 55(3) are

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Under s 2(1) of the TMA, the definition of
                    the term “well known trade mark” is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“well known trade mark” means —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) any registered trade mark that is well known in Singapore;
                            or</p>

                    “well known in Singapore”, regard must be had to the factors
                    listed in ss 2(7), 2(8) and 2(9) of the TMA. It is clear that these factors are
                        <em>not exhaustive</em> (<em>Novelty Pte

                        be relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the degree to which the trade mark is known to or recognised by

                            recognised, and the duration of such registration or application;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) any successful enforcement of any right in the trade mark in any
                            country or territory, and the extent to which the trade mark was
                            recognised as well known by the competent authorities of that country or
                            territory;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) any value associated with the trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8) Where it is determined that a trade mark is well known to any relevant
                        sector of the public in Singapore, the trade mark shall be deemed to be well
                        known in Singapore.</p>

                            goods or services to which the trade mark is applied;</p>

                            or services to which the trade mark is applied;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) all businesses and companies in Singapore dealing in the goods or
                            services to which the trade mark is applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    The TMA does not define the phrase
                    “well known to the public at large in Singapore”. However, in
                        <em>City Chain</em>, the Court of Appeal emphasised
                    that the test “well known to the public at large in Singapore”
                    must mean <em>more</em> than just “well known in
                    Singapore”; to come within the former test, the trade mark must
                    necessarily enjoy a <em>much higher</em> degree of
                    recognition (<em>City Chain</em> at [94]). It “must be recognised by most
                    sectors of the public though we would not go so far as to say all sectors of the
                    public” (<em>City Chain</em> at [94]). Such an approach, as the Court of
                    Appeal recognised, would be in line with the United States’ approach in
                    determining famous marks (<em>City Chain</em> at [94]). It flows from the logic in <em>City Chain</em> that <em>if</em> a trade
                    mark is shown to be “well known to the public at large in
                    Singapore”, it is <em>necessarily</em> also
                    “well known in Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Plaintiff’s trade marks are “well known to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    In determining whether a trade mark is
                    “well known to the public at large in Singapore”, regard must
                    nonetheless be had to s 2(7) of the TMA, which deals with trade marks that are
                    “well known in Singapore” (<em>City
                        Chain</em> at [92]; and see s

                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    I find that the “Nutella”
                    marks are well known to the <em>public at large</em> in
                    Singapore, for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Mr Malatesta gave
                        evidence that the “Nutella” bread spread is carried by between
                        94% to 98% of the stores in Singapore that sell food items, and that about 2
                        million units of “Nutella” bread spread are sold every year in
                        Singapore (where there are only 1.1 million households). Mr Malatesta also
                        gave evidence on how the “Nutella” bread spread can be found
                        throughout Singapore at various trade outlets such as hypermarkets,
                        supermarket chains, convenience stores, petrol kiosks, neighbourhood shops
                        and even kiosks operating at some bus stops. The Defendant did not
                        cross-examine Mr Malatesta on any of these claims. Mr Malatesta’s
                        evidence must therefore be taken to be accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the results of the
                        Plaintiff’s survey were telling in illustrating that the
                        Plaintiff’s “Nutella” mark is well known in Singapore.
                        The survey report evidences the awareness or existence of certain beliefs or
                        opinions held (whether rightly or wrongly) by the respondents to the survey,
                        and to the extent that it is a representative sample of a certain section of
                        the public, it is reflective also of the awareness or existence of those
                        beliefs or opinions of that section of the public with a certain confidence
                        level which depends, <em>inter alia</em>, on the size
                        of the survey sample with respect to the size of the population that
                        constitutes that section of public in question. (see also <em>Saga Foodstuffs Manufacturing (Pte) Ltd v Best Food Pte Ltd</em>
                        [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1013 at [7]-[16]). The survey revealed the
                        following:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       “Nutella”
                            was the most recognised brand among all other listed brands of sweet
                            spreads, with 292 (71.2%) of the 410 survey respondents selecting
                            “Nutella” as a sweet spread that they were familiar with.
                            It should be noted that of the 292 survey respondents who were familiar
                            with “Nutella”, a vast majority (239 survey respondents)
                            stated that they have known “Nutella” for more than five
                            years.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Of the 118 survey respondents who did not indicate
                            “Nutella” as being a sweet spread that they were familiar
                            with, a majority (71 survey respondents) indicated that they were
                            familiar with the product when showed a photograph of the
                            “Nutella” spread. It should be noted that of the 71 survey
                            respondents who indicated familiarity after being shown the photograph,
                            a majority (46 survey respondents) indicated that they had known
                            “Nutella” for more than five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       In all, 363 of the 410
                            survey respondents (88.53%) were familiar with “Nutella”,
                            with 288 (70.2%) of the respondents indicating that they had known
                            “Nutella” for more than five
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Defendant’s own evidence is that the
                        “Nutella” mark is well known and that consumers are attracted
                        by the “Nutella” mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Defendant had used the
                            “Nutella” mark on its menu without explaining it, on the
                            assumption that all its customers would be aware of
                            “Nutella”, and even know the taste of the same. Indeed, Mr
                            Christopher Tan explicitly agreed under cross-examination that the
                            “Nutella” mark is well-known.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Defendant’s other
                            witnesses, Mr Robin Ng and Mr Desmond Tan, testified that they were
                            aware of “Nutella” and had consumed the
                            “Nutella” spread before.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_155-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Internet blog postings (which
                            were adduced by the Defendant) show that the “Nutella”
                            mark is well known to the public, indicating <em>inter
                                alia</em> that the bloggers have personally consumed
                            “Nutella” and/or that their family members have tried
                            “Nutella” before. Indeed, many of the bloggers seem to
                            have presumed that the viewers of their comments (which, it is assumed,
                            is the general public) were familiar with “Nutella”, given
                            that they did not explain the composition or taste of
                            “Nutella” (in contrast, these bloggers endeavoured to
                            explain what “Nutello” is). Mr Christopher Tan further
                            agreed under cross-examination that the bloggers appeared not only to
                            know the “Nutella” product well, but that they were in
                            fact – to use his words – “passionate” about
                            “Nutella”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_155-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Plaintiff adduced evidence of no less than
                        twenty independent articles in the print media making reference to the
                        “Nutella” spread. As early as 9 July 1989,
                        “Nutella” spread was listed as one of the five most-liked
                        sandwich choices in terms of popularity. In an article published by the
                        Straits Times on 30 August 2000 titled “Rise and shine with
                        chocolate”, the “Nutella” spread was voted as the
                        “King of chocolate bread spreads” by a panel assembled by the
                        Straits Times. I note that the Defendant did not object to the admissibility
                        of these reports, and rightly so: the newspaper articles were not tendered
                        to prove the truth of the facts stated therein, but rather, to prove the
                        fact that they were written and published in the mass media having a very
                        wide circulation, thereby showing that the public at large would have the
                        opportunity of reading the articles and learning about
                        “Nutella”, even if they were not previously aware of the
                        existence of the “Nutella” spread.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    For the reasons above cited, I am of the
                    view that the Plaintiff’s trade marks are “well known to the public
                    at large in Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Plaintiff’s trade marks are “well known in
                Singapore”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Even assuming that I am wrong on the
                    forgoing point, I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s trade marks are,
                        <em>at the very least</em>, “well known in
                    Singapore”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    In <em>Amanresorts</em>, the Court of Appeal held that in determining whether a
                    trade mark is well known in Singapore, the <em>most crucial
                        factor</em> is that set out in s 2(7)(a) of the TMA, <em>viz</em>, “the degree to which the trade mark is known
                    to or recognised by any relevant sector of the public in Singapore” (at
                        [139]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    There has been some significant
                        and interesting debate among legal commentators on the actual scope of ss
                            2(7)(<em>c</em>)-2(7)(<em>e</em>) of the current TMA. However, as the instant case does not
                        turn on the consideration of these factors, we shall limit our discussion to
                        s 2(7)(<em>a</em>) (primarily) and s 2(7)(<em>b</em>) of the current TMA. Despite what has been said
                        earlier, <b><em>it can be persuasively said that s
                            2(7)(</em></b><em>a</em><b><em>) is
                            arguably the most crucial factor</em></b> when determining whether a
                        trade mark is well known in Singapore. This is because, by virtue of s 2(8)
                        of the current TMA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where it is determined that a trade mark is well known to any relevant
                            sector of the public in Singapore, the trade mark shall be deemed to be
                            well known in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    This deeming provision suggests that the court
                        cannot disregard s 2(7)(<em>a</em>) (which looks at
                        "the degree to which the trade mark is <em>known to or
                            recognised by any relevant sector of the public in Singapore</em>"
                        [emphasis added]) in its deliberations. Indeed, it appears that <b><em>all the other factors listed in s 2(7) are irrelevant once it

                        [154]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Finally, the Court of Appeal also recognised
                    that it is “<em>not too difficult</em> for a trade
                    mark to be regarded as ‘well known in Singapore’” (emphasis
                    added), since the trade mark in question only has to be recognised by <em>any</em> relevant sector of the public in Singapore, which
                    sector could “in certain cases be <em>miniscule</em>” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at
                        [229], emphasis
                added).</p>

                    it is clear that the Defendant had used the sign “Nutello” in
                    relation to its goods (specifically, the “Nutello”
                drink).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    With regard to the fourth element, the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> held that the term

                    connection which is <em>likely to give rise to
                        confusion</em> (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [161]-[177], [229] and
                        [233]). In <em>Amanresorts</em>, the Court of Appeal noted that the tests relating
                    to the s 55(3)(a) requirements of “connection” and “likely
                    to damage the [plaintiff’s] interests” were “substantively
                    the same as” the tests relating to misrepresentation and damage under the
                    law of passing off, although there was one difference between the two tests: the
                    s 55(3)(a) test concerns the plaintiff’s <em>interests</em> whereas the latter concerns the plaintiff’s
                        <em>goodwill</em> and <em>not</em>
                    its interests (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [234]). However,
                    despite this last-mentioned difference, the s 55(3)(a) and passing off claims in
                        <em>Amanresorts</em> yielded the same results. In the
                    present case, similarly, the difference noted by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Amanresorts</em> would not make any practical
                    difference between the s 55(3)(a) and passing off claims. In this regard, for
                    the reasons that I will give in the context of passing off, I find that the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unfair dilution of distinctiveness of well known trade mark </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    With regard to “unfair
                    dilution” under s 55(3)(b)(i) of the TMA, it is necessary to first
                    clarify the meaning of “dilution” as some confusion seemed to have
                    surfaced in the submissions in the present case. The term
                    “dilution” in the context of the TMA should <em>not</em> be confused with the use of the term
                    “dilution” in a passing off action. I must belabour this point
                    because the Defendant’s submissions at times have appeared to conflate the
                    concept of “dilution by blurring and/or tarnishment” under s 55 of
                    the TMA with the concept of “blurring and/or tarnishment to
                    goodwill” under the passing off action. As will be seen shortly, the
                    Court of Appeal has explicitly cautioned against this confusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    The (misleading and erroneous) use of the
                    term “dilution” in the context of passing off purports to refer to
                    the blurring or tarnishment of <em>goodwill in the
                        Plaintiff’s get-up</em> (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [97] and
                        [131]). This must be contrasted
                    with the use of the term “dilution” in the context of well known
                    trade mark infringement, which involves the dilution of the <em>distinctive character of the Plaintiff’s trade mark</em> (see
                    the phrasing of s 55(3)(b)(i) and the definition of “dilution” in
                    s 2(1)). To avoid further confusion, the Court of Appeal has eschewed using the
                    term “dilution” in the context of passing off claims (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [131] and <em>Mobil (CA)</em> at [96]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    “Dilution” is defined, for the
                    purposes of s 55(3)(b)(i) of the TMA, in s 2(1) of the TMA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“dilution” , in relation to a trade mark, means
                        the lessening of the capacity of the trade mark to identify and distinguish
                        goods or services, regardless of whether there is —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) any competition between the proprietor of the trade mark and any
                            other party; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) any likelihood of confusion on the part of the public;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    It is clear that “dilution” in
                    the context of the TMA refers to both dilution by <em>blurring</em> and by <em>tarnishment</em>
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [225]; <em>Mobil (CA)</em> at [96]). In the present case, however, it is
                    undisputed that there has been no dilution by <em>tarnishment</em>. Accordingly, I focus only on dilution by <em>blurring</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    In <em>Amanresorts</em>, the Court of Appeal noted that the protection against
                    dilution by blurring was to ensure that a trade mark well known to the public at
                    large should be protected from “the gradual whittling away or dispersion
                    of [its] identity and hold upon the public mind… by its use upon
                    non-competing goods” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at
                        [179], citing Frank I Schechter,
                    “The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection” (1926-1927) 40 Harv L
                    Rev 813 at 825). An example that perfectly illustrates the dilution by blurring
                    under s 55(3)(b)(i) is given by Frank I Schechter in <em>Hearings
                        Before the House Committee on Patents</em>, 72d Cong 15 (1932) (also
                    cited in <em>Amanresorts</em> at [179]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you allow Rolls Royce restaurants and Rolls Royce cafeterias, and Rolls
                        Royce candy, in ten years you will not have the Rolls Royce marks any
                        more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em>
                    elaborated on Schechter’s example thus (at [179]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… although consumers although consumers may not think that the
                        other “Rolls Royce”-labelled goods or services really
                        originate from the same source as “Rolls Royce” cars, it may
                        become more difficult for consumers to associate the “Rolls
                        Royce” name with hyper-luxurious cars specifically as the use of that
                        name for non-automobile related goods or services becomes
                        established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the court went on to observe (at [187]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The importance of the preceding discussion on the US law of dilution lies
                        in the fact that <em>Singapore has imported elements of this
                            area of US law</em> both indirectly through the adoption of
                            (<em>inter alia</em>) Art 4(1)(b) of the Joint
                        Recommendation (which has been translated into s 55(3) of the current TMA)
                        and directly through the incorporation in s 2(1) of the current TMA of the
                        definition of “dilution” set out in the 1996 version of s 45
                        of the Lanham Act. However, our importation of the US law of dilution took
                        place in 2004, before the TDRA was enacted and under the shadow of the US
                        Supreme Court’s view in the Victoria’s Secret case that dilution
                        under the FTDA included dilution by blurring only and not dilution by
                        tarnishment. As the amendments effected by the TDRA show, Congress had in
                        fact intended for dilution to include both forms, just as the 1995 House
                        Report ([182] supra) had stated.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    It should be noted that the <em>first use</em> of an identical or similar sign may suffice in
                    some circumstances to cause actual and present detriment to the distinctive
                    character of the earlier mark, or to give rise to the serious likelihood that
                    such detriment will occur in the future (<em>Intel Corporation
                        Inc v CPM United Kingdom Ltd</em> [2009] Bus LR 1079 at [75] (“<em>Intel</em>”)). This is because even the <em>first use</em> begins the process of dilution; the proprietor of a
                    trade mark that is well known to the public at large should not be required to
                    wait until harm is actually done to the distinctive character of the trade mark
                    before he may obtain an injunction against the dilution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In the circumstances, I am of the view that
                    – unless the Defendant is restrained from using the sign
                    “Nutello” – it is possible that the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” mark will lose its distinctiveness. While
                    Schechter’s example (on the “Rolls Royce” mark) was created
                    based on use of <em>identical</em> marks, there is no
                    reason in principle why the use of <em>similar</em> marks
                    may not likewise dilute by blurring. If the sign “Nutello” is used
                    on various goods, it will make it more difficult for the public to associate the
                    “Nutella” mark with the Plaintiff’s products. Indeed, if
                    other entities were to follow suit and use signs such as
                    “Nutellu”, “Nutelli”, Nutelle”
                    <em>etc</em>, the distinctiveness of the
                    “Nutella” mark will be greatly diluted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Taking unfair advantage of distinctive character of well known trade
                mark</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> did not take a firm stand on the meaning of
                    “taking unfair advantage” under s 55(3)(b)(ii) of the TMA.
                    However, the court proffered a detailed account on the concept of “taking
                    unfair advantage” of the distinctive character of a trade mark under
                    European law, thus seemingly analogising s 55(3)(b)(ii) to Art 5(2) of the EU
                    Directive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    In <em>L’Oreal SA v
                        Bellure NV</em> [2010] RPC 1 (“<em>L’Oreal</em>”) at [41], the ECJ considered that the concept of taking unfair
                    advantage of the distinctive character or repute of a trade mark related not to
                    the <em>detriment caused to the mark</em>, but rather, to
                    the <em>advantage taken by the third party</em> as a result
                    of the use of an identical or similar sign. It follows that no detriment to the
                    proprietor of the mark or the distinctive character of the mark needs to be
                    shown in order to demonstrate that unfair advantage had been taken of the mark
                        (<em>L’Oreal</em> at [43]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The concept of taking unfair advantage
                    covers, in particular, cases where there is clear exploitation on the coat-tails
                    of the mark with a reputation, <em>viz</em>, when the
                    defendant’s mark freely rides on the coat-tails of the well known mark in
                    order to benefit from its power of attraction, its reputation and its prestige
                    and to exploit the marketing effort of the proprietor without any financial
                    compensation (<em>L’Oreal</em> at [41] and [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    It should be noted that the mere taking of
                    advantage is insufficient – there must be <em>unfair</em> advantage taken. The English Court of Appeal in <em>Whirlpool Corporation &amp; Ors v Kenwood Ltd</em> [2010] RPC
                    2 (“<em>Whirlpool</em>”) at [113] <em>disagreed</em> with counsel’s contention that
                    “where the third party, using a sign which is sufficiently similar to a
                    mark with a reputation for a link to be established, obtains any commercial
                    boost or other advantage from the link, then that advantage is of itself unfair,
                    without proof of any additional factor”. The Court of Appeal opined that
                    such a reading would equate any advantage with an unfair advantage, and would
                    effectively deprive the word “unfair” of any added meaning
                        (<em>Whirlpool</em> at [114]-[115]). On the
                    facts of <em>Whirlpool</em> itself, the court held that it
                    was not sufficient for the proprietor to show that the alleged infringer had
                    obtained an advantage; there must be an “added factor of some kind for
                    that advantage to be categorised as unfair” (<em>Whirlpool</em> at [136]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The question of unfair advantage has to be
                    considered using a global assessment (<em>Intel</em> at
                        [79], <em>Whirlpool</em> at [137]). On
                    a reading of the decisions of <em>Intel, L’Oreal</em>
                    and <em>Whirlpool</em>, it is evident that there are
                    several factors to consider in determining whether an <em>unfair</em> advantage had been taken. It is trite that none of the
                    factors are determinative, and in the final analysis, it must be shown that the
                    alleged infringer had drawn some unfair advantage from the use of the similar
                    sign (<em>Whirlpool</em> at [137]). Each of these factors will be discussed in the context
                    of the present factual circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    The first factor to consider is the strength
                    of the mark’s reputation and the degree of distinctive character of the
                    mark (<em>Intel</em> at [65], <em>L’Oreal</em> at [44] and <em>Whirlpool</em> at [137]).
                    With regard to this factor, I had earlier found that the “Nutella”
                    mark is distinctive (see <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above). I
                    would also note that the evidence of the Plaintiff’s survey, the Internet
                    blogs and the newspaper articles (all referred to in [155]) suggest that the
                    “Nutella” mark had a strong reputation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The second factor is the degree of
                    similarity between the marks at issue (<em>L’Oreal</em> at [44],
                        <em>Whirlpool</em> at [137]). With regard to this factor, I had earlier found that
                    although the “Nutella” mark and the “Nutello” sign
                    were not <em>identical</em>, they were <em>similar</em> visually, aurally and conceptually.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    The third factor is the nature and degree of
                    proximity of the goods or services concerned (<em>L’Oreal</em> at [44],
                        <em>Whirlpool</em> at [137]). With regard to this factor, I had also earlier found
                    that there is <em>similarity</em> in the goods represented
                    by the “Nutello” sign with the product specification
                    (“chocolate products”) for which the “Nutella” mark
                    is registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The fourth factor is the immediacy and
                    strength with which the mark is brought to mind by the sign (<em>L’Oreal</em> at [44]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the more immediately and strongly the mark is brought to mind by
                        the sign, the greater the likelihood that the current or future use of the
                        sign is taking, or will take, unfair advantage of the distinctive character
                        or the repute of the mark or is, or will be, detrimental to them
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, I note that Mr Christopher Tan had stated that the
                    “Nutello” sign was derived from the “Nutella” mark.
                    I would also note that Mr Christopher Tan conceded that it was intended that
                    customers would be reminded of and attracted to the name
                    “Nutello”, and that the name <em>per se</em>
                    – without any description on the website and in the Defendant’s
                    booklet – would inform customers that the drink contained both espresso
                    and Nutella. Two excerpts from the transcripts will illustrate this
                    point.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Ultimately, however, and as was earlier
                    alluded to, it must be shown that the alleged infringer had <em>drawn some unfair advantage</em> from the use of the similar sign. On
                    the facts of <em>Whirlpool</em>, the English Court of
                    Appeal found that the alleged infringer had no need to ride on the
                    proprietor’s coat-tails, and that despite the goods being
                        “<em>very similar</em> (even <em>identical</em>…)” (emphasis added) and the mark being
                    “distinctive, but not strongly so”, there was insufficient proof
                    that the association of the earlier mark would enhance the performance of the
                    later sign (<em>Whirlpool</em> at [138]). In other words, there was
                    insufficient evidence to show that the alleged infringer had in fact drawn, or
                    was likely to draw, any commercial advantage from the perceived similarity
                        (<em>Whirlpool</em> at [138]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In the final analysis, there was
                    insufficient proof to convince me on the balance of probabilities that the
                    Defendant gained <em>any</em> advantage from naming the
                    drink “Nutello”, let alone an <em>unfair</em>
                    advantage. In cross-examination, counsel for the Plaintiff suggested to Mr
                    Christopher Tan that the good sales of “Nutello” in the first four
                    months since its release was due to the fact that the drink was being marketed
                    using a mark <em>similar</em> to the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” mark. Mr Christopher Tan admitted that this was
                    “possible”, but that it was “[n]ot necessarily so”
                    because the Defendant trained staff to “upsell” every new drink to
                    customers and accordingly it was natural that new items on the menu would sell
                    better. The Plaintiff had no other evidence that “Nutello” sold
                    better <em>because</em> it was named in a manner similar to
                    “Nutella”. Therefore, I conclude that the claim under s
                    55(3)(b)(ii) is not made out, because it had not been satisfactorily proven that
                    the Defendant had taken unfair advantage of the “Nutella”
                    mark.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    I have found that the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” marks are well known to the public at large in
                    Singapore. I have also found that the claim under s 55(3)(b)(i) is made out
                    because <em>inter alia</em> there was unfair dilution of
                    the distinctiveness of the Plaintiff’s trade marks. However, I disagreed
                    that the Defendant had taken unfair advantage of the distinctive character of
                    the Plaintiff’s trade marks, and accordingly find that the claim under s
                    55(3)(b)(ii) fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    In the event that I am wrong regarding the
                    Plaintiff’s “Nutella” marks being well known to the public
                    at large in Singapore, I have found that at the very least, the
                    Plaintiff’s marks are well known (to the relevant sector) in Singapore. In
                    the circumstances, I found that the claim under s 55(2) is made out because
                    – for the reasons given with regard to trade mark infringement under s
                    27(2)(b) above – the Defendant’s use of the “Nutello”
                    sign was likely to cause confusion. I have also found that the claim under s
                    55(3)(a) is made out because <em>inter alia</em> the
                    Defendant’s use of the “Nutello” sign was likely to damage
                    the Plaintiff’s interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    I turn finally to consider the passing off
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Passing off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    There is a conceptual difference between an
                    action for infringement of a registered trade mark and an action for passing
                    off: the action for infringement of a trade mark aims directly at protecting the
                    property in the mark itself and is brought to stop the wrongful use of the mark,
                    but the passing off action is for protection of the Plaintiff’s trade
                    which the mark may be used to promote (<em>Tan Lee Keng v
                        R</em> [1950] 1 MLJ 175 at 176).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    To succeed in an action for passing off, the
                    Plaintiff must establish the following elements of the “classical
                    trinity” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [36]-[37], citing <em>CDL Hotels International Ltd v
                        Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 975 (“<em>CDL Hotels</em>”) at [86]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, that the plaintiff has
                        goodwill attached to the goods which he supplies in the mind of the
                        purchasing public by association with the identifying “get-up”
                        (including, <em>inter alia</em>, brand names) under
                        which his particular goods are offered to the public, such that the get-up
                        is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the
                        plaintiff’s goods (hereinafter, referred to as the element of
                        “goodwill”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, that the defendant has made a misrepresentation
                        to the public (whether intentional or otherwise) leading or likely to lead
                        the public to believe that goods offered by the defendant are those of the
                        plaintiff (hereinafter, referred to as the element of “confusing
                        misrepresentation”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_193-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, that the plaintiff suffers, or is likely to
                        suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the
                        defendant’s misrepresentation (hereinafter, referred to as the element
                        of “damage”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    The law on passing off in Singapore has been
                    analysed in detail by the Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em>. Reference will accordingly be liberally made to
                    this case. Such reference is especially apposite also because the arguments
                    raised by parties in the present case mirror many of the arguments raised and
                    considered in <em>Amanresorts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on goodwill</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    A passing off action is a remedy for the
                    invasion of a right of property not in the mark, name or get-up improperly used,
                    but in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation
                    made by passing-off one person’s goods as the goods of another (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [38], citing <em>Star Industrial Company Limited
                        v Yap Kwee Kor</em> [1976] FSR 256 at 269).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Goodwill is the association of a good,
                    service or business on which the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling
                        <em>etc</em> (referred to generically as the
                    plaintiff’s “get-up”) has been applied with a particular
                    source (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [39]; <em>City Chain</em>
                    at [62]). It is an “attractive
                    force which brings in custom” (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    In determining whether goodwill exists in a
                    name, <em>exposure</em> of the name is the relevant
                    criterion (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [53]). Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is
                    a question of fact (<em>City Chain</em> at [62]). Possible indicia of goodwill include
                    volume of sales, trading, advertisements and promotion expenditure (<em>ibid</em>; <em>Caterpillar</em> at
                        [64]). However, mere sales figures
                    without more are not necessarily coincident with goodwill (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [158]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    The relevant date on which the reputation of
                    the plaintiff in a passing-off action should be considered is the date on which
                    the conduct complained of commences (<em>City Chain</em> at
                        [63], citing <em>CDL
                        Hotels</em> at [34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there goodwill on the present facts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Two preliminary points should be noted in
                    determining whether there was goodwill in the “Nutella” name.
                    First, the relevant date is 1 August 2007, which was the time when sale of the
                    “Nutello” drink in Singapore commenced (see also <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>
                    above). Second, in ascertaining whether the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” mark is well known in Singapore, the relevant figures to
                    be taken into account ought only be those in connection to the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” mark, and only in relation to the sale of
                    “Nutella” in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    For the same reasons that I found that the
                    Plaintiff’s trade mark was “well known” to the relevant
                    public, as well as the public at large, in Singapore, I find that
                    “Nutella” has goodwill in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_155">[155]</a> above). I now turn to consider the next element of
                    passing-off, that of “misrepresentation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Confusing misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    In order to establish an actionable tort of
                    passing off, the plaintiff, apart from proving that it has goodwill in the
                    goods, services or business in question, must also show that the defendant has
                    made a misrepresentation to the relevant sector of the public, and that such
                    misrepresentation has resulted in or is likely to result in damage to the
                    Plaintiff’s goodwill (<em>Amanresorts</em> at
                        [69]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    I turn to analyse the element of
                    misrepresentation in the context of the facts of the present case. In so doing,
                    I respectfully adopt the headings and methodology used by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Amanresorts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The content of the misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    With regard to the <em>content</em> of the “misrepresentation”, the Plaintiff
                    contends that the use of the “Nutello” sign by the Defendant
                    constitutes a misrepresentation that the “Nutello” product is
                    produced by the Plaintiff or that it is in some way connected to the Plaintiff.
                    In other words, the Plaintiff is contending that there are two alternative forms
                    of misrepresentation, <em>viz</em> misrepresentation as to
                    the <em>trade origin</em> of the goods and
                    misrepresentation as to the <em>connection</em> between the
                    defendant’s goods and the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The former type of misrepresentation
                        (<em>viz</em>, trade origin) may take the form of a
                    false representation by the defendant that his goods are those of the plaintiff,
                    or that there is a business connection between the plaintiff and the defendant
                    in relation to the goods provided by them (<em>CDL
                        Hotels</em> at [72]). Such
                    misrepresentation occurs when a defendant represents that his goods, services or
                    business are the plaintiff’s by using a name, word, device or other mark
                    which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s. The representation may be
                    express or implied, and deceives either by diverting customers from the
                    plaintiff to the defendant or by occasioning a confusion between the
                    parties’ businesses, <em>eg</em> by suggesting that
                    the defendant’s business is an extension, branch or agency or otherwise
                    connected with the plaintiff’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The latter type of misrepresentation
                        (<em>viz</em>, connection) refers to the situation
                    where the defendant represents that his goods are connected with the
                    plaintiff’s in such a way as would lead people to accept them on the faith
                    of the plaintiff’s reputation (<em>Bulmer v
                        Bollinger</em> [1978] RPC 79 (“<em>Bulmer</em>”) at 117). It would be sufficient if the
                    defendant’s goods are mistakenly assumed by the relevant public to be made
                    under licence, or under some trading arrangement which gave the plaintiff
                    control over the defendant’s goods (<em>Bulmer</em>
                    at 117). In such circumstances, even though the plaintiff and the defendant are
                    not competing traders in the same line of business, a false suggestion by the
                    defendant that their businesses were connected with one another would damage the
                    reputation and thus the goodwill of the plaintiff’s business (<em>Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v Townend &amp; Sons (Hull)
                        Ltd</em> [1979] AC 731).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The target audience of the misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Whether the misrepresentation is believed
                    and relied upon is subject to the reaction of the relevant sector of the public.
                    In this regard, counsel for the Defendant argued that the <em>Defendant’s</em> customers should form the target audience of
                    the misrepresentation because the damage, if any, would only arise if the
                        <em>Defendant’s</em> customers were confused as
                    to the source or origin of the “Nutello” drink.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The Defendant’s argument is
                    misconceived. It was clearly held in <em>Amanresorts</em>
                    that the target audience comprises of the “actual and potential customers
                    of the [<em>Plaintiff</em>]” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [73]
                    (emphasis added)). The rationale behind this holding is that “only
                    misrepresentations directed to [the Plaintiff’s customers] are likely to
                    damage the [Plaintiff’s] goodwill” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [73]). It
                    is difficult to see how the Plaintiff can suffer from a misrepresentation made
                    to a person who is neither an actual nor potential customer of the Plaintiff
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [73]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Therefore, I find that the relevant sector
                    of the public in the present case comprises the actual and potential customers
                    of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the misrepresentation resulted in confusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    A misrepresentation is actionable under the
                    law of passing off only if it gives rise to <em>confusion</em> (<em>Amanresorts</em> at
                        [77]). However, evidence of
                        <em>actual</em> confusion is not required before a
                    passing off action can succeed; it is open to the court to infer a <em>likelihood</em> of confusion from the surrounding facts
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [77]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    The elements of misrepresentation and
                    confusion together form the “deception” referred to by Lord
                    Diplock in <em>Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap v Townend
                        &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd</em> [1979] AC 731 (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [77]).
                    Although “deception” is a key element in a passing off claim
                        (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [161]), it is not necessary to prove that the
                    defendant has an <em>intention to deceive</em> or to
                    mislead the public (<em>Tessensohn t/a Clea Professional Image
                        Consultants v John Robert Powers School Inc</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 470).
                    For this reason, it has been said that the state of mind of the defendant is
                    immaterial; rather, what matters is the impact on the relevant sector of the
                    public (<em>Nation Fittings</em> at [165]). If the impact on these persons is
                    such that they would be deceived, the element of misrepresentation is made out
                    and the defendant cannot avoid a finding of passing off by the mere fact that
                    the misrepresentation was made innocently (<em>Johnson &amp;
                        Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corporation)</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at [25]; <em>Amanresorts</em> at [83]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    The test of whether there is a likelihood of
                    confusion is whether a reasonable member of the relevant sector of the public
                    would be likely to be confused or misled by the Defendant’s
                    misrepresentation. In determining whether there is confusion, the court is not
                    concerned with the “moron in a hurry” being confused (<em>Tong Guan</em> at [24]). Instead, the court is concerned with the ordinary
                    sensible purchaser, <em>viz</em>, the purchaser using
                    ordinary caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there was confusing misrepresentation in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    I have earlier held in the context of trade
                    mark infringement under s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, that the
                    “Nutello” sign and “Nutella” mark are similar and
                    are being used on similar goods, and that these similarities have resulted in a
                    likelihood of confusion (see [145]
                    above). For the same reasons, I find that there is a likelihood that the
                    relevant public would have been led to believe that the “Nutello”
                    product is produced by the Plaintiff or is in some way connected to the
                    Plaintiff. Therefore, there was misrepresentation giving rise to a likelihood of
                    confusion in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    I now turn to consider the final element of
                    passing-off, that of “damage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    The tort of passing off protects the
                    plaintiff against damage caused to the goodwill attached to its business, goods
                    or services by the defendant’s misrepresentation (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [94]).
                    Thus, even if the defendant’s misrepresentation is shown to have caused or
                    to be likely to cause confusion between the plaintiff’s business, goods or
                    services and those of the defendant, such misrepresentation is not in itself
                    actionable under the law of passing off unless it has caused (or is likely to
                    cause) damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [94]).
                    The test for damage in passing off cases is either “actual or probable
                    damage” (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [94]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    As recognised by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Amanresorts</em> at [96], the law relating to which heads of damage are (or should
                    be) judicially recognised under the tort of passing off is notoriously
                    difficult.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    In the present case, the Plaintiff claims
                    three heads of damage:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, restriction on the
                        Plaintiff’s expansion into the drinks industry in
                    Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
                        the likelihood of damage should the Defendant’s activities become
                        reprehensible; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the loss of licensing opportunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I will
                    address each of the alleged heads of damage in the following
                    sub-sections.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Restriction on the Plaintiff’s expansion into the drinks
                industry in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    The Plaintiff claimed that the use of
                    “Nutello” by the Defendant restricted the Plaintiff’s
                    ability to expand into the drinks industry in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    In <em>Amanresorts</em>, the Court of Appeal held that the respondents’
                    high-end hotel and resort business was closely related to the appellant’s
                    residential accommodation business, since both fields concern accommodation
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [121]). Importantly, the Court of Appeal emphasised that the
                    fact that the respondents have already expanded into the residential
                    accommodation business overseas buttressed its conclusion that the fields were
                    closely related (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [121]). For these reasons, the Court of
                    appeal held that the head of damage, <em>viz</em>
                    restriction on the respondents’ expansion into the residential
                    accommodation business, had been proved (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [121]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    The reasoning in <em>Amanresorts</em> is applicable to the present case. Here, the
                    Plaintiff’s field of business (including, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, chocolate products) is closely related to the
                    Defendant’s (although in the café business, the “Nutello”
                    drink has a chocolate character). The fact that the Plaintiff had already
                    expanded its product line to include a Nutella-based drink (“Nutella Milk
                    Shake”) overseas buttresses this point. Indeed, under cross-examination,
                    Mr Malatesta testified that the Plaintiff “may go also in [<em>sic</em>] the drink business” in Singapore.
                    Accordingly, I find that this head of damage, <em>viz</em>
                    restriction on the Plaintiff’s expansion into the drinks industry in
                    Singapore, has been proved. The use of the “Nutello” sign by the
                    Defendant is likely to restrict the Plaintiff’s expansion of its line of
                    products in Singapore to the drinks industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Likelihood of damage should the Defendant’s activities become
                reprehensible</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    The Plaintiff claimed that because it has no
                    control over the Defendant’s activities, should the Defendant’s
                    activities become reprehensible (<em>eg</em> selling a
                    tainted “Nutello” product), the sales of the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” spread may also be affected. A specific example was
                    given by Mr Malatesta under cross-examination, <em>viz</em>, “[i]f something happens, and tomorrow someone eats,
                    drinks your drink [<em>ie</em>, “Nutello”],
                    and for any reason there is any problem with what they drink, this can be
                    affected [<em>sic</em>] my product because it’s
                    branded Nutello”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    This argument is similar to the argument
                    raised by the respondents in <em>Amanresorts</em> that
                    there was likelihood of damage should the appellant get into financial, legal or
                    other trouble. More specifically, the respondents argued that (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [102]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if the Appellant were to get into any sort of financial, legal or
                        other trouble, persons who had confused the Project with the
                        Respondents’ resorts might assume that it was the Respondents which
                        were having difficulties; in effect, the Respondents would have lost control
                        over the goodwill or reputation attached to the “Aman” names.
                        It was submitted that if, for instance, a newspaper article headed
                        “Fire at Amanusa Due To Faulty Wiring” were published, the
                        public might assume that the article was referring to the Amanusa Bali as
                        opposed to the Project. People who made that assumption might decide not to
                        stay at the Amanusa Bali and might also assume that the quality of the other
                        Aman resorts had likewise deteriorated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    The Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> went on to analyse the case authorities which
                    indicated that the threshold which a plaintiff has to cross to prove this
                    particular head of damage (<em>viz</em>, a likelihood of
                    damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill should the defendant encounter
                    financial, legal or other trouble) is relatively low (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [103],
                    analysing <em>British Legion v British Legion Club (Street)
                        Ld</em> (1931) 48 RPC 555 (“<em>British
                        Legion</em>”), <em>Dawnay Day &amp; Co Limited v
                        Cantor Fitzgerald International</em> [2000] RPC 674 (“<em>Dawnay Day</em>”)). The Court of Appeal disagreed with
                    the propositions in <em>British Legion</em> and <em>Dawnay Day</em>, observing that mere allegations that evil
                    days may befall the defendant – if accepted as sufficient proof –
                    would render the requirement of damage otiose (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [105]).
                    Instead, a “real tangible risk of substantial damage” must be
                    shown (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [105]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Applying the reasoning in <em>Amanresorts</em>, the present head of damage is not made out. To
                    borrow the phrase of the Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> at [105],
                    it is “too much of a stretch to allege, without more, that there is a
                    real tangible risk” that the Defendant’s activities may become
                    reprehensible, resulting in damage to the Plaintiff’s
                goodwill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The loss of licensing opportunity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The Plaintiff argues that – as a
                    result of the Defendant’s actions – it would be likely to suffer the
                    loss of licensing opportunity, <em>viz</em>, that it would
                    lose out on an opportunity to licence its “Nutella” trade
                    mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    The Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> noted that loss of licensing opportunity or
                    licensing income has been held, in the UK, to be a distinct head of damage in
                    passing off actions (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [108]-[109], citing <em>Irvine v Talksport
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 1 WLR 2355 and <em>Lego System
                        Aktieselskab v Lego M Lemelstrich Ltd</em> [1983] FSR 155). However,
                    the Court saw “much force” in the analysis of Fisher J in
                        <em>Tot Toys Ltd v Mitchell</em> [1993] 1 NZLR 325 at
                    362 (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [110]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is axiomatic that damage must be proved or presumed as one of the
                        ingredients of passing off. It has never been sufficient for plaintiffs to
                        fill this gap by arguing that their loss is loss of the right to charge the
                        defendant a fee for continuing conduct the lawfulness of which is the
                        subject currently under inquiry. To accept that proposition would be to deny
                        that damage is an essential and independent ingredient of the tort. And if
                        the defendant’s conduct is otherwise lawful, it cannot be rendered
                        unlawful upon the ground that it might induce others to act in the same way
                        without the plaintiff’s permission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    In this regard, the Court of Appeal
                    cautioned that recognition of loss of licensing opportunity or licensing income
                    as a distinct head of damage for the purposes of passing off should be
                    approached <em>conservatively</em> (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [113]).
                    It noted that it is only if passing off is <em>first
                        proved</em> that the plaintiff then has the right to demand that those
                    who wish to use its distinctive get-up must first obtain a licence from it
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [111]). Otherwise, if the “damage” element is
                    automatically fulfilled by the mere fact that the misrepresentation in passing
                    off <em>could have been</em> sanctioned by the plaintiff
                    for payment, this would render the element of “damage” illusory
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [111], citing and agreeing with Christopher Wadlow, <em>The Law of Passing-Off: Unfair Competition by
                        Misrepresentation</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2004) at para
                    4-38).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Unfortunately, the Court did not make any
                    specific pronouncement on whether or not such a head of damage would be
                    recognised under Singapore law. On the facts of that case, the Court opined that
                        <em>even if</em> the loss of licensing opportunity was
                    accepted as being recoverable in passing off actions under Singapore law, it was
                    not clear on the evidence adduced by the respondents of their licensing
                    agreements with real estate developers <em>overseas</em>
                    really proved damage arising from misrepresentation and confusion <em>in Singapore</em> (<em>Amanresorts</em>
                    at [113]). Although the respondents
                    were entitled to license the “Aman” names overseas because they
                    had been registered as trade marks overseas for other reasons, this did not mean
                    that their “Aman” names had a natural capacity for generating
                    licensing opportunities or licensing revenue in Singapore (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [113]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    In the present case, the Plaintiff attempted
                    to distinguish <em>Amanresorts</em> in two ways. First,
                    unlike in <em>Amanresorts</em>, the Plaintiff has trade
                    mark registrations for the “Nutella” marks. Second, licensing in
                    the confectionery industry is common with chocolate manufacturers licensing
                    their marks in relation to chocolate products such as ice cream and cakes which
                    use the licensors’ chocolate as an ingredient (citing Cadbury UK’s
                    licensing of its mark to Frederick’s Dairies (ice-cream) and Premier Foods
                    (chocolate cakes)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    There is little force in the second argument
                    just cited. The Court of Appeal in <em>Amanresorts</em> had
                    opined that “[e]ven if the plaintiff does have an existing business of
                    licensing its get-up for use by others, this might only mean that its licensees
                        <em>mistakenly</em> think that a licence is necessary
                    before they can use the plaintiff’s get-up [and therefore does not
                    indicate that the element of “damage” has been fulfilled by a loss
                    of licensing opportunity <em>per se</em>]”
                        (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [111]); <em>a fortiori</em>, where the
                    Plaintiff has not even proven that it has an existing business of licensing its
                    get-up, there is little force in attempting to argue that other chocolate
                    manufacturers have previously licensed their get-ups. However, I recognise that
                    there is reason to distinguish <em>Amanresorts</em> from
                    the present case on the basis of the first argument, <em>viz</em>, that unlike in <em>Amanresorts</em>
                    the Plaintiff has trade mark registrations for the “Nutella”
                    marks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Nonetheless, there is no need for me to
                    consider whether or not the loss of a licensing opportunity would be recognised
                    as a distinct head of damage under the law of passing off in Singapore. This is
                    because although the Court of Appeal was reticent in accepting the loss of
                    licensing opportunity or licensing income as a distinct head of damage, it
                    readily held that if passing off is proved (based on some other head of damage
                    which is well established as being recoverable), the plaintiff –
                    <em>in addition to</em> claiming for any loss of sales
                    occasioned by such damage – can <em>also</em> claim
                    for loss of licensing revenue (<em>Amanresorts</em> at
                        [114]). The loss of licensing
                    opportunity or licensing revenue therefore goes towards <em>quantifying</em> rather than <em>proving</em>
                    damage (<em>Amanresorts</em> at [114]). On the present facts, I have already
                    found that damage had been caused in the form of restricting the
                    Plaintiff’s expansion of its line of products in Singapore to the drinks
                    industry. Any <em>additional</em> damage caused by the loss
                    of licensing opportunity can be taken into account at the stage of assessing
                    damages. Accordingly, there is no need for me to determine whether the loss of
                    licensing opportunity would be recognised as a distinct head of damage under the
                    law of passing off in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the passing off claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I find that passing off has been made out in
                    the present case. Goodwill exists in the “Nutella” name, which
                    reaches across a large proportion of the public in Singapore. The public, which
                        <em>includes</em> the Defendant’s clientele,
                    would have been exposed to the Defendant’s use of the name
                    “Nutello” for its drink –
                    <em>ie</em>, to the Defendant’s misrepresentation
                    that “Nutello” had the same source as or was in some way connected
                    with the Plaintiff. Although the Plaintiff has not succeeded in convincing me on
                    all their pleaded heads of damage, this is not significant because the Plaintiff
                    has successfully demonstrated a likelihood of damage in the form of restriction
                    on the Plaintiff’s expansion into the drinks industry in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    In the circumstances, I grant the Plaintiff
                    the injunctions to restrain the Defendant from infringing the Plaintiff’s
                    “Nutella” marks and from passing off its products as being
                    products of (or connected to) the Plaintiff. I find that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_232-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the Defendant had infringed
                        the Plaintiff’s “Nutella” word mark under s 27(2)(b) of
                        the TMA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_232-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the Plaintiff’s “Nutella” marks are well known
                        trade marks within the definition of s 2(1) of the TMA, and are well known
                        both to the relevant sector of the public as well as to the public at large.
                        Accordingly, I find that the Defendant had infringed the Plaintiff’s
                        “Nutella” marks under ss 55(2), 55(3)(a) and 55(3)(b)(i) of
                        the TMA. However, the Defendant had not infringed the Plaintiff’s
                        “Nutella” marks under s 55(3)(b)(ii) of the
                    TMA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_232-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the
                        Defendant had passed off by promoting, selling and offering for sale the
