</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        This was an appeal by the

prosecution against a decision of a magistrate in the subordinate courts, who acquitted

the accused without calling for his defence. I allowed the appeal and ordered the case to

be remitted back to the court below for the defence to be called. I now give my reasons

for my decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The charge against the accused was as follows:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, Sundaraju s/o Munusamy, Male 33 years, NRIC S6810332J, are charged

    that you on the 19<sup>th</sup> day of August 2001 at or about 3.14 am, along Perak Road,

    Singapore, which is a public place, was found armed with a dangerous instrument, to wit, a

    15 cm long screwdriver, without lawful purpose and you have thereby committed an offence,

    punishable under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and

    Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 Sections 22(1), (2) and (3) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public

<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 At the close of the prosecution’s case, defence counsel made a

submission of no case to answer. The magistrate agreed with the defence that the evidence

adduced by the prosecution was not sufficient to make out a prima facie case against the

accused and consequently acquitted the accused without calling for his defence. The

prosecution appealed against the acquittal.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p>The principles to be applied at the close of the prosecution’s case in determining

whether a prima facie case has been made out</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 Section 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides as

follows:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds

    that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his

    conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on

    the accused to enter on his defence. </p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 It is clear from the above provision that the condition precedent to

the judge calling for the defence is the establishment by the prosecution of a case

against the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the accused. In

relation to this precondition, Lord Diplock in <i>Haw Tua Tau v PP</i> [1980-1981] SLR 73

at pp 79 and 80 laid down the following principles, which have been adopted in <i>Tan Siew

Chay v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7034&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 2 SLR 14</a> at 38:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The crucial words [in s 189(1)] are the words ‘if

    unrebutted’, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely

    hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing

    evidence of primary facts and it is to such evidence that the words ‘if

    unrebutted’ refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision

    called for by s [189(1)], the court must act on the following presumptions: (a) that the

    evidence on the primary facts is true, unless it is so</p></blockquote></blockquote></font> <font size="3" xmlns="">inherently

    incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there

    will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind

    of the accused which would reasonably</font> <font size="3" xmlns="">be drawn from the primary

    facts in the absence of any further explanation. 

    </font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 In determining whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie

case which would justify a conviction if not contradicted, it has been clearly held in <i>Haw

Tua Tau</i> that the judge must consider whether there is some evidence, which is not

inherently incredible and which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each

essential element of the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those

essential elements is lacking, only then will he be justified in finding that ‘no

case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his

conviction’ within the meaning of s 189(1). If the judge finds that each essential

element has been established, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 It is well settled that at this stage the court need not be satisfied

that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In the words of Lord Diplock in <i>Haw

Tua Tau</i> (supra, at pp 78 and 80): </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Section [189(1)] states the conditions precedent to the

    right and duty of the judge of trial to call on the accused to enter on his

    defence…it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at

    that stage of proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then

    already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. Indeed it would

    run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court

    to do so.</p>
</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore in

    seem, upon a literal reading, to suggest that unless at the end of the prosecution’s

    case the evidence adduced has already satisfied the judge beyond a reasonable doubt that

    the accused is guilty, the judge must order his acquittal. But this can hardly have been

    what that court intended, for it ignores the presence in the section of the crucial words

    ‘if unrebutted’, to which in other passages the court refers, and it converts

    the hypothetical question of law which the judge has to ask himself at that stage of the

    proceeding: ‘If I were to accept the prosecution’s evidence as accurate would it

    establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt?’ into an actual and

    quite different question of fact: ‘Has the prosecution’s evidence already done

    so?’…their Lordships consider this to be an incorrect statement of the effect of

    [s 189(1)].</p>

<i xmlns="">
<p>The primary facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 On 19 August 2001 at about 3 am, Sergeant Ahmad Rithaudeen bin

Mohamed (‘Sgt Ahmad’) and Corporal Jeffrey Ang Zhilong (‘Cpl Ang’)

were on police patrol car duty when they received a message to proceed to Dunlop Street

where a group of foreigners (according to Sgt Ahmad) or Indians (according to Cpl Ang)

were fighting. A First Information Report stating that foreigners were fighting at Dunlop

Street was tendered in evidence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 When Sgt Ahmad and Cpl Ang arrived at Dunlop Street, a group of more

than 10 male Indians was seen at the junction of Perak Road and Mayo Street. According to

Sgt Ahmad, the group appeared to be having an argument or a conversation, but Cpl

Ang’s evidence was that the persons in the group were "just gathering

around". The crowd started to disperse upon seeing the patrol car. Another group

consisting of less than five Indian men was then seen walking along Perak Road. Sgt Ahmad

was not sure whether they were from the earlier group that had dispersed. He then decided

to check on this second group of Indians and walked behind them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 When Sgt Ahmad was about 5 metres behind them, he saw one of them,

who was later ascertained to be the accused, drop a black coloured object to the right

side and it was stuck at the bottom end of the trousers that the accused was wearing. The

accused was seen attempting to shake off the object. The accused did not turn around and

continued walking ahead when Sgt Ahmad shouted at him to stop. When Sgt Ahmad caught up

with him and questioned him about the object which had by that time fallen onto the

ground, the accused denied that the object was his. The object was later ascertained to be

a 15 cm long screwdriver. The other persons with whom the accused was seen together

continued to walk away when the accused was stopped by Sgt Ahmad. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 The main issue to be decided in the present case was whether,

assuming that the evidence adduced by the prosecution above was true and that there was

nothing to displace reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the above primary

facts, the prosecution had established a case against the accused which, if unrebutted,

would warrant his conviction under s 22(1)(a) of the Act.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 There are certain aspects of the magistrate’s reasoning with

which I did not entirely concur. In the court below, the magistrate drew a distinction

between "found armed" and "armed with" and this can be seen from the

following paragraphs of his grounds of decision:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">10. To compound matters further, the opening limb of

    section 22(1) also requires that the accused be "found armed" with the dangerous

    weapon. In addition, in order for the prosecution to rely on the presumption under section

    22(2), the prosecution must "allege and prove that the accused was found to be armed

    with any dangerous or offensive instrument".</p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">14. …The next issue then was whether from the existing evidence

    adduced by the prosecution, mainly the act of seeing the screwdriver sliding down from the

    accused’s trousers and the accused’s action in shaking it off from his trousers,

    the necessary inferences could be drawn to show that the accused was "found

    armed" with the screwdriver at the material time as required by the provision, and

    not merely "armed with" or "in possession of" the screwdriver. </p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 The court below referred to the Canadian case of <i>R v Mitchell and

Maclean</i> [1932] 1 W.W.R 657, in which the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal construed the

word "found" in s 464(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">By virtue of its presence and relationship, we think that <i><b>the

    word "found" in sec 464 carries with it the implication that the person in

    possession of the instrument must be discovered with it in such a place as to afford

    ground for a reasonable opportunity to use it in the commission of a criminal offence.

    Thus the place, as well as the time of discovery, must tend to incriminate him.</b></i> It

    is not enough that he may have a housebreaking instrument in those ordinary lawful haunts,

    such as home or office, where a man may keep such a thing without arousing suspicion of

    its use for a criminal purpose, other than such as may arise from its own unlawful

    character. To put it briefly, he must be discovered with it abroad. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 It seems to me that the magistrate was rather influenced by the

above passage from <i>Mitchell</i> and this can be seen from his decision:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">15. …The arresting officers had…received a message that

    either a group of foreigners (per Sgt Ahmad) or Indians (per Cpl Ang) was fighting at

    Dunlop Street. Upon arrival at the scene, the officers saw a group of Indians dispersing.

    They then saw another group of Indians whom the accused was with walking past

    them…However, neither officer could confirm whether the group whom the accused was

    with originated from the earlier group that had dispersed. In fact, Sgt Ahmad’s

    evidence was that the accused’s group was walking behind the officers…The

    overall impression given by the officers was that the accused’s group did not come

    from the earlier group that dispersed…<i><b>If it had been shown conclusively that

    the accused was from the group that dispersed, the inference that he was "armed"

    might have been stronger, that is, he might have been involved in the alleged fight</b></i>.

    (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The magistrate’s view that there might have been a stronger

inference that the accused was "armed" if there were evidence of the accused

having been involved in the alleged fight, implies that there has to be evidence of

surrounding circumstances suggesting the commission (for instance, being involved in

violence or robbery) or the imminent commission of an offence (for instance, the accused

loitering near a car) before the accused can be said to be "armed with" a

dangerous or offensive instrument. To impose such a requirement is tantamount to

indirectly placing the burden on the prosecution to prove that the carrying of the

instrument was related to the commission of any offence, or that the accused was armed

with the instrument with some intent to commit an offence, an element which Parliament has

already removed from the provision in 1996. Section 22(1)(a) was amended in 1996 when the

words "with intent to commit any offence" was substituted with the phrase

"without lawful authority or a lawful purpose". The attention of this court was

drawn to the speech of the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home

Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, on 27 February 1996 in relation to the Miscellaneous

Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Amendment) Bill:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">… under the existing section 22(1)(a), it is an offence for a

    person to be armed with a dangerous or offensive instrument<i><b> with intent to commit an

    offence</b></i>. This requires the prosecution to prove not only that the person is armed

    with a dangerous or offensive instrument but also that he intended to commit an offence

    with it. Unless the accused admits it, it is impossible to prove his intent. <i><b>To

    overcome this problem so as to facilitate prosecution</b></i>, clause 9 of the Bill seeks

    to create a new subsection (1A) to place on the accused the onus of proving that he has a

    lawful purpose to be armed with the dangerous or offensive instrument. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 The next question is how should the words "armed with" be

construed in the light of such considerations. Some guidance may be obtained from the

Australian and English authorities. In <i>Rowe v Conti</i> [1958] VR 547, the defendant

was charged under s 69(1) of the Police Offences Act 1957 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Every person committing any of the following offences

    shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person within this Part…</p>
<p align="justify">(f)     Every person found armed with any sword

    bludgeon or other offensive weapon or instrument: Provided that if such person being

    thereto required by the court gives to the satisfaction of the court a good account of his

    lawful means of support and assigns a valid and satisfactory reason for his being so armed

    he shall be deemed not to be guilty of such offence. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The police searched the defendant, Conti, outside a hotel and found

that he was not in possession of a knife. They subsequently found a knife in his car which

was in the back yard of the hotel. The Supreme Court of Victoria held that there was no

case to answer on the ground that the defendant was not "found armed" within the

meaning of s 69(1)(f). Gavan Duffy J said (at p 549):</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">When Conti was searched by the police he was not "armed" in

    any sense. I do not say that a man must necessarily have the weapon in his hand to be

    armed with it, but he must have it immediately ready for use. The fact that he has in his

    vehicle a weapon with which he can arm himself in a few minutes is not enough. </p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 The Supreme Court of Victoria in <i>Miller v Hrvojevic</i> [1972] VR

305 had also considered the meaning of "armed" in the context of s 6(1)(e) of

the Vagrancy Act 1966 (at p 306):</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">To be armed with a weapon means something more than to be in possession

    of it; the weapon must also be available for immediate use as a weapon. No doubt questions

    of fact and degree are involved. A man is armed with a pistol if he is wearing it in a

    holster, though perhaps not if it is in the boot of his car. It is not necessary for it to

    be in his hand for him to be armed with it. In the present case the knuckle duster was in

    the defendant’s left-side trouser pocket, where it could easily and rapidly be

    slipped onto his hand. Accordingly, I think the evidence establishes that he was found

    armed with it. </p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Section 6(1)(e) of the Vagrancy Act, which is rather similar to s

22(1)(a) of the Act, provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>

</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 In the English case of <i>R v Jones (Keith Desmond</i>) [1987] 2 All

ER 692, the appellant was convicted under s 86 of the Customs and Excise Management Act

1979, which makes it an offence to be "armed with any offensive weapon" while

being concerned in smuggling. The appellant was the captain of a boat that was used to

smuggle drugs into England. Customs and police officers boarded the boat and they found,

apart from the drugs, two pistols in a locker in the wheel-house. The Court of Appeal

dismissed the appeal against conviction and held that the expression "armed"

involves either physically carrying arms, or it will involve proof that a defendant knows

that they are immediately available. The court was also of the view that in considering s

86 of the 1979 Act, helpful guidance can be derived from the judgment of Scarman LJ in <i>R

v Kelt</i> [1977] 3 All ER 1099, which was a case under s 18 of the Firearms Act 1968:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Of course the classic case of having a gun with you is if you are

    carrying it. But even if you are not carrying it, you may yet have it with you, if it is

    immediately available to you. But if all that can be shown is possession in the sense that

    it is in your house or in a shed or somewhere you have ultimate control, that is not

    enough. </p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 In my opinion, the expression "armed with a dangerous or

offensive instrument" in the context of s 22(1)(a) of the Act should be construed to

mean being in actual physical possession of the instrument (whether it is carried on the

person or near to the person), which is immediately available and ready for use. The

expression does not include a situation, for instance, where a person is away from his

house or his car in which the instrument is found. That person cannot be said to be

"armed with" the instrument, even though he may have control or dominion over

it, as it is not available for immediate use. In not requiring the prosecution to prove

that the accused has committed or will commit an offence, such a construction of the words

"armed with" would be consistent with the intention of the amendment, which was

to facilitate prosecution and enforcement of the law. This interpretation would also be in

line with the purpose of s 22(1)(a), which is to prevent the use of dangerous or offensive

instruments and to allow timely action to be taken to reduce any opportunity to use such

instruments. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 Counsel for the accused contended that the prosecution’s case

fell short of even showing that the accused was in possession of the screwdriver, much

less could the evidence show that he was armed with the screwdriver. Counsel relied on

certain parts of the testimony of Sgt Ahmad in support of his submissions:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Q: Put – you never saw this accused in possession

  of the screwdriver as you alleged?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes, I didn’t see he was in possession of the screwdriver.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Put – this accused was not armed with the screwdriver?</p>
<p align="justify">A: He was not armed with the screwdriver.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 Counsel also drew the attention of the court to Cpl Ang’s

evidence during cross-examination:</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: Do you agree that you cannot say what fell onto the ground on that

  night from this accused person?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 Apart from Cpl Ang’s testimony given during cross-examination,

I also noted the evidence given by Cpl Ang during examination-in-chief and re-examination.

During examination-in-chief, Cpl Ang testified that he saw the accused shake his leg and

that a black object had landed near to the side of the road, but he could not see what the

black object was at that time. He was able to ascertain that the black object was a

screwdriver after he and Sgt Ahmad had caught up with the accused. In re-examination, Cpl

Ang gave the following evidence:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Q: You said you saw a black-coloured object fall from

  the accused?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Was it from his left or right hand side?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Right hand side.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q: You later identified this screwdriver in court and it was the black

  coloured object?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: How can you be so sure that this black object is the screwdriver?</p>
<p align="justify">A: When I saw the black object falling off, I remembered the location

  where it landed.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You saw it landed and you remembered the location where it landed,

  what made you so sure that the screwdriver fell from the accused and not from anyone else?</p>
<p align="justify">A: I saw the black object falling and he was trying to shake it away.</p>
</blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I would also point out at this juncture that Sgt Ahmad had clearly

testified in court that the accused had dropped the screwdriver to his right side, which

fell along the seams of the trousers and got hooked at the bottom end of his trousers, and

he had then attempted to shake it off his trousers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 In my view, an inference that the accused was "armed with a

dangerous or offensive instrument" could reasonably be drawn from the evidence, there

being no dispute that the screwdriver was such an instrument. I was therefore of the view

that the prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted and uncontradicted, would

warrant the conviction of the accused. In the circumstances, the magistrate should have

called for the defence whereupon the burden would be on the accused to show that he had

lawful purpose or lawful authority to be armed with the screwdriver. </p>
