<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The facts of the offence were set out in the
                    Statement of Facts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> which
                    the accused admitted without qualification. Paras 2 to 6 of the statement
                    disclosed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    On 10 October 2009,
                            at about 11.45 p.m., the accused drove a Singapore-registered motor car
                            bearing registration number SGX 3644M (“SGX 3644M”) alone
                            into Singapore at the Woodlands
                            Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    At the Arrival Car
                            Green Channel Zone of the said Checkpoint, the accused was directed by
                            an Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) officer
                            to park SGX 3644M at Lane 6 of the said Zone for a routine check to be
                            carried out on the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Two other ICA officers thereafter carried out the check on SGX
                            3644M.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    In the course of
                            checking SGX 3644M, the ICA officers discovered a box of tissues
                            (“the tissue box”) on the floor behind the driver’s
                            seat. On closer inspection, various glass ware and glass pipes were
                            found inside two smaller boxes that were packed at the bottom of the
                            tissue box.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The ICA officers
                            activated Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers on
                            duty in the vicinity of Lane 6 of the abovementioned Zone for
                            assistance. On further inspection of SGX 3644M, the following items were
                            discovered:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    One red plastic bag behind the radio console,
                                which contained two packets of granular/powdery substances wrapped
                                in a newspaper;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    One orange plastic bag inside the compartment
                                below the handbrake, which also contained two packets of
                                granular/powdery substances wrapped in a newspaper;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    One black pouch in the compartment below the
                                radio console (“the black pouch”), which contained two
                                packets of crystalline substance, glass tube, glass pipe and
                                straw.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The diamorphine referred to in Charge 1 was
                    recovered from the red plastic bag and the orange plastic bag. Each bag
                    contained two packets of granular/powdery substances which were analysed and
                    found to contain not less than 30.91 grams of diamorphine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The methamphetamine referred to in Charge 2 was
                    recovered from two packets of crystalline substance in the black pouch. The
                    crystalline substance was analysed and was found to contain not less 1.12 grams
                    of methamphetamine. The utensils referred to in Charge 4 were also recovered
                    from the black pouch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The utensils referred to in Charge 5 were
                    recovered from the tissue box.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The utensils referred to in Charge 6 and the
                    three tablets of nimetazepam were recovered from the accused’s residence
                    on 11 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The evidence of the consumption of
                    methamphetamine referred to in Charge 3 was from the analysis of the urine
                    sample of the accused taken on 11 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the hearing, the accused confirmed that he
                    knew that the drugs he was importing were diamorphine and
                        methamphetamine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The accused’s background was set out in
                    his plea-in-mitigation:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     he is a Singaporean and is 30 years
                        old (his marital status is not disclosed);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     he was educated in Perth, Australia to the
                        equivalent of A-level;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     he has been a regular with the Republic of Singapore Navy
                        since 1998 (his rank and pay are not disclosed);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     he suffers from gout and high blood
                        pressure; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     he has no antecedents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The accused disclosed that he used to commute
                    to Johor Bahru to visit his girlfriend and friends, and he met a person named
                    Eric who became a drinking companion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In 2008 – 2009 the accused was in
                    financial difficulties as a result of his accumulating credit card and mobile
                    telephone debts which amounted to $13,000. He borrowed from his friends to pay
                    the credit card and telephone bills and ended up being indebted to them as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On one occasion when he was with Eric he told
                    Eric of his financial problems. Subsequently, when he was in Johor Bahru on
                    10 October 2009 Eric approached him with a proposal for him to bring a
                    consignment of drugs into Singapore for a payment of $2,500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused was eager to earn the $2,500 and
                    agreed to the proposal. He gave Eric his car key and Eric drove off to place the
                    drugs in the car before returning it to him. When the accused drove the car back
                    to Singapore, he was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint. After he was
                    arrested, the accused co-operated with the authorities and made positive
                    statements to the investigating officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The prosecution did not make submissions
                    specifically on sentence to be imposed. Instead, it submitted two compilations
                    of sentences. One compilation was of sentences imposed in cases where an accused
                    person had pleaded guilty to trafficking/importing diamorphine where the
                    quantity of the drugs has been reduced to below 15 grams although the actual
                    quantities involved were greater and would have brought on the mandatory capital
                        sentence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In
                    the twenty cases in the compilation the sentences imposed ranged between 20 to
                    25 years imprisonment with between 15 to 20 strokes of the cane. The other
                    compilation was of sentences for consumption of methamphetamine, possession of
                    utensils intended for drug consumption, and possession of
                        nimetazepam<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In deciding on any sentence, regard must be
                    given to the range of sentences prescribed by statute. For the seven offences
                    the accused committed, the range of sentences are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>
<u>Charge 1</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Maximum_1"></a>Maximum    30 years or imprisonment
                        for life</p>
<p class="Judg-2">15 strokes</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Minimum"></a>Minimum    20 years</p>
<p class="Judg-2">15 strokes</p>
<p class="Judg-2">
<u>Charge 2</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Maximum"></a>Maximum    30 years or imprisonment for
                        life</p>
<p class="Judg-2">15 strokes</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Minimum_2"></a>Minimum    5 years</p>
<p class="Judg-2">5 strokes</p>
<p class="Judg-2">
<u>Charge 3</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Maximum_3"></a>Maximum:    10 years or $20,000 fine or
                        both</p>
<p class="Judg-2">
<u>Charges 4, 5 and
                    6</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Maximum_4"></a>Maximum    3 years or $10,000 fine or both</p>
<p class="Judg-2">

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_Maximum_5"></a>Maximum    10 years or $20,000 fine or
                both</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The circumstances and conduct of the accused
                    before and after his arrest are also important matters to be considered. I kept
                    in mind the mitigating factors, i.em that he had pleaded guilty to all the
                    charges, that he had co-operated in the investigations and that he had no
                    antecedents. I also took into account other factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     at 30 years old he is in the prime
                        of his life;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     he
                        is reasonably well-educated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     he has a steady job;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     his accumulated debt of $13,000 was not large,
                        and was incurred by him in credit card and mobile phone
                    expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     he was
                        not put under pressure to commit the offences, but was tempted by the allure
                        of quick cash, as his counsel put it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_f"></a>(f)     he would have faced the death penalty on
                        conviction if the quantity of diamorphine was not reduced by the
                        prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I imposed the following sentences on
                    him:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_Charge1"></a>Charge 1:    22 years’
                        imprisonment and 15 strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_Charge2"></a>Charge 2:    5 years’ imprisonment and 5
                    strokes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_Charge3"></a>Charge 3:    8 months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_Charges456and7"></a>Charges 4, 5, 6 and 7:    3 months’
                        imprisonment each.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and I ordered that the custodial
                    sentences for Charge 1 and Charge 2 are to run consecutively, and that the
                    custodial sentences for Charges 3 to 7 are to run concurrently with the
                    sentences for the first two charges. In effect, the accused has to serve
                    imprisonment for 27 years and suffer 20 strokes of the cane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The minimum sentence for Charge 1 is 20
                    years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes. The minimum sentence was not imposed
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the accused was actually importing
                        30.91 grams of diamorphine, which was more than twice the quantity that
                        would have brought on the mandatory death sentence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was an absence of any real
                        extenuating circumstances for the commission of the
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The sentence of 22 years, two years above the
                    minimum and eight years below the maximum sentence, is appropriate and cannot be
                    considered to be excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Counsel had submitted that it was proper
                    “to consider the two importation offences as a single transaction for
                    sentencing purposes”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He was
                    referring to the “one transaction rule”. This rule is that where
                    two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all
                    sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than
                    consecutive –
                    <em>Kanagasuntharam v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 874 (“<em>Kanagasuntharam</em>”), per Yong Pung How CJ at [8]. However, Yong CJ noted that
                    difficulty may arise over what constitutes one transaction, and he also observed
                    that the rule is not absolute, and that its application is subject to the facts
                    of the case and the circumstances of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Does the one transaction rule apply to the two
                    importation offences in the present case? The accused was importing
                    methamphamine which belonged to him as a principal and he was also importing
                    diamorphine which did not belong to him as an agent of Eric for payment. He was
                    going to retain the methamphamine, but the diamorphine was to be collected from
                    him. While he had committed the two offences at the same time and at the same
                    place, it cannot be said that the two offences were parts of one
                    transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Under s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure
                    Code 2010 (No 15 of 2010) where the accused person is convicted of at least
                    three distinct offences, at least two of the sentences are to run consecutively.
                    As the accused had been convicted for seven distinct offences, I had to decide
                    how many sentences are to run consecutively and which sentences should run
                    consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The seven offences are divisible into two
                    groups by reference to the gravity of the offences and the lengths of the
                    prescribed sentences. The two importation offences fall into one group and the
                    other charges for the drug possession, drug consumption, and possession of the
                    utensils fall into the another group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I ordered that the first two sentences for the
                    importation offences are to run consecutively because drug importation is a
                    serious offence. When a person commits two such offences and they were not
                    committed in a single transaction, he should be punished for both of them. The
                    three-month and eight-month sentences for the less serious offences can run
                    concurrently with the two sentences for importation and be subsumed within the
                    consecutive sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The effective sentence must be checked against
                    two rules of sentencing, namely, the totality principle and the proportionality
                    principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In respect of the first rule, <em>Principles of Sentencing</em> DA Thomas (Heinemann,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1979) explained at pp 57 – 58
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate
                        sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most
                        serious of the individual offences involved, <b><em>or</em></b> if its effect is to impose on the offender ‘a
                        crushing sentence’ not in keeping with his record and
                        prospects.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and this principle was approved in <em>Kanagasuntharam</em> and <em>Jeffery bin Abdullah v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 414
                        (“<em>Jeffery bin Abdullah</em>
                    ”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The effective sentence of 27 years is not
                    substantially above the normal level of sentences for offences of importing or
                    trafficking in large quantities of drugs shown in the record of sentences
                    compiled by the prosecution. The sentence is also not a crushing sentence on the
                    accused who is 30 years old and with no health problems except gout and high
                    blood pressure. If he behaves himself in prison and obtains remission in his
                    sentence for good behaviour, he may serve 18 years, and could be released when
                    he is 48 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The proportionality principle was explained by
                    Chan Sek Keong CJ in <em>Jeffery bin Abdullah</em> (at
                        [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The proportionality principle requires that the overall sentence imposed
                        on an offender should be based on his total culpability in the various
                        offences committed, when viewed as a whole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the present case, the accused had rendered
                    his services to Eric to import a substantial quantity of diamorphine from Johor
                    Bahru into Singapore. In addition to that, he was importing methamphetamine into
                    Singapore on his own account, he was consuming drugs, and he had other drugs in
                    his residence and was in possession of utensils for drug consumption. He was
                    fortunate that the prosecution reduced the quantity of diamorphine in Charge 1
                    so that the capital punishment would not be imposed. Looking at all the
                    circumstances, an effective sentence of 27 years imprisonment is not
                    disproportionate to the accused’s total culpability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The accused has appealed against the sentences
                    imposed as being excessive.</p>
