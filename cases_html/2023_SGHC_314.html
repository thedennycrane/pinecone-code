The Original Action involves a claim by the plaintiffs against the defendants for a declaration that, upon the demise of the late Dr Khoo Boo Kwee (“Dr Khoo”) on 21 January 2021, the defendants hold the entire balance of the moneys in two joint accounts totalling approximately some $4,000,000 on resulting trust for Dr Khoo’s estate, along with other consequential relief. In the Counterclaim, the defendants are suing the plaintiffs and one Khoo Teng Jin (“Teng Jin”) for a declaration that the defendants jointly hold the legal and beneficial interest to the entire balance of the moneys in the said joint accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The parties to this suit are the surviving spouse and children of the late Dr Khoo, who had been a practising doctor for many years. He was a general practitioner who ran his own clinic, initially at Rochor and later at Whampoa, until he retired at around the age of 65 years.

</div> Dr Khoo kept his savings in the two joint accounts which form the subject of the present dispute. In his will dated 10 August 2012, he provided that, upon his death, the moneys in the aforesaid accounts would be distributed among his four children in equal shares. It is common ground between the parties that the late Dr Khoo was a highly educated man, highly literate in the English language and careful to keep his affairs in order, as the evidence below will show. Unfortunately, upon Dr Khoo’s demise on 21 January 2021, an intractable dispute arose as to whether ownership of the moneys in the two joint accounts passed to the defendants by operation of the right of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The late Dr Khoo was married to Ng Eu Lin Evelyn (“Evelyn”), the second defendant, and together, they had four children:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first plaintiff is Khoo Phaik Eng Katherine (“Katherine”), the youngest daughter.

For convenience, I refer to these two accounts collectively as the “Joint Accounts”. Strictly speaking, a bank account is a chose in action; “a contractual recognition by the bank that the account-holder has deposited money with it and that the bank is required to return that money to the customer in accordance with the terms of their contract” (<span class="font-italic">MF Global Singapore Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and others v Vintage Bullion DMCC (in its own capacity and as representative of the customers of the first plaintiff) and another </span><span class="font-italic">matter </span>[2015] 4 SLR 831 at [51], citing Alastair Hudson, <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span> (Routledge, 8th Ed, 2015) at p 1294). As the authors of E P Ellinger, E Lomnicka &amp; C Hare, <span class="font-italic">Ellinger’s Modern Banking Law </span>(Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2011) point out (at p 324), the proper issue where one of the holders of a joint account dies is not the ownership of the funds as such, which remains with the bank from the time of deposit. Rather, what is at stake is <span class="font-italic">the right to</span> <span class="font-italic">the chose in action </span>that entitled the account holder to draw upon the credit balance or to instruct the bank to make payments from the joint account. Nonetheless, the parties in their submissions consistently refer to the ownership of the “moneys in the Joint Accounts” and I accept that this phrase can be used as a convenient shorthand which also accords with the layperson’s understanding of what happens when he deposits moneys in a bank account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Defendants were added as co-account holders of the Joint Accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In October 2019, Dr Khoo was diagnosed with liver cancer.

</div> According to the Defendants, Dr Khoo informed the UOB officer at the bank that he wished to convert the FD Account to be held in the joint names of Patricia, Evelyn and himself. The UOB officer then explained the difference between a “Joint-Alternate” or “Joint-All” account. The former would allow any of the co-account holders to operate the account independently, whereas the latter would require the approval of all co-account holders to approve a transaction before it could be effected. Following an interview with the UOB officer to confirm Dr Khoo’s instructions, the FD Account was converted into a “Joint-Alternate” account, with Patricia and Evelyn added as co-account holders alongside Dr Khoo.

</div> Although Dr Khoo had converted the FD Account and POSB Account into joint accounts, counsel for the Plaintiffs submits that there is no evidence to support a clear intention from Dr Khoo to gift the moneys in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants as the joint account holders. Substantial weight should be accorded to the fact that the material terms of the Will relating to the distribution of moneys in the Joint Accounts were not amended by Dr Khoo in his Codicil. Counsel also submits that the presence of a survivorship clause in the banks’ terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts should not be a decisive factor in determining whether the right of survivorship applies.

</div> As for the Defendants’ evidence that Patricia was Dr Khoo’s favourite child, having demonstrated a willingness to take care of her parents and that Dr Khoo wanted to provide financial support for Evelyn in her twilight years, counsel points out that the majority of the Defendants’ evidence in relation to Dr Khoo’s feelings or opinions of his children were based on what <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Defendants had perceived</span> from his actions or expressions.

This is because there was a transfer of property to Patricia and Evelyn for which they had not provided any consideration and the moneys in the Joint Accounts were contributed solely by Dr Khoo. Furthermore, the presumption of advancement applies but is rebutted by the evidence which shows that, while Dr Khoo was alive, he had full and complete dominion over the moneys in the Joint Accounts<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>and used the moneys primarily for himself.

</div> The presumption of advancement applies but it is a weak one. Evelyn was not financially dependent on Dr Khoo and, in fact, receives a monthly pension of $2,100 and a monthly rental income of $7,000 from a commercial shophouse property that she inherited from her parents. Furthermore, the Defendants’ claims that Evelyn and Dr Khoo’s marriage was a loving one and that Patricia was the “closest” to Dr Khoo are overstated. In any event, counsel for Teng Jin submits that the (weak) presumption of advancement is easily rebutted on the facts.

</div> In that case, an issue arose as to whether ownership of moneys in bank accounts held in the joint names of Mr Yang and his wife, Mdm Sun, passed to Mdm Sun by operation of the right of survivorship upon Mr Yang’s death (<span class="font-italic">Yang Chun </span>at [50] and [51]). Ang Cheng Hock JC (as he was then) found that Mr Yang and Mdm Sun had made unequal contributions to the joint accounts (<span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span> at [70]). Ang JC affirmed that the principles of survivorship are equally applicable to joint bank accounts, citing the decision of Warren L H Khoo J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Pow v Tan Seng </span><span class="font-italic">Hock </span>[1992] SGHC 104 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Seng Pow</span>”), and held that the operation of the right of survivorship turned on the following successive stages of analysis (<span class="font-italic">Yang Chun </span>at [53]–[55], [57]–[58], [61] and [64]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, citing the grounds of decision of Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Collars Muriel Esther de Jesus v Sandra Audrey Jude </span><span class="font-italic">Collars</span> [2008] SGHC 110 at [30], in the case of a joint bank account, there is a presumption that the survivor(s) takes the whole of the benefit of the account in the absence of a contrary intention. The onus would be on the person challenging the right of survivorship to demonstrate a contrary intention.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where such a contrary intention can be shown, the rule of survivorship may be displaced by a resulting trust or a presumed resulting trust. A resulting trust will arise where there is evidence of a clear intention on the part of the deceased to retain beneficial ownership of the joint account. On the other hand, the presumption of resulting trust will operate where there has been a transfer of property to the survivor(s) for which the survivor(s) has not provided the whole of the consideration (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye </span><span class="font-italic">Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [35]) and there is no evidence before the court which “adequately reveals the true intention of the transferor” (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel </span><span class="font-italic">Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”) at [79]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the presumption of resulting trust arises, the deceased’s lack of intention to benefit the survivor(s) is <span class="font-italic">inferred</span>. The burden of proof shifts such that the deceased is presumed to have intended to retain the beneficial ownership of the property. Ang JC further noted that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>had made it clear that the presumption of resulting trust “should not be applied mechanically” and that the strength of the presumption must be accorded varying weight, depending on the particular circumstances of each case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Next, Ang JC pointed out that the presumption of resulting trust, being a rebuttable presumption in cases where it arises, is capable of being rebutted in certain circumstances where the transferor may be regarded as having made a gift to the recipient, with no intention to retain an interest in the property concerned. This is the presumption of advancement, which is only relevant where a presumed resulting trust has already been found on the facts (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [57]). If applicable, the presumption of advancement shifts the burden of proof <span class="font-italic">back</span> to the party who challenges the transfer to the surviving recipient.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In respect of the application of the presumption of advancement, Ang JC also highlighted the Court of Appeal’s view in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> that, as with the presumption of resulting trust, so too the strength of the presumption of advancement would vary according to the individual circumstances of each case (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [77]). This “would allow a court to more accurately give effect to the parties’ intentions”. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> endorsed a fact-sensitive inquiry, with two key elements that guide this inquiry: (a) first, the nature of the relationship between the parties, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the obligation that one party has to the other; and (b) second, the state of the relationship, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the parties were in a close or distant relationship. Based on the weight of the evidence, the court will determine if the presumption of advancement has been successfully rebutted. If the challenging party succeeds in defeating the presumption of advancement, then the original presumption of resulting trust will operate. Conversely, if the challenging party fails, the presumption of advancement will displace the presumption of resulting trust and the right of survivorship shall take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal noted that the presumption of advancement comes into play to displace the presumption of resulting trust where there is a pre-existing relationship between the parties which falls into one of the established categories of relationships. Such recognised categories of relationships include transfers from husband to wife, and from father to child (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [60] and [107]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Woon Chun (administratrix of the estate of Ho Fook Tuck, deceased) v Wang Kai Qing </span>[2023] SGHC 115, Mavis Chionh J further observed (at [51]) that in applying the analytical approach set out by Ang JC in <span class="font-italic">Yang Chun</span>, it is also important to bear in mind the Court of Appeal’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong </span><span class="font-italic">Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) (at [52]) that “the question in every case where the claim is based on the existence of a resulting trust is still whether there is any direct <span class="font-italic">evidence that may adequately reveal the intention of the transferor</span>” [emphasis in original]. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> endorsed the reasoning of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Peng</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 (“<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span>”). In that case, the High Court found that it was not necessary to make use of presumptions such as the presumption of resulting trust because it was satisfied on the basis of the evidence before it that the deceased had intended to give the moneys in the joint bank account to the defendant. In so finding, the court observed (at [116]) (and its observations were cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If the court could discern a clear intention on the part of the deceased to gift all the moneys in the joint account to the survivor from the evidence before it, then there should be no need to apply any presumption of a resulting trust to aid the fact-finding or decision-making process. <span class="font-italic">Only when the court is not able to find any clear intention or if the evidence is inconclusive either way as to what the deceased’s real intention might be, then in this rather limited and exceptional situation</span> (where the evidence is so finely balanced on either side) <span class="font-italic">should the court apply the evidential presumption of a resulting trust to tilt the balance in favour of the estate of the deceased</span> (who solely contributed the moneys in joint account).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My finding: there is clear evidence that Dr Khoo intended to retain the beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts at the material time</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Bearing the above principles in mind, I first consider whether there is clear evidence of Dr Khoo’s actual intention at the time of the conversion of the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The banks’ terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Defendants submit that the FD Account is governed by the UOB Terms and Conditions and that the POSB Account is governed by the DBS Terms and Conditions, and these terms and conditions incorporate the right of survivorship at common law.

This may be reinforced, if there exist bank documents which prescribe and declare the operation of survivorship in relation to the joint account; such documents could constitute cogent evidence of the parties’ intention that the absolute benefit of the account should devolve to the surviving joint account-holder. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nevertheless, this needs to be assessed in relation to the factual matrix</span>; see <span class="font-italic">Low</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic">Gim</span><span class="font-italic"> Siah</span> … at [51].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Owing to the reliance placed by the Defendants on the banks’ respective terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts, it is instructive to be reminded of the legal principles in relation to such documents. When a person opens an account with a bank, he enters into a contract with that bank. Their relationship will be determined by the terms of that contract by which the account holders agree to abide. It is therefore well-settled that <span class="font-italic">the bank’s</span> legal obligations in the opening of a joint account are governed by the terms of the contract between the bank and the joint account holders: Poh Chu Chai, <span class="font-italic">Law of Banker and Customer </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2016) at p 225.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Where the bank’s terms and conditions provide for the right of survivorship, the survivorship clause must be interpreted by giving it its plain meaning. Case authority has, however, established that a survivorship clause without more is a <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> arrangement between the bank and the joint account holders as to how to deal with the moneys in a joint account and, therefore, <span class="font-italic">not</span> conclusive evidence of the parties’ intention as to ownership of the moneys in the joint account. In <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah and others v Low Geok Khim and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 (“<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah</span>”), the Court of Appeal cited with approval the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Saylor v Madsen </span><span class="font-italic">Estate </span>(2006) 261 DLR (4th) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Saylor</span>”). The facts of <span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>can be stated simply: the father, who died in 1998, had made one of his daughters (“Ms Brooks”) a joint signatory to his bank accounts, which provided for a right of survivorship. In September 1997, the joint accounts were closed, and the funds deposited into an investment account, which again was a joint account with Ms Brooks and had a right of survivorship (<span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>at [10]). During the father’s lifetime, Ms Brooks did not deposit any of her own moneys into the accounts and only drew out cheques on her father’s directions (<span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>at [33]). The issue was whether the father had intended to make a gift of that moneys to Ms Brooks or whether he intended to remain the beneficial owner of it (<span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>at [11]). The Ontario Court of Appeal, in upholding the trial judge’s finding that no gift to Ms Brooks had been intended, considered that the probative value of bank documents could only be ascertained after an assessment of the totality of the relevant evidence (<span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>at [27], [40]–[41]). As the case demonstrated, such bank documents do not always provide accurate evidence of the parties’ intentions. In this regard, I find helpful the approach as stated by LaForme JA (<span class="font-italic">Saylor </span>at [27] and [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[27] Bank documents can be strong evidence of a party’s intention at the time the parties signed them. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I do not, however, agree that the bank documents should be assigned presumptive value when trying to determine a party’s intention</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The probative value of such documents, like any other relevant evidence, can only be ascertained after an assessment of the totality of the relevant evidence.

Nevertheless, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the weight to be assigned to such documents in any given case must be left to the trier of fact.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The above approach is aptly illustrated by the factual matrix in <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah</span>, which was referred to in the passage from <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, as<span class="font-italic"> </span>cited by the Defendants (at [44] above). In <span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah</span>, the deceased (“LKT”), had held six bank accounts jointly with one of his sons (“LGB”), during his lifetime (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah</span> at [1]). The joint accounts each provided for the right of survivorship and stipulated that either co-account holder’s signature was sufficient to operate the accounts (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah </span>at [9] and [10]). Nonetheless, the evidence showed that LKT made sure that only he could draw on the joint accounts (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah</span> at [49]). The Court of Appeal thus found that LKT had retained full and complete dominion throughout his life over the moneys in the six joint accounts, and this fact of absolute dominion was sufficient to rebut the presumption that LKT intended for LGB to have the moneys in the joint accounts upon his death (<span class="font-italic">Low </span><span class="font-italic">Gim Siah </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In a similar vein, in relation to transfer documents generally, it was pertinently observed by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin (as the sole executrix of the estate of Lim Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Heong, deceased) v Lim Sai Ing Peggy </span>[2022] 1 SLR 873 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span>”) that “our courts have previously found that properties were held on trust for the transferor <span class="font-italic">in the face of</span> transfer documents suggesting that the transfer had been intended as a gift” [emphasis added] (at [11]). In <span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin</span>, the sole registered proprietor of a flat (“Mr Lim”) had transferred the flat to himself and his daughter (“LSI”) as joint tenants (at [2]). The sole executrix of LGH’s estate (“LCH”) brought an application seeking a declaration that LSI held the flat on trust for Mr Lim’s estate (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin </span>at [1]). At first instance, the trial judge relied in particular on a stamp on the Title Deed which reflected that the 1981 Transfer had taken place, and which stated that the flat had been “TRANSFER[RED] TO [LSI] (<span class="font-underline">BY GIFT</span>) AND [MR LIM] AS JOINT TENANTS OF THE WITHIN LEASEHOLD ESTATE” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin </span>at [10]). On appeal, the Appellate Division of the High Court disagreed, stating that whilst these transfer documents are contemporaneous records, they could hardly be said to be <span class="font-italic">conclusive </span>of the transferor’s actual intent or state of mind at the material time (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin </span>at [11]). Furthermore, the importance of considering the circumstantial evidence in that case was reinforced by the fact that Mr Lim, being deceased, was no longer able to provide direct evidence of his own intentions (<span class="font-italic">Lim Choo Hin </span>at [12]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I would add also that a bank is only concerned with its obligations and liabilities to the customer. It is not typically concerned with the identity of the person <span class="font-italic">beneficially entitled</span> to the chose in action that is the joint account. This is rightly so, as such an undertaking may increase the costs to the bank of providing such a service. Hence, in the standard terms considered at [12] above, UOB bank reserves the right to “take such steps [it] deem[s] appropriate including paying the credit balance in the [FD Account] into a court”. Hence, while the fact of adding a person as a joint account holder may be evidence of an intention of a gift, it is not determinative of that intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Bearing the above principles in mind, I am satisfied, for the reasons stated at [59] and [67] below, after considering the totality of the evidence in this case, that the banks’ terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts are not conclusive of Dr Khoo’s state of mind at the material time. The Codicil was executed just 11 days after the conversion of the Joint Accounts and made it plain that Dr Khoo continued to treat the moneys in the Joint Accounts as <span class="font-italic">his </span>moneys to be bequeathed under the Will and Codicil.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The undisputed chronology of events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There is no dispute between the parties as to the chronology of the following material facts (the “Material Chronology”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Dr Khoo executed the Will on 10 August 2012;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Dr Khoo was diagnosed with liver cancer in October 2019;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Patricia and Evelyn were added as co-account holders of the FD Account and the POSB Account on 7 November 2019, with the signature of any one co-account holder being sufficient for the operation of the Joint Accounts; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Dr Khoo executed the Codicil on 18 November 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conversion of the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Defendants’ case on these events is that Dr Khoo’s conversion of the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019 showed his intention to gift the entirety of the beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants upon his demise. There is no direct evidence that Dr Khoo expressly stated his intention as such, but the Defendants rely on the cumulative weight of the circumstantial evidence as follows. Dr Khoo’s trip to the UOB Parkway Parade Branch on 7 November 2019 was “out of the ordinary” as Dr Khoo typically would only visit UOB for the purpose of renewing his fixed deposits when they were due to mature. None of Dr Khoo’s fixed deposits with UOB were maturing or due for renewal on or around that date, and the Defendants submit that the trip was specifically arranged by Dr Khoo for the sole purpose of converting the Joint Accounts.

</div>
</div> However, I note that this was <span class="font-italic">Patricia’s account </span>of what Dr Khoo had stated. It is unclear what Dr Khoo meant by the word “it”, whether he intended this to be a definitive statement of intent, and whether Dr Khoo was even referring to the POSB Passbook, the fixed deposit slips and/or the moneys in the Joint Accounts. I therefore do not give this piece of evidence (“[i]t’s yours”) considerable weight in the light of the clear and compelling evidence suggesting otherwise (see [59] and [67] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In my view, the conversion of the Joint Accounts was, by itself, a neutral factor. Whilst this could be consistent with an intention to gift the beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts to the co-account holders (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Defendants), it could also be equally consistent with Dr Khoo’s intention for the Defendants to assist Dr Khoo in the administration of his medical expenses from the Joint Accounts. To adopt a loose analogy, it would be akin to a person, X, keeping moneys in a safe which can be unlocked by either of two keys. The fact that X hands over one key to Y, in circumstances which suggested that X was aware of his deteriorating health, such that X might not be able to access the safe as readily as before, does not necessarily mean that X intended to <span class="font-italic">gift </span>Y the moneys in the safe. Whilst, of course, there is a conceptual difference between moneys in a safe and a bank account (the latter of which is a chose in action), it appears to me that employing a loose proprietary analogy for the purposes of ascertaining X’s state of mind nonetheless accords with the layperson’s view of what he does when he opens a bank account, which for most people, is to store his moneys. This was certainly the case for Dr Khoo, who kept his life savings in the Joint Accounts. In the present case, the latter explanation (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, administrative convenience) was certainly <span class="font-italic">plausible </span>and cannot be ruled out<span class="font-italic"> </span>in light of Dr Khoo’s cancer diagnosis in October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Defendants rely on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span>, where Chan Seng Onn J, as he then was, found that the deceased (“Bee Bee”) had intended to give the moneys in her joint account to the co-account holder defendant (at [128]–[129]). Chan J gave “considerable weight” to Bee Bee’s “deliberate and considered action” to include the defendant as a joint signatory and to convert her UOB account into a joint account with the defendant on 25 June 2004 (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [102]). The defendant was Bee Bee’s boyfriend and co-habitant during her lifetime, and the “second love of [Bee Bee’s] life” (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [1] and [109]). Chan J also considered that the banks’ terms and conditions providing for the right of survivorship, which both the defendant and Bee Bee agreed to, constituted “very strong evidence of what Bee Bee’s true intentions were, namely that he, the defendant, was to have the money beneficially if he survived her” (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 However, the outcome in <span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span> must be considered in the context of its factual matrix. It is relevant that Bee Bee’s “deliberate and considered action” to convert the joint account on 25 June 2004 was <span class="font-italic">five years </span>after her second will was executed, in which Bee Bee had left all her real and personal property to the plaintiff upon her death (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [29]). The plaintiff was Bee Bee’s nephew, and he gave evidence that Bee Bee had always looked after him as her son. They evidently shared a close relationship as Bee Bee and her ex-husband (“Michael”) did not have any children of their own and she effectively adopted the plaintiff as her godson (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [5] and [10]). Crucially, Chan J stressed that at the time that Bee Bee executed her second will on 16 November 1999, the defendant had yet to enter her life (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim </span>at [29]). However, the personal situation of Bee Bee “changed substantially” after the second will and Chan J was alive to the possibility that, if Bee Bee had a change of intention on how her moneys should be distributed, “changing her will was not the only course open to [Bee Bee] and she could always, for example, make an <span class="font-italic">inter </span><span class="font-italic">vivos </span>gift” (<span class="font-italic">Kelvin Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [31]). In the circumstances, it must also be borne in mind that Bee Bee did not take any other step <span class="font-italic">relevant to </span>her testamentary intention in relation to the joint account <span class="font-italic">after </span>the conversion of the said account on 25 June 2004.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Two key features of the present case are, therefore, the Material Chronology and the terms of the Codicil. These provide important context to the conversion of the Joint Accounts and make it abundantly clear that Dr Khoo intended for the moneys in the Joint Accounts to form part of his Estate. Whilst I considered the possibility that Dr Khoo could have had a change of intention in November 2019, as submitted by the Defendants, it is highly significant that the Codicil was executed just 11 days after and, on the Defendants’ own case and evidence, in circumstances where Dr Khoo’s attention had been brought to the material terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts and what they meant (see [15] above). I therefore turn to consider the terms of the Codicil in greater detail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The terms of the Codicil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 A codicil is executed for the purpose of adding to, varying or revoking the provisions of a will that was previously made: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 15 (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) at para 190.165. By the Codicil executed on 18 November 2019, Dr Khoo made several amendments to his Will (as set out at [16(a)]–[16(f)] above). Insofar as the distribution of the moneys in the Joint Accounts is concerned, the relevant amendments to the Will are set out at: (a)<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>cl 1.4.2 of the Codicil, to direct that the Cash Gift be taken out “from the total amount of [Dr Khoo’s] fixed deposits” and be paid to Evelyn as a cash gift; and (b) cl 1.4.4 of the Codicil, to update that the business of POSB Siglap Branch had since been taken over by POSB Marine Parade Branch. Significantly, Dr Khoo did not amend the Will <span class="font-italic">to remove </span>the inclusion of the Joint Accounts for distribution to his four children in equal shares under Schedule A of his Will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I therefore find that the plain meaning of cl 1.4.2 of the Codicil affirms Dr Khoo’s expressed intention, under cl 5(1) read with Schedule A of the Will, to distribute the moneys in the Joint Accounts to his four children in equal shares. In specifying that the Cash Gift be paid to Evelyn as a gift, it shows that he considered, 11 days after changing the accounts to joint accounts, that the entirety of the $4,080,000 was his to dispose of. In a similar vein, in the terms of the Codicil, Dr Khoo continued to refer to the moneys in the Joint Accounts as “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">my</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>total fixed deposits of $4,080,000.000” and “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">my</span> fixed deposits” [emphasis added in bold italics] (cl 1.4.2 of the Codicil). Therefore, despite the Defendants’ evidence that Dr Khoo was aware of the survivorship clauses in the banks’ terms and conditions governing the Joint Accounts (see [15] and [57] above), the plain meaning of the Codicil and the fact that it was executed only 11 days after the conversion of the Joint Accounts <span class="font-italic">clearly indicates</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that Dr Khoo intended to retain all beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts at the material time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In response to this, counsel for the Defendants places weight on Evelyn’s explanation of the events leading up to the Cash Gift. In early November 2019, in the midst of four private discussions between Patricia and Dr Khoo regarding Dr Khoo’s “testamentary wishes” (the “Four Discussions”),

</div> Patricia informed Evelyn that Dr Khoo intended to make changes to his Will, but that Evelyn did not have to worry as she would be allowed to continue living in the Property until her death. Evelyn replied that she wished to see Dr Khoo’s Will. After obtaining Dr Khoo’s permission to do so, Patricia then showed Evelyn the Will.

</div> Evelyn explained that when she saw that the list of figures in the Will totalling $4,080,000, she suggested to Dr Khoo that he give her a sum of $80,000, which he agreed to. At the time, Evelyn had not known that Dr Khoo intended to convert the FD Account into a joint bank account. Relying on these events, counsel for the Defendants submits that Dr Khoo acceding to Evelyn’s “relatively modest” request for $80,000 was intended to be a symbolic gesture and to make clear to Patricia that whatever plans she may have for the moneys in the Joint Account, at least $80,000 should be set aside for Evelyn.

In fact, the organised and meticulous manner in which Dr Khoo handled his affairs, especially in matters concerning his assets and what would become of them after his death, was demonstrated through the Defendants’ <span class="font-italic">own </span>evidence on the Four Discussions. The Four Discussions, to which only Patricia (out of all the parties) was privy to, also suggest that Dr Khoo had formed the requisite intention to amend his Will several days <span class="font-italic">before</span> his act of converting the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019. These Four Discussions took place between 3 and 6 November 2019. Patricia’s evidence is that at the first discussion on 3 November 2019, Dr Khoo told Patricia that he wanted the Property to be kept in the family as he had received it as a gift from his mother. He also told Patricia that he wanted Evelyn to be able to live comfortably in the Property for the rest of her life with Patricia as her primary caregiver. Patricia expressed that she was keen to buy the Property as it was of great sentimental value to her, but she was worried that she might not have sufficient means and funds to purchase it. In response, Dr Khoo then stated that he would “<span class="font-italic">help</span> [Patricia]” [emphasis added].

Dr Khoo then instructed Patricia to reach out to his lawyer, Mr Ching, to make the following amendments to the Will: (a) to remove Joyce as a joint co-executrix of his Will; and (b) that upon Dr Khoo’s passing, the Property would be sold to Patricia at a price that is the average of two valuations and that Evelyn would be allowed to stay at the Property for as long as she wished or until her demise.

</div> There were no ifs and buts, so to speak, especially in matters concerning the distribution of his assets. Dr Khoo took care to instruct Patricia to make the necessary arrangements to carry out the changes in his testamentary wishes, and followed up with her on whether his instructions had been carried out. For instance, at the third discussion on 5 November 2019, Dr Khoo reviewed the wording of the Draft Letter that Patricia had prepared before instructing Patricia to print it out so that he could sign it in the presence of Dr Robert Lim (“Dr Lim”), an oncologist who had been treating Dr Khoo at that time.

It is significant that Dr Khoo made no mention during the course of the Four Discussions that the moneys in the Joint Accounts should be gifted to the Defendants upon his demise, nor did he exclude the Joint Accounts from the schedule of assets in his Will. There was likewise no mention of these changes by Dr Khoo in his Draft Letter. These facts support the contention that Dr Khoo did not intend to gift the entirety of the moneys in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Four Discussions indicate that Dr Khoo had already formed the intention to execute the Codicil between 3 and 6 November 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> before he took the step of converting the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019), and this is consistent with my finding that Dr Khoo did not intend to <span class="font-italic">gift </span>the entirety of the moneys in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants upon his demise. I reiterate that Dr Khoo’s fourth discussion with Patricia specified <span class="font-italic">carving out </span>the Cash Gift of $80,000 from the moneys in the FD Account. This suggests that, up until 6 November 2019 at the least, Dr Khoo had every intention that the moneys in the FD Account be distributed upon his death in the manner he had stated in the Will. I accept the submission that it is nothing short of incredible that Dr Khoo might have abruptly changed his mind the very next day during the bank visits and decided to <span class="font-italic">gift </span>the entirety of the moneys in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants.

It is also clear that other than the Property, the moneys in the Joint Accounts formed the most substantial part of Dr Khoo’s assets for distribution upon his death.

By November 2019, Dr Khoo was diagnosed with liver cancer. Patricia had by that time assumed the responsibility of being the primary caregiver for both of her parents. It was also Patricia’s evidence that subsequent to the conversion of the Joint Accounts, the funds in the POSB Account had been used to pay for Dr Khoo’s ongoing medical expenses, as well as daily and household expenses incurred by her parents. Patricia deposed that on or around 12 October 2020, a significant sum of $180,332.88 had been withdrawn from the fixed deposits in anticipation of nine upcoming sessions of cancer treatment for Dr Khoo.

</div>
</div> This therefore broadly corroborated the Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ evidence of Teng Jin’s estrangement from Dr Khoo since 2006 and, in any event, <span class="font-italic">before </span>the Will was executed in August 2012. That Dr Khoo still made provision under his Will for Teng Jin to receive an <span class="font-italic">equal share </span>in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the moneys in the Joint Accounts, and further, failed to modify this position by the terms of the Codicil, therefore showed that even if there was estrangement between them, this did not affect Dr Khoo’s intention to benefit his son after his death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In light of the aforesaid, it is unnecessary to consider the various allegations centred on Dr Khoo’s relationship with the parties, which scandalise, rather than assist, in the conclusion to be drawn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For completeness, however, I add that <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the Defendants’ case is taken at its highest and Dr Khoo did favour Patricia over his other children, I accept that the right to purchase the Property given to Patricia and/or her own family nominees <span class="font-italic">and</span> to do so within a generous time frame (see cl 1.2.1 of the Codicil) was an additional benefit conferred on Patricia that was not afforded to any of Dr Khoo’s other children. This would also be consistent with Patricia’s evidence that Dr Khoo had told her that he would “help” her to purchase the Property (see [61] above). I understand this term to mean, in the light of the totality of the evidence, that Dr Khoo was referring to the additional benefits given to Patricia and/or her own family nominees under cl 1.2.1 of the Codicil in respect of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In conclusion, I am satisfied that the totality of the evidence shows clearly that Dr Khoo did not intend to gift the beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts to the Defendants at the material time. Bearing the above principles at [40]–[42] in mind, a resulting trust therefore arises in favour of the Estate. It follows that the parties challenging the right of survivorship, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Plaintiffs, have discharged the burden of showing a contrary intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Furthermore, as I have found that there is direct evidence which clearly and adequately reveals the intention of the transferor, it is unnecessary in the circumstances to resort to the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement (see the principles cited at [40(b)], [40(d)] and [42] above). In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the presumptions of resulting trust and advancement are “no more than a long stop to provide the answer when the relevant facts and circumstances fail to yield a solution”, and should be treated as “an evidential instrument of last resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties” (citing the statements in <span class="font-italic">Vandervell</span><span class="font-italic"> v Inland Revenue Commissioners</span> [1967] 2 AC 291 at 313 and <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan </span><span class="font-italic">Yew </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 at [29]) (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 At the time of Dr Khoo’s death, the Defendants therefore hold the moneys in the Joint Accounts on resulting trust for the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">If the presumption of resulting trust arises in favour of the Estate, whether a presumption of advancement applies in favour of the Defendants and rebuts it</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the interests of completeness, I add that even if I am wrong in reaching the above conclusion that there is clear evidence of Dr Khoo’s actual intentions at the material time, I would nonetheless hold that the presumption of resulting trust arises in favour of the Estate and is not rebutted. The parties do not dispute the gratuitous nature of the conversion of the Joint Accounts on 7 November 2019 or that the moneys in the Joint Accounts were solely contributed by Dr Khoo. Whilst the presumption of advancement arises in favour of the Defendants, I would hold that it is rebutted by the clear words of the Will and the Codicil to the contrary, for the same reasons as stated at [58]–[67] above. In any event, I find that Dr Khoo did not consider himself to be morally or legally obliged to provide for Evelyn in any way as seen by the matters stated at [84] below and the presumption of advancement in favour of Evelyn is weak.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Addenda: The Will and Codicil are silent on how the Property and/or its sale proceeds should be dealt with if Evelyn chooses to stay on until her demise</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Clause 4(2) of the Will provides that the Property shall be sold, and the sale proceeds distributed equally among Evelyn and the four children only in the event that Evelyn “moves out of [the Property] on her own volition”. Whilst cl 5(1) of the Will provides that Dr Khoo’s residuary estate is to be bequeathed to his four children equally, cl 4(3) of the Will unequivocally states that the Property does not form part of the residuary estate.

</div> Aside from the $80,000 Cash Gift, Evelyn would receive 20% of the sale proceeds of the Property <span class="font-italic">only if</span> she moves out of her own volition. She receives no other share of the residuary estate. The Defendants assert that Evelyn was Dr Khoo’s “beloved wife” and that Dr Khoo knew that she would not be able to afford home-based nursing care and other medical expenses without additional financial support. Whilst she has a civil service card which subsidises the costs of certain medical expenses, the Defendants say that this would be insufficient to cover home-based nursing care.

</div>
</div> These suggest to me that Dr Khoo was not concerned about Evelyn’s financial state after his death and did not intend to make financial provision for Evelyn beyond the $80,000 Cash Gift which she had specifically requested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As to the question of how the Property and/or its sale proceeds should be dealt with <span class="font-italic">if</span> Evelyn chooses to stay on until her demise, I make some brief observations, although I emphasise that this particular issue was not in dispute before me. Dr Khoo was the sole owner of the Property. The Will and Codicil do not deal with the situation where Evelyn chooses not to move out of the Property on her own volition before her demise <span class="font-italic">and </span>cl 4(3) of the Will expressly excludes the Property from distribution under the residuary clause. Thus, if Evelyn chooses not to move out of the Property before her demise, there arises a situation of partial intestacy and, upon Evelyn’s demise, the Property falls to be distributed according to the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed). It would therefore appear that the trustees of Dr Khoo’s Estate continue to hold the Property for as long as Evelyn chooses not to move out of it on her own volition.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In this case, sufficient evidence was placed before me and I am able, from the totality of the evidence, to make a factual finding that on the balance of probabilities, Dr Khoo intended to retain all beneficial interest in the Joint Accounts for himself at the material time and, upon his death, for the moneys in the Joint Accounts to be distributed in accordance with the terms of his Will and Codicil. The Defendants therefore hold the moneys in the Joint Accounts on resulting trust in favour of the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Finally, I note that the Plaintiffs have also sought a declaration and asked for certain orders in relation to the Will and Codicil Moneys and the Cash Balance. I do not think it is appropriate for me to make any orders on these items, as they appear to me to relate to matters involving the administration of the Estate and not the issue of beneficial entitlement to the moneys in the Joint Accounts <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Furthermore, I am satisfied that there is no dispute as to the Cash Balance (see [34] above) as well as the Will and Codicil Moneys, save for the dispute over the moneys in the Joint Accounts. As to the injunction sought by the Plaintiffs, there is no indication of any risk of the Defendants dispersing any of the Will and Codicil Moneys, including the moneys in the Joint Accounts, such as to justify the order. Lastly, as to the amount of interest sought by the Plaintiffs, I am satisfied that as between prayers (e), (f) and (j), it would be more just to grant an order in terms on prayer (e), save for the modification that interest is to be paid on the amount of the moneys in the Joint Accounts instead of the Will and Codicil Money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In conclusion, I allow in part the orders that the Plaintiffs are seeking and dismiss the Counterclaim. Therefore, I make the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration that the Defendants hold the balance of the moneys in the Joint Accounts as at the date of Dr Khoo’s death on trust for Dr Khoo’s Estate and the beneficiaries in the Will and Codicil.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An order that the Defendants return to the Estate all the documents and material with regard to the moneys in the Joint Accounts that are in the possession, power or control of Patricia.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An order that the Defendants give an account to the Estate of all moneys in the Joint Accounts as at the date of Dr Khoo’s death, and that the Defendants pay to the Estate such amount of the moneys in the Joint Account found to be due to the Estate forthwith.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) An order that the Defendants pay to the Estate interest on the amount of the moneys in the Joint Accounts found to be due to the Estate in the amount of interest that would have accrued if such moneys had been left in their respective accounts.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) An order that Patricia shall sign and submit the Schedule of Assets in P 226/2021 that includes the Joint Accounts to the FJC within two weeks from the date of this order, and that Patricia shall sign and submit an affidavit verifying the Schedule of Assets to the FJC within one week from the date of the FJC’s acceptance of the Schedule of Assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I will hear parties separately on the question of costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chung Ting Fai (Chung Ting Fai &amp; Co) for the first and second plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Marina Chin SC, Alcina Chew and Natalie Ng (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the first and second defendants;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Jaikanth Shankar, Stella Ng Yu Xin and Waverly Seong (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) (instructed), Chan Jer Hiang (Chan Jer Hiang &amp; Co) for the third defendant (by counterclaim).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
