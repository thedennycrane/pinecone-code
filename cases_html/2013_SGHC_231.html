<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Resource Piling Pte Ltd
                    (“Resource Piling”), carries on the business of a piling
                    contractor and also conducts related engineering works. The defendant, Geospecs
                    Pte Ltd (“Geospecs”), is a company which specialises in soil
                    investigation works, slope stabilisation, laboratory testing and related works.
                    Resource Piling is suing Geospecs in tort, alleging that Geospecs had
                    negligently carried out soil investigation works and had produced inaccurate
                    borehole logs which Resource Piling relied upon to tender for a piling
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The soil investigation contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       HH Properties Pte Ltd (“the
                    Developer”), wanted to develop two hotel blocks of 15 and 18-storeys, a
                    13-storey office block and basement car parks (“the Project”) on a
                    site between Balestier Road and Ah Hood Road, Lot 09941T Mukim 17 (“the
                    Site”). The Developer engaged Longrove &amp; Associates
                    (“Longrove”) as its consultant civil structural engineer and
                    Longrove required the usual soil information and data to design the foundations.
                    The Developer, through Longrove, called for tenders for the soil investigation.
                    On 15 June 2009, Geospecs submitted a tender to carry out the required soil
                    investigations works at the Site. On 7 July 2009, Longrove – on behalf of
                    the Developer – awarded the soil investigation contract to Geospecs for
                    the sum of $20,500 excluding GST and rock coring (“the Soil Investigation
                    Contract”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The site was divided into two plots by a reserve
                    along which the Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) line between Novena and
                    Toa Payoh stations ran. The larger polygonal plot lay to the West of the reserve
                    (“the Western Plot”) whilst the smaller polygonal plot lay to the
                    East (“the Eastern Plot”). Geospecs conducted a field exploration
                    programme from 20 August 2009 to 23 September 2009 and drilled a total of 11
                    boreholes on the Site, BH-1 to BH-11. On the Western Plot, BH-1 and BH-2 were to
                    the west with BH-1 to the north of BH-2. BH-3 and BH-4 were in the centre, with
                    BH-3 to the north of BH-4. BH-5, BH-6 and BH-7 were drilled in a line along the
                    eastern edge with BH-5 to the north and BH-7 to the south. On the smaller
                    Eastern Plot, BH-8 and BH-9 were on the western side with BH-8 to the north of
                    BH-9, and on the eastern side, BH-10 was to the north of BH-11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 29 September 2009, Geospecs submitted its
                    site investigation report (“the Report”) – which included
                    borehole logs for the 11 boreholes (“the Geospecs Logs”) and the
                    usual soil test data and analyses – to Longrove. The Geospecs Logs
                    indicated that rock was only encountered in two of the boreholes, BH-5 and BH-6
                    (which were at the North-eastern corner of the Western plot), at depths of
                    18.00m and 18.70m respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Piling Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 5 October 2009, Resource Piling received a
                    letter from Longrove inviting tenders for the piling work which called for bored
                    piles ranging from 600mm to 1200mm in diameter. The tender documents issued by
                    Longrove (“the Tender Documents”) contained the following general
                    specifications (“the General Specifications”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An extract of the Soil Investigation Report is enclosed in the Appendix
                        for information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Contractor should note that he has to satisfy himself as to the actual
                        type of strata, geotechnical nature of the underlying stratum and ground
                        conditions to be encountered during the works. It is to be at the risk of
                        the Contractor if difficult ground conditions are actually encountered on
                        the site.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a Contractor wishes to perform investigation, which may involve

                        his own expense and arrangement could be made with the Engineer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.10 <u>Obstructions</u></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An obstruction is defined as material the excavation of which requires
                        additional effort. Upon encountering an obstruction, the Contractor shall
                        immediately inform the Engineer and shall agree with the Engineer the method
                        to be employed in removing the obstruction.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.2.2 The Contractor shall satisfy himself regarding

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No claims for extra cost or time shall be entertained on these

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Geospecs Logs were included in the appendix to the Tender
                    Documents but the full Report including the soil test data and analyses were not
                    included. Resource Piling allegedly relied on the Geospecs Logs to calculate the
                    tender price and submitted its tender to the Developer on 21 October 2009, the
                    closing date for the tender, which was about 16 days after the date of the
                    invitation to tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Resource Piling was successful and the Developer
                    awarded the piling contract to Resource Piling for the sum of $3,608,488.41
                    (“the Piling Contract”) on 24 December 2009. The contract price
                    was calculated according to per metre rates based on the provisional lengths of
                    the bored piles. The material terms of the Piling Contract are set out below as

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The piling construction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in January 2010, prior to the
                    commencement of the piling works and in accordance with the Building and
                    Construction Authority’s (“BCA”) requirements, Resource
                    Piling drilled and constructed an ultimate test pile (“the UTP”).
                    The purpose of the UTP was to verify the pile design submitted by the project
                    engineer to the BCA as the UTP would be constructed and tested to at least 2.5
                    times of the working load under the pile design. Resource Piling drilled the UTP
                    somewhere near the vertical midpoint between BH-10 and BH-11, and discovered
                    that rock was encountered from 19.00m onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Upon the UTP performing satisfactorily, Resource
                    Piling proceeded to carry out the piling works, and claimed to have encountered
                    ground conditions that were materially different from the conditions indicated
                    in the Geospecs Logs. Resource Piling subsequently engaged Soil &amp; Foundation
                    Pte Ltd (“S &amp; F”) sometime around March or April 2010 to
                    conduct additional soil investigation works on the Site. Three additional
                    boreholes, NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3, were drilled. The soil investigation report
                    prepared by S &amp; F dated 22 April 2010 (the “S &amp; F Report”)
                    indicated the presence of rock in all three boreholes, which were located in the
                    vicinity of areas where, according to the Geospecs Logs, rock was unlikely to be
                    encountered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       During the course of the piling works, Resource
                    Piling claimed that it had encountered rock in 326 piles, or 77% of the piles
                    located in the areas where no rock was expected. Resource Piling averred that
                    the time taken for boring into rock was 10 to 20 times longer than the time
                    required for boring into soil and that it had to incur additional rock socketing
                    costs which it had not provided for in its original tender price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 4 September 2010, Mr Foo Hee Kang
                    (“Mr Foo”), the Managing Director of Resource Piling, wrote to the
                    Developer to request an extra payment of $1,188,554 for socketing into rock. Mr
                    Foo claimed that the original cost of socketing in the contract sum was
                    calculated on the basis of the ground conditions recorded in the Geospecs Logs,
                    which were subsequently verified by S &amp; F and found to be
                        inaccurate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Developer replied on 18
                    October 2010, rejecting Resource Piling’s claim on the basis that it was
                    not entitled to claim for the extra costs for rock socketing under the terms of
                    the Piling Contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Resource Piling wrote two letters to the
                    Developer on 27 October 2010, repeating its position that it had a contractual
                    right to the extra payment for socketing into rock and stressing that the
                    Geospecs Logs were “completely inaccurate”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In a letter dated 12 November 2010
                    from Longrove to Resource Piling certifying interim progress payments under the
                    Piling Contract, Longrove rejected Resource Piling’s “variation
                    claim” of $1,188,554 on the grounds that the contract price was inclusive
                    of any coring or socketing into rock and covered Resource Piling’s
                    obligations under the Piling Contract and all work and expenditure necessary to
                    carry out the works to completion; the contract sum was firm notwithstanding the
                    amount or quantity of work assigned to Resource Piling. Longrove further stated
                    that the Geospecs Logs had been provided to Resource Piling for information only
                    and Resource Piling was deemed to have inspected and examined the site –
                    any risks arising from the works were therefore to be borne by Resource
                        Piling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Sometime in November 2010, Resource Piling was
                    allegedly informed by one Mr Babu, the Project Manager of the Developer, that
                    Geospecs would be drilling two boreholes adjacent to BH-1 and BH-11, numbered
                    BH-1A and BH-11A respectively, to prove that the Geospecs Logs were accurate.
                    The drilling was done in the absence of a representative from Resource Piling.
                    The borehole logs for BH-1A and BH-11A did not differ materially from the
                    earlier Geospecs Logs for BH-1 and BH-11 and indicated that no rocks were
                    present in both boreholes up to a depth of 27.02m. Resource Piling subsequently
                    requested S &amp; F to drill another borehole about 0.567m away from BH-11A,
                    numbered BH-11B. This borehole log indicated the presence of rock from 21.50m
                    below the surface.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 21 December 2010, Resource Piling sent a
                    letter to the Developer stating that the soil profile indicated in the borehole
                    log for BH-11B was entirely different from those indicated in the borehole logs
                    prepared by Geospecs for BH-11 and BH-11A. Resource Piling requested an
                    explanation from Geospecs for the difference, and stated that if no explanation
                    was forthcoming, it would file an official report with the BCA that the Geospecs
                    Logs were completely wrong and a misrepresentation to Resource Piling at the
                    tendering stage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> On 24 December 2010,
                    Geospecs responded to the issues raised in Resource Piling’s letter in an
                    email to a representative of the Developer. Geospecs maintained that the
                    borehole logs for BH-11 and BH-11A were correct, and that the apparent
                    differences in the soil profiles may be attributable to differential weathering
                    of the underlying rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Following Geospecs’ response, the
                    Developer sent a letter in reply to Resource Piling on 4 January 2011, firmly
                    stating that the Geospecs Logs were accurate, and that, in any event, there were
                    no sums due and payable to Resource Piling for the rock socketing
                        works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Resource Piling replied on
                    10 January 2011, reiterating that the Geospecs Logs were inaccurate and that it
                    was contractually entitled to the extra payment that it was claiming
                        for.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> There is no further record of any
                    subsequent correspondence between Resource Piling and the
                Developer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Resource Piling issued a writ of summons
                    against Geospecs on 12 May 2011, claiming in the alternative for: (a) the extra
                    costs it had incurred for drilling sockets through rock; or (b) the actual
                    losses and losses of anticipated profit that it had incurred on the performance
                    of the Piling Contract. At the date the trial commenced, Resource Piling had not
                    taken any legal action against the Developer or filed any complaint to the
                        BCA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The parties jointly requested, and I granted,
                    an order for bifurcation of issues and the trial proceeded only on issues of
                    liability. Although the lead counsels’ statements list some 15 or 16
                    agreed factual issues and some three to seven agreed legal issues, as well as
                    additional minor non-agreed issues, these can be essentially distilled into the
                    following broad factual and legal issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Factual Issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       What is the generalised
                            soil profile at the Site?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       What is the definition of
                            “rock”?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Are Resource Piling’s records of the
                            soil profiles of the boreholes accurate in that it encountered rock in
                            the construction of about 326 bored piles or 77% of the total number of
                            piles where no rock was expected?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Were the Geospecs Logs accurate in
                            approximately profiling the soil at the Site and the soil conditions in
                            the vicinity of BH-1 to BH-11?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       Did Geospecs carry out its soil investigation
                            works and compilation of the Geospecs Logs properly and to the expected
                            standard of a competent soil investigator?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Legal Issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       Did Geospecs owe Resource
                            Piling a duty of care to ensure that the Geospecs Logs it prepared were
                            accurate?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_16-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       If Geospecs did owe Resource Piling a duty of care, did Geospecs
                            breach that duty?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Resource Piling’s claim rests on the
                    allegation that Geospecs had negligently carried out the soil investigation
                    works, prepared the Geospecs Logs that did not accurately profile the kind of
                    soil at the Site and failed to show rock near BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7,
                    BH-8, BH-9, BH-10 and BH-11 when there was rock in the vicinity of these
                    boreholes, and provided a soil profile in the Geospecs Logs that was vastly
                    different from the actual soil conditions at the Site. Resource Piling alleged
                    that around or more than 77% of the piles in the zones adjacent to these nine
                    boreholes had to be socketed into rock, contrary to what was to be expected when
                    considering the soil profiled in the Geospecs Logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Resource Piling pleaded that Geospecs owed it
                    a duty of care to ensure that the Geospecs Logs were accurate and reliable and
                    had breached that duty in its negligent conduct of the soil investigation and
                    preparation of inaccurate Geospecs Logs. Resource Piling was a prospective
                    piling contractor bidding for the piling work for the Site, and Geospecs knew
                    that Resource Piling would be provided with the Geospecs Logs by the Developers
                    to tender for the piling contract and would price its tender based on
                    Geospecs’ inaccurate soil information. Geospecs allegedly breached this
                    duty by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     failing to give a proper and
                        accurate assessment of the soil conditions at the Site;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     failing to advise that there was rock
                        present in the areas of the Site surrounding BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7,
                        BH-8, BH-9, BH-10, BH-11; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     failing to detect the presence of rocks in the areas of
                        the Site surrounding BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10,
                        BH-11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Resource Piling alleges that because of the
                    widespread presence of rock, Longrove was able to reduce the length of the piles
                    generally, which reduced Resource Piling’s payment as it was based on
                    measured pile lengths. Additionally, Resource Piling incurred greater cost in
                    pile construction by having to socket the piles into rock, causing delays and
                    construction difficulties. This resulted in economic loss to Resource Piling as
                    the Developer refused to pay for such additional construction costs, alleging
                    that the risk was on Resource Piling under the terms of the Piling Contract.
                    While a number of factual allegations were made in the affidavits and in the
                    course of oral testimony that Resource Piling had not been able to claim extra
                    payments for the additional socketing works because Geospecs had incorrectly
                    informed the Developer that the Geospecs Logs were accurate, Resource Piling did
                    not additionally plead this as a basis of negligence, and I will put this aspect
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Geospecs denied that it owed a duty of care to
                    Resource Piling as a matter of law. It had only contracted with the Developer
                    and had submitted the Report, Geospecs Logs, test data and results and
                    recommendations for the foundation system to suit the soil conditions, duly
                    endorsed by a professional engineer, to the Developer and its consultant
                    engineers Longrove. The Report with its attachments was prepared for Longrove to
                    design the foundation system, estimate the costs and prepare the tender
                    specifications to call for tenders for the Piling Contract. The Report clearly
                    stated that “the presence of boulders probably due to differential
                    weathering [was] expected within the residual layer”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Geospecs had not been aware, until
                    discovery, that Resource Piling had only been provided with the Geospecs Log by
                    Longrove and/or the Developer. In any event, Resource Piling should not have
                    relied solely on the Geospecs Logs as it only formed part of the entire
                    Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Geospecs also averred that it had not been
                    negligent in the preparation of the Geospecs Logs and that the Geospecs Logs
                    were accurate. This was confirmed by the drilling of two more boreholes in
                    October 2010, BH-1A and BH-11A, which was witnessed by representatives of the
                    Developer and the Resident Engineer. Geospecs claimed that Resource
                    Piling’s alleged encounter with rock was only reported to it by the
                    Developer ten months later on 7 October 2010 and not when it was first allegedly
                    detected in January 2010. It was possible for the soil profiles of a particular
                    area to differ greatly from that of neighbouring areas due to the differential
                    weathering of different types of rocks and formations. Geospecs also questioned
                    the accuracy of Resource Piling’s records documenting that
                    “rock” had been encountered in the course of constructing the
                    bored piles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Does a duty of care arise?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I first address the preliminary and threshold
                    issue of law, <em>viz</em>, whether a duty of care in
                    respect of the damage suffered by Resource Piling was owed by Geospecs to
                    Resource Piling. In <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v
                        Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100
                        (“<em>Spandeck</em>”), the Court of
                    Appeal held that a single test should apply to determine the imposition of a
                    duty of care in all claims arising out of negligence, irrespective of the type
                    of damages claimed (at [71]) (hereafter referred to as the “<em>Spandeck</em> Test”). There was no justification for a
                    general exclusionary rule against recovery of economic losses (at [69]). The
                    Court of Appeal described the two-stage <em>Spandeck</em>
                    Test as follows (at [73]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, a coherent and workable test can be fashioned out of the
                        basic two-stage test premised on proximity and policy considerations, if its
                        application is preceded by a preliminary requirement of <em>factual</em> foreseeability. We would add that this test is to be
                        applied <em>incrementally</em>, in the sense that when
                        applying the test in each stage, it would be desirable to refer to decided
                        cases in analogous situations to see how the courts have reached their
                        conclusions in terms of proximity and/or policy. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I now turn to consider each limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual foreseeability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Geospecs argued that the loss suffered by
                    Resource Piling, <em>ie</em>, the economic loss suffered as
                    a result of the miscalculation of the tender price, was not foreseeable as
                    Geospecs was not aware that the Geospecs Logs would form part of the tender
                    documents provided by Longrove to potential bidders for the Piling Contract.
                    Further, Geospecs could not have foreseen that Longrove would provide only the
                    Geospecs Logs without the rest of the Report which would have indicated the
                    presence of boulders. Geospecs also could not have foreseen that the piling
                    contractor would suffer losses due to its inability to claim extra payment from
                    the employer for additional rock socketing because of the terms of the contract
                    it had entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Geospecs’ submissions miss the point of
                    the factual foreseeability requirement. As stated by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Spandeck</em> (at [75]-[76]), factual
                    foreseeability is a threshold condition that is readily satisfied in most cases
                    as the foreseeability threshold merely requires that the defendant ought to
                    broadly know that persons in the position of the plaintiff would suffer harm or
                    damage from the defendant’s carelessness – this involves the
                    establishment of a <em>factual foundation</em> upon which
                    legal proximity can be founded (see <em>Ngiam Kong Seng and
                        another v Lim Chiew Hock</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 674 (“<em>Ngiam Kong Seng</em>”) at [104]), but does not require
                    the defendant to foresee the precise harm or manner in which the loss was
                    suffered. In the context of a building project, soil investigation works are
                    required to decide on the foundations required for the building. The consultant
                    engineer would require this information and test data to design the required
                    foundations. The information and data would also shape the terms and
                    specifications of the piling contract to be awarded. That this is very important
                    or even vital information and data to the developer and his consultant engineer
                    cannot be gainsaid. If the soil investigation and tests are improperly conducted
                    and the results are inaccurate, it cannot be disputed that the possible costs
                    and time delays, financial and reputational consequences could be crippling. The
                    other parties who would clearly be most interested in the soil substrata would
                    be the piling and building contractors, both of whom would look at the soil
                    investigation information and data. Their contract work, method of work or
                    construction and the temporary works will be materially affected if the
                    information and data is incorrect or misleading. It is my experience, and I can
                    take judicial notice of the fact, that in the larger construction contracts, the
                    borehole logs are invariably included as part of the contract
                    documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It was not surprising that Mr Tan Eng Gee
                    (“Mr Tan”), a director of Geospecs, expressly conceded in
                    cross-examination that if the borehole logs provided by the company engaged to
                    conduct soil investigation were wrong, the contractor who relied on the borehole
                    logs to price his tender for a piling contract would also calculate the cost of
                    the work and the time taken to conduct the work inaccurately.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> A soil investigator
                    would therefore expect that inaccuracies in his borehole logs could cause some
                    form of economic loss – either in terms of loss of potential profit or
                    actual losses from the performance of the contract – to contractors in so
                    far as the contractors would be calculating their tender prices based on an
                    incorrect premise. In my judgment, the threshold requirement of factual
                    foreseeability is evidently satisfied on the present facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Spandeck</em>, the
                    Court of Appeal described legal proximity (at [78]–[79]) as a
                    “composite idea, importing the whole concept of the necessary
                    relationship between the claimant and the defendant”, and cited with
                    approval Deane J’s observations in the High Court of Australia’s
                    decision in <em>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</em>
                    (1985) 60 ALR 1 that the requirement of proximity embraced the notions
                    of physical proximity, circumstantial proximity and causal proximity, including
                    the closeness of the parties, the directness of the relationship between the
                    parties as well as the assumption of responsibility and reliance (at
                    55–56); the relative importance of each factor and the combinations of the
                    factors was a legal question to be determined on the basis of legal reasoning,
                    induction and deduction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Court of Appeal further held that the
                    two-stage test premised on legal proximity and policy considerations was to be
                    applied incrementally by reference to analogous situations to see how courts
                    have reached their conclusions for these stages to determine whether the current
                    limits of liability should be extended: see [43] and [73] of <em>Spandeck</em>. The lack of a factual precedent should not preclude
                    the court from extending liability where it is just and fair to do so, taking
                    into account the relevant policy consideration against indeterminate liability
                    against a tortfeasor (<em>ibid</em>). I note that although
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Spandeck</em> set out a single
                    test for a duty of care and enunciated a number of broad proximity
                    considerations (at [77]–[82]), the factors to be considered in
                    ascertaining whether the requisite proximity exists depends on the precise
                    factual circumstances, including the type of harm: see for example, <em>Spandeck</em>, which emphasised the traditional test of
                    assumption of responsibility and reliance in <em>Hedley Byrne
                        &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</em> [1964] AC 465
                        (“<em>Hedley Byrne</em>”) in the context
                    of economic loss; <em>cf</em>. <em>Ngiam
                        Kong Seng</em>, which applied the three factors in <em>McLoughlin v O’Brian</em> [1983] 1 AC 410 within the context of
                    the first proximity stage in the <em>Spandeck</em> Test for
                    a claim involving a duty of care not to cause psychiatric harm. The case before
                    me is one involving economic loss, and I analyse the factual circumstances
                    primarily through the prism of the twin criteria of assumption of responsibility
                    and reasonable reliance, but with reference to other considerations where
                    relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Statutory duty of a qualified person carrying out soil investigation
                works</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Resource Piling laid great emphasis on a
                    change in the legal regulatory landscape in relation to the conduct of soil
                    investigations. Counsel for Resource Piling, Mr Leo Cheng Suan (“Mr
                    Leo”), submitted that in the aftermath of the infamous tilting of the
                    Samsung Hub building in Church Street, the BCA now imposed an express statutory
                    duty for site investigation to be carried out in a proper and adequate manner
                    and made it mandatory for a professional engineer to sign off any site
                    investigation report. Mr Leo relied on reg 31 of the Building Control
                    Regulations 2003 (S 666/2003) (“BCR”), which provides as

<p class="Judg-1">Resource Piling submitted that changes were introduced by the Building
                    Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (S 54/2008) (“Building Control
                    (Amendment) Regulations 2008”) to place a duty on soil investigators to
                    carry out site investigation works properly and accurately, and that the
                    intended class of direct beneficiaries of this statutory duty included
                    contractors who relied on borehole logs produced as part of the site
                    investigation to tender for and carry out their works. It was contended that the
                    existence of this statutory duty “enhanced” the legal proximity
                    between Resource Piling and Geospecs, such that the latter owed the former a
                    common law duty of care in negligence in addition to its statutory duty.
                    Geospecs disagreed and argued that no issue of public safety arose on the facts;
                    the present case simply involved a commercial contract which was more expensive
                    to perform than one party had originally anticipated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is well-established that the existence of a
                    statutory duty does not <em>ipso facto</em> give rise to a
                    common law duty of care in negligence, although it may form part of the
                    contextual backdrop or be a relevant factor in favour of or militating against
                    the imposition of a duty of care (see <em>Animal Concerns
                        Research &amp; Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee</em> [2011] 2 SLR 146
                        (“<em>Animal Concerns</em>”) at [22]). In
                    particular, the statutory duty may establish that the duty of care does not
                    extend to the losses arising from a transaction falling outside the purpose for
                    which an allegedly negligent statement was made (see the observations of Lord
                    Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <em>Caparo Industries plc v Dickman</em> [1990] 2 AC 605
                        (“<em>Caparo Industries</em>”) at
                    661D–E and 651F respectively). Alternatively, the imposition of a common
                    law duty of care may support or undermine the legislative intention behind the
                    statutory regime (see <em>Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2012] 2 SLR 549 (“<em>Tan Juay
                        Pah</em>”) at [53]–[54]). For present purposes, I will
                    confine my discussion to the former, <em>viz</em>, the
                    relevance of the statutory framework under the Building Control Act (Cap 29,
                    1999 Rev Ed) (“Building Control Act”) and BCR in so far as the
                    nature and purpose of the statutory duty may implicitly create a special or
                    close relationship in the form of circumstantial or causal proximity or support
                    an inference of assumption of responsibility, such that legal proximity under
                    the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test is
                    established.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The Church Street incident in 2002, which is well known to those in
                    the construction industry, involved the 30-storey Samsung Hub building that
                    started to tilt during construction as the superstructure was loaded, <em>ie</em>, being built. There were allegations in relation to
                    the soil investigation, the characterisation of the soil substratum and possible
                    piling construction shortcomings. It caused great alarm as there were completed
                    buildings nearby. However, it should be noted that the introduction of the
                    requirement for a Professional Engineer (Geotechnical) to supervise specific
                    types of works in the BCAA 2007 followed the inquiry into the Nicoll Highway
                    collapse in 2004 and relates only to “geotechnical building
                    works”, which do not include foundational works for buildings which are
                    less than 30-storeys high: see the definition in s 2(1) of the Building Control
                    Act and the then Minister of State for National Development, Ms Grace Fu’s
                    (“Ms Fu”) explanation of the regulation of underground building
                    works in the BCAA 2007 (see the <em>20 September 2007
                        Parliamentary Debates</em> at cols 2055-2056).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The comments that Mr Leo cited followed Mrs
                    Lee's speech where she queried the need to introduce the requirement of a
                    Professional Engineer (Geotechnical) for piling works for projects of 30-storeys
                    and above as professional civil engineers had been designing the foundations of
                    high-rise buildings for many years, and suggested that the employment of a
                    second professional engineer was impractical and unnecessary: see the <em>20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates</em> at cols
                    2068-2069. Ms Fu responded to this concern by explaining that any structural
                    problems with the foundations of high-rise buildings could have very serious
                    consequences, and cited the Church Street incident as an example: see the
                        <em>20 September 2007 Parliamentary Debates</em> at col
                    2074. It is difficult to see how Mrs Lee’s comments support Mr Leo’s
                    position; on the contrary, Mrs Lee was arguing that the Church Street incident
                    could not have been prevented even with the input of a Professional Engineer
                    (Geotechnical). Mrs Lee’s comments were not directed at any proposed
                    amendments to the Building Control Act that directly considered the duties of
                    those engaged in specialised site investigation works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is evident that the overarching purpose of
                    the BCAA 2007, and the subsequent amendments to the BCR, were to
                    “strengthen the building control regulatory framework to uplift
                    professionalism, standards of safety and quality in the construction
                    industry”: see Ms Fu’s speech in the <em>20
                        September 2007 Parliamentary Debates</em> at col 2053. Apart from this
                    broad statement of purpose, the BCAA 2007 was silent on the duties of a soil
                    investigator, although the constant reference to the Church Street incident
                    suggests that it perhaps formed part of the catalyst for the BCAA 2007. (I
                    should add that the Nicoll Highway collapse in April 2004 must have also been a
                    major contributor but from a slightly different angle.) The BCAA 2007 introduced
                    a requirement for those engaged in site investigation works to be licensed as a
                    specialist builder (see s 29G of the Building Control Act) and additional duties
                    on a soil investigator were inserted in the BCR by the amended reg 31. These
                    changes undoubtedly followed the overall purpose of the 2007 amendments in
                    improving the accountability and competence of those engaged in site
                    investigation works to strengthen safety standards. However, I do not think that
                    there is anything to suggest that the changes introduced by the BCAA 2007, or
                    indeed the building regulatory regime as a whole under the Building Control Act,
                    additionally have the statutory objective of protecting the <em>economic interests</em> of the various participants in the
                    construction industry or to define the scope of their responsibilities <em>vis-à-vis</em> each other. The financial risks potentially
                    incurred by contractors who rely on work done by other contractors in the same
                    project are not regulated under the Building Control Act. While it is clear that
                    specialised site investigators in the position of Geospecs owe an express
                    statutory duty to carry out proper and adequate site investigation under reg
                    31(2), in my view, there is nothing that can plausibly support a suggestion that
                    Parliament intended for this duty of competence to extend equally to contractors
                    who rely on geological information provided by site investigators to price their
                    tenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Contractors are not within the class of
                    persons intended to be protected by the statutory duty to carry out adequate and
                    proper site investigation works, and I am thus of the view that reg 31 of the
                    BCR is of minimal assistance to Resource Piling in establishing that the parties
                    were brought into a close and direct relationship or that Geospecs had assumed
                    any responsibility, as part of its statutory duty, towards Resource Piling in
                    relation to the accuracy of its soil investigation logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assumption of responsibility, reasonable reliance and the contractual
                framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Resource Piling submitted that Geospecs was a
                    soil investigation specialist and had to expect that Resource Piling – as
                    a potential bidder for the Piling Contract – would rely on the Geospecs
                    Logs to price its tender. Resource Piling was also constrained to rely on the
                    Geospecs Logs due to the short window of time within which tenders for the
                    Piling Contract had to be submitted. There was therefore sufficient proximity
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Geospecs argued that there was no proximity
                    between itself and Resource Piling. The Geospecs Logs contained only facts and
                    did not purport to give any advice or make any representation to third party
                    contractors. Further, Resource Piling was aware, at the time it submitted the
                    tender for the Piling Contract, that it should not rely on the Geospecs Logs but
                    should instead satisfy itself of the actual ground conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is clear from the contractual provisions
                    between the Developer and Resource Piling (set out at [5] and [6] above) that
                    the risk of unexpected, different, difficult or adverse ground conditions fell
                    upon Resource Piling. The Developer would not pay for any extra costs incurred
                    by Resource Piling or grant additional time to Resource Piling should it
                    encounter such conditions. Under cl 1(o) of the Piling Contract, Resource
                    Piling’s rates, based on bored pile lengths, were to include any coring,
                    chiselling, socketing into rock or use of special tools or equipment and all
                    processes that were indispensably necessary to achieve completion whether
                    described or otherwise in the face of practical difficulties or for other
                    technical reasons. At the tendering stage, cl 1.6 of the General Specifications
                    provided that an “extract of the Soil Investigation Report [was]
                    enclosed…for information” and cl 1.2.3 of the Bore Pile
                    Specifications stated that the Geospecs Logs was for Resource Piling’s
                    reference only and that neither Longrove nor the Developer accepted
                    responsibility for the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs if the actual soil
                    conditions encountered were different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Both parties made use of aspects of this
                    allocation of risk. Resource Piling argued that since the Geospecs Logs formed
                    an integral part of the Piling Contract, Resource Piling should therefore be
                    entitled to rely on the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs as it would have no other
                    recourse for losses if the Geospecs Logs did not provide an accurate
                    approximation of the ground conditions at the Site. Geospecs submitted that it
                    only had a contractual relationship with the Developer and had satisfactorily
                    discharged its duties in accordance with the Soil Investigation Contract. As
                    Resource Piling was not contractually entitled to claim for the additional cost
                    of rock socketing from the Developer over and above the fixed contract sum,
                        <em>a fortiori</em>, it should not be allowed to claim
                    the same from Geospecs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Resource Piling’s argument can be
                    characterised as a claim of assumption of responsibility by Geospecs and
                    corresponding reliance by Resource Piling. Although of considerable vintage,
                        <em>Hedley Byrne</em> continues to be the starting
                    point in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions for claims involving negligent
                    misstatements. Lord Devlin’s formulation of the test as to when a duty of
                    care not to cause economic loss by making negligent statements arises can be
                    found at 528–529 of <em>Hedley Byrne</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the categories of special relationships which may give rise to a duty
                        to take care in word as well as in deed...include also relationships
                        which...are "equivalent to contract," that is, <em>where
                            there is an assumption of responsibility in circumstances in which, but
                            for the absence of consideration, there would be a contract.</em>
                        [emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The <em>Hedley Bryne</em> elements have been
                    incorporated as part of the first proximity limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test at [81]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our view, Deane J's analysis in <em>Sutherland</em>, that proximity includes physical, circumstantial
                        as well as causal proximity, does provide substance to the concept since
                            <em>it includes the twin criteria of voluntary assumption
                            of responsibility and reliance</em>, <em>where the
                            facts support them, as essential factors in meeting the test of
                            proximity.</em> … [emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Assumption of responsibility is to be understood in a legal rather
                    than factual sense. It therefore refers to “the circumstances in which
                    the law will deem the maker of the statement to have assumed responsibility to
                    the person who acts upon the advice” (per Lord Griffiths in <em>Smith v Eric S. Bush and Harris v Wyre Forest District
                        Council</em> [1990] 1 AC 831 at 862; see also the observations of
                    Phang J (as he then was) in <em>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte
                        Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric (practising under the name and style of W P
                        Architects)</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 853 at [63], citing Andrew Phang,
                    Cheng Lim Saw and Gary Chan, "Of Precedent, Theory and Practice - The Case for a
                    Return to Anns" [2006] Sing JLS 1 at pp 47-48 that the concept of proximity is
                    “not merely factual but is, rather, legal in
                    nature”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I first dispose of the argument that was
                    repeatedly stressed by Geospecs in its submissions, <em>viz</em>, that Resource Piling could not claim to have been
                    negligently misled by the Geospecs Logs as the Geospecs Logs contained purely
                    factual statements. The basis of liability for negligent misstatements, either
                    under the <em>Hedley Bryne</em> principle or the <em>Spandeck</em> Test, is that one party may owe a duty of care
                    to another not to provide information negligently; it is not dependent on
                    whether such information may be classified under the semantic categories of
                    “facts” or “advice”. I am, with respect, unable to
                    comprehend how this apparent distinction changes the character of any
                    responsibility that Geospecs may have undertaken with respect to Resource Piling
                    or the nature of Resource Piling’s reliance on the Geospecs Logs. In this
                    regard, I need only refer to the observations of Lord Steyn in <em>Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd</em> [1998] 1 WLR
                    830, at page 834D-H:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear … that the governing principles are stated in the
                        leading speech of Lord Goff of Chieveley in <em>Henderson v
                            Merrett Syndicates Ltd</em> [1995] 2 AC 145. First in <em>Henderson’s</em> case it was settled that the
                        assumption of responsibility principle enunciated in <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd</em> [1964]
                        AC 465 is <em>not confined to statements but may apply to any
                            assumption of responsibility for the provision of services</em>.
                        … [emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The <em>Hedley Bryne</em> principle is
                    conceptually premised on assumption of responsibility and a corresponding
                    reliance, and does not turn on minute classification of what was said or
                    done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The present claim by Resource Piling against
                    Geospecs, who provided geological or subsoil information or conditions to the
                    Developer, is a novel one and neither counsel directed me to any previously
                    decided case in a Commonwealth jurisdiction where a duty of care was held to
                    exist on materially similar facts. In accordance with the incremental approach
                    of reasoning by analogy endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Spandeck</em> (at [82]), I now consider earlier cases where the
                    courts have answered this broader question: does a professional owe a duty of
                    care to a contractor where the contractor tenders for a contract on the faith of
                    information prepared by the professional who does so under a separate contract
                    with the contractor’s employer, but with whom the contractor has no
                    contractual relationship?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     A close factual parallel can be found in the
                    decision of the Court of Appeal of California in <em>M Miller Co
                        v Dames &amp; Moore</em> (1961) 198 Cal. App. 2d 305
                        (“<em>Miller</em>”), which predated the
                    House of Lords decision in <em>Hedley Bryne</em>. It was
                    alleged that negligent soil tests, which failed to disclose unstable ground
                    material, were carried out by the defendant soil engineering firm under contract
                    with the employer and their civil engineers. It was assumed for the purposes of
                    the appeal that the report <em>was intended</em> to provide
                    information for prospective bidders, including the plaintiff contractor, and was
                    in fact made available to and relied upon by the contractor (at 307). As a
                    result of the negligent report, the contractor’s bid was less than the
                    actual cost of completing the project. The court held that on the assumed facts,
                    the soil engineering firm could be liable to the contractors in negligence under
                    the rule in its earlier decision in <em>Biakanja v
                        Irving</em> (1959) 49 Cal. 2d 467, <em>viz</em>,
                    damages for negligent performance could be recovered if “the
                    circumstances were such that the transaction was intended to affect the
                    plaintiff and injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable”. The court also
                    rejected the defence that the contract between the contractor and the employer
                    specifically provided that the contractor was not to rely on the soil report but
                    was to make its own independent investigations; the rights and duties of the
                    soil engineer as against the contractor were not necessarily equivalent to the
                    scope of the liabilities that the contractor had chosen to waive in favour of
                    the employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In my view, <em>Miller</em> is of limited guidance because it was decided at an
                    interlocutory stage on summary judgment principles. It arose from a motion by
                    the defendant to dismiss the claim against it as disclosing no merit. It was
                    therefore decided as a matter of law only on the basis of the assumed facts set
                    out in the preceding paragraph, including the plaintiff’s pleading that
                    the defendant soil engineer had <em>intended</em> for the
                    report to provide information for prospective contractors bidding for the
                    project. The summary judgment granted in favour of the soil engineering firm at
                    first instance was accordingly reversed and the issue of negligence was sent for
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     A similar conclusion and reasoning was adopted
                    in <em>Edgeworth Construction Ltd v ND Lea &amp; Associates

                        (“<em>Edgeworth</em>”), a decision of the
                    Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court held that an engineering firm which
                    had prepared specifications and construction drawings for a highway project and
                    the relevant tender documents incorporating such plans owed a duty of care to a
                    contractor who had successfully tendered for the project and incurred economic
                    losses as a result of errors in the specifications and drawings. McLachlin J,
                    delivering the leading judgment of the court, made the following observations on
                    the assumption of responsibility by the engineering firm at [5]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The engineers undertook to provide information (“the tender
                        package”) for use by a definable group of persons with whom it did
                        not have any contractual relationship. <b><em>The purpose of
                            supplying this information was to allow tenderers to prepare a price to
                            be submitted. The engineers knew this</em></b><em>.</em> The plaintiff contractor was one of the tenderers. It
                        relied on the information prepared by the engineers in preparing its bid.
                        Its reliance upon the engineers’ work was reasonable. It alleges it
                        suffered loss as a consequence. These facts establish a <em>prima facie</em> cause of action against the engineering firm.
                        [emphasis in bold italics added; emphasis in italics in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">McLachlin J then considered whether the contract between the
                    contractor and the employer negated this <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty of care, and held (at [9]) that although the
                    specifications provided by the engineering firm had been incorporated in the
                    contract and had also become representations of the employer, they did not cease
                    to be representations of the engineering firm. The contractor continued to rely
                    on the accuracy of the specifications and did not assume the risk of errors in
                    the work of the engineering firm. The presence of a clause in the main contract
                    between the contractor and the employer negating any warranty of the accuracy of
                    the information provided in the tender documents also did not extend to protect
                    the engineering firm from liability (at [10]) and did not oust any possible
                    duties in tort that the engineering firm owed to the contractor (at
                    [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I am hesitant to draw any statement of general
                    principle from <em>Edgeworth</em> as it similarly concerned
                    a striking out application at an interlocutory stage. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Spandeck</em> cited <em>Edgeworth</em> for the proposition that (at [107]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there might be situations where a negligent statement by the
                        professional in preparing the tender documents would lead to liability under
                        Hedley Byrne … but, in the absence of such a statement to the
                        contractor, it seemed unlikely that a court would find a duty of care based
                        on the mere conduct of the professional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the very brief comment that <em>Edgeworth</em> drew from the Court of Appeal in <em>Spandeck</em>, it appears that the Court of Appeal gave a qualified
                    and cautious interpretation of the decision as requiring a statement <em>to the contractor</em> instead of mere conduct of the third
                    party professional in preparing the tender documents. The observations of
                    McLachlin J (at [5]) that appear to suggest that the professional’s
                    knowledge that the purpose of supplying the information was to allow contractors
                    to prepare a tender could amount to an undertaking by the professional must be
                    read in the context of the factual scenario in <em>Edgeworth</em>. <em>Edgeworth</em> concerned a
                    situation where the professional provided the information for the specific
                    purpose of preparing a tender package that would be relied upon by potential
                    contractors and was involved in the preparation of the tender package; this may,
                    depending on the facts, go beyond mere knowledge and
                foreseeability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The New Zealand Court of Appeal came to a
                    different conclusion in <em>R M Turton &amp; Co (in liquidation)
                        v Kerslake &amp; Partners</em> [2000] 3 NZLR 406 (“<em>R M Turton</em>”). The employer, a health authority,
                    engaged architects to design a hospital building, oversee the tendering and
                    supervise the construction. The architects engaged an engineering firm to advise
                    on the engineering aspects, including the mechanical services specifications and
                    the corresponding subcontract, and to supervise the engineering side of the
                    construction. The mechanical services included a heating system that required
                    identified models of heating pumps with a minimum output capacity of 185 kw
                    output under certain specified conditions. There were also fairly detailed
                    specifications on the oil cooler, condenser and evaporator required for the
                    heating system. The plaintiff company R M Turton &amp; Co
                    (“Turton”) obtained the tender documents from the architects,
                    including the mechanical services specifications which it passed on to its
                    mechanical subcontractors NZ Mechanical and George Mechanical Ltd
                    (“George Mechanical”). Turton submitted a bid which nominated NZ
                    Mechanical, who tendered at a cheaper price based on substituted heat pumps, as
                    their preferred subcontractor and George Mechanical as the alternative
                    subcontractor. Turton’s tender based on the specified heat pumps, with the
                    compliant tender submitted by George Mechanical, was accepted. Upon
                    construction, it was found that the heat pumps were unable to produce the
                    required 185 kw output. The trial judge found that this inability was due to the
                    performance inadequacy of the specified evaporators within the heat pump
                    packages supplied to George Mechanical, and these packages in essence comprised
                    shelf items. Turton had to bear the costs of remedial works. Turton commenced
                    proceedings against the employers, the architects and the engineers for the cost
                    of the remedial works, alleging that the mechanical services specifications had
                    been negligently prepared. The District Court allowed part of Turton’s
                    claims against the employer but dismissed the claims against the architect and
                    engineers, holding <em>inter alia</em>, that Turton had
                    assumed the contractual obligation to provide heat pumps which would achieve the
                    specified performance criteria. On appeal, the High Court upheld the District
                    Court’s conclusion that the engineers did not owe a tortious duty of care
                    to Turton.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the Court of Appeal, Henry and Keith JJ
                    agreed and upheld the decision of the High Court that the engineers did not owe
                    a duty of care to the contractor. There had been a careful allocation of risk
                    for the negligence of the engineers (at [26]) and the imposition of a duty of
                    care would “cut across and be inconsistent with the overall contractual
                    structure defining the relationships of the various parties” (at [32]).
                    Applying the principles in <em>Hedley Bryne</em>, the
                    majority further held (at [28]–[30]) that the engineers were not possessed
                    of a special skill that the contractor was relying upon, and there was thus no
                    justification for holding that the engineers had voluntarily assumed a
                    responsibility to the contractor. Notably, the majority distinguished <em>Edgeworth</em> and expressly departed (at [35]) from the
                    approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in finding a <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty of care that may <em>subsequently</em> be negated by the relevant contractual framework;
                    instead, the imposition of the duty would depend on a consideration of all the
                    circumstances, including the contractual framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Thomas J issued a robust dissent, disagreeing
                    with the findings of the majority that the engineers had not assumed
                    responsibility for the accuracy of the specifications or that the contractor had
                    not reasonably relied on the specifications (at [84] and [86]). Thomas J also
                    held (at [109]) that the contractual structure did not preclude the liability of
                    the engineers to the contractor on the basis of the principles in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>, and approved (at [120]) of the basic logic
                    underlying the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Edgeworth</em>, <em>viz</em>, that proximity was
                    made out once the elements of assumption of responsibility and reliance were
                    satisfied and the tort law of negligence would as, a general rule, apply unless
                    negated by contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I now turn to two English cases, a decision of
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>J Jarvis and Sons Ltd v Castle Wharf
                        Developments and others</em> [2001] EWCA Civ 19 (“<em>J Jarvis</em>”) and a more recent High Court decision
                    in <em>Galliford Try Infrastructure Ltd and another v Mott
                        MacDonald Ltd</em> [2008] EWHC 1570 (“<em>Galliford Try</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     
          <em>J Jarvis</em>
                    involved facts that are not found in the usual building contracts. The employer
                    was engaged to provide an office tower for Northcliffe, a newspaper company. The
                    tower was in a prominent and sensitive location in Nottingham and was
                    constrained by planning requirements; the town planners, who wanted to retain
                    Northcliffe’s commercial presence in Nottingham, took a close interest in
                    the approval of plans for that tower. The employer was determined to obtain
                    planning permission but nonetheless wanted the least expensive scheme
                    satisfactory to Northcliffe. The planners, on the other hand, wanted to exercise
                    control to ensure high quality design and architecture and imposed unusually
                    onerous conditions for approval. The employer and their architects, Franklin
                    Ellis, had many meetings with the planners over the planning approval and design
                    of the tower. The employer also engaged the defendant, Gleeds, a quantity
                    surveyor, to coordinate the construction project and pass information to
                    contractors. When the employer thought it had planning approval on a certain
                    basis, it got Gleeds, on its behalf, to invite Jarvis to tender for the design
                    and construction of the tower. That invitation enclosed various documents, plans
                    and drawings and Employer’s Requirements which was expressed to contain a
                    summary of known constraints to assist Jarvis in formulating proposals and
                    submitting a tender. The contract was eventually awarded to Jarvis and many
                    problems subsequently ensued in the obtaining of planning permission. Jarvis
                    brought claims alleging that the employer, Franklin Ellis and Gleeds had been
                    negligent. The relevant aspect of this case involved Jarvis’ claim that
                    Gleeds owed it a duty not to misrepresent that the scheme contained in its
                    contractor proposals would comply with the planning permission that had been
                    obtained and that Jarvis had relied on such misrepresentations. After an 18-day
                    trial on the preliminary issues, the trial judge held that, <em>inter alia</em>, Jarvis was entitled to recover for loss and damage
                    caused by negligence for which the employer and Gleeds were responsible and
                    dismissed the defence that Jarvis was contributorily negligent. On appeal, the
                    Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed Jarvis’s claim against
                    Gleeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Court of Appeal recognised (at [51]) that
                    the English courts had been slow to recognise a duty of care where a
                    professional agent provides information to a third party with whom his principal
                    has, or is about to enter into, a contractual relationship. However, the court
                    went on to state that it was prepared to assume, without deciding the point,
                    that Gleeds could owe a duty of care to the plaintiff contractor who tendered on
                    the basis of the information provided, and made the following statement of
                    general principle (at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... There is no reason in principle why the professional agent of the
                        employer cannot become liable to a contractor for negligent misstatements
                        made by the agent to a contractor to induce the contractor to tender, if the
                        contractor relies on those misstatements. But whether a duty of care in fact
                        arises in any given situation must depend on all the circumstances,
                        including in particular the terms of what was said to the contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After going through the facts in great detail, the Court of Appeal
                    held that the factual findings of the trial judge, who had sadly died in the
                    meanwhile, were uncertain and the court was unable to reach a conclusive
                    decision that the quantity surveyor did in fact owe the contractor a duty of
                    care (at [59]). The Court of Appeal therefore did not provide any detailed
                    reasoning for the preliminary conclusion that a duty of care was not strictly
                    precluded, nor did it make any affirmative finding on this basis. I note that
                    the Court of Appeal confined the potential liability to negligent misstatements
                    that were made by the agent <em>to induce</em> the
                    contractor to tender; it did not include any misstatement that came to the
                    contractor’s knowledge or was conveyed to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     
          <em>Galliford Try</em>
                    involved a claim by a contractor, who undertook a design-and-build project, for
                    economic losses it had suffered as a result of delays and additional redesign
                    work that it had not adequately factored into its contract price due to
                    carelessly provided information by the consulting engineers. Although the
                    engineers had liaised extensively with the contractor and had provided tender
                    information directly, Akenhead J held that the engineers did not owe the
                    contractor a duty of care as there was no assumption of responsibility by the
                    engineers, who were at all material times employed only by the main developers
                    of the project and had not been involved in the contractor’s pricing
                    plans. Akenhead J further observed (at [315]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the ordinary course of events, I have no doubt that an architect or
                        engineer engaged by a developer would not owe any duty of care (at least in
                        relation to economic loss) to tendering contractors even though the latter
                        had been supplied by the architect or engineer with tender information,
                        drawings and specification upon which to base their tenders. The successful
                        tenderer would be considered to have taken the risk in respect of that
                        information. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The judgment in <em>Galliford Try</em> comprised
                    some 424 paragraphs where the judge went into great detail to analyse the
                    evidence and facts to see whether a duty of care arose under the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principles. His judgment bears reading also
                    because the learned judge was a leading construction silk in his
                day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Two threads are discernible from the above
                    cases. First, in my view, statements made or information prepared by third party
                    consultants employed by the employer that is given to prospective contractors
                    are not, without more, to be treated as statements or information which
                    constitute <em>Hedley Byrne</em> type statements,
                    information or advice leading to liability. It is normal in the context of a
                    building contract for consultants to convey information and, without more, there
                    is no imputation of any assumption of responsibility by the consultants.
                    Secondly, the manner in which the various contracts are structured and how risk
                    has been allocated between the various parties forms the indispensable context
                    and is an important factor in analysing whether the contractual relationships
                    show or support intentions regarding the assumption or allocation of risk or
                    responsibility inconsistent with the claimed duty in tort. The various
                    contractual provisions which bind different parties have to be considered.
                    Building and construction contracts for larger projects are all about the
                    allocation of risk and responsibility; often, tied to that risk is the
                    responsibility of insuring risks that are insurable. In referring to claims
                    under the <em>Hedley Byrne</em> principle, Akenhead J made
                    the following observation (at [190(c)] of <em>Galliford
                        Try</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is always necessary to consider the circumstances and context,
                        commercial, contractual and factual, including the contractual structure, in
                        which the inter-relationship between the parties to and by whom tortious
                        duties are said to be owed arises. Thus, it is not every careless
                        misstatement which is actionable or gives rise to a duty of care.
                        Foreseeability of loss is not enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Whilst factually most contractors will rely on information gleaned
                    from tender documents, including the drawings and specifications, what is
                    relevant is the issue of <em>legal</em> assumption of
                    responsibility and reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     With these principles in mind, I now turn to
                    the facts of the case. Four factors stand out in relation to Resource
                    Piling’s claim that Geospecs owed it a duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, Geospecs is a specialised soil
                    investigator and in carrying out its soil investigations on a site, it must know
                    that three persons or groups would, or potentially would, rely on the
                    information and data it produces. I have already mentioned the developer and his
                    consultant engineer. The developer’s engineer would want to know the
                    subsoil conditions so that he can design and choose the kind of foundations
                    required and the developer would want to know the cost of construction and the
                    time it would take for the construction. The other group would be the
                    contractors – the piling contractor and the superstructure contractor.
                    They would need to know the subsoil to decide on the kind of temporary works
                    required and construction methodology. In the present case, the Developer
                    intended to construct basement car parks which would involve excavation. In
                    addition, there were other buildings and structures in close proximity to the
                    site, including the MRT line and reserve, and different construction methods
                    might be necessitated by different types of subsoil conditions. Underlying those
                    interests are those of the insurers and their specialist reinsurers (who often
                    bear 90 to 95% of the eventual risk) who have become increasingly interested in
                    subsoil conditions as one of the main factors to rate the risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Secondly, in the context of the Singapore
                    building construction industry, Geospecs would reasonably expect and know that
                    at least the Geospec Logs would be made available to the contractors tendering
                    for the piling and superstructure works. Geospecs initially pleaded that it did
                    not know that the Geospecs Logs would be incorporated into the Tender Documents;
                    fortunately for their credibility, Mr Tan candidly conceded during
                    cross-examination that he was aware that the Geospecs Logs would be provided to
                    the piling contractors to price their bids:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">MR LEO:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Tan, when you drilled the bore hole, did
                            you know it would finally be given to piling contractors to price their
                            tender?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">But logically, you have been in this trade for so
                            long, you should know that ultimately it will form part of the tender
                            specification to call for tender.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes, but how they incorporate the document to the
                            tenderer, we don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">That’s a fair point, okay. For these
                            contractors, your bore hole would be relied on to tender,
                            correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would have been entirely unrealistic for Mr Tan to contend
                    otherwise given the prevalent industry practice. Geospecs therefore must have
                    foreseen and was probably aware at the material time that the Geospecs Logs
                    would be relied upon in some form by a contractor in the position of Resource
                    Piling or the main contractor for the superstructure. It is my experience, and I
                    can additionally take judicial notice of the fact, that in the larger
                    construction contracts, the borehole logs are invariably included as part of the
                    tender and eventual contract documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Thirdly, although cl 1.6 of the General
                    Specifications stated that Resource Piling was given the option to conduct its
                    own soil investigations before tendering if it so wished, piling contractors are
                    seldom given enough time to carry out soil investigations of their own in the
                    short time interval between collecting the tender documents and the deadline for
                    the submission of tenders. This necessitates piling contractors relying on the
                    borehole logs of soil investigators to submit their tender bids. Resource Piling
                    alluded to this in the evidence of Mr Foo, who claimed that although Resource
                    Piling was contractually entitled to conduct its own soil investigation, it was
                    not practically possible to do so within the two week time frame to submit its
                    tender; Resource Piling therefore had no choice but to rely on the Geospecs
                        Logs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    This is the reality in Singapore’s building contract environment, and I
                    recognise that this is a necessary constraint under which most, if not all,
                    contractors have to operate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having said that, what exactly is meant by
                    “relying on” the borehole logs to price or base their tender bids?
                    In my judgment, there is no mathematical correlation (as compared to
                    assumptions, extrapolation and estimation) between the pricing methods used by
                    piling contractors and the borehole logs. The borehole logs are invariably used
                    by piling tenderers to give them an approximate idea of the general soil
                    conditions. They do not calculate the length of the pile through different
                    layers of soil with different costing on each layer and then build up the price
                    of the piles. They look, for example, for the depth of the water table and
                    whether underground water will be a problem; they may generally see if there is
                    marine clay and if so how thick the layer is, what depth it is at and what the
                    sandwiching layers of soil are; they may look generally to see what the lower
                    layers consist of so that they know if they have to socket into rock and what
                    length the socketing has to be or whether they will have difficulties with
                    ‘soft toes’ at the foundation levels which may affect the
                    end-bearing capacity of the pile. They may want to know if driven piles into the
                    subsoil may cause excessive vibration and damage to neighbouring properties or
                    buildings. These factors affect construction and the time to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I accept that if a piling contractor sees a
                    rock layer underlain by softer layers, he will have to bore through that layer
                    before reaching the foundation level and that may affect price. Also, if there
                    are large boulders, measures will have to be taken to avoid any mistakes in
                    construction based on an erroneous assumption that the foundation level has been
                    reached. The presence of rock at the foundation level is seldom a problem as all
                    it means is that the piling contractor should check the drawings or
                    specifications to see the depth of and therefore his cost estimate for the
                    socketing. However, Resource Piling’s case is on a broader front –
                    the Geospecs Logs only indicated rock around one area (the north-eastern corner
                    of the larger Western plot around BH-5 and BH-6), whereas they encountered rock
                    in almost every other area of the Site. I will deal more fully with this below
                    as there are other factors to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Fourthly, there was no disclaimer of
                    responsibility or a notation or clause – which is sometimes found in soil
                    investigation reports – to the effect that the Report was prepared solely
                    for and for the purposes of the developer and its consultant and that the maker
                    expressly accepts no responsibility towards any other third party whatsoever and
                    who relies on the same at his own risk. The terms on which Geospecs provided the
                    soil investigation results to Longrove or the Developer clearly did not contain
                    an express disclaimer as to the accuracy of the Geospecs Logs. Although Mr Tan
                    asserted that Geospecs had preserved its position in this respect, he could only
                    point to a single line in the Report when cross-examined:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">MR LEO:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes. Where is your disclaimer?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">... “The
                            pile penetration length, may, however, depend on the type of piling
                            system to be adopted, on any inherent special variations of the
                            substrata and on the intended loads to be carried out by the piles.
                            Presence of boulders probably due to differential weathering is expected
                            within the residual layer.”</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So this presence of boulders if already found in bore hole 6, so it
                            could have it in any part of the site.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">MR LEO:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">This would be the disclaimer you are talking
                            about?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement was clearly not in the nature of an unambiguous and
                    unequivocal disclaimer of responsibility that sufficed to exclude a <em>prima facie</em> assumption of responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     However, in my judgment, although I am
                    satisfied that Resource Piling was not practically able to ascertain the
                    accuracy of the Geospecs Logs and that Geospecs had knowledge that the
                    information contained in the Geospecs Logs would be conveyed to and relied upon
                    by Resource Piling to price their tenders, these <em>per
                        se</em> are not sufficient to establish proximity. On the contrary,
                    there are at least five other countervailing factors that militate against a
                    finding that there was an assumption of responsibility by Geospecs or a
                    corresponding reasonable reliance by Resource Piling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     First and foremost, Geospecs was engaged by
                    the Developer to conduct soil investigations, ascertain water table
                    measurements, record field Standard Penetration Test (“SPT”)
                    values, obtain undisturbed samples to enable tests to be carried out to obtain
                    information on moisture content, bulk density, Atterberg limits, shear strength
                    in triaxial compression and consolidation and other data <em>for
                        the Developer and its consultant</em> for the purposes of pile design.
                    This was expressly stated in the scope of works in the Soil Investigation
                    Contract and the articulated purposes of the investigation. I accept that once
                    the engineer has decided on the choice of piles and the foundation design based
                    on the Report, information from this Report, including the Geospecs Logs, would
                    be used to prepare the tender specifications and drawings for
                tender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Secondly, the Soil Investigation Report was
                        <em>not</em> primarily for tendering purposes and
                    neither was it for any express purpose of enabling the piling tenderer <em>to calculate</em> his price. The Report consisted of some 203
                    pages. The Geospecs Logs for the 11 boreholes only comprised some 22 pages. The
                    Report itself comprised 11 pages. The rest, which formed the bulk of the Report,
                    were mainly detailed test data and results, graphs and laboratory test results
                    which were clearly intended not for a piling contractor’s use but for
                    Longrove’s use in designing the foundations. The Report also contained
                    Geospecs’ recommendations for the type of soil encountered and the
                    recommended pile to be used. There was no passing of such information directly
                    from Geospecs to Resource Piling, and neither was the Report addressed directly
                    or indirectly to Resource Piling as the successful piling tenderer. In fact,
                    there was no evidence before me that there was any immediate contact between
                    Geospecs or Resource Piling right up to the time that the writ of summons was
                    filed. All communications took place through the Developer or
                Longrove.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Thirdly, and consequent upon the second
                    reason, only a small part of the entire Report was made available to Resource
                    Piling, namely, the Geospecs Logs. Clause 1.6 of the General Specifications
                    stated that “an <em>extract</em> of the Soil
                    Investigation Report [was] enclosed…for information” [emphasis
                    added], and it was thus clear that the full Report was not included. It is
                    noteworthy that soil investigation, if properly done, only gives a snapshot of
                    the cross-section of the soil which the bore went through. It does not say what
                    the soil <em>is</em> ten metres away. If another borehole
                    is sunk 20 metres away, then only a very approximate extrapolation of the
                        <em>likely</em> soil profile is obtained by placing
                    these borelogs at two ends of a page and connecting the layers. Sometimes, three
                    or more borelogs are used in this fashion when extrapolating the likely soil
                    profile along a longer axis. The point is, the analysis is not continuous, and
                    because this is after all an extrapolation, it cannot show <em>exactly</em> the precise different soils or boulders or rock which
                    may exist between any two boreholes. It has to be remembered that soil
                    investigation borelogs are by their very nature limited in number across a much
                    larger site and do not necessarily accurately profile the subsoil at a site;
                    that is why employers and their consultants in Singapore always provide that the
                    risk of different or adverse soil conditions is on the piling or superstructure
                    contractor. Geospecs sank 11 boreholes whereas Piling Resources had to construct
                    442 bored piles across the site. These are facts, general as well as particular,
                    that have to be weighed in deciding whether the first test of proximity can be
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It is therefore erroneous for Resource Piling
                    to say that only two (BH-5 and BH-6) out of the 11 boreholes drilled by Geospecs
                    indicated the presence of rock and that they could therefore anticipate that
                    approximately only 18% of their piles would encounter rock, or that two out of
                    11 of the boreholes, which were adjacent to each other, indicated the presence
                    of rock and that Resource Piling could therefore safely extrapolate that it
                    would not encounter rock elsewhere across the Site. That was therefore an
                        <em>assumption</em> Resource Piling made. It
                    accordingly took the risk, in the contractual context, of that assumption being
                    wrong. Mr Foo’s evidence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> clearly bears out his extrapolation
                    and therefore assumptions he made in working out his tender price. Geospecs also
                    pointed out (in my view very validly so, given the context), that they did not
                    know the Report was not made available to Resource Piling. The Report stated at
                    p 11 that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Piles may be founded within the very dense/hard/weathered rock stratum
                        …
                        <em>Presence of boulders</em> probably due to
                        differential weathering <em>is expected within the residual
                            layer</em>. [emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although this does not say rock can be expected, it clearly opines
                    that boulders can be expected, <em>ie</em>, drilling or
                    coring through boulders may have to be carried out before reaching the layers
                    below them. Therefore, while I would accept that it was reasonable for Resource
                    Piling to have relied on the Geospecs Logs as one of the considerations in
                    preparing their tender, I do not think it can be said with equal strength that
                    it was reasonable to rely on the Geospecs Logs as enabling them to determine
                    with accuracy that only 18% of the piles would hit rock. There was an element of
                    risk that is inherent in extrapolating the overall soil profile of the Site
                    based on 11 data points, and I believe that Resource Piling must have been aware
                    of that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Fourthly, also of importance is that there are
                    different ways in which piling contractors price their works and Geospecs would
                    not know which pricing structure would be adopted as between the Developer and
                    Resource Piling. For bored piles, tenderers can price their piles by length and
                    diameter of the pile with different rates for boring through soil, boring
                    through soft soils (where there might be a need for additives to help stabilise
                    the surrounding soil) and boring through rock or large boulders when they are
                    encountered in the subsoil. They can also make provision for underground
                    obstructions, like old structures sunken in the subsoil. There was no suggestion
                    at all that Geospecs was aware how Longrove would structure the pricing for the
                    tender or that Resource Piling would price their tender purely by the length and
                    diameter of the pile, irrespective of the type of soil it encountered in its
                    construction of the bored piles. I note that in the case of Geospecs, it
                    protected itself by providing that its lump sum quote did not include rock
                    coring and if required it would charge $150 per metre subject to a minimum of
                    three metres per borehole. The bill of quantities issued by Geospecs also
                    stipulated that boring in soil would be priced at a rate of $20 per metre
                    whereas diamond drilling through solid rock or material with SPT results of not
                    less than 100 blows per 300mm was at a rate of $180 per metre. I do not think
                    there was evidence of any close relationship between the parties as there
                    apparently was in <em>Miller</em> or <em>Edgeworth</em> that would support the imputation of an assumption of
                    responsibility on the part of Geospecs in relation to Resource Piling’s
                    reliance on the Geospecs Logs for tendering purposes. It had not participated in
                    the drawing up of the tender documents or specifications or prepared the
                    Geospecs Logs with the intention that it be used by Resource
                Piling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Fifthly, in the context of the Singapore
                    building and construction industry, the risk of adverse subsoil conditions is
                    variably borne by the contractor. None of the standard building contract forms
                    commonly in use in Singapore provide otherwise. This is the well-known and
                    accepted commercial environment of long standing that both Geospecs and Resource
                    Piling operated within. Hence, the terms of the Piling Contract and Tender
                    Documents repeatedly emphasised that as between the Developer and Resource
                    Piling, the risk that the ground conditions may be different from that indicated
                    in the Geospecs Logs lay <em>solely</em> on Resource
                    Piling:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 16(b) of the Piling Contract
                        and cl 1.2.3 of the Bored Pile Specifications clearly excluded any warranty
                        from the Developer and Longrove with respect to the accuracy of the Geospecs
                        Logs and absolved the Developer and Longrove from any liability to Resource
                        Piling on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clauses 1.6 and 1.10 of the General Specifications and cll 1.2.3 and
                        4.2.4 of the Bored Pile Specifications expressly provided that the
                        contractor tendered for the piling work on the Site on a fixed price per
                        metre basis and no extra cost or time would be allowed in the event that
                        difficult ground conditions were encountered on the Site.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     Clauses 7 and 11(d) of the Piling
                        Contract, cl 1.6 of the General Specifications and cl 1.2.2 of the Bored
                        Pile Specifications stated that Resource Piling was deemed to have inspected
                        the Site and satisfied itself as to the ground and subsoil
                        conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The cumulative effect of these contractual
                    terms was that Resource Piling accepted by its contract that it was not entitled
                    to claim extra payment for the additional costs of coring through rock,
                        <em>ie</em>, no extra payment would be due if there
                    were unanticipated conditions that rendered the piling work more onerous or
                    expensive to perform in accordance with the contractual specifications. Also, by
                    contract, Resource Piling accepted payment according to a single variable of the
                    length of the bored piles; this was an all inclusive price whether or not
                    Resource Piling had to bore or core through soft soils, medium stiff soils, hard
                    soils or rock or had to use any special tools or equipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given the factual circumstances surrounding
                    the relationship between Geospecs and Resource Piling, including the fact that
                    this relationship was not formed directly but through the conduit of the
                    contractual relationship between Resource Piling and the Developer, I am of the
                    view that apart from Geospecs’ knowledge that prospective piling
                    contractors would rely on the Geospecs Logs to price the tender, there was no
                    other element which would justify the imputation of an undertaking of
                    responsibility by Geospecs. There was no physical proximity in terms of
                    immediacy of relationship, nor was there circumstantial proximity in the sense
                    of Geospecs performing the soil investigation on behalf of the Developer for the
                        <em>immediate purpose</em> of conferring some benefit
                    on Resource Piling or to assist Resource Piling. As Mr Tan averred – and
                    this was confirmed by Resource Piling’s expert witness Dr Ting Seng Kiong
                    (“Dr Ting”) – the borehole logs were prepared to enable the
                    project engineer to design the foundations and to prepare the engineer’s
                    estimate and tender specifications. Geospecs’ information was thus
                    provided to the Developer for the primary purpose of the planning and design of
                    the foundations; the contractors who relied on the information to price their
                    tenders were ancillary recipients of that piece of work. Most crucially, I find
                    that the overall contractual and commercial context – as the two general
                    threads running through all the factors above – explicitly and implicitly
                    evinces the parties’ intentions to allocate the entire risk of any
                    economic loss arising from inaccuracies in the information provided in the
                    Geospecs Logs to the contractor tendering for the piling work on the Site. This
                    undermines any direct assumption of responsibility by Geospecs to Resource
                    Piling. It was Resource Piling that failed to adequately price for the risk that
                    it undertook.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I recognise the possible countervailing
                    argument that it does not follow that Resource Piling is not entitled to claim
                    from Geospecs in tort <em>because</em> Resource Piling
                    cannot claim against the Developer under the Piling Contract. The presence of a
                    contractual relationship between Resource Piling and the Developer and the
                    rubric of risk allocation in contract need not necessarily mirror the position
                    of Resource Piling <em>qua</em> a third party professional
                    in tort. I accept the general principles behind the reasoning in <em>Miller</em> and <em>Edgeworth</em>,
                        <em>viz</em>, that a duty in tort cannot be
                    “ousted” by a contractual duty, and <em>a
                        fortiori</em> when the duties in contract and tort do not exhaustively
                    occupy the same ground. However, I also do not consider it particularly helpful
                    to frame arguments in terms of abstract theoretical propositions of whether
                    parallel duties in contract and tort are logically inconsistent by the legal
                    nature of the causes of action. In considering the issue of legal proximity, all
                    the facts and circumstances of the case have to be considered. The question
                    before me accordingly is this: given that Geospecs and Resource Piling were
                    brought into a relationship by the Tender Documents and Piling Contract, did
                    this contractual structure indicate that Resource Piling should be deemed, by
                    inference, to have also accepted the risk of the ground conditions being
                    materially different from that indicated in the Geospecs Logs <em>vis-à-vis</em> Geospecs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In answering this question, I respectfully
                    prefer and adopt the approach of the majority in <em>R M
                        Turton</em>, which I consider to be consonant with the <em>Spandeck</em> Test. The unified two-stage test for a duty of
                    care in <em>Spandeck</em> does not separate the questions
                    of whether a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care arises out
                    of an assumption of responsibility and whether the contractual framework negates
                    the duty of care; both factors are part of the open-textured enquiry under the
                    first limb of whether legal proximity has been established. Of course, to the
                    extent that the contractual structure may additionally be regarded as a relevant
                    policy consideration, it may negate a <em>prima facie</em>
                    duty of care; this is, however, an inquiry from a different and broader
                    perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In my judgment, the principle applied by the
                    majority of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <em>R M
                        Turton</em> is directly relevant to the present circumstances and
                    correct. The Court of Appeal held that where the chain of contracts had
                    carefully defined the rights and obligations of the various parties, there is
                    little justification for holding that the third party professional had
                    voluntarily assumed a responsibility to the contractor in tort. The allocation
                    of risk in the respective contracts indicate that as between Geospecs and the
                    Developer, in the absence of any exclusion of liability, the general risk of the
                    accuracy of the soil investigation report fell on Geospecs. As between Resource
                    Piling and the Developer, Resource Piling bore the risk of any possible
                    variations in the actual ground conditions as the contractual price was based on
                    prices measured by the metre length of the bored piles <em>irrespective</em> of the actual subsoil encountered. In this manner,
                    the risk that the Geospecs Logs did not reflect actual ground conditions was
                    expressed to be borne by Resource Piling. In the circumstances, I do not
                    consider that the parties contracted on the basis that the risk could be passed
                    across the network of contracts through a tortious duty and do not see any basis
                    to find that Geospecs had, in addition to the contractual duties that it owed to
                    the Developer, assumed the risk of any losses arising out of Resource
                    Piling’s performance of the separate Piling Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I acknowledge that a similar argument on risk
                    allocation and responsibilities under contract was rejected by the Court of
                    Appeal of California in <em>Miller</em>. The Court of
                    Appeal stated as follows (at [4]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must be remembered, however, that this contract was one between [the
                        contractor] and the district, and [the soil engineers] was not a party
                        thereto. The fact that [the contractor] chose to assume certain
                        responsibilities and to waive certain liabilities in favour of the district
                        and its engineer does not necessarily result in a determination that its
                        rights and duties as against the engineers were the same. … No
                        mention whatever is made of respondent’s liability for
                        inaccuracies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With respect, this argument merely begs the question, and I decline to
                    follow <em>Miller</em>. If the soil engineer was an
                    independent third party, and was not a party to or a participant in the
                    performance of the main contract between the contractor and the employer, then
                    in the ordinary course of things, that contract would not have expressly defined
                    the engineer’s <em>contractual</em> scope of
                    responsibilities simply because the employer has no reason to protect the
                    engineer’s interests. The rights and liabilities that the contractor has
                    undertaken in relation to the employer therefore likewise should not necessarily
                    result in a determination that its rights and liabilities in relation to a third
                    party should not be deemed to be the same, particularly if that third party is
                    also involved in the overall network of contracts within a building and
                    construction project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Finally, I turn to the submission that the
                    proximity test was satisfied here because, unlike the case in <em>Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter</em> [1990] 1 QB 993
                        (“<em>Pacific Associates</em>”) and
                        <em>Spandeck</em>, Resource Piling had no contractual
                    remedy against the Developer if the Geospecs Logs failed to provide an accurate
                    estimate of the ground conditions. I am unable to accept Resource Piling’s
                    argument that the absence of an adequate contractual remedy for Resource Piling
                    in such an event must mean that Resource Piling placed greater reliance on the
                    Geospecs Logs and that legal proximity under the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test was therefore enhanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In <em>Pacific
                        Associates</em> and <em>Spandeck</em>, the courts
                    held that a certifier of work done under a contract did not owe a duty of care
                    to the contractor to exercise professional skill and judgment in certifying
                    payment for work done so as to avoid causing the contractor loss as a result of
                    undervaluation or under-certification of the works. A crucial part of the
                    reasoning in both cases was that the contract between the employer and
                    contractor, under which the scope of the certifier’s employment was
                    defined, contained arbitration clauses that gave the contractor a remedy against
                    the employer for any under-certification of works by the certifier. The courts
                    therefore held that it could not be said that the certifier had assumed any
                    responsibility to the contractor, and the imposition of a duty of care on the
                    certifier would cut across and be inconsistent with the contractual
                    structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In my view, <em>Pacific
                        Associates</em> and <em>Spandeck</em> do not
                    present analogous fact situations to the present case; they are clearly
                    distinguishable and are of a different sub-category. First, the consultant
                    certifiers there interacted with the contractor throughout the pre-construction,
                    construction and post-construction phases and were active participants in the
                    administration of the construction contract. They belong to a different class of
                    consultants in a building and construction contract. Their functions were also
                    of a very different nature and were set out in the main contract between the
                    employer and the contractor. This is quite unlike the soil investigator who does
                    his one-time investigation, presents his findings and test data and leaves the
                    stage unless he is engaged to do further boreholes and reports. Secondly, I do
                    not read <em>Pacific Associates</em> and <em>Spandeck</em> as laying down a rule of general application that a
                    duty of care will not be inconsistent with the contractual structure if there is
                    no adequate contractual machinery that addresses the particular loss that the
                    contractor claims to have suffered. It was but one of the factors (although I
                    would accept, an important one) considered by the courts when assessing whether
                    the proximity test was satisfied. Thirdly, <em>Pacific
                        Associates</em> and <em>Spandeck</em> are cases
                    relating to the professional’s negligent performance of functions which,
                    as I have noted, are defined in the main contract between the contractor and the
                    employer. They are not cases akin to the <em>Hedley
                        Bryne</em> type of factual scenarios involving a negligent
                    misstatement by a professional to a contractor who relies on it in relation to
                    his decision to enter into a contract, where the twin criteria of a voluntary
                    assumption of responsibility and reliance come to the fore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Where the very basis of the
                    professional’s duties stems from the main contract, and the professional
                    is entrusted with certain direct functions in relation to the contractor, the
                    availability of a comprehensive contractual remedy governing the rights and
                    responsibilities of the parties in relation to losses arising from the
                    performance of the professional’s functions would be an important
                    indicator that the contractor should be deemed by inference to have voluntarily
                    accepted the limited role played by the professional and that the contractor
                    should look only to its contractual remedies against the employer. In this
                    context, the availability (or otherwise) of a contractual remedy is
                    understandably of some importance. In contrast, the involvement of Geospecs was
                    not expressly contemplated by the Piling Contract save to the extent that
                    information in the form of the Geospecs Logs was provided to Resource Piling in
                    the course of calling for tenders for the contract. The lack of remedies
                    afforded to Resource Piling against the Developer under the Piling Contract does
                    not provide any indication as to whether Resource Piling had therefore
                    contracted on the implied contemplation that it would alternatively have
                    recourse against Geospecs – a party whose “participation” in
                    the Piling Contract was merely incidental – should the information on the
                    subsoil conditions which formed the assumptions for its contract price
                    subsequently turn out to be inaccurate, or whether Geospecs had accepted this
                    responsibility or obligation. Instead, as I have alluded to above, the lack of a
                    remedy is simply another indication of the allocation of risk that Resource
                    Piling was prepared to accept.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The present case is instead analogous to cases
                    like <em>Caparo Industries</em>, where shareholders who
                    bought into a company failed in their claim against the company’s auditors
                    for negligence in relation to the conduct of an audit and preparation of a
                    report for the annual accounts, and <em>Simaan General
                        Contracting Co v Pilkington Glass Ltd (No 2)</em> [1988] QB 758, where
                    a main contractor failed in its action for negligence against the supplier of
                    its subcontractor, alleging that the supplier owed it, the main contractor, a
                    duty of care in respect of economic loss suffered by it as a result of the glass
                    supplied being of an allegedly wrong colour. Bingham LJ, as he then was, said at
                    782D–E:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Here, [the main contractor’s] real (and understandable)
                        complaint is that Pilkington’s [the supplier of the subcontractor]
                        failure to supply goods in conformity with the specification <em>has rendered their main contract less profitable. This is a
                            type of claim against which, if laid in tort, the law has consistently
                            set its face.</em> [emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the effect of <em>Spandeck</em> is that
                    there is no longer any exclusionary rule against the recovery of particular
                    types of loss, I agree that when separate and independent contracts are
                    involved, absent special circumstances, an assumption of responsibility in
                    relation to economic loss is not readily found between parties who are brought
                    into a relationship only because they are interposed by a mutual third
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     For the reasons set out above, I find that
                    Resource Piling has failed to establish proximity under the first limb of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> Test.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Policy considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Having found no legal proximity on the facts
                    of this case, it is moot whether policy arguments may negate a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care under the second limb of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> Test. However in the event that I am
                    wrong, I briefly set out my reasons explaining why, when applied to these facts,
                    policy considerations will negate a duty of care. It should also be noted that
                    while the Court of Appeal in <em>Animal Concerns</em> (at
                    [77]) held that the <em>Spandeck</em> Test does not
                    preclude the court from having due regard to positive policy considerations, the
                    implicit assumption underlying the decision was that policy considerations
                        <em>alone</em> cannot operate in an active manner to
                    impose a duty of care where there is otherwise no proximity under the first
                    stage of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test. I now turn to briefly
                    address the policy considerations canvassed by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Resource Piling submitted that the Building
                    Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008 sought to increase the accountability of
                    those engaged in soil investigation works so as to avoid structural and safety
                    issues that may subsequently surface due to improperly designed foundations.
                    There was therefore a policy element of public interest and safety in imposing a
                    duty of care not to perform soil investigation works negligently. It was also
                    impossible, as a matter of practical reality, for Resource Piling to verify the
                    Geospecs Logs by performing the soil investigation works itself, and Resource
                    Piling was therefore compelled to rely on the soil investigator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Geospecs contended that if there was proximity
                    between the parties, it should be negated for policy reasons. It argued that
                    allowing Resource Piling to claim for the extra costs of rock socketing would
                    circumvent the contractual allocation of risk by allowing it to claim from
                    Geospecs what it had otherwise given up contractually from the Developer. If
                    Geospecs were liable for Resource Piling’s losses, it would effectively
                    become an insurer for losses that Resource Piling made on the Piling Contract as
                    a result of a bad bargain. This was not the legislative purpose of the Building
                    Control (Amendment) Regulations 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The statutory framework and the objective of promoting safety in the
                construction industry</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     An important policy consideration for the
                    court under the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> Test
                    is whether the imposition of a common law duty of care would be inconsistent
                    with a statutory duty governing the same subject matter: see <em>Spandeck</em> at [53].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The primary objective of the Building Control
                    Act is to create a regulatory framework that gives powers to the Building
                    Authority to regulate building works and the safety of buildings, implements a
                    system of independent checking and supervision by accredited checkers and
                    qualified persons, and places a responsibility on contractors to construct
                    buildings safely and in accordance with the approved building plans and
                    regulations: see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>,
                        <em>Official Report</em> (16 February 1989) vol 52 at
                    col 668. Section 11 of the Building Control Act and reg 31 of the BCR define the
                    duties of builders engaged in site investigation works for the purpose of
                    ensuring that the relevant work is carried out competently and in compliance
                    with industry practice and professional standards. As I have discussed above,
                    the statutory regime is intended to promote a common denominator of safety
                    standards and competence in the industry for the public benefit; it does not
                    purport to regulate the rights and commercial interests of private parties
                    involved in the construction industry as between each other. I agree with
                    Geospecs that there is nothing to indicate that the Building Control Act and BCR
                    contemplated that all legal liability in respect of economic losses suffered by
                    Resource Piling as a result of Geospecs’ failure to discharge its
                    statutory duties under reg 31 of the BCR should fall on Geospecs through a
                    coextensive remedy in tort. I cannot dispute that it is desirable for Geospecs
                    to meticulously discharge its statutory duties and that this would advance the
                    purpose of protecting public safety, but imposing a duty on Geospecs owed to a
                    piling contractor or subcontractor on the present facts has no rational or
                    plausible relation to this objective. This is achieved through regulatory or
                    criminal sanctions – which are expressly provided for in reg 50 of the BCR
                    – and not through a private remedy in tort for <em>economic
                        losses</em>. While I therefore do not consider that the statutory
                    framework expressly militates against the imposition of a duty of care by reason
                    of inconsistency, I am of the view that there are no positive policy reasons in
                    favour of a duty of care either.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Practical limitations on piling contractors, risk allocation and the
                contractual context</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In <em>Edgeworth</em>,
                    McLachlin J made the following observation (at [18]) on the practical realities
                    of construction contracts which merits citing <em>in
                        extenso</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One important policy consideration weighs against the engineering firm.
                            <em>If the engineering firm is correct, then contractors
                            bidding on construction contracts will be obliged to do their own
                            engineering. In the typically short period allowed for the filing of
                            tenders — in this case about two weeks — the contractor
                            would be obliged, at the very least, to conduct a thorough professional
                            review of the accuracy of the engineering design and information, work
                            which in this case took over two years.</em> The task would be
                        difficult, if not impossible. Moreover, each tendering contractor would be
                        obliged to hire its own engineers and repeat a process already undertaken by
                        the owner. The result would be that the engineering for the job would be
                        done not just once, by the engineers hired by the owner, but a number of
                        times. This duplication of effort would doubtless be reflected in higher bid
                        prices, and ultimately, a greater cost to the public which ultimately bears
                        the cost of road construction. <em>From an economic point of
                            view, it makes more sense for one engineering firm to do the engineering
                            work, which the contractors in turn are entitled to rely on, absent
                            disclaimers or limitations on the part of the firm. In fact, the short
                            tender period suggests that in reality this is the way the process
                            works; contractors who wish to bid have no choice but to rely on the
                            design and documents prepared by the engineering firm. It is on this
                            basis that they submit their bids and on this basis that the successful
                            bidder enters into the contract. The fact that the contractor may agree
                            to exempt the party inviting tenders from liability for the design
                            process does not suggest that it thereby should be taken to have
                            exempted the engineering firm. In the scheme of things, it makes good
                            practical and economic sense to place the responsibility for the
                            adequacy of the design on the shoulders of the designing engineering
                            firm, assuming reasonable reliance and barring disclaimers. The risk of
                            liability to compensate third parties for design error will be reflected
                            in the cost of the engineers' services to the owner inviting
                            tenders.</em> But that is a much better result than requiring the
                        owner to pay not only the engineering firm which it retains, but indirectly,
                        the additional engineers which all tendering parties would otherwise be
                        required to retain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This paragraph was cited with approval by Thomas J in his dissenting
                    judgment in <em>R M Turton</em> (at [132]). Thomas J
                    stressed that the limitations in the tendering process necessitated reliance on
                    information provided by the professional (at [129]), and that it was
                    unrealistic, given the fiercely competitive nature of the tendering process, to
                    require a contractor to either refrain from tendering or request the employer to
                    protect him from loss (at [128]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     While Resource Piling did not expressly
                    advance a similar argument in relation to the second <em>Spandeck</em> limb of policy considerations, Resource Piling did
                    allude to this in Mr Foo’s evidence that it was impossible to conduct its
                    own soil investigation in the two weeks it had to submit its tender. I accept
                    this evidence on the realities of the tendering process that are not reflected
                    in the apparent contractual rights that parties are conferred, but do not think
                    that this is a valid policy consideration that would support the imposition of a
                    duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     First, while the economic efficiency rationale
                    proffered by McLachlin J in <em>Edgeworth</em> appears to
                    be an intuitively attractive and sensible one, I would respectfully make the
                    observation that there is no self-evident reason why the rational economic man
                    should be more tolerant of free-riding than he is of waste through duplication
                    of effort. The practical realities of the tendering process mean that the
                    economic waste rationale is purely theoretical and the real issue before the
                    court is therefore one of the allocation and spreading of the loss, <em>ie</em>, who should bear the burden of economic losses caused
                    by inaccuracies in the site investigation reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Secondly, I am sympathetic to the fact that
                    contractors are often left in an unenviable position where they are compelled to
                    rely on the information provided to them at the time of tendering and can only
                    price their contracts on the assumption that the information provided is
                    accurate. However, as pointed out by Ian Duncan Wallace in his trenchant
                    criticism of <em>Edgeworth</em> in <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 11th Ed, 1995) at para 1.296A:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [t]he Supreme Court also noted the short period allowed for tendering
                        as a factor supporting [architect or engineer] liability to the contractor.
                        This is certainly a valid observation, and indeed a common-place of
                        construction contracts ... and almost certainly explains the widespread use
                        of “changed conditions” clauses in engineering contracts.
                        Whether or not (as seems entirely possible if probable) such a clause
                        existed in the <em>Edgeworth</em> contract, however,
                        the fact that tenderers have for more than a century been prepared to tender
                        at short notice at a time when they enjoyed no possible rights against the
                        [architect or engineer] in tort does not seem a reason for introducing a
                        novel liability and transfer of risk (and which would seem independent of
                        the time, however generous, in fact allowed for tendering).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The <em>status quo</em>
                    argument is not necessarily a cogent one in the light of the fact that the
                        <em>Hedley Bryne</em> principle is a comparatively
                    recent development in the law of negligence. Nevertheless, in my view, it is
                    certainly a valid answer to point to the existence of “changed
                    conditions” clauses or different ways of pricing that I have referred to
                    above in piling contracts. Resource Piling suffered economic losses in the
                    present case precisely because the Piling Contract had expressly excluded
                    Resource Piling’s right to claim for extra payment if additional rock
                    socketing had to be carried out as a result of encountering rock. The practical
                    limitations faced by contractors could be mitigated by entering into a contract
                    that shared the risk between the parties, and if the contractor has entered into
                    a contract that did not provide for this eventuality and voluntarily undertook
                    that risk, I am of the view that this is a policy consideration that should
                    negate an extra-contractual remedy against the third party soil investigator. In
                        <em>Spandeck</em>, the Court of Appeal stated that one
                    of the factors negating the duty of care under the second limb was this (at
                    [83]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Among the relevant policy considerations would be, for example,
                        the presence of a contractual matrix which has clearly defined the rights
                        and liabilities of the parties and the relative bargaining positions of the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It may well be true, as Thomas J pointed out in <em>R M
                        Turton</em>, that the court is divorced from the competitive realities
                    of the tendering process, but where commercial men are willing to enter into
                    what may be unequal economic bargains, I do not see why a favourable protective
                    stance should be adopted towards the contractor. Inasmuch as the third party
                    professional may price for possible liability to the contractor, the contractor
                    may also price for the possibility that the contract might end up to be an
                    unprofitable one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Distributive justice </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Geospecs submitted that the imposition of a
                    duty of care would effectively render it an insurer for the potentially large
                    economic losses that Resource Piling may incur on the Piling Contract, which had
                    a contract value of $3,608,488.41. In contrast, the value of the Soil
                    Investigation Contract was only $20,500.00. The implicit tenor of this
                    submission was that the legal liability imposed on Geospecs would be very
                    onerous and disproportionate in relation to the value of Geospecs’ soil
                    investigation works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan
                        Juay Pah</em> accepted, as a matter of principle, that distributive
                    justice in economic terms could be a relevant policy consideration negating a
                        <em>prima facie</em> duty of care. The Court of Appeal
                    held (at [84]–[87]) that in determining where the balance of distributive
                    justice lies, the court may have regard to the allocation of risk and where
                    available, protection through insurance. In the circumstances before me, I
                    consider that as a matter of policy, the imposition of a duty of care owed by a
                    third party professional to a contractor in the tendering process would not be
                    consistent with distributive justice and would undermine the private allocation
                    of risk that parties have voluntarily entered into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Participants in the construction industry are
                    in the business of managing commercial risks through contracting; these risks
                    are reflected in the contract bargain that each party is willing to accept.
                    Given the minimal contracting price and Geospecs’ limited scope of work in
                    drilling 11 boreholes over the entire site, the extent of risk that Geospecs was
                    willing to accept cannot reasonably extend to cascading economic losses that a
                    contractor may suffer in reliance on the Geospecs Logs due to an under
                    estimation of the costs of the works, something which was entirely out of
                    Geospecs’ control and within the realm of its own choice for the piling
                    contractor. I do not think that a third party professional, who contracts with
                    one of the parties who then passes information on to his contracting party,
                    would be the best party to shoulder risks that arise under the main contract.
                    The contracting parties themselves, with specialised knowledge and experience of
                    the potential contingencies that they may encounter in the performance of their
                    contract as well as the pricing variables, are better able to spread the risk
                    through careful contracting, and I am of the view that the law of tort should
                    exercise much caution and restraint before intervening in such circumstances to
                    shunt the risk onto the third party professional. The risk should generally lie
                    where it falls and where it was intended to fall, in accordance with the
                    agreement of commercial men.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     I must point out that in this respect, I
                    confine my observations above to economic losses to contractors arising purely
                    out of bad bargains on hindsight, and would reserve my view on whether this
                    consideration would have the same force in relation to physical damage or
                    personal injury that is caused by the negligent conduct of soil investigation
                    work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I therefore conclude that even if Geospecs did
                    owe Resource Piling a duty of care under the first proximity limb of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> Test, the above policy considerations
                    ought to negate the duty of care under the second limb.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of duty and causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In the event that I am wrong in my conclusions
                    that Geospecs did not owe Resource Piling a tortious duty of care in preparing
                    the Geospecs Logs such that they accurately reflected the soil conditions on the
                    Site, I set out my findings on the primary factual issues identified above (at
                    [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Geospecs Logs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     I first describe what the Geospecs Logs

                    After the usual layer of fill (up to 1.40m and 1.90m respectively), there were
                    layers of peaty clay (estuarine) underlain by very soft greenish grey marine
                    clay (marine) going down to 8.70m and 9.50m respectively where, as can be
                    expected, there was no resistance to the SPT blows; after that, there were
                    varying layers of soft to firm greyish light brown clay with fine sand at the
                    bottom of the layer (fluvial) extending to 11.80m and 12.30m respectively,
                    followed by a layer of loose fine to medium sand with fine gravel and clay, a
                    fluvial layer identifiable as the Kallang Formation down to 14.10m in both
                    boreholes. This was followed by a very dense light bluish grey and brownish grey
                    silty fine to coarse sand with fine to medium gravel identifiable as Old
                    Alluvium in BH-1 and residual soil in BH-2, down to 20.30m and 16.30m
                    respectively, with SPT of 100/18cm to 100/6cm in BH-1 and SPT of 100/19cm for
                    BH-2. Below that there was the final layer of very dense light bluish grey and
                    light yellow gravelly silty fine to coarse sand identifiable as residual soil,
                    Bukit Timah Granite down to 27.20m (SPT 100/6cm to SPT 100/2cm) where the bore
                    ended for BH-1 and down to 30.10m (SPT 100/6cm to SPT 100/2cm) where the bore
                    ended for BH-2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     BH-3 and BH-4 had a similar profile, albeit
                    with slightly different depths for each layer with a similar end layer of
                    residual soil – Bukit Timah Granite from 19.80m to 30.02m (SPT 100/5 to
                    SPT 100/2) for BH-3 and from 22.50m to 30.02m (SPT 100/4 to SPT 100/2) for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     BH-5 also had similar upper layers of subsoil:
                    fill, estuarine peaty clay, very soft greenish grey marine clay, fluvial sandy
                    clay, fluvial coarse sand with some fine gravel of the Kallang Formation
                    followed by residual soil of silty fine to coarse sand with fine to medium
                    gravel down to 18.00m. This was followed by rock, where a rebound was recorded
                    by the SPT, consisting of highly to moderately weathered granite layers down to
                    23.20m where the bore ended, with a core sample taken within that last layer of
                    rock. BH-6 had a similar subsoil profile to BH-5 with the last layer of rock
                    extending from a depth of 18.70m to 30.20m where the bore ended. The SPT
                    recorded a rebound at a depth of 18.07m, but showed SPT of 100/17cm at about a
                    depth of 24.00m depth to 100/2cm at a depth of 27.00m. A core sample was taken
                    from 18.70m to 23.00m but no samples were recovered for the last 7m from 23.00m
                    to 30.02m.</p>

                    to BH-4, but to different depths. The same bottom layer contained residual soil
                    of Bukit Timah Granite which extended from 23.80m to 33.02m where the bore
                    ended, with SPT 100/23cm, 100/08cm, 100/3cm and 100/2cm within that layer. No

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The expert evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The expert evidence for Resource Piling was
                    given by Dr Ting, the Deputy President (Academic) for the Singapore Institute of
                    Technology. Dr Ting was previously an Associate Professor at the Nanyang
                    Technological University and is currently a Visiting Professor of Newcastle
                    University, United Kingdom. He is a registered Professional Engineer and
                    presently engages in ad hoc consultancy work from time to time, having been
                    appointed a consultant or expert witness to more than 50 projects over the past
                    five years. From his <em>curriculum vitae</em>, it appears
                    that he was consultant for the underpinning works for the 30-storey office
                    development at Church Street mentioned above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The expert evidence for Geospecs was given
                    by Mr Akira Wada (“Mr Wada”), the Managing Director of Asia
                    Georesearch Agency Corporation Pte Ltd (“AGAC”), a specialist
                    contractor for geotechnical works including soil investigation and geotechnical
                    analysis. Mr Wada is registered as an APEC Engineer in the discipline of Civil
                    Engineering by the APEC Engineer Monitoring Committee in Japan but is not a
                    licensed Professional Engineer in Singapore. Both experts were instructed to
                    prepare an expert report based on a number of issues identified by
                    counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Under O 40A r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed), an expert’s primary duty is to assist the Court on
                    matters within his expertise, and this duty overrides any obligation he owes to
                    the party from whom he has received instructions. This means that while the
                    courts will permit a spirited defence of an expert’s independent views and
                    position, the expert should not stray into engaging in partisan advocacy to
                    advance his client’s cause: see <em>Pacific Recreation Pte
                        Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491
                    at [69]–[73]. It emerged in the course of cross-examination that Mr
                    Wada’s company AGAC had subcontracted soil investigation works to Geospecs
                    about three to four times a year<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and had at least a fairly close
                    working relationship with Geospecs. I would hesitate to conclude from this alone
                    that Mr Wada was in any way partial or biased in his evidence, but my overall
                    impression of Mr Wada’s evidence was that he occasionally attempted to
                    advance Geospecs’ case on its behalf by making certain allegations that
                    had not been previously put before Resource Piling’s witnesses. This was
                    in keeping with his admission that looking out for Geospecs was only
                        natural:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Counsel for the defendant, Mr Thomas Tan
                    (“Mr Thomas Tan”) said it was not disputed that Longrove changed
                    the pile design after the results of the UTP load tests. However, when Mr Wada
                    went on the witness stand, he put forward the fact that it was actually Resource
                    Piling that suggested the change in design. That caught even Mr Thomas Tan by
                    surprise. With respect, Mr Wada also overlooked what I found to be shortcomings
                    in Geospecs’ case by giving unconvincing excuses:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, Mr Wada gave an elaborate
                        explanation as to why samples could not be obtained from the lower levels of
                        some of the boreholes: BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-6, BH-7, BH-8, BH-9, BH-10 and
                        BH-11. However, he later agreed that the inspection of samples was important
                        for verifying borelogs. Mr Wada then said that tools were available to
                        recover weathered rock in Japan but not in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> However, when it
                        was put to him, he could not explain why S &amp; F managed to recover
                        samples at the lowest levels but could only give an equivocal
                            response:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_a_1"></a>(a)     Additionally, Resource Piling managed to obtain soil investigation reports
                        prepared by Mr Wada for other projects (the Singapore Zoological Gardens and
                        25 Grange Road),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> where Mr Wada had, contrary to his
                        earlier evidence, successfully cored and obtained samples for Grade IV rock.
                        There was no indication of refusal or rebound before he switched to coring
                        to obtain samples in Grade III and Grade IV rock and he also agreed that
                        generally there would not be any refusal of the drill bit or rebound of the
                        SPT hammer for Grade IV rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, Mr Wada was asked to look at the data
                        from BH-11 and BH-11A and BH-11B, which were within a distance of 1m to 1.5m
                        from each other, and Mr Leo asked how the three borelogs could show both
                        rock and soil. Mr Wada struggled to provide any explanation:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">How can it be possible that within such a small
                                diameter the results can be so far apart, that one is soil and is
                                rock?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Yeah. This one is I also many day consider
                                about this 11, what is the condition. I cannot, still I cannot find
                                out, I cannot get sure idea, because of within three, one number is
                                rock, two number is based on this classification, not
                            rock.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_b_2"></a>(b)     I pause to
                        mention that BH-11A was drilled by Geospecs to confirm the results of BH-11
                        but BH-11B was drilled by S &amp; F. Rock was encountered at a depth of
                        21.50m to 27.00m in BH-11B. Geospecs’ senior geologist Mr Okkar
                        examined the samples and accepted that it was rock; Geospecs did not deny
                        the results from BH-11B.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thirdly, Mr Wada did not seem to find anything
                        surprising or strange with the borelogs for BH-1A and BH-11A, which were
                        drilled by Geospecs to confirm the earlier results in the Geospecs Logs for
                        BH-1 and BH-11, for the borelog of BH-1A to state that the soil encountered
                        from 23.20m to 27.02m was “inferred” to be “very dense
                        silty fine to coarse sand with gravel (completely weathered granite; Bukit
                        Timah Granite)” and that no samples were recovered from those depths;
                        and for the borelog of BH-11A to state that at a depth from 22.50m to
                        27.02m, the layer was “inferred as very dense silty fine to coarse
                        sand (completely weathered SANDSTONE; Jurong Formation)”, and again,
                        no samples were recovered. When Mr Wada was asked during cross-examination
                        whether “inferring” meant guesswork and whether it was unusual
                        to use such a term in borelog descriptions, all he said was that different
                        description terms were used by different companies but his company did not
                        use that term.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Even taking into account Mr Wada’s
                        less than fluent facility in the English language, I find this difficult to
                        accept as an objective and non-partisan view.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourthly, Mr Wada maintained that the Geospecs
                        Logs were correct and that Resource Piling’s records collated by Mr
                        Michael Chong Kong Wai (“Mr Chong”) during the piling works
                        were wrong. He was taken through the borelogs of BH-3 and the records for
                        one of the bored piles, BP-93, and it was clear that the two were
                        dissimilar. The records for BP-93 was signed off by Longrove’s
                        Resident Engineer Mr K A Chua (“Mr Chua”). Mr Wada first
                        attempted to say that Mr Chong was wrong and that Mr Chua was
                        “writing wrongly” but eventually had to accept that the
                        Professional Engineer and Accredited Checker were not wrong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_104-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifthly, I find that Mr Wada denied
                        the obvious, which was that when Geospecs took a whole day to drill 3m, it
                        was drilling into rock, not soil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I therefore find that I prefer Dr
                    Ting’s evidence over Mr Wada’s evidence where they
                differed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What was the generalised soil profile at the Site?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Dr Ting adopted the observations in the S

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The area is covered with fills of sandy silt, firm to stiff sandy silt
                        underlain Old Alluvium of fine to coarse and dense sand. The marine clay of

<p class="Judg-1">NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3 each ended in a layer of moderately weathered

                    (erroneously) dated 8 January 2010, also stated that “below [the Old

                    in Bukit Timah Granite Terrain.” Mr Wada stated that the ground material
                    at the Site generally consisted of three groups of soil/rock formations: (1) a
                    fill layer from a depth of 0m to 1.2/2.1m (2) a layer from the Kallang Formation
                    to a depth of 10.9/14.5m and (3) an ending layer of weathered granite
                    formation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I note and find that the geological map of
                        Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> tendered in evidence showed that the Site was
                    located in a “transition” region which was surrounded by the
                    boundaries of the Kallang Formation, the Bukit Timah Granite and the Jurong
                    Formation (conglomerate Rimau Facies). The Geospecs Logs indicated both the
                    presence of residual soil and/or weathered rock from Bukit Timah Granite in the
                    deeper layers of BH-1, BH-2, BH-3, BH-4, BH-5, BH-6, BH-7, BH-8 and BH-9 and
                    residual sandy silt from the Jurong Formation in BH-10 and BH-11; and there were
                    references to material from the Kallang Formation in all boreholes and Old
                    Alluvium in BH-1 and BH-9.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the definition of “rock”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    According to the National Productivity and
                    Quality Specifications (“NPQS”), “rock” is defined
                    as “[m]aterial classified as grade I to III in table 10 ‘Scale at
                    weathering grades of rock mass’ in [the British Code of Practice for Site
                        Investigations]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. It was not disputed that piling
                    contractors in Singapore were generally entitled to claim for drilling into
                    “rock” only when they encountered materials classified as Grade
                    III or above. Resource Piling’s case is that they only claimed for piles
                    where they encountered rock that was classified as Grade III under the British
                    Code of Practice for Site Investigations (“BS 5930”) with a
                    strength greater than 20 MN/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Resource Piling and Geospecs both tendered
                    expert evidence on the definition of “rock”. Dr Ting explained
                    that there were two main classification scales of rock: the weathering
                    classification of rock from Grade I to Grade VI ranging from fresh rock to
                    residual soil under table 10 of the BS 5930, and the strength description of the
                    rock based on the unconfined compressive strength from less than 1.25
                        MN/m<sup>2</sup> to more than 200
                        MN/m<sup>2</sup> under table 2.1 of the Singapore Standard
                    Code of Practice for Foundations (“CP4”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Dr Ting also stated that while a
                    geologist may regard Grade IV and Grade V as rock, this was not the case for
                        engineers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> However, where the rock was Grade III and
                    above, there was no ambiguity<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, and the definition of Grade III
                    rock bore a general correlation to the CP4 scale based on the compressive
                    strength of the rock such that Grade III rock had a strength of 12.5
                        MN/m<sup>2 </sup>to 50
                        MN/m<sup>2</sup>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I accept the evidence of Dr
                    Ting and this is, in my view, correct and in accordance with engineering
                    practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Mr Wada stated in his expert report that it
                    was necessary to have a detailed soil description as specified by BS 5930 in
                    order to understand the mechanical properties of the ground material, and that
                    the boring logs recorded by Resource Piling were insufficient for this
                        purpose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> In particular,
                    during cross-examination, Mr Wada disputed Dr Ting’s correlation between
                    the grade of the rock under the scale of weathering and classification based on
                    strength, <em>ie</em>, a Grade III rock would not
                    necessarily have a strength between 12.5 MN/m<sup>2</sup> to 50
                        MN/m<sup>2</sup> as weathering was not homogeneous and it
                    was possible for certain weathered zones to have rocks of different
                        strengths<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.
                    However, it is important to note that Mr Wada accepted that where the rock had a
                    strength of 20 MN/m<sup>2</sup>, it was possible but unlikely
                    that the rock would be highly weathered rock and it was more likely to be
                    moderately weathered rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I do not think that the positions of both
                    experts were diametrically opposed on this issue. Both Dr Ting and Mr Wada were
                    generally in agreement that there was a grey area and that the distinction
                    between Grade III and Grade IV (<em>ie</em>, moderately
                    weathered and highly weathered) rock could not be delineated with precision. It
                    was not Dr Ting’s position that there was a strict correlation between the
                    grade of weathering and the uniaxial compressive strength, and Mr Wada
                    eventually conceded that he would agree with such a gradation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Any
                    residual disagreement between the experts over the definition of rock was, in my
                    view, immaterial. I therefore accept, for the purposes of Resource
                    Piling’s claim, that where the ground material had a strength of at least
                    20 MN/m<sup>2</sup>, this could be classified as Grade III rock
                    that falls under the definition of “rock” in the
                NPQS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the soil profile logs produced by Resource Piling in the course
                of conducting the piling works accurate?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Geospecs adopted the strategy of trying to
                    impugn the accuracy of Resource Piling’s boring logs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> (hereafter collectively referred to as
                    “the Boring Logs”) that recorded that Resource Piling had hit rock
                    in 77% of the piles that they had drilled in the zones surrounding the nine
                    boreholes where the Geospecs Logs had indicated that no rock was encountered. In
                    essence, Geospecs alleged that Resource Piling’s claims that they had
                    cored into rock were untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The Boring Logs were mostly recorded by Mr
                    Chong and one Mr Kumar. Geospecs contended that the Boring Logs recorded by Mr
                    Chong were inaccurate as he had been specifically instructed by a Mr Eric Choo
                    or Mr Foo to record the material as “moderately weathered rock”.
                    In comparison, Geospecs claimed that Mr Kumar’s logs were more detailed
                    and did not indicate that there was any rock detected even in boreholes that
                    were very close to boreholes where Mr Chong had recorded that rock was
                    encountered. The Boring Logs done by Mr Chong contained a description of the
                    soil, with the word “rock” included in brackets following certain
                    descriptions. In Mr Chong’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”), he stated that he was instructed to record the material
                    bored out of the borehole as “moderately weathered rocks” when it
                    was necessary to use core barrels to core the rock first, followed by a rock
                    bucket to drill the borehole.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Mr Foo also stated that this manner of
                    description was the industry practice, and I accept his evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Geospecs seized upon the
                    words used in Mr Chong’s AEIC to cross-examine him on the basis that he
                    did not really encounter rock but was instructed to say so by Resource Piling.
                    Mr Chong’s statement in his AEIC must be read in context and fairly.
                    Geospecs’ cross-examination and submission was that only the boring
                    records recorded by Mr Chong indicated that rock was encountered. That is not
                    true. I note and find that not all of Mr Chong’s records state that rock
                    was encountered. In Mr Kumar’s limited records, he recorded that
                    “[v]ery dense bluish grey and weather moderately sandstone” was
                    encountered for BP-174. Other Resource Piling employees, contrary to
                    Geospecs’ allegations, also recorded the presence of rock. One Mr V.
                    Suresh recorded encountering rock in BP-6, BP-243, BP-365 and BP-369. One Mr
                    Salam records hitting “[v]ery hard bluish (Rock)” in BP-60 and
                    “[b]luish weathered granite (Rock)” for BP-423, and also recorded
                    encountering rock in BP-38, CBP-180, CBP-163, CBP-170, CBP-172 and CBP-171. Mr
                    N. Kumaresan also recorded encountering rock at BP-38. I also note that in
                    accordance with standard practice, and as mentioned before me but not
                    specifically addressed as it was not in issue, some piles would have been
                    randomly selected for load tests; there is no suggestion that any of those test
                    piles failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    During cross-examination, Mr Chong candidly
                    testified that he was not able to visually distinguish between moderately
                    weathered rock and highly weathered rock, but he had learnt from experience that
                    highly weathered rock could be torn apart by hand but moderately weathered rock
                    could not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In the course of his work, he would
                    consider that a rock was Grade III rock if it was necessary to use a core bucket
                    or rock bucket instead of a soil bucket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> The soil bucket used by Resource
                    Piling could bore materials having a strength of up to 20
                        MN/m<sup>2</sup><sup>.</sup> Therefore, when
                    the soil bucket could not penetrate further and it was necessary to switch to a
                    core bucket or core barrel, it meant that at least Grade III rock had been
                    encountered in the borehole.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    More importantly, Mr Chong also averred that
                    when he extracted samples from the borehole, the Resident Engineer on site would
                    verify what was recorded by him<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and would countersign on the Boring
                        Logs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> I accept his
                    evidence. This is industry practice and Dr Ting held the same view.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> There is no basis for
                    Geospecs’ insinuation that Mr Chong was instructed to deliberately record
                    the Boring Logs in a particular manner merely because the piling records were
                    less detailed than the standard descriptions in the BS 5930, and I find that
                    there is no reason to doubt the Boring Logs accurately recorded the ground
                    conditions at each layer of the borehole. It bears emphasising that the samples
                    recovered from the boreholes were inspected and kept for the Resident Engineer
                    and made available for Longrove’s or the Accredited Checker’s
                    inspection if they so required. The Boring Records were countersigned by the
                    Resident Engineer, who was a representative from Longrove and then lodged with
                    the BCA. They were also implicitly accepted by Longrove, the Professional
                    Engineer and the Accredited Checker (who signed off on the superstructure and
                    substructure).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In the final analysis, if Resource Piling
                    had not in fact hit rock, I am unable to see why Resource Piling would have
                    fabricated this fact in the Boring Logs. Resource Piling evidently had nothing
                    to gain by making false allegations; the Piling Contract was payable on a per
                    metre basis and the pile lengths were in fact shortened as a result of the
                    presence of rock at the Site. One of Resource Piling’s complaints was that
                    due to the shortened piles, it was only paid $2,274,063.36 instead of the
                    contract sum of $3,608,488.41. It would also take Resource Piling a much longer
                    time to core through rock instead of boring through soil and they would also
                    have to incur additional costs of rock socketing (<em>ie</em>, to anchor the piles two times the pile diameter into the
                    rock layer). Furthermore, after an occurrence like the Church Street debacle, no
                    Professional Engineer or Accredited Checker would blindly or lightly endorse or
                    sign-off As-Built drawings and records showing shorter constructed piles with a
                    significant number having been socketed into rock when this departed from the
                    earlier construction drawings and documents that had originally been submitted
                    and approved by the BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Geospecs Logs accurately indicate the soil conditions at each
                borehole?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    On balance, I conclude and find that the
                    Geospecs Logs were inaccurate and negligently prepared, even after making
                    allowance for the inherent possibility of variations in soil conditions and
                    differential weathering across the Site. I accept Dr Ting’s opinion in
                    this respect that although only a small proportion of the ground was tested by
                    sinking 11 boreholes, this was in compliance with the BCA guidelines that the
                    boreholes should not be more than 50m apart and that it was sufficient to
                    generally ascertain the overall soil conditions if the soil profiles were
                        consistent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> I also
                    agree, as a matter of common sense, that while slight gradations are possible,
                    large variations across the Site at distances of one to two metres are unlikely
                    unless a large number of the investigation boreholes were sunk precisely along
                    the joints of the rocks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    I also find and accept the evidence in the S
                    &amp; F Report and the report for BH-11B, as well as the evidence of Dr Ting,
                    that the site sat in a ‘transition’ region (as compared to sitting
                    within one of the recognised geological formations in Singapore). To the north
                    and northeast of the Site lay the igneous Bukit Timah Granite formation; to the
                    south and southeast of the Site lay the Kallang Formation; and to its West, a
                    little further on, lay the sedimentary Jurong Formation. There were also
                    elements of Old Alluvium. Anyone with some familiarity of Singapore’s
                    geology (and this includes those who practice in construction) will know that
                    these are part of the ten geological formations of Singapore and there are
                    references to four of these formations scattered in the Geospecs Logs. This may
                    account for those instances where rock was encountered in one borehole whilst
                    being absent in an adjacent borehole, <em>eg.</em> BP-138
                    and BP-139 which was 3m to 4 m apart; BP-47, BP-48 and BP-49; BP-223 and BP-231
                    (which did not hit rock) and BP-229 and BP-230 (which hit rock); BP-249 and
                    BP-250; BP-174 and BP-173; BP-169 and BP-171; BP-130 and BP-129; and a cluster
                    comprising the UTP, BP-335, BP-332, BP-334, BP-337 and BP-349, with only BP-335
                    in the centre which did not hit rock. To this extent, I accept Geospecs’
                    contention that the subsoil condition may vary naturally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Comparatively, there were many more piles
                    where rock was encountered when none should have been expected if the Geospecs
                    Logs were accurate, <em>eg</em>, the many piles around the
                    UTP, BH-2 and BH-11 which hit rock, and the differing soil profiles recorded in
                    Geospecs’ BH-11A and S &amp; F’s BH-11B which were only slightly
                    over 0.5m apart. I note that BH-2, where no rock was encountered up to a depth
                    of 30.01m and where the soil was classified as residual soil from 16.30m to
                    30.10m, was completely at odds with what was encountered when boring BP-189.
                    BP-189, which was 1100mm in diameter and located close to BH-2, hit Grade III
                    rock from 17.00m to 20.30m where it ended. Indeed, rock was also encountered in
                    the other piles surrounding BH-2. In BP-188, rock was encountered from 18.00m to
                    19.285m where it terminated; in BP-159, rock was encountered from 20.00m to
                    26.355m where it terminated; and in BP-160 rock was encountered from 18.00m to
                    20.70m where it terminated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As a
                    matter of statistical probability, I find it difficult to explain this by
                    natural variances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The overall objective evidence before me
                    also leads me to the conclusion that the Geospecs Logs were not an accurate
                    record of the subsoil at the lower levels of their boreholes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    First, in my judgment, the evidence tendered
                    by Geospecs’ two factual witnesses on the manner in which the drilling and
                    recovery of soil samples were conducted gives rise to the inference that the
                    soil investigation work was done incompetently and the Geospecs Logs were
                    therefore an inaccurate reflection of the ground conditions on the Site. The
                    majority of the field exploration and drilling work from August 2009 to
                    September 2009 for BH-1 to BH-11 was supervised by Mr Tun Tun Latt (“Mr
                    Tun Tun”), who was employed as the Site Geologist. Mr Tun Tun gave
                    evidence that he collected soil samples and recorded the field logs based on the
                    collected samples.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The
                    Senior Geologist Mr Okkar would then double check Mr Tun Tun’s field logs
                    against the sample collected and would occasionally make
                        corrections.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Tun Tun stated that it was Geospecs’ practice to continue drilling if
                    there was some penetration, and he would only core if there was a total rebound
                    after conducting the SPT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> This procedure was confirmed by Mr
                        Okkar.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Mr Okkar
                    visited the site about four times when the field exploration work was
                        conducted.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> Mr
                    Okkar was also responsible for compiling the Geospecs Logs in accordance with
                    the requirements of BS 5930<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> and he stated that he would
                    thoroughly check the field logs recorded by Mr Tun Tun against each
                        sample.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> Mr Okkar
                    claimed that if the field logs were inaccurate, he had enough experience to
                    recognise that the materials recorded did not correspond with the materials that
                    would be expected at that level based on the profiles of neighbouring
                        areas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> I do not
                    accept this at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr Tun Tun, who only had less than three
                    years’ work experience in Singapore, relied largely on instructions from
                    Mr Okkar, who was rarely present. Mr Tun Tun was aware of the termination
                    criteria for the boreholes but could not independently decide whether drilling
                    should be terminated and had to refer to Mr Okkar for instructions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span>, although Mr Okkar was not
                    onsite to satisfy himself as to the actual ground conditions. Mr Tun Tun also
                    stated that while he had experience in soil description, he had little
                    experience in either conducting rock coring or recording rock
                        descriptions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> I also
                    note that although the Geospecs Logs were certified by a Professional Engineer
                    Mr Cecil Sinnadurai (“Mr Sinnadurai”), Mr Okkar confirmed that Mr
                    Sinnadurai was not present at the site and had relied on feedback from Mr Okkar
                    that all procedures were correctly followed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> I note that Mr Sinnadurai, who was in the
                    full-time employment of Geospecs, was not called as a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Dr Ting pointed out that CP4 cautioned that
                    where Bukit Timah Granite was concerned, it was important to distinguish between
                    Grades III, IV, V and VI as the engineering properties of each grade were very
                    different. The weathered granite found in Singapore generally consisted of a
                    thick mantle of residual Grade VI, and there was only a limited amount of Grade
                    V and Grade IV material before hitting Grade III rock. It was therefore
                    necessary to take frequent samples to correctly classify the grade of the ground
                        materials.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>
                    However, as noted above, as a result of the drilling procedures followed by Mr
                    Tun Tun and Mr Okkar, proper samples had not been retrieved at the lower depths.
                    Samples were not recovered from 24.00m to 30.01m for BH-2, from 24.00m to 30.02m
                    for BH-3, from 27.00m to 30.02m for BH-4, from 27.00m to 33.02m for BH-7, from
                    24.00m to 25.52m for BH-8, from 21.00m to 26.01m for BH-9, from 24.00m to 27.02m
                    for BH-10, and from 27.00m to 27.02m for BH-11. Mr Okkar, who was personally
                    involved in the fieldwork for BH-1A and BH-11A, also did not attempt to core to
                    recover any samples at the lower layers. I have also referred to the highly
                    unusual notations which state that the soil was “inferred” since
                    no samples were retrieved. For BH-1A, there was no recovery from 24.00m to
                    27.02m, and for BH-11A, there was no recovery from 24.00m to 27.02m. Mr Okkar
                    also gave evidence that it took an entire day to drill the last three metres of
                        BH-1A<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> and BH-11A.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    I find that the recording of the soil
                    profiles at the lower depth in the Geospecs Logs was more likely to be based on
                    guesswork as no proper samples were retrieved for verification. Dr Ting stated
                    that where only a small sample was obtained it may be insufficient for an
                    inexperienced person to ascertain whether the sample formed part of a rock
                    layer, and that it was necessary to obtain a core to confirm the nature of the
                        material.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    Mr Wada accepted that where the penetration was limited, for example 2 cm, it
                    was not possible to obtain a sample by conducting the SPT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Mr Okkar
                    “inferred” the characteristics of the soil layer by observing the
                    particles that were flushed out from the boreholes together with the return
                        water<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>, and claimed that this was
                    more accurate than coring.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> I do not accept this at all.
                    It appears on the face of the Geospecs Logs that where samples were not
                    recovered, Mr Tun Tun had simply assumed that the soil characteristics at the
                    lower depths were similar to those of the samples recovered from the preceding
                    layer, although Mr Okkar stated that Mr Tun Tun followed the same procedure of
                    observing particles in the return water.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> I am unable to accept that this is a
                    proper or scientific method of classifying the type and strength of material
                    found within a defined layer, particularly if I accept Mr Wada’s expert
                    evidence that any particular layer may consist of material of differing
                    weathering grades and strengths. In other words, a residual particle may not
                    necessarily represent the overall soil condition of that layer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I find that Mr Tun Tun was inexperienced and
                    incapable of dealing with subsoil investigation when he reached the rock layers
                    at lower depths. When he was asked how he had managed to describe the soil
                    layers when he had not recovered any samples, his honest answer was that he did
                    not know exactly and had assumed it was the same as the layer above from which
                    he obtained his last sample.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Mr Tun Tun also testified that Mr
                    Okkar wrote the words “rebound” in the borelogs for BH-5 and BH-6
                    before the rock coring results were stated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> Overall, I am of the impression that Mr
                    Tun Tun’s answers in cross-examination clearly demonstrate his
                    inexperience and inability to independently handle the soil investigation when
                    it reached the rock level, and Mr Okkar had to correct Mr Tun Tun’s
                    descriptions when rock samples were recovered in both BH-5 and BH-6. Based on Mr
                    Okkar’s evidence, I also find that he was not properly supervising Mr Tun
                    Tun in carrying out the soil investigation work and had not performed his duties
                    competently in failing to recognise Mr Tun Tun’s deficiencies. Further, Mr
                    Okkar was himself responsible for carrying out the investigation works for BH-1A
                    and BH-11A, and as I have observed above, Mr Okkar only “inferred”
                    the soil layers and likewise did not recover samples. Based on Mr Okkar’s
                    evidence, I consider that it was possible that Geospecs’ Professional
                    Engineer, Mr Sinnadurai, was signing off the report without checking whether the
                    soil investigation was done in accordance with the applicable standards. My
                    findings are made on a balance of probabilities and I say no more as Mr
                    Sinnadurai was not called as a witness and did not have a chance to say anything
                    in his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Secondly, after the test results were
                    obtained from the UTP, the design of the bored piles was changed. It was common
                    ground that Longrove changed the pile designs after the UTP was constructed (on
                    22 January 2010), load tested (from 30 January to 5 February 2010) and the test
                    results compiled in a report dated 10 February 2010 (“the UTP
                    Report”). There was an attempt by Mr Wada, while giving additional
                    evidence in testimony, to say that this change was proposed by Resource
                        Piling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>
                    This fact was never put to Mr Foo or to Dr Ting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> Mr Leo quite rightly lodged his
                    protest. However at the end of the day, I do not think it makes much difference
                    who first proposed the design change. Even if this was initiated by Resource
                    Piling, they were but reporting on the test results of the UTP which clearly
                    showed much higher mobilised skin friction than that assumed in the drawings
                    that were issued for tender. In the UTP Report, under the heading
                    “RECOMMENDATION”, Resource Piling stated:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the safe side, adapt the following procedure:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">i.    Compute the pile length of bore pile base on
                            ultimate skin friction of 2.5N for soil,
                                450KN/m<sup>2</sup> for sandstone and end bearing of
                            8,000 kNm<sup>2</sup>, copy of the pile length
                            calculation is enclosed in Appendix D</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">ii.    Prior to obtain approval from BCA, construct bore
                            pile base on the length stated in the pile layout plan. Pile length
                            calculation base on parameter stated in the drawing. Skin friction : 2N;
                            end bearing : 8000is enclose in appendix E.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the final analysis, Longrove must have accepted or agreed to
                    the recommendation (with minor amendments) and Longrove and the Accredited
                    Checker would have signed off on the proposal and sent it on to the BCA for
                    approval. This new design was approved by the BCA. In the original design, the
                    skin friction of the soil was 2 N KPa subject to a maximum value of 200
                        KN/m<sup>2</sup>, but the engineer subsequently increased
                    the skin friction to 2.5 N KPa (for soil) subject to a maximum value of 450
                        KN/m<sup>2</sup>. Under CP4, a maximum value of 150
                        KN/m<sup>2 </sup>is permitted for soils of Bukit Timah
                    granite and sedimentary Jurong Formation, and a maximum of 300
                        KN/m<sup>2 </sup>for dense or hard cemented soil in Old
                    Alluvium. Higher maximum values may be adopted if sufficient load tests were
                    conducted in similar soil condition.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The
                        450kN/m<sup>2</sup> was supported by the UTP test results
                    and at that time, Resource Piling would not have known that they would hit rock
                    in the construction of some 302 out of their 391 bored piles. What is undeniable
                    and not challenged by Mr Thomas Tan was that Longrove’s original design
                    for tender had used a skin friction of 2 N KPa subject to a maximum of 200
                        kN/m<sup>2</sup> with design pile lengths varying from
                    22.60m to 34.00m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span>.
                    Under the subsequent design, the skin friction increased to 2.5N subject to a
                    maximum of 450 kN/m<sup>2</sup> with design pile lengths varying
                    from 16.80m to 27.20m. After the redesign, the piles were also divided into
                    eleven sub-zones based on the location of the boreholes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    According to Mr Foo, the increase of the
                    skin friction in the design above 300 KN/m<sup>2</sup> would not
                    have been permitted by the BCA unless the material surrounding the piles was
                        rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan agreed that
                    calculations with 450 kN/m<sup>2</sup> skin friction meant skin
                    friction in rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> I accept
                    that the increase in skin friction must have meant that Longrove recognised that
                    the ground conditions were different from what was originally indicated in the
                    Geospecs Logs at the time that the piles were initially designed. The end
                    bearing load value was unchanged at 8.0 MPa, but I am not convinced by
                    Geospecs’ contention that the end bearing load value must have remained
                    unchanged because the engineer found that the Geospecs Logs were sufficiently
                    accurate for design purposes. I accept Dr Ting’s evidence that the
                    engineer did not have sufficient information to determine whether the pile could
                    bear an increased end bearing load as the UTP did not fail, and that there was
                    therefore no reason to redesign the pile on this basis.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> The consequence would
                    be that the pile was slightly overdesigned but the value would remain
                        safe.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> It must be
                    remembered that after the UTP test results, no one would know whether rock would
                    be encountered elsewhere as well. If the bored piles did encounter rock, then
                    the socketing requirement (twice the bored pile diameter) would take effect and
                    the end bearing would be much higher than 8.0 MPa<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span>. The fact that the end bearing
                    load was not changed is at most a neutral factor. Additionally, the shorter
                    lengths of the piles could be attributed to the fact that the skin friction was
                    higher than was originally anticipated under the Geospecs Logs as the actual
                    surrounding material was rock instead of soil. The piles could therefore be
                    shortened accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    There would be no reason for the pile
                    designs to be changed by Longrove, an independent third party, and neither would
                    the revised designs have been approved by the BCA if Resource Piling had not in
                    fact encountered ground conditions that were different from those recorded in
                    the Geospecs Logs. Although Mr Tan contended that the new designs of the piles
                    were still based on the SPT indicated in the Geospecs Logs<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span>, he acknowledged that the
                    increase in the skin friction to a maximum value of
                        450KN/m<sup>2</sup> meant that the engineers were basing the
                    design on the capacity of rock instead of soil.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> It is an uncontroverted fact that
                    the design was changed, and I find that the new design had been calculated on
                    the basis that Longrove accepted that the ground conditions encountered at the
                    lower layers were in fact rock instead of soil (as recorded in the Geospecs
                    Logs).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Thirdly, I find on a balance of
                    probabilities that the S &amp; F Report and their borehole logs were accurate.
                    NBH-1 was drilled in the vicinity of BH-10 and the UTP, and a layer of
                    moderately weathered Grade III greyish pink granite spotted with black and white
                    minerals was encountered from 19.80m. NBH-2 was located near BH-3 and the layer
                    extending from 19.50m to 26.50m consisted of moderately weathered Grade III
                    light greenish grey granite spotted with black, white and pink minerals. NBH-3
                    was located near BH-4 and moderately weathered Grade III light greenish grey
                    granite spotted with black and white minerals was encountered from 26.30m to
                        33.30m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> After
                    Geospecs drilled BH-11A, S &amp; F also drilled BH-11B 0.567m away from BH-11A.
                    The borehole log for BH-11B indicated that moderately weathered Grade III light
                    grey spotted with black and light pink coloured Bukit Timah Granite was
                    encountered at a depth of 21.50m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> This was followed by a layer of
                    slightly weathered Grade III spotted with black and light pink coloured light
                    grey Bukit Timah Granite at 24.90m, and a layer of moderately weathered Grade
                    III Bukit Timah Granite from 25.50m to 27.00m. Samples for all four boreholes
                    were recovered at every level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Geospecs submitted that the exact geographic
                    coordinates were not available for NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3, and that it was
                    impossible to verify whether the boreholes were in fact drilled on the precise
                    locations on the Site where the S &amp; F Report had claimed that they were
                    drilled. Geospecs also claimed that the accuracy of the S &amp; F Report was
                    suspect as Mr Ng Dick Young (“Mr Ng”) – who was a director
                    of S &amp; F and gave evidence on behalf of Resource Piling – had not been
                    present when the fieldwork for NBH-1, NBH-2 and NBH-3 was done and did not
                    personally verify the samples recovered onsite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I do not think that either of these points
                    seriously undermines the accuracy or reliability of the borelogs prepared by S
                    &amp; F. While the precise coordinates were not recorded, I am satisfied that
                    the location plan, which was plotted by S &amp; F’s geologist, provided a
                    sufficient approximation of which zone each borehole was drilled in. NBH-1 was
                    set between BP-359 and the UTP and it was surrounded by BP-437, BP-348 and
                    BP-360; NBH-2 was surrounded by BH-3, BP-71, BP-52, BP-56 and BP-75 and NBH-3
                    was surrounded by BH-4, BP-202, BP-198, BP-176, BP-177, BP-179, BP-203 and
                    BP-204. S &amp; F was an independent third party and Geospecs quite rightly did
                    not challenge their impartiality at any point in cross-examination, and I do not
                    see any ground for suspecting that the locations indicated in the S &amp; F
                    Report were misrepresented. I also do not think that I can draw any conclusions
                    from the fact that Mr Ng was not personally involved in the fieldwork. Mr Ng
                    testified that he had looked at photographs of the rock cores recovered before
                    certifying the S &amp; F Report<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>, and I cannot realistically draw any
                    inference that the borehole logs were inaccurate or that the fieldwork was not
                    conducted properly merely because Mr Ng was not personally involved in the
                    recording and compilation of the borehole logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    I pause to make my findings on Mr Ng’s
                    evidence. Mr Ng was first cross-examined on 26 June 2012. It was evident that
                    something was amiss because he looked quite distracted and disturbed when he
                    came on the stand. It appears that he rushed down to court and when his driver
                    stopped at the front of the court, a policeman came up and fined his driver. His
                    text message to Mr Leo’s junior read: “I came here but was fined by
                    the courts when my driver stopped me. I don’t think I am in the right
                    frame of mind to attend the court.” I acceded to Mr Leo’s request
                    to halt proceedings for five to ten minutes while he tried to calm Mr Ng down.
                    Nonetheless, even after that short break, it certainly looked as if some of Mr
                    Thomas Tan’s questions were not registering and Mr Ng’s answers were
                    suspect. I noted this at the end of the day. The next day, Mr Ng appeared to
                    have recovered and was able to respond to the questions fielded to him very
                    coherently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    I find Geospecs’ attack on Mr
                    Ng’s absence from the Site and the conduct of the drilling and recording
                    of the borelogs by Mr Ng’s staff somewhat ironic in view of what went on
                    in Geospecs’ own soil investigation. The inevitable commercial pressures
                    put on engineers involved in geotechnical soil investigation means they cannot
                    be at each and every site. I accept the evidence of Mr Ng and the accuracy of S
                    &amp; F’s soil investigation results. S &amp; F is an established soil
                    investigation outfit and has been an ISO 9000 certified company since the late
                    1990s. Its staff members are trained and operating procedures are in place. Mr
                    Wada acknowledged its reputation. I also accept and agree with the evidence of
                    Mr Ng that there are different types of sampling methods that can be employed
                    for different s conditions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>; if no sample is recovered with one
                    method, another method should be employed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> A sample can be recovered by using a core
                    barrel to core and Mr Ng stated that where there was a possibility that the
                    lower layers contained moderately weathered material, they would core to
                    retrieve a sample<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>. Even Mr
                    Tan, Geospecs’ director, agreed that where the SPT penetration was 1cm or
                    2cm, using a core barrel would give him a chance to recover a
                        sample.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span> Mr Ng
                    did not directly receive his instructions from Resource Piling and did not know
                    of the background to this particular soil investigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> I find the recording of the S
                    &amp; F borelogs, sample retrieval and core identification much more
                    professional than Geospecs’ work. They retrieved samples where Geospecs
                    did not or could not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In my judgment, the borelog for BH-11B is
                    also irreconcilable with the borelogs for BH-11 and BH-11A. All three boreholes
                    were at most 1.5m apart. BH-11B indicated that there was Grade III Bukit Timah
                    Granite from 21.50m to 27.00m. Mr Okkar<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> and Mr Wada<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> both accepted the accuracy of
                    BH-11B. In contrast, BH-11 indicated that residual soil in the form of silty
                    fine to coarse sand with fine to medium gravel was encountered from 17.20m to
                    22.30m and residual soil in the form of sandy silt from the Jurong Formation
                    from 22.30m to 27.02m; samples were not recovered from 27.00m to 27.02m. BH-11A
                    indicated that the layer from a depth of 20.40m to 22.50m contained residual
                    soil in the form of silty fine to medium sand, and from 22.50m to 27.02m, it was
                    inferred that this layer contained completely weathered sandstone from the
                    Jurong Formation; samples were not recovered from 24.00m to
                27.02m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Mr Okkar averred that he had used the same
                    method to drill BH-11A as Mr Tun Tun did for BH-11; he continued drilling as
                    there was no rebound when the SPT was conducted and took about one day to drill
                    the three metres from 24.00m to 27.02m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> No samples were recovered from a depth
                    of 24.00m and Mr Okkar explained that he had “inferred” the soil
                    description from the sand contained in the return water from the
                        borehole.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> While Mr
                    Okkar contended that it was possible to find a wide variance in the properties
                    of soil within a short distance, it appears to me that at the same level,
                        <em>ie</em>, from about 22.00m to 27.00m, both the
                    physical properties and the geological nature of the rock formations differed
                    rather widely across the three boreholes. I would also observe, as noted above,
                    that Geospecs’ own expert witness Dr Wada conceded that he could not
                    explain this difference.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> As
                    complete samples of the rock core were recovered for BH-11B and seen and
                    accepted by both Mr Okkar<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> and Dr Ting<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>, I find that BH-11B
                    was a more accurate reflection of the soil profile within that specific area. Mr
                    Okkar had no other option but to accept the findings of S &amp; F, including the
                    rock samples recovered, notwithstanding that the results clearly differed from
                    the borehole logs produced by Geospecs for BH-11 and BH-11A. The latter had the
                    notation “inferred” in the description of the final soil layer
                    when Geospecs failed to recover a sample. In my experience I have never seen a
                    borelog of a soil investigator which infers the soil in a layer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    On balance, I therefore accept the veracity
                    and accuracy of the borehole logs produced by S &amp; F. It is an independent
                    and reputable soil investigation company and had no reason to be partial to any
                    party. I acknowledge that the soil investigation work by S &amp; F covered a
                    much more limited area, but it suffices to illustrate that the methods adopted
                    by Geospecs contributed to a higher probability that the soil conditions at the
                    lower layers were not correctly determined by Geospecs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Fourthly, as between Dr Ting’s and Mr
                    Wada’s expert opinions on whether the Geospecs Logs were accurate and the
                    reasons for the disparity between the different sets of records of the soil
                    profile of the Site, I prefer Dr Ting’s evidence. Dr Ting expressed the
                    view that the reason for the disparity between the Geospecs Logs and the Boring
                    Logs at the lower levels was because Mr Tun Tun had failed to core when the SPT
                    values fell below 100/3 cm and had continued to drill instead.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span> As a result, no
                    samples could be recovered and the geologist was unable to make an assessment as
                    to whether the layer contained soil or rock, and the layers (with SPT values
                    below 100/3 cm) that had been described as Grade VI residual soil in BH-1 to
                    BH-11 could in fact have been Grade III or Grade IV rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> It was possible for
                    the tungsten carbide drill used by Geospecs to cut through weaker Grade III
                        rock.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Dr
                    Ting also explained that while certain bored piles did not hit rock, the pile
                    length was shorter than the depth at which the rock layer started; consequently,
                    while no rock was encountered, it could not be concluded that there was no rock
                    at the deeper levels of the cross-section.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Dr Ting’s overall position was
                    that while the SPT values recorded in the Geospecs Logs were correct<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span>, the description and
                    classification of the ground materials were incorrect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> Mr Wada opined that the
                    Geospecs Logs could be trusted and that the engineers had accepted it as a
                    matter of judgment although there had been no physical recovery of
                        samples.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span>
                    While Mr Wada did not respond directly to Dr Ting’s explanation as to why
                    the soil had possibly been described inaccurately at the lower levels, Mr Wada
                    suggested that the Site was a boulder area based on the borehole logs for BH-5
                    and BH-6.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_109" id="Ftn_109_1"><sup>[note: 109]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I also accept Dr Ting’s evidence
                    (which relied on CP4) that where Bukit Timah Granite is concerned, it is
                    particularly important to distinguish between Grades II, IV, V and VI as there
                    is a significant difference in the engineering behaviour of each of these
                    grades. As noted above, CP4 also states that typically there is only limited
                    Grade V and Grade IV material below the usual thick layer of residual soil and
                    recommends careful and frequent sampling once the penetrational resistance in
                    the SPT reaches 30 blows/300mm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> This was something Geospecs
                    clearly failed to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    With respect, I find Mr Wada’s expert
                    evidence of limited assistance in explaining the disparity between the Geospecs
                    Logs and the Boring Logs. I accept that differential weathering and the
                    possibility of boulders on the Site may explain the occasional presence of rock,
                    but it appears to me to be highly improbable that rock would be consistently
                    encountered across the Site for these two reasons. As noted above, Mr Wada
                    conceded that he was not able to explain the variations between BH-11, BH-11A
                    and BH-11B, whilst Dr Ting was able to proffer a consistent and coherent theory
                    that satisfactorily explained the results of the Geospecs Logs, Boring Logs and
                    S &amp; F Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Fifthly, I find that Geospecs’
                    confirmatory boreholes BH-1A and BH-11A were drilled during a weekend and
                    Resource Piling was not informed so that it could not send representatives to
                    witness the drilling. Mr Tan explained that Mr Okkar had communicated the time
                    of drilling to Mr Babu but the latter had failed to inform Resource
                        Piling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>
                    However, I note that Mr Babu was not called as a witness to establish this fact.
                    I find this excuse quite suspicious and self-serving. Geospecs knew there was a
                    claim by Resource Piling that they had encountered rock over large areas in the
                    site. That was the very reason why the confirmatory boreholes were being done in
                    the first place. Mr Tan also claimed that Mr Sinnadurai witnessed the drilling
                    of the two confirmatory boreholes and checked the termination depth.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> However he too was not
                    called nor did a Professional Engineer sign off on the findings of
                    Geospecs’ confirmatory borelogs as no report was produced and Mr Tan
                    claimed that Mr Sinnadurai’s certification was therefore not
                        required.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> I
                    have already commented on the lack of sample recovery in the lowest levels of
                    BH-1A (24.00m-27.02m) and BH-11A (24.00m-27.02m) which inevitably led to the
                    lower layers being described as “inferred”. I additionally note
                    that the description of these lowest layers from each borehole did not really
                    correspond to the two layers above for each borehole. I find that no competent
                    engineer could say that these two borelogs confirmed the findings in BH-1 and
                    BH-11. On the other hand, as noted above, the Resident Engineer countersigned on
                    Resource Piling’s Boring Logs and I accept that Resource Piling recovered
                    samples from their boring which were kept by the Resident Engineer for
                    inspection by the Accredited Checker or Developer. Both the Accredited Checker
                    and Developer must have been satisfied and agreed with Resource Piling because
                    the Boring Logs were compiled and sent in together with the As-Built Pile
                    Drawings, duly signed by the Professional Engineer and Accredited Checker, to
                    the BCA. If the Resident Engineer or Longrove had any reservations, I cannot see
                    them signing off these records and drawings for submission and retention by the
                    BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In summary, I find that Geospecs’ soil
                    investigation was negligently carried out and the Geospecs Logs were negligently
                    logged and inaccurate, but as I have found that no duty of care exists <em>vis-à-vis</em> Resource Piling and Geospecs, it is not
                    necessary to consider whether any such hypothetical duty has been breached. If
                    it was necessary to do so, then I would have found that Geospecs was negligent
                    and had breached that duty of care if it existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    For the reasons set out above, I dismiss
                    Resource Piling’s claim on the basis that Geospecs did not owe any duty of
                    care to Resource Piling in relation to the preparation of the Geospecs
                    Logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I will hear the parties on
                costs.</p>
