<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by Mr Tetsuya Motomura
                    (“the Defendant”) to set aside the Writ of Summons (“the
                    Writ”) or the service of the Writ on him by Omae Capital Management Pte
                    Ltd (“the Plaintiff”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Plaintiff procured the issuance of the Writ
                    on 2 October 2014, claiming substantial loss and damage against the Defendant on
                    account of the Defendant’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and/or
                    deceit during the latter’s brief tenure as the Plaintiff’s Chief
                    Investment Officer. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had deliberately
                    concealed investigations by the Department of Justice, United States of America,
                    into the Defendant’s participation in London Interbank Offered
                    Rate (“LIBOR”) manipulation. The Plaintiff further alleged,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that in employing the Defendant as
                    the Plaintiff’s Chief Investment Officer, it had relied on the
                    Defendant’s representation that he was not subject to any proceedings of a
                    disciplinary or criminal nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Pursuant to an <em>ex
                        parte</em> Order of Court dated 16 October 2014, the Plaintiff
                    obtained leave to serve the Writ on the Defendant out of jurisdiction at the
                    Defendant’s residence in Tokyo. The Writ was served on 23 October 2014 by
                    registered mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 26 November 2014, the Defendant filed the
                    present summons challenging the jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore. On
                    11 December 2014, the Plaintiff’s Japanese solicitor served the Writ and a
                    Japanese translation thereof on the Defendant via registered mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the hearing on 9 January 2015, counsel for
                    the Defendant, Mr Walter Ferix (“Mr Ferix”) withdrew the prayer
                    for an order to set aside the Writ, but maintained that service of the Writ
                    ought to be set aside due to irregularity in service.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It was undisputed that there was no Civil
                    Procedure Convention providing for service of court processes between Singapore
                    and Japan. As such, the parties agreed that the Writ may be served on the
                    Defendant in accordance with O 11 r 4(2)(c) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”).</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff additionally relied on O 11 r 3(3)

<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>3. Service of originating process

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The parties also recognised that pursuant to O
                    11 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court, the court may not make any order or direction
                    which “shall authorise or require the doing of anything in a country in
                    which service is to be effected which is contrary to the law of that
                    country”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Two issues arose for consideration in the
                    present application:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, whether the Plaintiff’s
                        service of the Writ was irregular; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, if so, whether this court should exercise its
                        discretion to cure the irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Whether the Plaintiff’s service of the Writ
                was irregular</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Ferix argued that service of the Writ was
                    irregular. He raised three arguments in this regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, he pointed out that service
                        in Japan had to be effected by a competent district court of Japan, through
                        a “special delivery”, with a Japanese translation of the Writ.
                        According to the Defendant’s expert, Mr Genta Irie (“Mr
                        Irie”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">

                            of the service of process regarding an international civil case.

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The method of service of a Singapore writ in Japan was

                                (“<em>SRS Commerce</em>”) at [6],
                            where Choo Han Teck J noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There is little doubt that the service was not properly effected.

                            present case was not served by a court clerk authorised by the Japanese
                            court. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Mr Ferix
                        argued that delivery by mail is an “unlawful” method of
                        service in Japan. In support of this argument, Mr Irie cited a Japanese
                        textbook titled <em>International Civil Procedure
                            Law</em> (2005) (“<em>International Civil
                            Procedure Law</em>”), which stated (as translated into
                        English) at p 119:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If service of process is made to a country with which no treaty exists
                            or bilateral judicial assistance agreement has been executed, the
                            service lacks legal foundation under international laws. As such,
                                <em>personal delivery and personal delivery by mail
                                as previously described are clearly unlawful methods of service
                                under Japanese law</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Another passage found in <em>International
                                Civil Procedure Law</em> stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">3. Services by Direct Delivery and Direct Mailing</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">What becomes the most significant issue in services performed in Japan
                            for foreign cases is the legality of services by direct delivery and
                            direct mailing to the recipient of the service, which often occurs in
                            the services from common law nations, where the method of service is
                            different from that of Japan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">As described above, for services for countries with which Japan has no
                            treaty or arrangement for bilateral judicial assistance, since there are
                            no grounds related to international law, <em>such direct
                                delivery and direct mailing are clearly an illegal service under

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, Mr Ferix
                        contended that the Plaintiff’s reliance on the decision of the Supreme
                        Court of Japan in <em>Kishinchando Naridas Sadhwani,
                            Sadhwanis Japan v Sadhwani, Gobindram Sadhwani</em> (Case No
                        1838(O) of 1994 dated 28 April 1998) (“<em>Sadhwani</em>”) was misplaced, as <em>Sadhwani</em> was a case relating to the enforcement of foreign
                        judgments rather than to the service of originating processes. Mr Irie
                        agreed that in the context of enforcement of a foreign judgment,
                        irregularities in service could be cured if the defendant knew about the
                        proceedings and had an unobstructed right to defend. However, he opined that
                        there were “very different considerations when examining irregular
                        service at the enforcement stage as opposed to commencement of
                            action”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was because, at the
                        enforcement stage, refusing enforcement on the ground of an irregularity in
                        service would involve substantial prejudice to the plaintiff since the
                        plaintiff had already obtained a judgment and had (it is presumed) gone
                        through the legal process. In contrast, at the commencement stage, the
                        defendant has not yet substantively contested the proceedings.
                        Irregularities at the commencement stage should therefore “be more
                        closely scrutinised so as to allow the Defendant his full due
                            process”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Arvind Daas
                    Naaidu (“Mr Naaidu”) raised three arguments to support his
                    contention that service of the Writ was regular.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, he argued that Mr
                        Irie’s reliance on the <em>International Judicial
                            Cooperation Manual</em> (see [10(a)] above) was misplaced, because
                        according to the Plaintiff’s expert, Mr Iida Toyohiro (“Mr
                        Toyohiro”), the manual applied only to instances of service of a
                        foreign originating process in Japan “<u>if and only
                            if</u> there subsists a Civil Procedure Convention and/or exists
                        a concluded or executed bilateral judicial assistance agreement between that
                        foreign country and Japan” [emphasis in original].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                        However, it should be noted that Mr Irie conceded that the manual was not
                        strictly applicable in situations where there is no Civil Procedure
                        Convention between the foreign country and Japan, but emphasised that the
                        point he was trying to make was that regular service in Japan can only be
                        achieved by a central authority, a designated authority or by a court with
                            jurisdiction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Mr Toyohiro interpreted the <em>Sadhwani</em> decision to mean that in the absence of a Civil
                        Procedure Convention subsisting between an originating country and Japan,
                        the service of a foreign process from the originating country need not
                        comply with the requirements of the Japanese Code of Civil Procedure
                        (“CCP”) so long as the defendant knew about the commencement
                        of the foreign proceedings and his right of defence was not
                            obstructed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Mr Naaidu
                        emphasised that similar observations had been made by Professor Nozomi Tada
                        (in an article titled “Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
                        Judgments” (2003) 46 Japanese Annual of International Law 75
                        (“Professor Tada’s article”)) and Mr Masahiro
                        Nakatsukasa (for the “Japan” entry in Mark Moedritzer &amp;
                        Kay C Whittaker, gen ed, <em>Enforcement of Foreign Judgments
                            in 28 jurisdictions worldwide 2013</em> at p 71).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> While <em>Sadhwani</em> was a case decided in the context of the
                        enforcement of foreign judgments, the issue of service was considered by the
                        Supreme Court of Japan and the decision was therefore relevant to the
                        present case. Mr Toyohiro disagreed with Mr Irie’s reliance on
                            <em>International Civil Procedure Law</em> on the
                        basis that the commentary by the authors of that textbook was
                        “plainly contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court of Japan [in
                            <em>Sadhwani</em>]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, Mr Naaidu pointed out that in a 1989 meeting of
                        the Hague Conference on Private International Law Special Commission
                        (“the 1989 Hague Conference”), the Japanese Government stated
                        that it did not consider the use of mail or postal channels to send judicial
                        documents to be an infringement of its sovereign power.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In my view, the Plaintiff’s service of
                    the Writ by registered mail was irregular.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the authorities cited by Mr
                        Naaidu and Mr Toyohiro (see [11(b)] above) related to the enforcement of
                        foreign judgments, rather than the setting aside of service of process at
                        the commencement of proceedings. They were therefore not directly relevant
                        to the issue before this court. In this regard, it should be noted that in
                            <em>SRS Commerce</em>, Choo J had expressly
                        considered <em>Sadhwani</em> and observed that the
                        provision relied upon in <em>Sadhwani</em> (<em>ie</em>, Article 118 of the CCP) applied only to
                        “final and binding” judgments (see also <em>SRS
                            Commerce</em> at [7]). Choo J emphasised that <em>Sadhwani</em> did not stand for the proposition that
                        “defendants who contest proceedings with actual knowledge of the
                        commencement of actions cannot raise arguments on irregular service”
                            (<em>SRS Commerce</em> at [8]). Before me, the
                        parties agreed that the positions taken in <em>SRS
                            Commerce</em> concerning the validity of service by mail in Japan
                        (in general) and the applicability of <em>Sadhwani</em>
                        (in particular) were findings of fact and therefore not strictly binding on
                        this court. However, that did not preclude me from adopting Choo J’s
                        compelling reasoning, particularly since <em>SRS
                            Commerce</em> concerned the very same decision of the Supreme
                        Court of Japan. Furthermore, Choo J’s findings did not seem
                        contradicted by the evidence before me, and indeed, appeared to be supported
                        by the expert opinion provided by Mr Irie. This was so, for instance, with
                        regard to the point that there is a principled distinction between (a)
                        resisting enforcement on the ground that the originating process had not
                        been validly served; and (b) setting aside the service of a writ at the
                        commencement of proceedings on the same ground (see [10(c)] above). I would
                        also add, for completeness, that in Professor Tada’s article (which
                        was cited by Mr Toyohiro in support of the Plaintiff’s position), the
                        learned author in fact recognised that service by “mailing of
                        judicial documents to a defendant by plaintiff’s lawyers is not valid
                        under Japanese domestic law”, and cautioned that one “might
                        encounter problems in Japan if service were accomplished by
                        mail”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, while the Japanese Government had taken the position at the 1989
                        Hague Conference that service by mail did not infringe its sovereign power,
                        it is necessary to have regard to the fuller context in which the Japanese
                        delegation indicated its position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Japan has not declared that it objects to the sending of judicial
                            documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad. In this
                            connection, Japan has made it clear that no objection to the use of
                            postal channels for sending judicial documents to persons in Japan
                                <em>does not necessarily imply that the sending by
                                such a method is considered valid service in Japan</em>; it
                            merely indicates that Japan does not consider it as infringement of its
                            sovereign power. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>From the extract, the Japanese delegation appeared to
                            emphasise that while Japan was not objecting to the use of postal
                            channels, this did not imply that sending documents by mail was
                            considered valid service in Japan. A plain textual interpretation of
                            this statement appeared to lend support to the position that service by
                            mail was not valid service in Japan. Indeed, it should be noted that in
                            Professor Tada’s article, the learned author cited a decision of
                            the Tokyo District Court (referred to by Professor Tada as “Tokyo
                            District Court, Judgment, March 25, 1990, <em>Kinyu Shoji
                                Hanrei</em> No. 857 p. 39”) which held that the
                            Japanese Government’s position, as expressed at the 1989 Hague
                            Conference, is “not to be understood as having positively
                            introduced a new method of service which foreign States are to
                            follow”. Mr Naaidu submitted, in response to a query by this
                            court, that the Japanese Government was simply being “mindful not
                            to declare such service <em>ipso facto</em> valid
                            in all circumstances”, and that the validity of service should be
                            assessed “on the particular circumstances of each
                                case”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                            However, apart from Mr Toyohiro’s personal interpretation of
                                <em>Sadhwani</em> and several articles on the
                            enforcement of foreign judgments in Japan, no evidence was adduced to
                            support Mr Naaidu’s submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I therefore found that the Plaintiff’s
                    service of the Writ by registered mail was irregular, and now turn to consider
                    if this court should exercise its discretion to cure the irregularity in
                    service.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: Whether this court should exercise its discretion
                to cure the irregularity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     That there is discretion to cure the
                    irregularity in service is undisputed by the parties. If authority is needed, it
                    may be found in <em>SRS Commerce</em> at [9]–[15],
                    citing <em>ITC Global Holdings Pte Ltd (In Liquidation) v ITC Ltd
                        and others</em> [2011] SGHC 150 (“<em>ITC Global
                        Holdings</em>”) at [42]–[50] (in turn citing the English
                    cases of <em>Golden Ocean Assurance Ltd and World Mariner
                        Shipping S A v Christopher Julian Martin and others</em> [1990] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 215 (“<em>The Goldean
                    Mariner</em>”) and <em>Phillips and another v Symes
                        and others (No 3)</em> [2008] 1 WLR 180 (“<em>Phillips</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     While the court clearly has discretion to cure
                    irregularities in service, the validation of a breach of a procedural rule must
                    depend on all the circumstances of the case (<em>ITC Global
                        Holdings</em> at [42]). It is therefore useful to consider the
                    pertinent facts of each of the abovementioned cases, in order to discern how the
                    courts have exercised discretion to cure irregularities in service.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>SRS
                            Commerce</em>, Choo J found that service by post was invalid under
                        Japanese law. However, he noted that the defendants had actually taken steps
                        to defend the proceedings (<em>SRS Commerce</em> at
                        [11]). After entering appearance, the 1st defendant had filed an affidavit
                        and, in compliance with a freezing order, had also filed a list of assets
                            (<em>ibid</em>). There were also exchanges of
                        correspondence between the parties’ solicitors (<em>ibid</em> at [12]–[14]). Choo J noted that the defendants
                        had already been given substantive advice “not only in respect of the
                        claim, but also on the freezing order” (<em>ibid</em> at [14]). In the circumstances, Choo J exercised his
                        discretion to cure the irregularity because the defendants “knew that
                        process had been instituted against them in Singapore”, and were
                        “constantly advised by Singapore lawyers and cannot now say that the
                        irregularity in service justified their application to set aside the
                        process” (<em>ibid</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     In <em>ITC Global
                            Holdings</em>, the plaintiff filed a request for service of the
                        writ out of Singapore with the Supreme Court of Singapore, and specifically
                        requested that the relevant documents be sent to the relevant authorities in
                        India (<em>ITC Global Holdings</em> at [23]).
                        Thereafter, the plaintiff played no role in the service of the writ, and
                        left matters entirely to the Registry of the Supreme Court of Singapore, the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the relevant Indian authorities (<em>ibid</em>). The plaintiff was subsequently provided with
                        a copy of an endorsement from the process server, stating that the writ had
                        been served on the defendants (<em>ibid</em> at [24]).
                        However, it transpired that the service was irregular because the plaintiff
                        failed to show that the entity that it served the writ on was in fact an
                        agent for the defendants (<em>ibid</em> at [35]). Lee
                        Seiu Kin J exercised his discretion to cure the irregularity in service
                        because (i) the defendants were apprised of the proceedings and had taken
                        steps to contest them, thus suffering no prejudice; and (ii) the plaintiff
                        had “done all that he could to effect service” (<em>ibid</em> at [49]). Indeed, the plaintiff had even
                        received a copy of an endorsement from the process server indicating that
                        the writ had been successfully served (<em>ibid</em>).
                        Lee J further noted that the parties had been involved in the suit for
                        “almost a decade” and that “in the light of the several
                        assiduous attempts at service and the defendants’ knowledge of such
                        attempts and of the proceedings, the procedural defects are illusory”
                            (<em>ibid</em> at [50]). To fail to cure the
                        irregularities “would cause undue prejudice to [the plaintiff] by
                        denying its right to a hearing” (<em>ibid</em>).
                        It should be noted that the factors considered by Lee J in deciding whether
                        to exercise discretion to cure irregularities in service were also cited in
                            <em>Astro Nusantara International BV v PT Ayunda Prima
                            Mitra</em> [2013] 1 SLR 636 at [61].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>The Goldean
                            Mariner</em>, there were two categories of defendants who had
                        experienced procedural irregularities in service: (i) defendants who
                        received wrongly addressed writs which were meant for other defendants in
                        the suit, although the writs were accurate in every other respect; and (ii)
                        defendants who were only served with a form of acknowledgement of service,
                        with no writ actually served on them. The English Court of Appeal emphasised
                        that the court’s exercise of discretion to cure irregularities in
                        service “is likely to depend upon whether it appears that the
                        opposite party has suffered prejudice as a direct consequence of the
                        particular irregularity”. On the facts, the defendants frankly
                        accepted that they could not point to any prejudice suffered. The court (by
                        a majority) exercised its discretion to cure the irregularity in the first
                        category. The majority judges noted that the defendants had each received a
                        copy of the writ, were parties to the contract in question, and knew about
                        the cause of action. They emphasised that “[the defendants] all took
                        the same prompt action” by putting the matter in the hands of their
                        London solicitors, and that “[none of the defendants] was in any way
                        misled by the mistake; and, indeed, none of them has ever suggested that it
                        was”. The majority judges also cured the irregularity in the second
                        category because the there was no doubt in the minds of those defendants
                        regarding the proceedings that were initiated against them. In contrast, the
                        dissenting judge opined that the defect in service was “very
                        serious”, that the “conduct of the plaintiffs excites little
                        sympathy”, and that it was “important” to remain
                        cognisant that the matter at hand involved service out of jurisdiction on
                        defendants who “owe[d] [the English courts] no allegiance”.
                        The dissenting judge also surmised that the judge below, who was “an
                        experienced commercial judge”, would have agreed with his refusal to
                        cure the irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     In <em>Phillips</em>, documents
                        required to be served on the defendants were forwarded by an English court
                        to the relevant legal authorities in Switzerland. However, the enclosed
                        English language claim form was erroneously stamped “[n]ot for
                        service out of the jurisdiction”. The error was noticed by the
                        claimants’ solicitors and the official at the foreign process section
                        of the English court (who proceeded to accept the document for service). The
                        documents were then forwarded to the relevant legal authorities in
                        Switzerland for service. It transpired that the Swiss court removed the
                        English language claim form (but not the German translation of it) from the
                        package before serving the documents on the 2nd defendant. It also
                        transpired that no documents were served on the 3rd defendant due to an
                        error on the part of the Swiss Post Office. The House of Lords found that
                        the “essential faults” in service were those of the Swiss
                        authorities rather than the plaintiffs, and that to deny the effectiveness
                        of service would lead to part of the claims being compromised because
                        neither the English nor the Swiss courts would have had jurisdiction over
                        the entire set of claims (see <em>Phillips</em> at
                        [38]). The House of Lords considered the power to dispense with service
                        under r 6.9 of the English Civil Procedure Rules (“CPR”).
                        However, Lord Brown observed in his leading judgment (with which the other
                        members of the court agreed) that even without resort to the dispensation
                        with service, it was “at least arguable” that the court could
                        simply order under r 3.10(b) of the CPR (<em>ie</em>,
                        the English equivalent of O 2 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court) that the
                        defendants “be regarded as properly served” (<em>Phillips</em> at [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     From the above analysis, it appeared that
                    there were at least three factors to be considered in deciding whether or not to
                    cure an irregularity in service out of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first factor concerned whether
                        the <em>defendant</em> was apprised of the proceedings.
                        This is a “highly significant” factor; if the defendant was in
                        fact apprised of and took steps to contest the proceedings, he would
                        probably have suffered no prejudice (<em>ITC Global
                            Holdings</em> at [49]). While the Defendant in the present case
                        did come to know of the Writ, he did not actually take any active steps to
                        contest the proceedings at all. This was unlike the defendants in <em>SRS Commerce</em>, who entered into correspondence with
                        the plaintiffs and were found to have taken active steps in the proceedings
                        (including filing affidavits concerning their assets). While the Defendant
                        did enter an appearance, this was mandated by the rule concerning a dispute
                        as to jurisdiction (see O 12 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court). The
                        Defendant’s immediate step after entering appearance was, as is also
                        prescribed in the said rule, to file the present application to set aside
                        service of the Writ on grounds of irregularity. The present situation
                        therefore appeared to be different from that in <em>SRS
                            Commerce</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second factor concerned whether the <em>plaintiff</em> had properly done all that he could to
                        effect service (<em>ITC Global Holdings</em> at [49];
                        and see <em>Phillips</em> at [38]). If a plaintiff had
                        done all that he could, the court may be more amenable to exercising its
                        discretion to cure irregularities in service (see [15(b)] and [15(d)]
                        above). In the present case, the Plaintiff had, on its own volition, simply
                        sent the Writ to the Defendant by registered mail. This should be contrasted
                        with the effort expended by the plaintiffs in both <em>ITC
                            Global Holdings</em> and <em>Phillips.</em>
                        On balance, in the present case, I did not think it could be said that the
                        Plaintiff had done all that it could to serve the Writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third factor concerned whether the
                            <em>plaintiff</em> would be unduly prejudiced
                        should the court refuse to cure the irregularities in service. A plaintiff
                        would likely be unduly prejudiced where, for instance, a defendant attempts
                        to set aside service on the ground of irregularity after proceedings have
                        already run their course (such as in <em>Sadhwani</em>;
                        and see [10(c)] and [12(a)] above). There might also be undue prejudice to
                        the plaintiff if the failure to cure irregularities in service would result
                        in claims (or part thereof) being forsaken (see <em>ITC
                            Global Holdings</em> at [48]; and see [15(d)] above), if
                        substantive proceedings have been unnecessarily delayed due to a
                        “myriad [of] procedural obstacles” (<em>ITC
                            Global Holdings</em> at [50]), or if it would effectively amount
                        to “denying [a plaintiff’s] right to a hearing”
                            (<em>ibid</em>). In the present case, the Plaintiff
                        was unable to show how it would be unduly prejudiced in the event that
                        service of the Writ is set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having considered these factors, I declined to
                    exercise the discretion to cure the irregularity in service of the Writ. While
                    the fact that the Defendant was aware of the Writ is certainly an important
                    factor, it should be noted that this was not the <em>only</em> factor considered in both <em>ITC Global
                        Holdings</em> and <em>Phillips</em>. Should the
                    irregularity in the present case be cured, it might suggest that a plaintiff is
                    entitled to serve a Singapore originating process on a defendant in Japan in
                    whatever manner the plaintiff so desires, and that so long as the defendant
                    becomes aware of the originating process, there will not be a need to comply
                    with any rules on service. Indeed, this was precisely what the Plaintiff did in
                    this case. If the Plaintiff’s actions were countenanced and the
                    irregularity in service cured, it may well suggest that rules on service of
                    process out of Singapore (such as O 11 rr 3(3) and 4(2)(c) of the Rules of
                    Court) may be flouted with impunity and the door will be open to methods of
                    service of originating processes that have not hitherto been
                    contemplated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For the reasons above, I granted the
                    Defendant’s application for setting aside the service of the
                Writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On the issue of costs, I noted that additional
                    rounds of affidavits and hearings were necessitated because the Defendant had
                    failed to exhibit some of the evidence of foreign law that he had sought to rely
                    on. I had earlier asked parties to make submissions on costs prior to the
                    outcome of the present decision. Having considered those submissions as well as
                    the circumstances of the case, I fixed costs to the Defendant of $3,000, all
                    inclusive.</p>
