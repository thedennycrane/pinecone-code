AGMS therefore sought a preliminary hearing on an urgent basis for two purposes: to determine whether the arbitration ought to be proceeded with, and also to request interim relief from the Tribunal in the form of an interim injunction preventing RALL from terminating the Master Agreement.

In this regard, RALL’s main argument was that the Master Agreement – the underlying contract in the arbitral proceedings – was procured by bribes given by AGMS’s Mr Senadhipathi to the chairman of RALL at the time, Mr Waduge Palitha Piyasiri Fernando (“Mr Fernando”), noting that both men had been indicted in the Sri Lankan High Court and Magistrates’ Court on charges of bribery and corruption.

Further, the object of the MOU was solely to resolve disputes regarding the monies owed to RALL, and in this regard AGMS had fulfilled its obligations under the MOU with the payment of Rs 165 million, whereas RALL had failed to ensure the continuity of the Master Agreement, which went to the root of the MOU. Thus the dispute referred to in AGMS’s statement of claim was still alive. The Tribunal noted RALL had not established to the Tribunal how it could resile from this scenario and it has failed to impress upon the Tribunal anything to the contrary. The Tribunal was of the view that AGMS had provided sufficient reasons as to why the arbitration should proceed and ruled that it will proceed with the arbitration in its Interim Order dated 19 December 2015.

</div>
</div> the arbitral proceedings remained live and the Tribunal’s mandate never came to an end. AGMS argued that it was no longer obliged to take that step as RALL had failed to ensure the continuity of the Master Agreement. Hence their original claims still remained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 What RALL did, instead of engaging in the arbitral process, was therefore <span class="font-italic">to write</span> an economically worded letter to the SIAC, not the Tribunal, stating that the dispute had been settled and “it is no longer required to proceed with the above matter.” Thereafter, despite being given notice that AGMS disputed the same and was asking the Tribunal to rule the arbitration was still afoot, RALL chose to stay away from the arbitration proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The MOU should also be viewed in the context of the Master Agreement and the claims brought by AGMS under its Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim, which was before the Tribunal. At the hearing before the Tribunal, AGMS produced the MOU, which was in Sinhalese, and provided a translation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The contents of the MOU are also important: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It acknowledges, in what would be characterised as the recitals, the existence of the Master Agreement, the six projects and acknowledged a further agreement to operate two further projects. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It also stated that the “aforesaid parties are bound by the said respective agreements to operate the aforementioned projects and whilst the aforesaid agreements are still in force, the parties hereby agree to enter this new agreement on October 20, 2015 thereby mutually agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions…” </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It goes on to state: “Furthermore, this agreement is limited in scope to the relevant monitory [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] transactions specified therein.” </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The MOU then goes on to provide for AGMS to pay fairly significant sums of money, described as “arrears”, to RALL, provisions on computation and these clauses also appear on their face to reflect discounted sums for the payments of arrears. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The only other clause not reflecting these payments of arrears, computation or reference of confirmation by way of an audit is Cl 5 (cited at [44] above) which, for completeness, also provided that RALL shall take action to terminate proceedings in relation to RALL’s letter of demand to AGMS claiming Rs 500,000,000 for damages caused to reputation and monetary losses caused to RALL and terminate legal proceedings initiated against AGMS.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 At the preliminary hearing, AGMS informed the Tribunal that although they had fulfilled their obligations by making payment to RALL as stipulated in the MOU, RALL had not fulfilled their obligations under the Master Agreement and the claims and matters in the arbitration were still live. AGMS therefore wished to proceed with the arbitration. The Tribunal, after due deliberation, ruled in favour of AGMS and continued with the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I agree with the Tribunal’s ruling that its mandate had not terminated. If there was evidence that the position was otherwise, then RALL cannot complain because it chose to stay away from the arbitration and not provide any evidence or submissions refuting AGMS’s claims and contentions. I also agree that on the facts and contentions of AGMS that were before the Tribunal and on the terms of the MOU taken in context, there is no compelling case on a balance of probabilities that all disputes between the parties had been settled and that the mandate to continue with the arbitration had ended. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Article 34(2)(a)(iii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Secondly, in these proceedings, RALL seeks to set aside the Final Award dated 24 November 2016 pursuant to Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law (I address its case on s 24 IAA below). It should be noted that these proceedings are therefore neither enforcement proceedings brought by AGMS nor RALL defending itself against enforcement proceedings. RALL is making an application at the seat to set aside the Final Award rendered by the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Counsel for RALL contends that with the execution of the MOU there was no longer any submission to arbitration or mandate to arbitrate and accordingly the Final Award is null and void for lack of jurisdiction and/or there was a withdrawal by the parties of the submission to arbitration and the Final Award should be set aside. He contends that RALL has brought its challenge within the 3 months prescribed by Art 34(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Leaving aside the position where a party has refused to participate in the arbitral proceedings, which I deal with below, I do not think RALL can apply to set aside the Final Award at the seat under Art 34 at this stage and certainly not on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The parties agreed under Cl 8 of the Master Agreement to refer their disputes to arbitration in Singapore under the Rules of the SIAC. Rule 25.3 of the applicable SIAC Rules 2013 stipulates:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A plea that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the Statement of Defence or in a Statement of Defence to a Counterclaim. <span class="font-italic">A plea that the Tribunal is exceeding the scope of its jurisdiction shall be raised promptly after the Tribunal has indicated its intention to decide on the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its jurisdiction.</span> In either case the Tribunal may nevertheless admit a late plea under this Rule if it considers the delay justified. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he has nominated or participated in the nomination of, an arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As noted above, when RALL wrote to the SIAC on 12 November 2015 stating that the dispute had been settled and it was no longer required to proceed with the arbitration, AGMS wrote to the Tribunal on 15 November 2015 disagreeing. AGMS stated that there was no longer any settlement in view of certain events that had recently transpired and sought instead a preliminary hearing on an urgent basis to determine whether the arbitration ought to be proceeded with and to request for an interim injunction to prevent RALL from terminating the Master Agreement.

</div>
</div> The inevitable conclusion is that RALL chose this course of action (which was in itself an unorthodox challenge to the jurisdiction or mandate of the Tribunal to carry on with the arbitration), refused to comply with Rule 25.3, and is therefore in breach of its agreement to arbitrate disputes or differences or questions which have risen in connection with or in relation to the Master Agreement. More pertinently, the Tribunal then ruled on 19 December 2015 that the arbitral proceedings were not at an end and that it would continue with the arbitration. That was a ruling on jurisdiction as a preliminary issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Under s 10(3) IAA, if the arbitral tribunal rules that it has jurisdiction as a preliminary question or issue (or at any stage of the arbitral proceedings that it has no jurisdiction), any party may, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, apply to the High Court to determine the matter. RALL, in bringing this Originating Summons to set aside the Final Award for lack of jurisdiction is therefore outside the time limit set down in s 10(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 By s 3 IAA, the Model Law (with the exception of Chapter VIII) has the force of law in Singapore. Under Art 16(2) a plea that the arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence; also, a plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as possible as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. RALL refused to so plead but wrote the letter dated 12 November 2015 to the SIAC. Knowing the settlement as a cause of bringing the arbitral proceedings to an end was strongly disputed by AGMS, RALL nonetheless refused to attend the Preliminary Meeting on 16 November 2015 to make its case before the arbitral tribunal. I note it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> part of RALL’s case that it did not have the opportunity, whether due to the short notice or otherwise, to attend the 16 November 2015 Preliminary Meeting. This is not surprising as the 16 November 2015 Preliminary Meeting was fixed about one month earlier on 15 October 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Art 16(3) states explicitly what is implicit in s 10(3) IAA; <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the arbitral tribunal has the discretion whether to rule on a plea that it has no jurisdiction either as a preliminary question or as an award on the merits. Both s 10 IAA and Art 16(3) clearly provide that if the arbitral tribunal rules that it has jurisdiction as a preliminary issue then any party may apply, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, to the supervisory court at the seat to determine the matter.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In my judgment, under s 10 IAA and Art 16(3), RALL’s challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to continue with the arbitration after the MOU was executed is one that, having received an adverse ruling by the Tribunal as a preliminary question that it had jurisdiction to continue with the arbitration, required RALL, if dissatisfied, to bring that question to the supervisory court within 30 days of having received notice of that ruling from the Tribunal. Counsel for RALL contends instead that RALL’s challenge is in time because Art 34(3) gives RALL 3 months to do so. That is, with respect, not correct. As the Tribunal decided this question as a preliminary issue the applicable provision is Art 16(3) and s 10(3) IAA. Where the arbitral tribunal chooses to decide on jurisdiction in its award on the merits (which is not the case here), then Art 34(3) gives the dissatisfied party an opportunity to set aside that ruling, and any other decisions or ruling made on the merits, within 3 months of that party receiving the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Art 16(3) of the Model Law was intended as an early avenue for parties to promptly and finally resolve jurisdictional disputes so as to save costs and time, and it would defeat these purposes to allow a party to reserve jurisdictional challenges to the award on the merits (see Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>”) at p 1104):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The better view, which is strongly supported by Article 16(3)’s text and the Model Law’s purposes, is that a party must challenge the tribunal’s jurisdictional ruling within the 30 day time period allowed under Article 16(3) and, if it does not, then it will not be permitted subsequently to do so in an annulment action under Article 34.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is the clear import of the text of Article 16(3) which, by laying out a path to challenge the arbitrators’ positive jurisdictional ruling, impliedly requires that this path be taken, failing which the ruling will be binding. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It was therefore intended that a failure to raise a plea on jurisdiction within the 30-day limit should have a preclusive effect on subsequent setting aside proceedings at the seat (see the <span class="font-italic">Report of the Working Group on the Work of its Seventh Session</span> (A/CN 9/246, 6 March 1984) at para 51):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was observed … that a party who failed to raise the plea as required under article 16(2) should be precluded from raising such objections not only during the later stages of the arbitral proceedings but also in other contexts, in particular, in setting aside proceedings or enforcement proceedings, subject to certain limits such as public policy, including arbitrability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, that party has <span class="font-italic">not</span> lost its passive remedy of resisting <span class="font-italic">enforcement</span> whether in another jurisdiction or as a domestic international award at the seat: see <span class="font-italic">PT First Media </span><span class="font-italic">TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal</span> [2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">PT First Media (CA)</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Court of Appeal in its very comprehensive judgment on the active and passive remedies open to a party under the IAA and Model Law<span class="font-italic"> </span>stated, albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter,</span> in <span class="font-italic">PT First Media </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> at [130] and [132] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">130 … The more pertinent controversy is whether a party’s active remedy under Art 34 remains available to it if it fails to trigger the instant controls available under Arts 13(3) or 16(3). In the light of the <span class="font-italic">travaux</span> which we have examined, it appears to us that there is a policy of the Model Law to achieve certainty and finality in the <span class="font-italic">seat of arbitration</span>. This is further borne out by the strict timeline of 30 days imposed under both Arts 13(3) and 16(3), the design of which seems to be to precipitate an early determination on issues of composition and jurisdiction so that the arbitration can continue. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We would therefore be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">surprised if a party retained the right to bring an application to set aside a final award on the merits under Art 34 on a ground which they could have raised via other active remedies before the supervising court at an earlier stage</span> when the arbitration process was still ongoing. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">132  … Parties who elect not to challenge the tribunal’s preliminary ruling on its jurisdiction are not thereby precluded from relying on its passive remedy to resist recognition and enforcement on the grounds set out in Art 36(1). That having been said, we are of the tentative view, as noted above, that the position might not be the same in relation to whether such a party may raise such a ground to initiate setting aside proceedings under Art 34.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It will be noted that <span class="font-italic">PT First Media</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> involved <span class="font-italic">enforcement</span> proceedings of a domestic international arbitration award at the seat. Here, RALL is applying to the supervisory court at the seat under Model Law to set aside the Award.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Perhaps two counter-arguments against this construction of Art 16(3) can be made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 First, the phraseology of Art 16(2) contemplates a party that is engaged in the arbitration; hence the reference to raising the plea not later than its statement of defence and the reference to a party not being precluded from raising a plea of no jurisdiction by appointing or participating in the appointment of an arbitrator. It is therefore unsurprising that texts on Art 16 mostly proceed on the footing that the objecting party is an active participant in the arbitral proceedings (see Blackaby <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration</span> (Oxford University Press, 6th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Redfern and Hunter</span>”) at para 10.30):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Parties are unlikely to succeed on any challenge to an award based on an objection that <span class="font-italic">they have failed to raise during the </span><span class="font-italic">arbitration</span>. This is because they will usually be deemed to have waived that objection. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The authors of <span class="font-italic">Redfern and Hunter</span> referred to the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Thyssen</span><span class="font-italic"> Canada Ltd v Mariana Maritime SA</span> [2005] EWHC 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Thyssen</span><span class="font-italic"> Canada</span>”), observing in a footnote to the above-quoted paragraph (footnote 57):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[In <span class="font-italic">Thyssen</span><span class="font-italic"> Canada</span>] it was held that a party <span class="font-italic">who takes part in arbitral proceedings</span> and fails to raise an objection as to a serious irregularity affecting the proceedings will lose the right to object, unless it can show that, <span class="font-italic">at the time that it took part or continued to take part in the proceedings</span>, it did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the grounds for the objection.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 These views support an argument that where a party has stayed away from the arbitral proceedings altogether or has walked out at some early stage, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, before filing its statement of defence, then Art 16’s time limit is not binding on it. However, I note that against this, s 10 IAA does not contain such phraseology.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Secondly, there is authority that an option remains open to a party to choose to leave the arbitral proceedings in protest, in which case the time limits in Art 34 (and therefore by extension, Art 16 as well) do not apply. This can be found in the first instance decision of <span class="font-italic">Astro Nusantara</span><span class="font-italic"> International BV v PT Ayunda Prima Mitra</span> [2013] 1 SLR 636 at [133]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If a party chooses the second option of challenge by choosing to <span class="font-italic">leave the arbitral regime in protest</span> and should the tribunal rule against it on the merits, that party, as the losing party, is entitled within the time stipulated in Art 34 to set aside the award under any of the grounds in Art 34. … One way in which a party may challenge the jurisdiction of a tribunal is simply to step out of the arbitral regime and boycott the proceedings altogether. <span class="font-italic">If this course of action is chosen (and this course is not without risk), then the rules for appeal which would apply to </span><span class="font-italic">parties within the arbitral regime would no longer apply to the boycotting party. Arguably, the boycotting party would then be able to apply to set aside the award under Art 34(2)(a)(i) on jurisdictional grounds.</span> The jurisdictional award would not be final <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the boycotting party, and the opposing party would have ample notice of this from the boycotting party’s absolute refusal to participate. This possibility is hinted at in UNCITRAL Commentary (A/CN 9/264) on Art 16(2) at para 9.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The learned trial judge found support in the <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Analytical</span><span class="font-italic"> Commentary on Draft Text of a Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</span> (A/CN 9/264, 25 March 1985), p 39 at paras 8–9:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. The model law does not state whether a party’s failure to raise his objections within the time-limit set by article 16(2) has effect at the post-award stage. The pertinent observation of the Working Group was that a party who failed to raise the plea as required under article 16(2) should be precluded from raising such objections not only during the later stages of the arbitral proceedings but also in other contexts, in particular, in setting aside proceedings or enforcement proceedings, subject to certain limits such as public policy, including those relating to arbitrability.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9.

It would mean, in practical terms, that any objection, for example, to the validity of the arbitration agreement may not later be invoked as a ground for setting aside under article 34(2)(a)(i) or for requesting, under article 36(1)(a)(i), refusal of recognition or enforcement of an award (made under this Law); <span class="font-italic">these provisions on grounds for setting aside or refusing recognition or enforcement would remain applicable and of practical relevance to those cases where a party raised the plea in time but without success or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where a party did not participate in the arbitration</span><span class="font-italic">, at least not submit a statement or take part in hearings on the substance of the dispute.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 This has been picked up by Gary Born in <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> at p 1105:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The only exception to this requirement, that a party challenge the arbitrators’ positive jurisdictional ruling immediately (or within 30 days) under Article 16(3), is where a party does not participate at all in the arbitral proceedings</span>; in this instance, the Singaporean court would permit a challenge to a final arbitral award under Article 34 of the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Other courts have adopted similar interpretations of the Model Law, holding that a party must challenge an arbitral tribunal’s positive jurisdictional ruling under Article 16(3), rather than awaiting a final award and challenging jurisdiction under Article 34. <span class="font-italic">Although these decisions do not address the point, they presumably permit an exception where a party does not participate in the arbitral process at all</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Arbitration Legislation Annotated</span> (Informa, 2nd Ed, 2016), Robert Merkin and Johanna Hjalmarsson, also seem to recognise the existence of an exception where a party does not participate at all in the proceedings (at pp 148–149):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The manner of the challenge depends upon the respondent’s attitude to the arbitration. <span class="font-italic">The respondent may simply refuse to have anything to do with the arbitration, in which case he has the right to await the award itself and then challenge it under Model Law, art 34.</span> A further possibility is that the respondent may use the mechanism in Model Law, art 16(2), and appear in the arbitration under protest. … Making an objection preserves his right to challenge the substantive award on the jurisdictional point at some later stage. … The result is that if a party has not objected to the arbitrators’ assertion of jurisdiction but has proceeded with the hearing on the merits, the award cannot be challenged on jurisdictional grounds<span class="font-italic">.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On balance, and with respect, I think the Court of Appeal’s statements in <span class="font-italic">PT First Media </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> (referred to at [63] above) reflect the correct position. Where the arbitral tribunal chooses to decide jurisdiction as a preliminary question or issue, then all the considerations of finality, certainty, practicality, cost, preventing dilatory tactics and settling the position at an early stage at the seat militate against allowing a respondent to reserve its objections to the last minute and indulge in tactics which result in immense delays and cost. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 This very case is a good example. RALL stayed away from the arbitration, did not file a response, did not nominate an arbitrator, refused to pay any fees, did not file a statement of defence and then raised a jurisdictional challenge by way of a terse letter and absented itself from the preliminary meeting, refused to file any submissions in support of its stand and allowed the arbitration to proceed without participation. Why should a party in RALL’s position be entitled to take up a challenge to jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">at the seat</span> in blatant disregard of Art 16 and the policy reasons behind the 30-day time limit? This amounts, in my view, to an abuse of process. It allows a party to wait till the opposing party goes through the whole arbitral process, obtains an award, only to be met by a setting aside application at the seat on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 However, even if RALL was not precluded from raising its Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) jurisdictional objection at this late stage, I find that the objection is not sustainable on these facts as the MOU did not terminate the Tribunal’s mandate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I note for completeness that AGMS had argued, in the alternative, that the MOU had been rescinded for misrepresentation and therefore could not be the basis on which the arbitration was terminated.

</div> However, even if AGMS’s entry into the MOU had been induced by a misrepresentation, the MOU would only be voidable and not void. AGMS was unable to point to any clear and unequivocal act indicating that it had elected to rescind the MOU. All that AGMS did was to proceed with the arbitration, which can hardly be said to be conduct unequivocally indicating that the entire MOU (which contained other rights and obligations unrelated to the arbitral proceedings) was rescinded. Be that as it may, even if the MOU remained in force, I had previously found that it did not terminate the reference to arbitration nor the Tribunal’s mandate.

If indeed it suffered any prejudice, something which I am constrained to doubt, it was entirely of its own doing. I do not think that the Tribunal’s omission to furnish RALL with a copy of the notes of evidence occasioned RALL any prejudice at all. Given RALL’s near-total disengagement from the arbitral proceedings, it was far from clear to me that RALL would have abruptly started participating in the proceedings upon receiving the notes of evidence. In this regard I note that RALL only saw fit to request a copy of the notes of evidence on 17 February 2017;

On the facts of this case, I did not think it was incumbent on the Tribunal, SIAC or AGMS to send a copy of the notes of evidence to RALL. It is noteworthy that RALL had not paid any part of its share of the arbitration fees. It is also beyond argument that transcribers’ fees would have been incurred by AGMS to have notes of evidence of the proceedings drawn up. Given its conduct, RALL’s argument that it was <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> to a copy of the notes of evidence cannot on any view be sustained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 RALL also referred to a list of various pieces of correspondence between AGMS and SIAC which were not forwarded to RALL.

</div> Until they have been convicted and their avenues for appeal exhausted, there is no basis for me to find that the award would perpetuate or enable corruption or bribery in Sri Lanka.

</div> However, counsel was unable to give me any indication as to when the proceedings would likely be concluded. The Magistrate’s Court indictments, comprising 19 corruption charges against eight persons, were fixed for trial on 26 February and 26 March 2018. The High Court indictments, comprising 47 charges against two persons, were fixed for trial on 19–22 March 2018. It is highly unlikely that such important and numerous criminal charges can be determined within such a short of period of time (not to mention the prospect of appeals). I therefore did not think it would be appropriate for me to adjourn these proceedings indefinitely. I note, however, that in the event convictions are eventually secured, RALL may be able to invoke public policy as a ground to resist the enforcement of the arbitral award (for example under s 31(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement required the performance of an illegal act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Cl 3.1 of the Master Agreement required that RALL “provide its utmost assistance” to AGMS in respect of the various projects they had jointly undertaken, such as the Galle Floating Armoury Project. RALL argued that AGMS’s request for assistance – for RALL to obtain a declaration from the MOD confirming the legitimacy of the Galle Floating Armour Project – would be a “direct interference with the dispensation of justice, law and order” as RALL did not have the power or authority to procure from the Sri Lankan government AGMS’s requested assurances.
