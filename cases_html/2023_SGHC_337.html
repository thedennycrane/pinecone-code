At present, the [BMA] has no direct access to the Company as the Company has no office and no directors or officers in the jurisdiction. This poses obvious regulatory and enforcement concerns. For these reasons, the [BMA] has now determined that the Company must be wound up to ensure long running non-compliances are brought to an end and any detrimental effects on the ultimate policyholders or on Bermuda’s regulatory reputation may be managed and repaired. A winding up will ensure that a fulsome and professional evaluation of the Company’s financial affairs may be conducted by individuals to whom [the BMA] will have direct access, as necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 It is therefore clear that the BMA did not petition for the winding-up of the Company on the grounds that it was insolvent or in any form of financial distress. The grounds and provisions it relied on do not relate to insolvency but to the Company’s failure to comply with various statutory requirements governing insurance companies under Bermudan law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 This, however, does not determine the issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Having carefully considered the language of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>), both itself and in the context of other provisions of the SG Model Law, as well as the policy and impetus behind the SG Model Law and authorities interpreting Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) and similar provisions here and elsewhere, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ascentra Holdings</span> concluded that a company does not need to be insolvent or in severe financial distress before the proceedings in respect of it may be recognised under the SG Model Law. Specifically, the Court of Appeal held (at [98]–[99]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98 We are therefore satisfied that there is <span class="font-italic">no requirement under the SG Model Law for a company to be insolvent or in severe financial distress</span> before a proceeding concerning that company may be recognised as a foreign proceeding under the SG Model Law. For this reason, we agree with the appellants that the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Re Betcorp</span> towards the interpretation of the words “law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Broad Approach) should be adopted in Singapore. Interpreting Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the SG Model Law in that manner better coheres with its ordinary meaning and reflects Parliament’s intention to include proceedings concerning solvent companies within the scope of the SG Model Law. We are also satisfied that such an interpretation does not undermine, and is indeed consistent with, the overall purpose of the UNCITRAL Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">99 To reiterate, under the Broad Approach, the requirement that a proceeding be conducted “under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) will be satisfied <span class="font-italic">as long as</span><span class="font-italic"> the law or the relevant part of the law under which the relevant proceeding is conducted includes provisions dealing with the insolvency of a company or the adjustment of its debts</span>.

As seen above, the Petition was founded on various sub-sections of s 35 of the IA 1978.

As noted in the Howard Affidavit, in order to call meetings of creditors and contributories, the Applicants must ascertain the identity and location of the company’s creditors and contributories, which information is typically found in the statement of affairs that the company's former management is obligated to provide or within the company’s books and records, or both.

</div> The court has discretion under s 47(4) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) to vary the weight accorded to expert evidence because of an expert’s lack of independence: see <span class="font-italic">Innovative Corp Pte Ltd v Ow Chun Ming and another </span>[2023] 3 SLR 1488 at [93], [97] and [98]. While it may have been preferable for the Applicants to have found an independent lawyer to give evidence on Bermudan law, there was ultimately no reason to reject the Howard Affidavit. Its evidence was not contradicted – the Non-Parties were given leave to file a response affidavit but did not do so. In any case, the evidence in the Howard Affidavit was not inconsistent with a plain reading of the relevant statutes and regulations of Bermuda, and not remarkable. I therefore accept the evidence contained therein. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Article 17 of the SG Model Law provides that this court <span class="font-italic">must</span> recognise the Proceeding and the Winding-Up Order if its requirements are satisfied. However, that is qualified by Art 6 of the SG Model Law, which provides that the court may refuse recognition if such recognition would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore. The SG Model Law does not define “public policy”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 4 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet</span>”), the High Court observed (at [21]–[23]) that under the Model Law, the court can only deny recognition on this ground if recognition is “manifestly contrary” to public policy, but the SG Model Law omits the word “manifestly”. The court surmised that that the omission was deliberate, and this meant that the standard of exclusion on public policy grounds in Singapore is lower than in other jurisdictions: <span class="font-italic">Re Zetta Jet </span>at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Commentaries on other international documents provide some guidance as to the meaning of the phrase “manifestly contrary” to public policy. This requires “additional, extended scrutiny”, and means that an alleged violation of public policy must not be “an arguable violation” but must be one which is definitely recognisable as such”: see Ronald A Brand &amp; Paul Herrup, <span class="font-italic">The 2005 </span><span class="font-italic">Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements: Commentary and Documents</span> (Cambridge University Press, 2008) at pp 91–93. The phrase is intended to set a high threshold and refers to the basic norms or principles of the relevant State, not mere technical violations of a mandatory rule: see Trevor Hartley &amp; Masato Dogauchi, <span class="font-italic">Explanatory Report on the </span><span class="font-italic">Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements </span>(Hague Conference on Private International Law, 2013)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 153.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I note that the phrase “manifestly contrary” to public policy has been retained in ss 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 14(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Choice of Court Agreements Act 2016 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CCAA”), which provide respectively that an exclusive choice of court agreement may not be given effect, and the court must refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment, if doing so would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of Singapore. The CCAA gives effect to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (“the Hague Convention”): see the Explanatory Statement to the Choice of Court Agreements Bill (Bill No 14/2016) (“the CCAB Explanatory Statement”). However, neither the CCAB Explanatory Statement nor the report of the Law Reform Committee (see Law Reform Committee, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Law Reform Committee on the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(March 2013) (Author: Yeo Tiong Min)) comment on the choice to retain the phrase “manifestly contrary” from the Hague Convention in ss 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 14(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CCAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In so far as the phrase “manifestly contrary” has been retained in the CCAA and not the SG Model Law, it does suggest that in the context of the recognition of foreign proceedings under the SG Model Law, the standard of exclusion on public policy grounds in Singapore is lower. I also note the observations in the <span class="font-italic">UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency with </span><span class="font-italic">Guide to Enactment and Interpretation</span>, UN Sales No E.05.V.10 (2013) (“the 2013 Guide”) at para 104 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The purpose of the expression “manifestly”, used also in many other international legal texts as a qualifier of the expression “public policy”, is to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be <span class="font-italic">interpreted restrictively</span> and that article 6 is only intended to be invoked under <span class="font-italic">exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance</span> for the enacting State. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, the omission of the word “manifestly” in Art 6 of the SG Model Law suggests that our Parliament intended that the public policy ground may be invoked for reasons less stringent than those concerning matters of fundamental importance for Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I do not propose to lay down an exhaustive definition of the phrase “contrary to public policy” in Art 6 of the SG Model Law – that would not be possible. Nonetheless, it is trite that preventing or limiting a person’s rights on public policy grounds is an exceptional measure, and the burden is on the party invoking to identify the precise public policy engaged and how it has been (or will be) violated. As held in <span class="font-italic">UKM</span><span class="font-italic"> v Attorney-General </span>[2019] 3 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">UKM</span>”), the alleged public policy relied on by a party must be shown to be attributable to a constitutionally authoritative source (such as legislation, statements made by Cabinet ministers, and judicial decisions) which clearly expresses the policy: <span class="font-italic">UKM </span>at [136], [138] and [144].

Even if true, it was not relevant to the question of where the Company’s business was conducted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In any case, Li did not furnish any objective evidence to support his assertion that the Company conducted its business from China, Ukraine and Russia, or that most of its customers are from China.

However, there does not appear to be any public statement on the reasons for its inclusion in the SG Model Law – the Explanatory Statement in the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 (Bill No 13/2017) (“the CAB Explanatory Statement”) (which enacted the SG Model Law) is silent in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Nevertheless, the CAB Explanatory Statement does state that the SG Model Law contains the articles of the original Model Law, with modifications to adapt them for application in Singapore, and is also adapted with modifications from Schedule 1 to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006, No 1030) (UK) (“the UK Regulations”). The UK Regulations include an Art 4(2) which is almost identical to that of the SG Model Law. Hence, it appears that Art 4(2) of the SG Model Law was imported directly from the UK Regulations. Article 4(2) of the UK Regulations reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. Subject to paragraph 1 of this article, the court in either part of Great Britain shall have jurisdiction in relation to the functions referred to in that paragraph if—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the debtor has—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) a place of business; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) in the case of an individual, a place of residence; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) assets,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">situated in that part of Great Britain; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the court in that part of Great Britain considers for any other reason that it is the appropriate forum to consider the question or provide the assistance requested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Explanatory Memorandum to the UK Regulations is unfortunately also silent on the reasons for the inclusion of Art 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). The case of <span class="font-italic">American Energy Group Ltd v Hycarbex Asia Ltd </span>[2014] EWHC 1091 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">American Energy</span>”) sheds some light on this issue – the court there noted that Art 4(2) was not meant to impose a jurisdictional requirement for the courts to perform the functions relating to recognition of foreign proceedings. Rather, the provision was <span class="font-italic">only</span><span class="font-italic"> meant to allocate jurisdiction</span> as between the courts of England and Wales and the courts of Scotland: <span class="font-italic">American Energy </span>at [13].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 That appears consistent with how Art 4(2) of the UK Regulations is worded. However, in the recent decision of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lau</span><span class="font-italic"> Yu v Patrick Cowley &amp; Anor </span>[2020] EWHC 2429 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Lau</span>”), the court observed that Art 4(2) may impose a jurisdictional requirement which must be satisfied together with the requirements under Art 17(1): <span class="font-italic">Lau </span>at [8] and [10]. I note however, that the court there did not engage in an analysis of Art 4(2) and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">American Energy </span>was not cited or referred to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is therefore doubtful whether Art 4(2) of the SG Model Law was intended to impose a jurisdictional requirement. Indeed, Art 4 has the same header as its Model Law equivalent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “<span class="font-italic">Competent Court</span>”, which suggests it was only intended to designate the national court to perform the function of recognition. Nonetheless, each country is entitled to adapt and modify the Model Law to suit its own circumstances and requirements (see the 2013 Guide at para 20), and Art 4(2) of the SG Model Law must therefore be interpreted with reference to its ordinary meaning and context: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38]. On its plain language, Arts 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SG Model Law appear as disjunctive jurisdictional requirements for the Singapore court to recognise foreign proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Article 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is self-explanatory – it requires a tangible connection between the debtor and Singapore in terms of business activity or assets. In this regard, there is no specified minimum threshold, suggesting that a <span class="font-italic">de minim</span><span class="font-italic">is</span> connection may be sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 That low threshold to establish jurisdiction is also evident in the language used in Art 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) – that the court “considers for <span class="font-italic">any </span>other reason that it is the <span class="font-italic">appropriate </span>forum to consider the question or provide the assistance requested” [emphasis added]. However, while this discretion is broad, it obviously cannot be unfettered. It is trite that statutory interpretation in Singapore follows the purposive approach – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law is to be preferred: see s 9A of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) and <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [35]. Thus, Art 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) must be interpreted in a manner which enables the court to find jurisdiction where the recognition of the foreign proceedings will advance the purpose of the SG Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Preamble to the SG Model Law provides that the purpose of the SG Model Law is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of cross‑border insolvency so as to promote the objectives of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) co-operation between the courts and other competent authorities of Singapore and foreign States involved in cases of cross‑border insolvency;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) fair and efficient administration of cross‑border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors and other interested persons, including the debtor; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) protection and maximisation of the value of the debtor’s property.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 This is reinforced by the observations of the court in <span class="font-italic">Ascentra Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [64] that the Model Law is designed to provide a harmonised approach to the treatment of cross-border insolvency proceedings in national legal systems; to facilitate co-operation between courts and office holders involved in the same insolvency across different jurisdictions; to provide for the recognition of proceedings and the consequences of such recognition; and to afford direct access by foreign representatives of such companies to the courts of the enacting state. These concerns arise not only in the context of an insolvent company, but also for a company undergoing solvent liquidation: <span class="font-italic">Ascentra Holdings </span>at [65].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I find that Singapore is the appropriate forum to provide the assistance requested in this case and that Art 4(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is therefore satisfied.
