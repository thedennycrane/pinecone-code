<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
plaintiff in this action holds a certain sum of money as a trustee and
she has come to the court for a determination as to who the rightful beneficial
owner of the money is. The two competing claimants are the first and
second defendants to the action. All the parties are related, the
first defendant being the elder brother of the plaintiff and the
father of the second defendant. The trust funds are derived from
certain shares that originally belonged to the plaintiff’s mother,
and the history of the competing claims goes back some 30 years.
The story is therefore somewhat involved and due to the lapse of
time and the loss of documents, there are many gaps.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events from 1980 up to 1987</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In
1980, one Madam Yeo Siew Guat (“Mdm Yeo”) was the owner of 950 shares
in a company called Tai Seng Realty Co Pte Ltd (“TSR”) and 10 shares
in a company called General Sawmill Pte Ltd (“GSPL”). Both these companies
were family businesses run by her husband. Mdm Yeo had nine children,
namely (not in order of age):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tan
Lucy (now known by her married name of Lucy Lim) (“Lucy Lim”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     Tan
Chin Chye, Amy (“Amy Tan”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Tan
Poh Choo, Joscelyn (the plaintiff)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     Tan
Pof Eng (formerly known as Tan Poh Eng and called Ali by the family)
(“Pof Eng”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     Tan
Poh Wah, Nelly (“Nelly Tan”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     Tan
Poh Chuan (also called Eric by the family) (“Chuan”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     Tan
Poh Siong (also called Johnson by the family) (“Siong”)</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_h"></a>(h)     Tan
Poh Seng, Robert (also known as Robert Tan), the first defendant;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_i"></a>(i)     Tan
Poh Lin (“Poh Lin”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In
August 1980, Siong and Chuan incorporated a private limited company
in Singapore called Hock Ann Holdings Pte Ltd (“HAPL”) as an investment
company. Siong and Chuan were the initial shareholders and directors
of the company. On 2 May 1981, HAPL passed a directors’ resolution
by which it was resolved that the company would acquire 950 TSR
shares from Mdm Yeo at a price of $158,000. No similar resolution
was produced in respect of the GSPL shares but subsequently (the
exact date is not known), Mdm Yeo’s TSR and GSPL shares were transferred
from her into the ownership of HAPL. It is the evidence of Chuan
that Mdm Yeo was paid $168,000 for these two counters but there
was no document adduced to support such testimony. The first defendant
does not believe that any money was ever paid to Mdm Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At
about the same time, again no dates have been furnished, a number of
Mdm Yeo’s children who also held shares in TSR transferred their shareholdings
to HAPL. As a result, HAPL became the owner of 4,070 TSR shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
position of the plaintiff is that on the advice of Chuan, Mdm Yeo had
decided to do some estate planning because in the 1980s estate duties were
very high. She decided to make a gift (“the Gift”) of her TSR and
GSPL shares to her nine children equally and the shares were transferred
to HAPL pursuant to this intention. The scheme was that the children
would become shareholders of HAPL itself and would thereby secure
their interests in the Gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
position of the first defendant is that Mdm Yeo transferred her shares
to HAPL for the latter to hold the same on trust for Mdm Yeo for
her lifetime and thereafter, on trust for distribution to her children
in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According
to the plaintiff and her witnesses, the common intention was that
each of the children was to receive 22,000 shares in HAPL. These 22,000
shares were to represent such child’s interest in the shares that
Mdm Yeo had transferred to HAPL. This scheme was not carried out
completely in that not all the children became shareholders in HAPL.
In the case of Poh Lin, he informed Chuan that he wanted to give
his portion of the Gift to his elder brother, Pof Eng, and therefore
he never became a shareholder in HAPL. Instead, Pof Eng was regarded
being entitled to two shares of the Gift. As for the first defendant,
it is the evidence of Chuan that the first defendant wanted his
portion to be put in the name of his son, the second defendant,
to be held by the latter on trust for himself and his sisters, who are
named Arlette and Alena. The plaintiff’s position is that for a
long time, she was aware only that the first defendant wanted to
pass on his share of the Gift to the second defendant. She was not
told that the same was to be held on trust by the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There
is no document in court showing exactly how many shares in HAPL
were allotted to Mdm Yeo’s children in the 1980s. However, from
a document dated 24 December 1988 (“the Deed”) (a very important document
about which I say more below), it appears that in December 1988,
Lucy Lim, the plaintiff, Amy Tan, Nelly Tan and Pof Eng were among the
registered shareholders of HAPL. These siblings held their shareholdings
in part for themselves beneficially and in part for other siblings
namely, Lucy Lim, Nelly Tan, Siong and Chuan. From the evidence, Siong
and Chuan must also have been registered shareholders as they had procured
the incorporation of HAPL. There is no documentary evidence that
either the first or second defendant was a shareholder of HAPL at
any time. Chuan and Amy Tan, however, insisted in their testimony
that the first defendant’s intention was that the second defendant
should be a shareholder in his place and Chuan at least was convinced
that this intention had been effected and the second defendant had
become a shareholder of HAPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
second defendant’s evidence was that in late January or early February1984,
just before his 17<sup>th</sup> birthday, his parents
visited him at his boarding school in England. During this visit,
the first defendant told the second defendant that he did not want
to accept the shares that Mdm Yeo had given him. He said that he
had told his siblings that his 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
of the Gift was to be given to the second defendant. He also told
the second defendant that this portion was meant for the second
defendant alone and that his sisters had no share in it. The first
defendant denies that any such conversation took place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At
the time that Mdm Yeo’s shares were transferred to HAPL, her husband
was still alive and he was maintaining her. The senior Mr Tan died in
November 1983. Thereafter, Mdm Yeo was maintained for a number of years
from her own funds and by some of her children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In
April 1988, Mdm Yeo executed her last will. She appointed Amy Tan
and the plaintiff as her executors and trustees. By the will, she bequeathed
the whole of her estate including her jewellery to her four daughters
in equal shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In
December 1987, TSR was put into members’ voluntary liquidation. The
question then arose as to what HAPL should do. By that time, Chuan who
had been managing HAPL, was no longer living in Singapore and neither
was Siong. They were considering winding up HAPL and did not want
the company to be responsible for the TSR shares which “belonged”
to their siblings including the 950 TSR shares which had come from
Mdm Yeo. It should be noted, though nothing turns on it, that in
the event HAPL was only wound up in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It
was decided, after various discussions amongst the siblings, that these
shares should be taken out of HAPL. It was in these circumstances that
the Deed was drawn up and executed. The actual dates of execution
of the document by the various parties are not known but it was
dated 24 December 1988. It should be noted that Mdm Yeo witnessed
the signatures of the seven siblings who signed the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It
may be helpful for me to set out the main provisions of the Deed
at this point. There were three sets of parties to the Deed: the
Vendors, the Purchasers and the company (HAPL). The Vendors were
Lucy Lim, Amy Tan, Nelly Tan, the plaintiff and Pof Eng; the Purchasers
were Siong and Chuan. The recitals to the Deed stated that the Vendors
were the beneficial owners of 262,000 shares in HAPL and were also
the registered owners of a further 814,000 shares which they held
on trust for the Purchasers. It was also stated that the Vendors
and the Purchasers were to purchase 1,600 TSR shares from HAPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In
the main body of the Deed, the following were effected:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     By
cl (i), in consideration of the sum of $681,200 paid by the Purchasers
to the Vendors, the Vendors transferred a total of 538,000 shares
to Siong and an identical number of shares to Chuan:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     By
cl (ii), in consideration of the sum of $660,800 paid to HAPL, the
company sold to the Vendors and the Purchasers 1600 shares in TSR
to be transferred to them as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       140 TSR shares to each of Lucy Lim and the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       280 TSR shares to Amy Tan;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       90 TSR shares to Pof Eng; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       a block of 950 TSR shares to be allocated in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_A"></a>(A)       2/9<sup>th</sup> shares
to Pof Eng;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_B"></a>(B)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to Lucy Lim;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_C"></a>(C)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to Amy Tan;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_D"></a>(D)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to Nelly Tan;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_E"></a>(E)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_F"></a>(F)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to Chuan;</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_G"></a>(G)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to Siong; and</p>
<p class="Judg-4"><a id="p1_15-p2_b-p3_iv-p4_H"></a>(H)       1/9<sup>th</sup> share
to the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Clause
(v) of the Deed is important and must be set out in full. It says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Vendors and the Purchasers further
agree that the said 950 shares in Tai Sing Realty Co., (Pte) Ltd
shall remain intact during the life time of Madam Yeo Siew Guat
and that any dividends declared by the liquidator of Tai Sing Realty
Co., (Pte) Ltd or assets distributed shall be applied to the maintenance and
up keep of the said Madam Yeo Siew Guat in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As
might be anticipated, the first defendant places a great deal of emphasis
on cl (v) and says that it supports his stand that the 950 TSR shares
were never given by Madam Yeo to her children but were instead put into
a trust for her benefit during her lifetime. The plaintiff takes
the position that the clause reflects the consensus among the siblings,
excluding the first defendant, that whilst the 950 shares belonged
to them absolutely, they had a moral obligation to support their
mother and should therefore only use the proceeds of the same for
this purpose during her lifetime and postpone distribution amongst
themselves till after her death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In
this context, cl (iii) of the Deed cannot be overlooked. That clause stated
that in the event the transfer of 1600 TSR shares to the various
parties mentioned in cl (ii) was not effected, then HAPL was to
hold the same in trust for the Vendors and the Purchasers “who shall
retain the beneficial interest of the said shares” in the proportions
stated in cl (ii).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There
is no evidence exactly how the transfer of the 950 TSR shares contemplated
by the Deed took place. It is however common ground that eventually
assets representing these shares, mainly UOB shares and cash, were
distributed by the liquidator of TSR to the plaintiff and Amy Tan
who considered that they held the same on trust for the eight persons
named in cl (ii) of the Deed. The parties referred to these assets
as “the 950 account”. In 1994, it was agreed that all the assets
of the 950 account should be held by the plaintiff alone. However,
even thereafter the siblings generally seem to have regarded both
the plaintiff and Amy Tan as the trustees. By the time of Mdm Yeo’s
death in 2009, however, the plaintiff alone was acting as trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It
should be noted that the first defendant who was not a party to
the Deed asserts that he was not aware of its existence in 1988
or 1989. The second defendant claims, however, that in March 1989
when he visited his mother’s home in London, his father brought
out a document and showed him a single page of the same: the page
in which cl (ii) and the names of the various persons who were allocated
portions of the 950 TSR shares were written. The first defendant
showed the second defendant the latter’s name in the clause and
indicated that this evidenced the second defendant’s share of the
Gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the execution of
the Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
plaintiff’s position is that after December 1988, the siblings (sometimes
including the first defendant) would meet from time to time to discuss
how the 950 account should be managed. She said that she acted at all
times with the knowledge, information and consent of all siblings, including
the first defendant, and of the second defendant. The 950 account itself
was always independently audited so that she could report its net worth
when the siblings held their meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     These
meetings were not formal meetings but took place as family gatherings
or reunions. One such meeting was in Bangkok in 1994. This gathering
was partly to celebrate Mdm Yeo’s birthday and partly to discuss the
management of the 950 account. According to Lucy Lim, a few days prior
to the meeting, the first defendant telephoned her and asked her
to make a request to the meeting and to the other siblings and to
the second defendant. He wanted the second defendant’s 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
to be divided into three so that it would be held in equal shares
by the second defendant, Arlette and Alena. His request was that
the siblings or the second defendant should add Arlette’s and Alena’s
names to the second defendant’s name as beneficiaries of the 950
account. Lucy Lim then passed this request on to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
Bangkok meeting was attended by all the siblings apart from the first
defendant. The second defendant was also absent. Minutes were taken at
the meeting and subsequently circulated to the siblings. The plaintiff
and the siblings who testified on her behalf, ie. Chuan, Amy Tan
and Lucy Lim, accepted the minutes as reflecting what had happened
at the meeting. The topics discussed were the maintenance of Mdm
Yeo and how the assets of the 950 account should be dealt with.
Amongst other things, the attendees agreed on the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     That
$2,500 a month should be paid for Mdm Yeo’s rent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     All
shares belonging to the 950 account would continue to be in the
plaintiff’s name and any shares in Amy Tan’s name would be transferred
to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would indicate in her will that the
assets of the 950 account were held by her in trust for all; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     They
were all happy with the management of the 950 account so far and
the plaintiff and Amy Tan were to continue to be the trustees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
minutes also noted that the first defendant had made a request through
Lucy Lim that the second defendant’s share in the 950 account should
be placed in the names of the second defendant, Arlette and Alena. In
this regard, it stated that Lucy Lim was to inform the first defendant
that the legal advice received by the plaintiff was that since the
portion was in the second defendant’s name alone, the second defendant
needed to write in to all the other beneficiaries to effect the
change. According to Lucy Lim, the plaintiff told the meeting that
the second defendant was not agreeable to adding his sisters’ names
to the 950 account. Lucy Lim was tasked with informing the first
defendant about the requirement for the second defendant to consent
to the change and that the second defendant had not agreed to do
so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The
only other meeting at which minutes were taken and subsequently
circulated was a meeting held in Malacca on 31 March 2005. This
meeting started in the morning and continued to the night. Present were
the plaintiff, Lucy Lim, Amy Tan, Nelly Tan, Pof Eng, Chuan, Siong, the
first defendant and the second defendant. The defendants were not present
in the morning but arrived in Malacca in time to attend the afternoon
and evening sessions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     According
to the minutes, in the morning the parties discussed the accounts
and Mdm Yeo’s condition. It was agreed that the plaintiff should continue
to have the discretion to spend whatever was necessary for Mdm Yeo’s
care and maintenance. Pof Eng proposed that since the funds in the 950
account were more than sufficient for Mdm Yeo’s maintenance, some distribution
could be made to the beneficiaries. He had two proposals: (a) that
the excess income after expenses be distributed; or (b) that the
capital be halved. He believed that either way there would still
be sufficient assets to provide for Mdm Yeo’s care. It should be
noted that according to the balance sheet of the 950 account, as
at 31 December 2004, the total assets of the account amounted to
$13,497,347.28 of which $2,048,391.48 was held in cash in two bank
accounts. Further, for the year 2004, the expenses of the fund (basically
the cost of looking after Mdm Yeo) had amounted to only $139,575.82.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
the afternoon, the defendants were told about the proposals made by
Pof Eng and the siblings and the second defendant then had a long discussion
on these proposals. In this regard, para 15 of the minutes is significant.
It is a paragraph on which the first defendant relies to support his
case. It says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All agreed that 950 was set up with [Mdm
Yeo’s] shares, and that she is the true owner although legally,
the shares are held in [the plaintiff’s] name (and the bank account
in [Amy Tan’s and the plaintiff’s] names) in trust for the 8 “beneficiaries”.
The 950 fund was set up to be used for [Mdm Yeo’s] care and maintenance,
and that we were considering distributing some of it only because
of extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The
minutes also state that the first defendant was told that the second
defendant was the named “beneficiary” and that any distribution had
to be made directly to the second defendant only. The first defendant apparently
said that he understood the situation and that he would like the siblings
to impress on the second defendant that the first defendant’s share was
meant for his three children if the first defendant was no longer
alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As
regards the proposals made by Pof Eng, the second proposal was rejected.
The first proposal was considered a possibility since it would leave the
capital intact and available to take care of unforeseen problems.
Chuan and Siong objected to the proposal outright. They felt it
was a breach of trust to make any distribution. After dinner, everyone
got together for a third proposal made by Siong. He suggested that
all “the trustees” would be entitled to ask for a loan which would
be their portion of the excess of the income of the trust over its
expenses. Nominal interest would be charged. The first defendant
objected to the suggestion that interest be charged. It was agreed
that the for the sake of an unanimous agreement, the interest element
would be dropped and interest-free loans offered. According to the minutes,
all agreed to the third proposal as so modified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     After
the Malacca meeting, distributions of the surplus income of the 950
account were made on an annual basis to each of the “beneficiaries”. The
second defendant as a named beneficiary was given his share of the distribution.
According to the plaintiff, the first defendant never objected to this.
The first defendant however asserted that he had objected in no uncertain
terms to the plaintiff giving a share of the trust income to the second
defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Yeo’s death and subsequent
events leading to these proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Mdm
Yeo died on 2 September 2009. A meeting was held on Monday 7 September
2009 to read Mdm Yeo’s Will and to agree on the distribution of
the 950 account. This meeting was attended by the second defendant
and all the siblings apart from Siong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
plaintiff says that the meeting decided that, as the purpose of
the 950 account had ended with Mdm Yeo’s death, the 950 account
would be liquidated and each beneficiary would be given his or her
share in due course. The first defendant asked to read the Will
himself and was given the document in order that he could do so.
He did not raise any objections to the Will or to the decisions
made during the meeting. He did not make any request for the 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
in the second defendant’s name to be paid or to be given to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The
plaintiff also says that to determine the transfer fee payable when she
transferred the second defendant’s 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
to him, she needed the birth certificate of the defendants to prove
that the second defendant was the first defendant’s son and that
the first defendant was her brother. She asked both of them for
these documents at the meeting. Subsequently, the first defendant
told her that he had reminded the second defendant to pass over
the birth certificate as soon as possible. There was no indication
at this time that the first defendant was disputing the second defendant’s entitlement
to share in the distribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
position changed a few weeks later. On 22 October 2009, the first defendant,
through his solicitors, sent a letter of demand to the plaintiff
and Amy Tan. This letter stated that the first defendant was the
beneficiary of Mdm Yeo under the Intestate Succession Act and that
his “rightful 1/9 share in the estate should be distributed to and
given only to him and in his personal name”. Subsequently, lawyers
for the plaintiff and Amy Tan responded to state that Mdm Yeo had
not died intestate and that under her will, the only beneficiaries
were her four daughters. On 5 November 2009, the first defendant
through his lawyers changed his position again and made a claim
for a 1/9 share in the 950 account. The plaintiff did not accept this.
Her solicitors responded to the effect that when Mdm Yeo made the Gift,
the first defendant had given instructions that his share of the
same should be given to his son, the second defendant. Therefore
if the first defendant wanted to retract his gift to his son, he
would have to ask the latter to relinquish his rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Shortly
thereafter the second defendant also appointed lawyers and correspondence
subsequently ensued between all the parties. In February 2010, the
second defendant took the position that there was no basis on which
the first defendant could make a claim for a 1/9<sup>th</sup> share
in the 950 account. He asked for that share to be paid to him forthwith.
The first defendant did not withdraw his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The
plaintiff commenced these proceedings by writ in June 2012. In her
statement of claim, after setting out the facts and asserting that
the dispute was between the first defendant and the second defendant,
she stated the respective positions of the defendants as at the
filing of the claim to be as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
first defendant had maintained that it was his intent at all times
that his portion of the Gift was to be eventually given to his three
children, including the second defendant, equally; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
second defendant had maintained that it was the intent of the first
defendant that the first defendant’s portion was to be given to the
second defendant absolutely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The
plaintiff went on in para 5 of the statement of claim to formulate what
she saw as the issues raised by the dispute between the defendants. Among
these are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     When
the first defendant initially placed his 1/9<sup>th</sup> share
into the name of the second defendant was it an outright gift?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did
the first defendant have any rights or residual rights over the
1/9<sup>th</sup> share?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     Was
the second defendant to hold the 1/9<sup>th</sup> share
for the benefit of all the first defendant’s children in equal shares?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     Which
party is the lawful beneficiary of the 1/9<sup>th</sup> share?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
first defendant filed a long defence. At first he based his defence on
the premise that Mdm Yeo had died intestate and as one of her children he
was entitled to a 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion of the
estate under the laws of intestacy. A copy of the will was then
forwarded to his lawyers and the first defendant’s defence was amended.
The material averments of the amended defence can be summarised
as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     At
all material times, the assets of the 950 account were in law and
fact beneficially owned by Mdm Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
about 1981, Mdm Yeo created a trust whereby her shares in TSR were
to be held on trust for herself until her death and thereafter, the
trust funds were to be distributed equally to her lawful children and
none other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mdm
Yeo had 9 lawful children including the first defendant; the second
defendant who is the son of the first defendant was not a beneficiary
of the 950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
plaintiff was the trustee of the 950 account; she administered the
account during Mdm Yeo’s lifetime and upon Mdm Yeo’s demise distributed
8/9<sup>th</sup> of the assets to the children of
Mdm Yeo, including herself, but failed refused and neglected to
distribute the 1/9<sup>th</sup> share due to the
first defendant despite his demand on 22 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_e"></a>(e)     As
a result, the plaintiff is in breach of her duties as trustee of the
950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_f"></a>(f)     HAPL
was a limited company created solely for the purpose of receiving
funds due to Mdm Yeo and maintaining her from the dividends generated
by her shares. All the assets of HAPL were held as trust assets
for Mdm Yeo under the 950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
directors of HAPL had no right to transfer the assets of the 950
account to Mdm Yeo’s children before her death.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_h"></a>(h)     He
denied that he had chosen to have his share transferred to the name
of the second defendant and asserted that the directors of HAPL
acted wrongfully in putting the share in the name of the second defendant
who, at the material time, had no legal capacity or right to hold
any shares in HAPL. In any event, any share held by the second defendant
in HAPL was held as a nominee and on trust for the first defendant
and was never intended to be given to the second defendant. As the
second defendant was an infant at the material time, any share transfer
to him would have been invalid in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_i"></a>(i)     The
dissolution of HAPL did not detract from its object and the beneficial
interest in all the shares of HAPL was held on trust and for the
sole benefit of Mdm Yeo in accordance with the 950 account. The purpose
of the 950 account was to generate income for the maintenance of
Mdm Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
first defendant was not a party to the Deed and the alleged designation
of the second defendant as the named owner of a 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
was invalid for, at all material times, the true owner was Mdm Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_k"></a>(k)     The
plaintiff by her conduct in seeking to divest the ownership of Mdm
Yeo’s assets during Mdm Yeo’s lifetime had acted in breach of trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_l"></a>(l)     On
Mdm Yeo’s death, her estate comprising the whole of the 950 account
ought to have been distributed in accordance with her intention
in equal shares to her beneficiaries who were her nine children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_m"></a>(m)     The
plaintiff was in breach of her duties as trustee of the 950 account
and had initiated unnecessary proceedings. The 950 account should
not be penalised for costs and the plaintiff and/or the second defendant
should be made to bear the legal costs of the proceedings on an
indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I
have set out the first defendant’s pleadings in some detail so as
to indicate the whole thrust of his case which the second defendant
had to meet. The significance of this will be apparent later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
second defendant put in a defence and counterclaim. He admitted
most of the averments of the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim
in relation to the origin and history of the 950 account. He noted
that the plaintiff had confirmed in para 55 in the Statement of
Claim that in 1983, the first defendant had asked her to put his
1/9<sup>th</sup> share of the 950 account in the
name of the second defendant. He relied on the plaintiff’s pleadings
as to the relative positions of the first and second defendants
in respect of the 950 account. Accordingly his position is:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
plaintiff has failed in her duties as trustee of the 950 account by
not adhering to the fact that a 1/9<sup>th</sup> share
thereof has always been in the name of the second defendant and
the plaintiff has no legal basis on which to withhold payment of
this share to the second defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
plaintiff has breached her duties as trustee of the 950 account
by not distributing to the second defendant the money to which he
is entitled. The plaintiff had no need to apply to the court for directions
and it was for the second defendant to seek his remedy, if any,
in the courts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
present proceedings are unnecessary and unreasonable and the plaintiff
should not be entitled to recover costs on any basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In
relation to the first defendant’s defence, the second defendant denied
the substantive claims of the first defendant. Essentially, he maintained
that a gift had been made to him of the first defendant’s interest in
the 950 account. The main bases for this assertion were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     By
giving instructions that the 1/9<sup>th</sup> share
of the 950 account should be registered in the name of the second
defendant, the first defendant made an absolute gift of the same
to the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
the alternative, these instructions amounted to an advancement to
the second defendant as the son of the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In
his counterclaim, the second defendant claims payment of the sum of
money in the 950 account which represents his 1/9<sup>th</sup> share,
interest and costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The
main issues arising from the pleadings are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     When
she transferred her 950 TSR shares to HAPL, was Mdm Yeo making a
gift of the same to her children or was she setting up a trust for
herself for her lifetime and thereafter for her children?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
a gift was made, what happened to the first defendant’s share in
the gift?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     Was
the plaintiff justified in commencing this lawsuit and can she be
indemnified for costs?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did Mdm Yeo make a gift or declare
a trust?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
legal position regarding the effect of the legal transfer of property by
one person to another free of any obligation on the part of the
recipient to pay for the same is not in doubt. Whether the recipient
becomes the legal and beneficial owner of the transferred property
or becomes only the legal owner, holding the beneficial interest
on trust for the transferor, depends on the intention of the transferor.
This intention may be expressed orally or in writing or may be inferred
from conduct and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On
behalf of the plaintiff, Chuan was the main witness as to Mdm Yeo’s
intentions in 1981. He testified that he and Siong set up HAPL as
an investment holding company to manage Mdm Yeo’s shareholdings
in TSR and GSPL. He said that this arrangement arose out of his
idea to do estate planning for his mother. Chuan thought estate
planning would ensure a smooth transition of Mdm Yeo’s TSR and GSPL
shares which had the potential to become very valuable one day.
He approached his mother and advised her that, for estate planning
purposes, she should look into giving her shares away and asked
her who she wanted to give them to. Mdm Yeo was receptive to estate
planning and told him that she wanted to give the shares to her
nine children equally. The purpose of the estate planning was to
effect an immediate distribution of the shares and not a distribution upon
Mdm Yeo’s death. Mdm Yeo knew this and was agreeable to the idea.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Chuan
also advised his mother that the best way of disposing of her shares
for estate planning purposes would be to set up a company which could
buy over the shares and then the shareholders of the company would hold
its shares in proportion to their interests in her gift. Chuan testified that
Mdm Yeo had not told him anything about holding the shares in a trust.
He subsequently informed some of his siblings, including the second defendant
and Pof Eng, about Mdm Yeo’s intentions and told them that their
mother wanted to give each of them a 1/9th portion of her TSR and GSPL
shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Chuan
was the only child who spoke directly to Mdm Yeo about her intentions.
Lucy Lim’s evidence was that she was told contemporaneously by Chuan
that her mother wanted to give her shares to all the nine children and
that this gift would be effected by transferring the shares to HAPL
and making the children shareholders of HAPL. At the time, Lucy
Lim was living in the United States. She did not speak to her mother
about the latter’s intentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Whilst
Amy Tan did not speak to Mdm Yeo about the shares, her testimony
was that Chuan told her about Mdm Yeo’s intention to make her children
a gift of the shares and that he did so in their mother’s presence.
At that time Mdm Yeo was in her early sixties and was in good health.
The plaintiff herself was not able to add any direct evidence on
this point. All she could say was that at all times all of Mdm Yeo’s
children knew that it was their mother’s intent to give away her
shares in TSR and GS before her death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In
his affidavit, the first defendant asserted that it was always his
late mother’s intention throughout her lifetime right up to the
date of her death that only her children surviving at her demise
would be entitled to her shares in TSR and GSPL. He did not say
in that affidavit how he knew what Mdm Yeo’s intention was. When
he was questioned about this in court, he said that until this case
started, he did not know exactly whether his mother held shares
in TSR and GSPL because she had not discussed the matter with him.
All he knew was that his mother was very rich. His mother told him that
she had so much money and that when she died she wanted to see that all
her children would have one share of her money. However, she did
not tell him what share counters she had. He also said that he assumed
that Mdm Yeo would never give him anything whilst she was alive.
That was more or less the sum total of his evidence on Mdm Yeo’s
intentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Pof
Eng, who testified on behalf of the first defendant, asserted in
his affidavit that Mdm Yeo created a trust of her TSR and GSPL shares
so that the dividends arising from the shares would be accumulated
and held on trust to maintain her during her lifetime and, after
her demise, the accumulated proceeds would be divided equally amongst
her nine children. In court, he elaborated that Mdm Yeo had told
him this during her lifetime. She had said that she wanted her shares
to be given to her children after her death. She also said that
there was a company which was holding the shares for her and this
company would pay for all her expenses throughout her years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Apart
from assertions as to what Mdm Yeo told her children, there are
some other pieces of evidence that may assist in solving the puzzle.
First, there is the fact that between 1981 and 1988 when the Deed
was executed, no dividends were paid to HAPL in respect of the TSR
and GSPL shares and HAPL did not maintain Mdm Yeo. Until his death
in November 1983, Mdm Yeo’s husband maintained her. After that,
she was maintained out of her own funds and also by some of her
children. Nothing was paid by HAPL. This evidence supports the plaintiff’s
position because if Mdm Yeo had no need of income from the TSR and
GSPL shares in 1981 and, in any case, these counters were not income-producing
then she would have had no cause to create a trust of the income
for her own support. It was the undisputed evidence of the plaintiff
that it was only sometime after 1988, when the liquidator of TSR
made a distribution in specie of UOB shares as representing contributories’
holdings in TSR, that the 950 account started receiving dividend
income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The
next piece of evidence relates to the manner in which the TSR and
GSPL shares were transferred to HAPL. While it is the plaintiff’s position
that they were transferred to HAPL as a gift to her children, that company
in fact passed a resolution to purchase the TSR shares for $158,000.
There was probably a similar resolution in respect of the GSPL shares
but that was not produced in court. Chuan’s evidence was that HAPL
paid Mdm Yeo cash of $168,000 for both counters and that he himself
had financed this payment by selling his own publicly listed shares. Upon
reflection I think that this evidence, if true, is by itself neutral
vis a vis the parties’ respective positions. The usual inference
that is drawn when a company acquires an asset for value is that
the company itself is the legal and beneficial owner of the asset.
It does not hold that asset on trust for the vendor nor do its own
shareholders have any interest in the asset. Thus, while a sale
of the shares would militate against an intention to make a gift, it
would also militate against the establishment of a trust in favour
of Mdm Yeo herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     There
is, however, evidence from Lucy Lim as to why the transfer was structured
as a purchase. She explained that there was a concern that unless valuable
consideration was shown as having been paid, the authorities would
not accept that Mdm Yeo had genuinely disposed of her assets and then
the estate planning exercise would have failed. Lucy Lim also believed that
the consideration paid was nominal and it was not until these proceedings
started and she saw the resolution passed by HAPL that she changed
her mind and accepted that a substantial sum had been paid. In fact,
there is no evidence that this payment was anything more than a
paper transaction. No document supported Chuan’s assertion that
he had sold his shares and that Mdm Yeo had received the full amount
of $168,000. It is significant that when it came to the Deed, although
the same mentioned large sums of money as purchase consideration
for the various transfers that took place pursuant to the Deed,
the evidence of some of the parties to the Deed was that they had
not paid anything to each other. Chuan himself was unable to say
whether any money had changed hands in relation to the Deed. He
said that he did not know about this and that, because by then he was
no longer in charge of HAPL, he had relied on Siong who was “performing
the mechanics” required to effect the transactions agreed to in the
Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Chuan
testified that it was he who came up with the mechanism for the
transfer of his mother’s shares in order to give effect to her intention
to gift them to her children. He invited his siblings to subscribe
for shares in HAPL. His siblings agreed to this but not all of them
took up the subscriptions in their own names. He also testified
that they were each allotted 22,000 shares but he could not remember
how many paid for the shares and how many did not. The first defendant
criticised this evidence as being unsupported by documents or the
testimony of the plaintiff, Lucy Lim and Amy Tan. Also the first
defendant denied Chuan’s assertion that he had paid for shares in
HAPL. In my view, what was important in this arrangement was that
the siblings took up shares in HAPL. No doubt if they paid for the
shares that could be considered some indication that no gift was
made. It could mean equally that HAPL was not intended to be a trustee
as it would be odd for the siblings to pay for shares in a company which
was going to hold a substantial portion of its assets on trust for Madam
Yeo. The true import of their becoming shareholders was that this was
consistent with an intention to make a gift of the shares to them,
albeit through this mechanism their interests were indirect. If
HAPL’s purpose was only to manage Mdm Yeo’s shares as trustee, Siong
and Chuan could have remained its sole shareholders and there would
have been no need to involve any other sibling as a shareholder.
These two brothers would then have been able to manage the company
without having to be accountable, even notionally, to anyone else.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The
next piece of evidence is the Deed itself. This provides for 950
of HAPL’s TSR shares to be transferred to the eight persons named
in cl (ii) and for one of these persons to receive 2/9<sup>th</sup><sup>s</sup> of
the 950 TSR shares while the other seven were to receive 1/9<sup>th</sup> each
of the same corpus. In my view, the distribution of the 950 shares
to eight persons was not consistent with the same being held on
trust for Mdm Yeo. If that were the case, it would have been simpler
to provide for the shares to be transferred to one sibling to be held
on trust for Mdm Yeo during her lifetime. Instead there was this somewhat
awkward arrangement of a declared transfer to all eight and then a
provision whereby the parties to the Deed agreed to hold the shares
intact during Mdm Yeo’s lifetime. The fact that they had to make
such an agreement also supports the inference that the 950 TSR shares
no longer belonged to Mdm Yeo. This conclusion is reinforced by
cl (iii) of the Deed which expressly provides in respect of the
1600 TSR shares “purchased” by the Purchasers and Vendors that in
the event the transfer to them was not effected, they would nevertheless
retain the beneficial ownership of the shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Next,
I come to the parties’ conduct after the execution of the Deed. The
first defendant submitted that the conduct of the Plaintiff and
her witnesses in keeping the 950 account “intact” during Mdm Yeo’s
lifetime and only distributing it on her death rebutted the plaintiff’s
claim that Mdm Yeo had given away the 950 TSR shares in her lifetime.
He laid emphasis on the fact that the minutes of the Malacca meeting
referred to all attendees agreeing “that 950 was set up with [Mdm
Yeo’s] shares, and that she is the true owner”. He said that this
reflected the true position of the 950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having
considered all of the evidence of the parties’ conduct after the establishment
of the 950 trust, I am satisfied that the same reflected the common
understanding of the siblings (except perhaps that of the first defendant)
that Mdm Yeo had given away her shares to her children absolutely.
Their conduct at the two meetings supports Chuan’s evidence as to
the original reason for the transfer of the shares to HAPL rather
than the first defendant’s assertions in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Chuan
and Lucy Lim also testified that the reason why the Deed was executed
was that many of the siblings wanted to take back control over the shares
that they had injected into HAPL. At that time Mdm Yeo had her own
money but the siblings generally thought that whatever she had given them
might have to be used to support her as well. They felt it would
be best to keep her gift intact and use it to support her as long
as she lived. This was the reason why the 950 account was set up
instead of making an immediate distribution of the Gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I
accept the evidence that after 1988, the siblings met from time
to time and continued to discuss how Mdm Yeo should be looked after. Generally
they were happy with the way that the 950 trust was administered by
the plaintiff and Amy Tan. The minutes of the Bangkok meeting in
1994 reflect some of these discussions in particular in relation
to her accommodation. At that meeting, the attendees (who included
Pof Eng) agreed that if the property market stabilised, a property
should be purchased for Mdm Yeo and in the event of her death, that
property should be sold by the beneficiaries entitled to it either
under her will or under the intestate succession law and the sale
proceeds should be distributed to the parties in accordance with
their entitlements under the 950 account. This is significant because
it meant that the proceeds of any property purchased for Mdm Yeo
with the assets of the 950 account would go back to the beneficiaries
of the 950 account and would not be distributed in accordance with
her will or the laws of intestacy. Such an agreement was contrary
to the first defendant’s stand that upon Mdm Yeo’s death, the proceeds
of the 950 account were to be divided equally amongst her children.
In this regard, I accept the testimony given for the plaintiff that
the siblings regarded the second defendant as a beneficiary of the
950 account and that until this action was started no claim was
made that it was the first defendant who was the true beneficiary
in place of his son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
minutes of the Bangkok meeting also noted that all shares belonging
to the 950 account were to be put in the plaintiff’s name and that she
was to make a provision in her will that such shares were held in
trust by her “for all”. Further the plaintiff was to declare her
proportion of dividends received from the shares belonging to the
950 account as her income and, again significantly, “everyone is
advised to do likewise”. All the siblings apart from the first defendant
attended this meeting and these two agreements that I have referred
to demonstrate their understanding that the 950 account belonged
to them not Mdm Yeo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Moving
on to the minutes of the Malacca meeting in 2005, I deal first with
the reference to Mdm Yeo being the true owner of the TSR shares. Lucy
Lim took the minutes and she was asked why she had written this.
Her response was that she had put it this way because she felt that
the siblings were morally obliged to use the funds in the 950 account
for their mother’s benefit. This had come up because Pof Eng had
asked for the funds to be distributed and the others felt, some
strongly, some less so, that they should not touch the money in
case Mdm Yeo needed it. However in the end it was agreed that some
distribution should be made of the income. I accept this explanation
and that Lucy Lim meant to indicate that Mdm Yeo was the original
owner of the 950 TSR shares and not that she was the legal owner
of the assets in the 950 account as at 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Apart
from the statement as to the “true ownership” of the trust funds,
the discussion of the distribution of surplus funds as reflected
in the Malacca minutes demonstrate the siblings’ understanding that
they were the beneficial owners of the assets of the 950 account.
The proposal regarding distribution came from Pof Eng. He made two
suggestions: distribute excess income after expenditure or, secondly,
halve the capital. These suggestions were not consistent with the
position he took in court that the assets belonged to Mdm Yeo for
her lifetime and that the siblings’ entitlement would only arise
after her death. When he was asked in court how he could have made
a proposal that was against Mdm Yeo’s intent (as asserted by him)
that the assets should belong to her for life, he said he did not
see anything wrong in it. When pressed, his response was that the proposals
would not harm her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The
meeting discussed Pof Eng’s proposal and, as noted above, the eventual
conclusion was that the capital had to be kept intact but that excess income
could be distributed as loans. Pof Eng agreed in court that it had been
decided at the meeting that the proposal to make a distribution
would not be implemented unless there was unanimous agreement on
the same. It was pointed out to him that the decision for unanimous
agreement by the siblings and the second defendant would be inconsistent
with his stand that the only trustees of the 950 account were Siong
and Chuan (this was a position also taken by the first defendant).
His reply was that the inconsistency had not occurred to him at
the time. At a later point in his testimony, he maintained that
when he made the proposal he was hoping that in the circumstances
the siblings could utilise the surplus assets whether this course
was right or wrong in respect to the fact that this account was
a trust for Mdm Yeo. It can be seen that he was not able to rationalise
his inconsistent positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It
is worth noting that subsequent to this meeting, annual distributions
of the surplus income were made to the eight persons named in the
Deed and that Pof Eng received and kept 2/9<sup>ths</sup> of
each such distribution. None of the recipients objected to the distributions.
On 18 April 2007 Lucy Lim sent an email to each of the eight, including
Pof Eng and the second defendant. She attached the final accounts
of the 950 account for 2006 to the email. In its text, she said
that based on the decision to distribute the excess of income over
expenses, the distribution in 2007 would come to $50,000 per 1/9<sup>th</sup> share.
She asked for instructions on how each person wanted their distribution
given to them and stated that objections should be raised by 29
April 2007. There was no evidence that Pof Eng, or for that matter
anyone else, objected to the distribution whether by the stated
date or thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I
also find it significant that the first defendant had contributed
to the discussion on distribution during the Malacca meeting. In
relation to the proposal that it be by way of loan which could either
be repaid at the option of the recipient or deducted from the final
distribution, he objected to the suggestion that interest be charged.
The minutes do not note any objection by him to distribution <em>per </em><em>se</em> though
they do state that Chuan and Siong felt such action would be a breach
of trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On
a consideration of all the evidence I am satisfied that it has been proved
on a balance of probabilities that it was Mdm Yeo’s intention in 1980
or 1981 to make an immediate gift of her shares to her children
in equal shares. I accept Chuan’s oral evidence as to how the Gift
arose and that his mother had clearly expressed her intention to
him. I also accept the evidence of the plaintiff and her sisters
that the common understanding of all the siblings including the
first defendant was that this was a gift and they were intended
to be the absolute owners of their mother’s shares. I do not accept
Pof Eng’s evidence that his mother told him something different.
As I have pointed out above his conduct was inconsistent with such
an understanding. In fact, his acceptance that he had a 2/9<sup>th</sup> interest
in the 950 account was in itself contrary to his stand that the
siblings’ rights would only arise on Mdm Yeo’s death. When he was
questioned about this, he was not able to explain how Tan Poh Lim
could have given him the extra 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
at the very beginning in 1981 or thereabouts when Mdm Yeo was still
alive. Further, it did not make sense for Mdm Yeo to transfer her
shares to HAPL if her intention was for the company to hold and
use the shares for her benefit. Such an intention would mean that
she had not relinquished all interest in the shares and would have
risked nullifying the aim of taking the shares out of her estate
so as to avoid estate duties on her death. The plaintiff’s explanation
that the shares were transferred to HAPL as the mechanism by which
the Gift was effected is a more coherent explanation than the first
defendant’s explanation that the transfer was a way of setting up
a trust for Mdm Yeo’s benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I
should also state that I did not find the first defendant to be
a credible witness. He was frequently evasive in his testimony and
also prevaricated a great deal. Often he was not able to give coherent
answers to the questions he was asked. His testimony on Mdm Yeo’s
intentions, in particular, appeared to be made up. He admitted that
Mdm Yeo had never spoken to him about the shares and asserted that
he did not even know that there were such shares. All his mother
told him, he said was that she was a rich woman and wanted her money
to go to her children on her death. If this is what Mdm Yeo told
him, then it was far from establishing that she intended HAPL to
hold the shares she transferred to it on trust for her during her
lifetime. I think that the first defendant did not have any direct knowledge
of Mdm Yeo’s intention in relation to the shares and that whatever
he said on this topic was fabricated. Some support for this conclusion
also comes from the way he framed his case in the first place—as a
claim for his entitlement in his mother’s alleged intestacy. The
claim was pleaded this way despite the fact that the first defendant
had read Mdm Yeo’s will shortly after her death and should have
known that he inherited nothing under the will. I infer that the
basis of the first defendant’s claim only changed when he realised
that his original cause of action was a non-starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I
hold that Mdm Yeo’s gift to her children was completed when she transferred
her shares to HAPL. The 950 account was a fund that was set up in
1988 by the children as the owners of the Gift in order to have
ready resources to maintain their mother. At that time Mdm Yeo had
no beneficial interest in the Gift and no right to tell her children
what to do with the 950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What happened to the first defendant’s
portion of Mdm Yeo’s gift?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The
first defendant did not give any positive evidence as to what had happened
to the 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion of the Gift that
had been intended for him. He could not do so because his position
was that there was no gift that took effect in 1981 and that it
was not until his mother’s death in 2009 that her children became
entitled to share in the assets of the 950 account. However, there
was a great deal of evidence from the witnesses for the plaintiff
as to what the first defendant had wanted to do and had done. Whilst
the first defendant denied he had said what they testified to, there
was also some documentary evidence supporting their testimony. This
took the form of a letter written in 1988 and the minutes for the
Bangkok and Malacca meetings. I am satisfied on the basis of all
the evidence that the first defendant intended to give his portion
of the gift to his three children in equal shares but that, equally,
he had directed that it be put in the name of the second defendant.
Some of this evidence is set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Chuan
testified that all nine children were to be allotted shares in HAPL
equally in order to reflect Mdm Yeo’s intention that the Gift was
to be distributed equally amongst them. He remembered that the first defendant
had told him and Siong that the first defendant’s portion should be
put in the second defendant’s name for the second defendant to hold
on behalf of himself and his sisters. Chuan did not recall whether
he had told the other siblings about this. The plaintiff’s testimony
was that she knew that the first defendant had given his portion
to the second defendant but did not know until after the start of
these proceedings what the first defendant’s intentions had been
in 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Amy
Tan testified that after Mdm Yeo had decided to make the Gift, she
had been present at a meeting in the family home amongst herself, Siong,
Chuan, Pof Eng, Poh Lin and the first defendant. It was at this meeting
that she heard the first defendant say that his portion of the Gift should
be put in the second defendant’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Further,
the plaintiff testified that in 1987 when she was living in Toronto,
some of the siblings had visited her and discussed the 950 TSR shares.
This was at a time when the siblings were considering taking the TSR
shares out of HAPL. During this visit, the first defendant had stated that
he still wanted his portion to remain in the second defendant’s
name. This testimony was given after Amy Tan produced a letter dated
3 January 1988 which the plaintiff had written to her to inform
her about the Toronto discussions. The letter states that in the
course of those meetings, the plaintiff herself heard the first
defendant say that he wanted “Andrew’s [that is the second defendant’s]
name down”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The
other evidence of the first defendant’s intentions comes from what
he said in 1994 and 2005. In 1994, he asked Lucy Lim whether the portion
of the 950 account in the second defendant’s name could be put into
his daughters’ names as well. The plaintiff took legal advice on
this query and informed the meeting that for this to be effected
the second defendant had to agree. This outcome was conveyed to
the first defendant. Then in 2005, according to the Malacca minutes,
the first defendant was told that the second defendant was the “named
‘beneficiary’” and that distribution could be made to the second
defendant only. Changes could be effected only with the second defendant’s
consent. The minutes went on to record that the first defendant
stated that he understood the situation and that he wanted the others
to impress on the second defendant that the first defendant’s original
portion was meant for his three children in the event of his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Thus,
I am satisfied that in or about 1983 when the issue came up about
allotting shares in HAPL, the first defendant gave instructions
that his portion should be put in the second defendant’s name. There
is no evidence that, following these instructions, HAPL shares were
indeed allotted to the second defendant. However, there is no evidence
that they were put in the first defendant’s name either. Chuan did
produce a document which he said showed the shareholders of HAPL
from time to time. That was a handwritten document allegedly based
on the records of HAPL. However, neither such records nor the maker
of the document were produced. As such the document was hearsay
and could not be relied on as evidence. Therefore it is only the
appearance of the second defendant’s name in the Deed that shows
how the first defendant’s instructions were given effect to. I accept
the evidence given for the plaintiff that the Deed was drafted in
the way it was because the other siblings believed that the first defendant
had given his share of the Gift to the second defendant and accordingly,
that the second defendant had a 1/9<sup>th</sup> interest
in the 950 TSR shares when they were transferred out of HAPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I
should also say that I accept the second defendant’s evidence that
on two occasions in the 1980s the first defendant told him that
he had given the second defendant his share of the Gift. I am not
so sure that the first defendant also stated expressly that Arlette
and Alena were not to have any share in the same as this evidence
of the second defendant is rather self-serving and is also contradicted
by the evidence of Chuan that he knew from 1983 that the first defendant
wanted all his children to benefit equally. On the other hand, I
am satisfied that the first defendant never told the second defendant
that he was to hold the portion of the Gift for himself and his
sisters. There was no evidence at all of such a declaration, least
of all from the first defendant himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The
question that arises is whether on the facts as I have found them, the
first defendant made an effective gift to the second defendant.
The first defendant submitted that even if he had asked Chuan to
allot 22,000 HAPL shares to the second defendant instead of to himself,
that instruction only related to HAPL shares and could not have
in any way related or affected his portion of the Gift. If at all
there was any gift from the first defendant to the second defendant,
that gift was of HAPL shares only. In any event that could not have
been a valid gift because as an infant the second defendant could
not become the owner of shares. He also argued that since there
was no documentary evidence of the gift to his son and he gave Chuan
oral instructions only, in law, no valid gift could have been made.
This was because under s 7(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999
Rev Ed) (“the CLA”) a disposition of an equitable interest must
be made in writing signed by the person disposing of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     On
the evidence, I do not accept that the first defendant’s intentions were
only that his son should have 22,000 HAPL shares and that intention did
not relate to the Gift. The first defendant was aware that the way
in which the Gift was to be completed was by the allotment of shares
in HAPL and therefore that becoming shareholders of that company
was the way in which the children would accept their mother’s gift.
In giving Chuan instructions to make the second defendant a shareholder
of HAPL in his place, the first defendant knew and intended that
this would in effect pass to the second defendant the first defendant’s
right to take up a 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion of the
Gift in the designated manner. It is significant in this respect
that in later years the first defendant did not assert a personal
right to the Gift; rather his position was that his portion was
to be shared equally amongst his children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In
relation to the second argument, it is not the law that as an infant the
second defendant could not be the owner of shares in 1983. He could
be allotted shares or become the owner of the same by legal transfer.
Any such allotment or transfer of company shares to him during his
infancy would be voidable but not void. The avoidance would have
to be done by the second defendant himself on reaching his majority
and a third party would have no standing to challenge the validity
of the transaction. <em>Walter Woon on Company
Law</em> at para 5.4 makes clear that an infant may repudiate
such allotment or transfer within a reasonable time of reaching
his majority but is bound by it if he affirms it after coming of
age. The position is similar in Australia and England (see also: <em>Hamilton v Vaughan-Sherrin Electrical Co</em> [1894]
3 Ch 589). The second defendant never repudiated the Gift. The first defendant’s
second argument therefore fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     It
is the third argument that has given me some concern. Section 7(2) of
the CLA was only enacted in 1993 but it was derived from the English Statute
of Frauds 1677 and was accepted as part of Singapore law before 1993.
Thus the same requirement as to the manner in which equitable interests
could be effectively disposed of or transferred applied here in
1983 and 1988. It is undisputed that the first defendant never made
any writing in which he indicated his intention to make a gift of
his portion of the Gift either to the second defendant alone or
to his three children equally. This submission would therefore seem
to be an absolute answer to the second defendant’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I
have, however, come to the conclusion that it is not. As would be apparent
from the detailed summary of the first defendant’s defence at [38] above,
he did not plead s 7(2) or the preceding English legislation as
a basis on which to invalidate the alleged gift. It is a basic principle
of our system of civil litigation that a litigant must plead the
material facts on which he relies so as to allow the opponent a
chance to meet the case. Whilst in general legal principles need
not be pleaded, this is not so when one is relying on a specific
statutory provision such as the Limitation Act or the Statute of Frauds
to found a defence. At the least, material facts should be pleaded
so as to alert the opponent to the position that is being taken.
The first defendant could have pleaded that any gift made to the
second defendant was oral and therefore legally ineffective for
want of compliance with the requisite formalities. He had no trouble
pleading that the gift was not valid at law because of the second
defendant’s infancy at the material time but did not take the further
step of pleading that the formalities required to complete the gift
had not been taken. That he did not do so is perhaps not surprising
since most of his defence was given over to his stand that Mdm Yeo
had not made the Gift but had declared a trust under which he could only
benefit upon her death. It is, however, a defect which prevents
him from raising the argument now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It
is well established that a party is bound by his pleaded case. In <em>Abdul Latif Bin Mohammed Thahiar (trading as Canary
Agencies) v Saeed Husain s/o Hakim Gulam Hohiudin (trading as United
Limousine)</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 61, the plaintiff’s solicitor
had failed to amend the pleadings on appeal regarding the quantum
of damages, even though the accountant’s report in evidence had
mentioned a higher sum than that awarded by the trial judge. On
appeal, it was held that it is settled law that parties stand by their
pleaded case and any defect in the pleadings could not be cured
by averments in affidavits or references in counsel’s closing speech.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In
the present case, if the first defendant had pleaded the lack of formalities
the second defendant would have had the opportunity to meet the
case by pleading facts that could perhaps have established the applicability
of the rule laid down in <em>Vandervell v Inland
Revenue Commissioners</em> [1967] 2 A.C. 291 (which sets out
the circumstances in which s 7(2) is inapplicable) or laid the foundation
for a plea of estoppel or part performance as a rebuttal to the
first defendant’s position. Evidence could then have been led in
support of the pleas. Whether the pleas would have succeeded is
not the point; by failing to plead such a position, the first defendant
indicated he was not taking the point and the second defendant was
entitled to rely on its omission. For me to now allow the first
defendant to deprive the second defendant of his interest in the
950 account on the basis of an unpleaded point would not only be
unjust but would also undermine the importance of pleadings in civil
litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The
first defendant also argued that even if the second defendant acquired
an interest in the Gift, he held that interest on trust for the
first defendant. I do not accept that argument. Apart from the fact
that the second defendant was then an infant and thus unable to
be a trustee, the presumption of advancement which the second defendant
relied on would mean that the first defendant could only claw back
his interest in the Gift from his son if he could prove that it
was not his intention to make a gift. The evidence before me established
plainly that at the material time the first defendant’s intention
was to give away his portion of the Gift. He gave directions for
it to be put in his son’s name with this intention and while he might
have wanted the second defendant to hold it for his sisters as well
as himself, he did not tell the second defendant this. What he told
his brother Chuan in this regard was not material to the manner
in which the second defendant received the gift from the first defendant.
Further, in reference to the second defendant, no attempt was made
by the first defendant to impose a trust for the benefit of Arlette
and Alena. Thus even if the second defendant’s and his mother’s
evidence that the first defendant specifically told them that his
interest in the Gift was being passed on only to the second defendant
is not accepted, no trust for the sisters was constituted. I should
point out that in any case due to the second defendant’s lack of
legal capacity in the early 1980s, he could not have been a trustee
for his sisters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I
hold that the second defendant is entitled to receive the remaining undistributed
1/9<sup>th</sup> portion of the 950 account free
from any claim of the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The
plaintiff has asked to be indemnified in respect of the costs of these
proceedings out of the trust monies in her hands. Her argument is that
she had to commence these proceedings because she was faced with two
competing and incompatible claims to the funds. She had done her
best to get the defendants to meet and sort out the conundrum but
they did not respond to her requests. Nor did either defendant take
any step to obtain a court order so she was left with no choice
but to start the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The
second defendant submitted that this litigation was unnecessary and
it would not be reasonable to deduct the plaintiff’s costs out of
the remaining money in the 950 account before paying him the same.
For 29 years the plaintiff had recognised the second defendant as
the owner of 1/9<sup>th</sup> of the Gift and a
beneficiary of the 950 account. She was given an indemnity in September
2009 by the second defendant in which he stated that he agreed to
indemnify her “against all claims relating to the distribution”.
The plaintiff, said the second defendant, should just have carried
out her duty as trustee and paid him the money instead of seeking
a court order. Thus, the plaintiff should not be entitled to take
her costs from the fund. If at all she was entitled to costs, she
should recover them from the first defendant whose frivolous claim
had caused her to initiate the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     I
consider that the plaintiff acted reasonably in starting this suit. There
was clearly a considerable dispute of fact which had to be decided
in a court of law. The plaintiff herself, although she believed
that the second defendant was rightfully entitled to a 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion
of the 950 account, could not have settled the dispute between the
defendants without coming to court. The problem was that there were
differing accounts, events took place many years ago and the parties
did not document each step they took thoroughly. Further the law
in this area is rather complicated and therefore the outcome was
uncertain. If the plaintiff had paid the second defendant his portion
of the 950 account in 2009 she would have laid herself open to a lawsuit
from the first defendant. I cannot fault her for considering that
to be an unattractive option, notwithstanding the existence of the
second defendant’s indemnity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I
hold that the first defendant must bear the costs of the second defendant
on the standard basis and of the plaintiff on the indemnity basis. His
actions led to this lawsuit. Having originally indicated his intention
to divest himself of his interest in the Gift (whether to his son
only or to all three children), he did an about turn when he found
out that there was nothing for him to inherit in Mdm Yeo’s intestacy
and mounted a claim on a basis which undermined and called into
question the very foundation on which all his siblings had been
proceeding for decades. That meant that as many of the siblings
as possible had to give evidence. If the first defendant had taken
action simply in relation to the question of whether he or his son was
the true beneficiary of the 950 account, the case would have been shorter,
less complicated and less expensive and the plaintiff need not have been
involved at all except as a nominal defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Having
said that the first defendant is ultimately responsible for the costs
of the plaintiff, I think it is fair to allow her to recover her
costs, as taxed or agreed on an indemnity basis, from the remaining
funds in the 950 account. The plaintiff should not be out of pocket
in the event that the first defendant is unable to pay these costs.
The first defendant shall reimburse the second defendant with the
amount of any costs paid to the plaintiff in relation to these proceedings
which are taken from the 950 account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For
the reasons given above, I have found that the person who is entitled
to the 1/9<sup>th</sup> portion of the Gift which
was originally intended to be given to the first defendant, is the
second defendant. The second defendant is entitled to be paid the
remaining balance of the 950 account inclusive of any interest that
has accrued thereon. The first defendant shall bear the costs of
