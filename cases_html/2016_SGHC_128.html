It is undisputed that the Plaintiff was entitled to a sum of money from the company’s OCBC account before his exit.  I agreed with the Plaintiff that it was unlikely that the Plaintiff would give the company away to the Defendant for no consideration whatsoever, when the company was a profitable going concern. The issue is whether the Plaintiff had already taken out the sum of money that he was entitled to as of 29 October 2009.  In my view, it appeared that he had already done so by the time of his exit as a director and shareholder, would therefore not be entitled to further sums from the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Regarding the quantum that the Plaintiff was entitled to, I am of the view that parties did not agree on a specific number, despite the Plaintiff’s attempt to show otherwise.

</div> The Plaintiff’s vague explanations clearly could not withstand cross-examination. I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s purported defence is a sham.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 It is important to separate the second issue from the issue of the forgery of the cheques. Whether or not there was forgery by the Plaintiff is a matter that will not be decided in this case as parties have admitted that it is the subject of criminal investigations. The pertinent issue is whether the Plaintiff’s withdrawal of the counterclaim sum by signing on the Defendant’s personal POSB cheques was done with the Defendant’s authorization and consent.  While I do not believe that the payment of the three cheques to the Plaintiff was to settle debts owed to the Defendant, it does not necessary follow that the payment of the cheques to the Plaintiff was thus unauthorized.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Though I rejected the Plaintiff’s defence, I could not accept the Defendant’s allegations at face value either. Reviewing parties’ evidence as a whole, I was of the view that there is insufficient evidence to support the Defendant’s claim that the three cheques were forged without authorization from him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The distinguishing feature and difficulty in this case is that there was a general authority given to the Plaintiff to manage the Defendant’s account. The longstanding practice of the Plaintiff managing the Defendant’s personal POSB account and declaring the Defendant’s taxes struck me as a very unusual arrangement. This was done at the Defendant’s request. Both parties also admitted to a longstanding practice of the Defendant giving the Plaintiff pre-signed cheques from both his personal POSB account as well as the company’s OCBC account, in the course of running the business.

</div> From this arrangement, the irresistible inference was that there was a general, broad-ranging authorization to the Plaintiff to manage the Defendant’s personal finances relating to the POSB account. The unusual blanket authorization in favour of the Plaintiff to manage the Defendant’s personal accounts showed prima facie consent to banking activities conducted by the Plaintiff on the Defendant’s behalf. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 From the surrounding circumstances of how the company was run after 29 October 2009, I was of the view that this blanket authorisation to transfer monies in and out of the Defendant’s personal account and the company’s account must have continued even after the Plaintiff was no longer an officer or employee of the company on paper. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Defendant singled out these three cheques made payable to the Plaintiff and asserted that they ought to be returned to him. This alone, however, was insufficient in showing that the Plaintiff’s actions were not within the blanket authorisation, especially given the unusual nature of the arrangement between both parties. Despite making reference to his personal POSB account statements in the submissions,

</div> the Defendant did not adduce these statements as evidence. His claim that the Plaintiff had transferred $720,000 from the company to the Defendant’s POSB account as director’s fees, and then withdrew $540,000 in the Plaintiff’s own favour out of this <span class="font-italic">same</span> $720,000 was unsupported by documentary evidence. In fact, in terms of the sequence of events, the Defendant’s allegation seems unlikely as the declaration of income as $720,000 was for the year 2011, while the withdrawal of $540,000 was in three separate cheques across three years from 2010-2012. Furthermore, during cross-examination, the Defendant appeared unclear as to the balance in his POSB account at the material time, and admitted that he was not entirely sure that a sum of $720,000 was deposited into his personal account from the company.

It sounds like it is 720, because in little (i), you referred to the amount of 720, and then in little (ii), you say this amount was paid into the POSB account. So this amount must be 720; correct?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Witness: Because I handed him my account passbooks so that he could help me make repayments for the housing loans as well as the car loans. <span class="font-italic">I do not know how much exactly he had withdrawn from my bank account</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q And the plaintiff only took $540,000, leaving a balance of $180,000; right? </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A I do not have the bank statements with me, it was with him.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32  This really begged the question - how did the Defendant prepare his counterclaim?

I do not accept that the Defendant did so simply because he was illiterate or that the Plaintiff did this as favour. This arrangement did not last for merely one or two weeks, but for two to three years. There must have been some informal arrangement that was not disclosed to the court.  It also defied common sense that one would cede all control over a personal bank account merely because he was illiterate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Thus, it was unclear what the limit of the Plaintiff’s authority in managing the Defendant’s personal POSB account up to March 2012 was. Many of their arrangements, whether regarding personal loans or the company, appeared highly informal in nature, such as the curious one in which the Plaintiff continued to run the affairs of the company for essentially no remuneration, even after he had divested himself of all legal interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I am of the view that isolating the three transactions out of the many that were done pursuant to a broad authorization to manage the Defendant’s account, is insufficient  in showing that the three cheques were unauthorised as they do not show a complete picture of the long running arrangements between the parties.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Unfortunately, the parties’ testimonies failed to assist in clarifying the nature of their arrangements regarding the Defendant’s personal accounts. As the evidence stood at the end of trial, I was unable to draw a firm conclusion in favour of the Defendant regarding the counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For the reasons given above, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim and the Defendant’s counterclaim.
