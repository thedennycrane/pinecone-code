<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the Prosecution against
                    the sentences meted out on the accused (“the Respondent”) by the
                    District Judge (“DJ”) in respect of two charges — 1 charge
                    under s 304A(b) Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) and 1
                    charge under s 67(1)(b) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)
                    (“RTA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the appeal, I allowed the
                    Prosecution’s appeal. I now set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       According to the Statement of Facts
                    (“SOF”), on 4 April 2012, at about 7.00pm, the Respondent drove
                    his motor car to Lorong 15 Geylang to meet up with three of his friends at a
                    coffee shop for dinner and drinks. They ordered a total of 6 bottles of beer, of
                    which the Respondent consumed 2 bottles. At about 8.45pm, the Respondent left
                    the coffee shop and drove his motor car to send a friend home before heading
                    home himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At about 9.29pm, the Respondent was driving
                    along Lower Delta Road after dropping his friend off. The Respondent entered a
                    slip road leading to Jalan Bukit Merah. Without stopping his motor car at the
                    give way line, the Respondent proceeded to exit the slip road and turn left into
                    Jalan Bukit Merah in the direction of Queensway.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In doing so, however, the Respondent failed to
                    keep a proper lookout and thus did not see one Sin San Wah (“the
                    deceased”) cycling along the extreme left lane of Jalan Bukit Merah. The
                    front right of the Respondent’s motor car thus collided with the
                    deceased’s bicycle. Upon impact, the deceased was run over by the motor
                    car and was pinned under it. The deceased suffered multiple injuries and was
                    pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic at 9.55pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the time of the accident, the weather was
                    fine, road surface was dry and the visibility was fair. The traffic flow along
                    Jalan Bukit Merah towards the direction of Queensway was light.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The police officers who arrived at the scene to
                    investigate the collision observed that the Respondent smelled strongly of
                    alcohol. The Respondent was then placed under arrest and escorted to Traffic
                    Police Headquarters for investigations. At about 11.45 pm, a Breath Evidential
                    Analyser test which was conducted revealed that the proportion of alcohol in the
                    Respondent’s breath was 42 microgrammes of alcohol in every 100
                    millilitres of breath. This exceeded the prescribed limit by 7
                    microgrammes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Respondent pleaded guilty before the
                    district judge, admitted to the facts in the SOF and was convicted on two
                    charges:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">MAC 7965-2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, Wong Yew Foo … are charged that you, on the

                        Jalan Bukit Merah towards the direction of Queensway near lamp post 74 A,
                        Singapore, being the driver of a motor car bearing registration number SGS
                        2868 S, did cause the death of a pedal cyclist, Sin San Wah (m/67), by doing
                        a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, to wit by failing to
                        keep a proper look out for the said pedal cyclist while entering Jalan Bukit
                        Merah from the slip road of Lower Delta Road resulting in a collision
                        between your motor car and the deceased’s bicycle which was travelling
                        along Jalan Bukit Merah in the direction of Queensway, hence causing his
                        death, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section
                        304A(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And MAC 7966-2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, Wong Yew Foo … are charged that you, on the
                            4<sup>th</sup> day of April 2012, at about 9.29pm, along

                        Singapore, when driving motor car bearing registration number SGS 2868 S,
                        did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your
                        breath exceeds the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100
                        [millilitres] of breath, to wit, not less than 42 microgrammes of alcohol in
                        100 [millilitres] of breath, and you have thereby committed an offence
                        punishable under section 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter
                        276.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DJ sentenced the Respondent to the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     For MAC 7965-2012 under s 304A(b) PC:
                        a fine of $10,000 (in default 2 months’ imprisonment) and
                        disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 4
                        years with effect from the date of conviction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     For MAC 7966-2012 under s 67(1)(b) RTA: a fine of
                        $2500 (in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment) and disqualification from
                        driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 2 years with effect from the
                        date of conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The total sentence was hence a fine
                    of $12,500 and disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a
                    period of 4 years with effect from the date of conviction. At the time of the
                    appeal, the fine had already been paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was noted from the outset that the DJ
                    incorrectly concluded that Prosecution was appealing only against the sentence
                    imposed for the s 304A(b) PC charge and not the s 67(1)(b) RTA charge.
                    Therefore, the key thrust of her grounds of decision (“GD”)
                    centred on the sentencing considerations in relation to the former. They were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The proper punishment for causing
                        death by a negligent act is the imposition of a fine unless aggravating
                        factors render it a “most unusual case” to warrant a custodial
                        sentence. A “most unusual case” is one where the level of
                        negligence is towards the higher end of the objective range of seriousness
                        and bordering on recklessness.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Court could not reject the Respondent’s claim
                        that he had taken some care, albeit insufficient, before executing the turn
                        from the slip road. The Prosecution did not object to the Respondent’s
                        mitigation that he had indeed slowed down to check for the oncoming traffic.
                        Further, the Respondent’s view might have been compromised by the big
                        tree at the scene and the shadows that it cast at the said
                    location.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Respondent’s negligence fell short of the level of negligence
                        demonstrated by the accused persons in previous s 304A(b) PC cases where
                        custodial terms had been imposed. Those cases were more serious in nature as
                        the accused persons took the risk when they did not have a complete view of
                        the path that they were taking or failed to notice a pedestrian or cyclist
                        who was directly ahead of them for a period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Moreover, the facts of the present
                        case were not more serious than in cases where fines had been imposed even
                        though the accused persons in those cases had deliberately and intentionally
                        chosen to act in a certain way which resulted in an
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     In
                        determining whether the Respondent’s drink driving seriously
                        aggravated the act of negligence in this case, other factors like the amount
                        of alcohol consumed by the Respondent as well as whether his state of
                        intoxication had contributed to the cause of the collision would have to be
                        taken into account. As regards the former, she noted that the alcohol level
                        in this case was lower than the precedents cited by the Prosecution. As
                        regards the latter, there was no direct evidence to support a conclusion
                        that his state of intoxication was a causal factor in that it had caused or
                        had contributed to his failure to keep a proper look out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Respondent was a first time
                        offender and his early plea of guilt was indicative of his
                    remorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the light of the above, the DJ was of the
                    view that the negligence of the Respondent was not of such an aggravated degree
                    as to warrant a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Principles governing appellate intervention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It bears emphasising from the outset that it
                    is settled law that an appellate court only has a limited scope to intervene
                    when reappraising sentences imposed by a court at first instance: see <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4
                    SLR(R) 653 (“<em>Angliss</em>”) at [13];
                    affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at
                    [81].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Kwong Kok Hing</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 684 (“<em>Kwong Kok Hing</em>”) at [14], it was held that an appellate
                    court would interfere with the sentence imposed if it was satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     the trial judge had made the wrong
                        decision as to the proper factual basis for sentence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     there had been an error on the part of
                        the trial judge in appreciating the material placed before
                    him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     the sentence
                        was wrong in principle; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive or
                        manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The threshold for determining
                    whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate or excessive is whether it
                    “requires substantial alterations rather than minute corrections to
                    remedy the injustice”: see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [13].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In respect of the s 304A(b) PC charge, the
                    Prosecution submitted that having regard to all the facts and circumstances of
                    the case, the custodial threshold had been crossed. It argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The DJ failed to give sufficient
                        weight to the aggravating factor of the Respondent being intoxicated above
                        the prescribed legal limit when he caused the deceased’s
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The DJ
                        failed to identify the Respondent’s degree of negligence as being
                        high, and in particular erred in failing to appreciate the material before
                        her by:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       failing to give adequate
                            consideration to the Respondent’s act of filtering onto Jalan
                            Bukit Merah without first making a proper check of the oncoming
                            traffic;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       failing to give adequate consideration to the Respondent’s
                            failure to stop his motor car at the slip road and give way to the
                            deceased who had the right of way;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       failing to give adequate
                            consideration to the fact that there were no vehicles ahead of the
                            Respondent and his view was unobstructed;</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     The DJ placed undue weight on the purported mitigating
                        factors in the case, in particular the Respondent’s assertion that he
                        had checked for both oncoming traffic and there was a blind
                    spot.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     The DJ also
                        gave undue weight to sentencing precedents which could be distinguished, for
                        instance, sentencing precedents for the s 304A(b) PC charge in which the
                        accused persons were not intoxicated beyond the prescribed legal
                        limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In respect of the s 67(1)(b) RTA charge, the
                    Prosecution argued that the DJ failed to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     give sufficient weight to the
                        aggravating factor of the Respondent causing the death of the deceased due
                        to his drink-driving;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     appreciate the material before her in assessing the
                        Respondent’s culpability; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     give adequate consideration to the sentencing precedents
                        where imprisonment was imposed when death was caused by the
                        Respondent’s drink-driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It submitted that
                    having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case, a custodial
                    sentence should also have been imposed for the s 67(1)(b) RTA
                charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Further in respect of both charges, the
                    Prosecution argued that the DJ failed to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     sufficiently consider the principles
                        of deterrence and protection involving such offences; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     give adequate consideration to the
                        sentencing precedents for the length of disqualification normally imposed in
                        cases under s 304A(b) PC and s 67(1)(b) RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Prosecution thus urged me to substitute
                    the fine imposed in respect of the s 304A(b) PC charge with a sentence of 6
                    months’ imprisonment and to enhance the period of disqualification to 8
                    years. In respect of the s 67(1)(b) RTA charge, the Prosecution submitted that a
                    custodial sentence and disqualification period commensurate with the gravity of
                    the Respondent’s wrongdoing be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Respondent contended that the DJ was
                    correct in finding that the degree of intoxication in this case was marginal and
                    did not play any significant causative role in his momentary lapse of judgment.
                    In addition to the low breath alcohol level, his ability to stop almost
                    immediately upon impact indicated that the Respondent was not so intoxicated as
                    to lose control of his vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Moreover, in view of the mitigating factors,
                    the Respondent argued that the DJ was correct in finding that the degree of
                    negligence displayed in the circumstances on that night in question was not
                    unusual or sufficiently severe to merit a custodial sentence. Factors looked at
                    would include the fact that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Respondent was travelling at a
                        relatively slow speed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     the road was dimly lit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     shadows cast by trees might have obstructed the
                        Respondent’s view;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     the deceased was dressed in dark clothing;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        deceased’s bicycle was poorly lit and lacked
                reflectors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent thus submitted that the
                    sentence was not delivered against the weight of evidence nor was it manifestly
                    inadequate in view of the sentencing precedents and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Where the accused faces a number of separate
                    charges, the correct approach to determine the appropriate sentence to be
                    imposed is to first determine the sentences for the individual offences before
                    deciding whether the overall sentence is globally fair in view of the totality
                    of the criminal behaviour by selecting the appropriate sentences to run
                    consecutively or concurrently and if need be, by appropriately adjusting the
                    individual sentences, in order to achieve the overall objective of a globally
                    fair sentence: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Syamsul Hilal bin
                        Ismail</em> [2012] 1 SLR 973. With this in mind, I turn to the appeal
                    proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 304A(b) PC</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 2008 amendments to the Penal Code</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 304A PC reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Causing death by rash or negligent
                            act</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>304A.</b> Whoever causes the death of any person
                        by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall
                        be punished —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">in the case of a rash act, with imprisonment for a
                            term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with both;
                        or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">
<em>in the case of a negligent act,
                                with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with
                                fine, or with both.</em> [emphasis added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As mentioned above at [10(a)], the DJ found
                    that the proper starting point as regards sentencing for this offence is the
                    imposition of a fine unless aggravating factors render it a “most unusual
                    case” rising to the level of culpability as that of a reckless and rash
                    act to warrant a custodial sentence. This sentencing principle was set out in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Gan Lim Soon</em> [1993] 2
                    SLR(R) 67 (“<em>Gan Lim Soon</em>”) at [10]
                    (and applied in <em>Mohamad Iskandar bin Basri v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 440):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under s 304A, the act can be due to either rashness or negligence. If
                        death has been caused by a rash act the proper punishment would be
                        imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. <em>If death
                            has been caused instead by a negligent act, it would be sufficient in
                            most cases to inflict a fine on the accused.</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The dictum in <em>Gan Lim Soon</em> thus appears
                    to evince a sentencing dichotomy between the offences of causing death by
                    rashness and causing death by negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Prosecution queried if the sentencing norm
                    set out in <em>Gan Lim Soon</em> still applies. In this
                    regard, they pointed out that the present form of s 304A PC came in the wake of
                    the 2008 amendments to the Penal Code. Pre-2008 amendments, s 304A PC read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Causing death by rash or negligent
                            act</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>304A.</b> Whoever causes the death of any person
                        by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall
                        be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or
                        with fine, or with both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Prosecution contended that in the light of the pre-2008 amendment
                    provision, there was a need for the court to differentiate between the
                    culpability of an offender who was negligent versus one who was rash when
                    sentencing. This was the basis of the sentencing dichotomy in <em>Gan Lim Soon</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, in the wake of the 2008 amendments, s
                    304A PC has been clearly bifurcated into rashness and negligence limbs with each
                    limb attracting a different statutorily prescribed maximum sentence. The
                    rationale for the sentencing dichotomy expounded in <em>Gan Lim
                        Soon</em> has thus been considerably weakened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Also significant was the increase of the
                    prescribed statutory maximum sentence for the rashness limb (<em>ie</em> s 304A (a) PC) to five years whilst the statutory maximum
                    sentence prescribed for the negligence limb is now two years. It bears
                    reiterating that the court must take the statutory maximum sentence into account
                    when determining the sentence to be imposed. As was emphasised by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Kwong Kok Hing</em> at [44], citing <em>Angliss</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… when Parliament sets a statutory maximum, it signals the gravity
                        with which the public, through Parliament, views that particular offence
                        … Therefore, it stands to reason that the sentencing judges must take
                        note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine
                        precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of
                        punishment devised by Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Therefore, I agreed with the
                    Prosecution’s contention that it is highly questionable if the starting
                    point as regards sentencing for the s 304A(b) offence remains a fine and that
                    only a “most unusual case” would warrant the imposition of a
                    custodial sentence. That said, it is clear that the sentence to be imposed will
                    depend on the nature and extent of the culpability — the more serious the
                    negligence, the more justification there is for the imposition of a custodial
                    sentence: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Kao Chong
                        Sylvester</em> [2012] SGHC 96 (“<em>Lee Kao
                        Chong</em> Sylvester”) at [18].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Drink driving as an aggravating factor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Prosecution’s key contention was
                    that the DJ failed to place sufficient weight on the Respondent’s drink
                    driving as a serious aggravating factor warranting the imposition of a custodial
                    sentence for the s 304A(b) PC offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The DJ’s decision was premised on the
                    dictum in <em>Gan Lim Soon</em> that an offence under the
                    negligence limb would only attract a fine unless it was a “most unusual
                    case” rising to a similar level of culpability as that of a reckless or
                    rash act. However, as explained in the section above, the applicability of this
                    dictum is questionable in the light of the 2008 amendments to the Penal Code.
                    Instead, I found that the preferable approach is to determine the seriousness of
                    the Respondent’s negligence against the standard of care that a prudent
                    and reasonable man would exercise: see <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Teo Poh Leng</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 541.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In coming to her decision that this case did
                    not warrant the imposition of a custodial sentence, the DJ placed some emphasis
                    on her finding that there was no evidence or statement in the SOF that the
                    alcohol had contributed causally to the Respondent’s negligence in failing
                    to keep a proper lookout. She thus took the view that the Respondent’s
                    intoxicated state could not on its own raise the objective seriousness of the s
                    304A(b) PC negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On appeal, the Prosecution submitted that the
                    presence of alcohol in the body was always a factor affecting an
                    individual’s perception, reaction and reflexes. It cited an excerpt from
                    the 1985 Parliamentary Debates on the Road Traffic Act where impairment of
                    driving skill was observed at levels as low as 30 to 50 milligrammes of alcohol
                    per 100 millilitres of blood (approximately 13 to 21.7 microgrammes per 100
                    millilitres of breath) and a rapid deterioration of driving skill thereafter. I
                    found the Prosecution’s submissions on this point in relation to causation
                    highly persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     More critically, I was of the view that this
                    was not a case where a momentary lapse of concentration arising from human
                    frailty resulted in the unfortunate loss of life. On the contrary, not only did
                    the Respondent fail to maintain a proper lookout and to give way to the deceased
                    cyclist who had the right of way, he also made a <em>conscious</em> decision to drink and drive. The lattermost act was
                    one of complete selfish disregard for the safety of other fellow road users
                    since the Respondent could not have been ignorant of the risk that his judgment
                    and driving skills might be impaired as a result of his inebriation. Taken as a
                    whole, it was clear that the Respondent’s conduct fell <em>egregiously</em> below the standard of what a prudent and reasonable
                    man would do. I am even prepared to go so far to hold that by choosing to drive
                    a car (and it was not a case that he chose to ride a bicycle) after having
                    consumed two whole bottles of beer that had sent his level of alcohol in his
                    body beyond the prescribed legal limit, and knowing full well (a) the very
                    serious consequences that might follow due to any impairment of his driving
                    skill and any slowdown in his perception, reaction and reflexes as a result of
                    being in a relatively high state of inebriation; and (b) that a car could cause
                    death to others in a serious accident, the Respondent could also be said to have
                    acted with culpable rashness when he consciously took the risk to drive a car
                    whilst in that state of inebriation. It is of course the Prosecution’s
                    prerogative to prefer a lower charge under s 304A(b) instead of s 304A(a) PC. I
                    was thus satisfied that the Respondent’s culpability for the offence here
                    was of such seriousness that the custodial threshold had been
                breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In determining the gravity of the offence and
                    hence the sentence for the Respondent, the level of alcohol and the degree of
                    loss of control of the vehicle are highly relevant factors. In this regard, I
                    found that the DJ was correct in distinguishing the present case from cases like
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Zaw Myint Tun</em> (unreported,
                    DAC 16003/2006) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Siam
                        Poo</em> (unreported, DAC 25841/2009) where the levels of alcohol were
                    significantly higher and the accused persons were so inebriated that they
                    completely lost control of their vehicles. Nonetheless, the absence of these
                    further aggravating factors (<em>ie</em> of an extremely
                    high level of alcohol and a complete loss of control) would not detract from the
                    seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct, which on the facts of this case
                    would in my view still attract a custodial sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Prosecution raised several contentions in
                    relation to the facts the Respondent had relied on and which the DJ had
                    considered as mitigating the offence. First, it contended that the DJ had erred
                    in accepting the Respondent’s claim that his view of the road had been
                    compromised, in particular, by the shadows cast by a big tree at the scene. The
                    Prosecution pointed out that No 5 of a series of photographs taken of the scene
                    immediately after the accident showed that that the canopy and branches of the
                    tree in question rose well above the street lamp and thus could not have cast
                    shadows as alleged by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I agreed with the Prosecution and further
                    observed from the photos that besides the presence of railings, through which
                    the Respondent could have looked, there was no dense shrubbery which could have
                    obscured the Respondent’s view of the main road. In any case, both the
                    tree and railings were located some distance before the give way line. Hence, I
                    found that the DJ had erred in accepting the Respondent’s claim that his
                    view of the main road (when his car was at the give way line) had been
                    compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Pertinently, paragraph 72 of the Highway Code
                    places the onus of checking for oncoming traffic squarely on the driver of the
                    motor vehicle on the minor road. Had the Respondent’s view of the main
                    road indeed been obstructed by the tree trunk or compromised as alleged, it was
                    all the more incumbent on him to exercise extra prudence when checking for
                    oncoming traffic — for instance, by bringing his vehicle to a complete
                    stop at the give way line and checking for oncoming traffic before slowly easing
                    out and exiting the slip road, instead of taking the risk and making a dangerous
                    assumption that there would be no on-coming cyclist or vehicle hidden by the
                    obstruction or the blind spot coming his way. This would be akin to the
                    dangerous act of overtaking at a sharp bend when the driver’s view of
                    on-coming traffic on the opposite side is obstructed. In this regard, the High
                    Court in <em>Lee Kao Chong Sylvester</em> deemed the
                    accused’s negligent act of deliberately reversing a car at high speed for
                    an extensive distance when he could not completely see the path of his reversing
                    vehicle “a dangerous act or recklessness” (at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Prosecution also contended that the DJ had
                    given undue importance to the Respondent’s assertion that he had slowed
                    down in order to check for oncoming traffic and his blind spot. Counsel for the
                    Respondent submitted below and before me that the Respondent was able to stop
                    his car immediately upon feeling the impact of the collision. He contended that
                    this was consistent with the Respondent’s account of slowing down before
                    exiting the slip road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Several facts contradicted the
                    Respondent’s account. According to the SOF, the deceased had been
                    travelling along the left-most lane when the collision occurred. However, the
                    colour photos taken of the accident scene and the sketch map indicated that the
                    Respondent’s motor vehicle did not come to a standstill until squarely at
                    the middle of the centre-most lane. The deceased and his bicycle were dragged
                    the distance of approximately a full car length. Had the Respondent been
                    travelling at a slow speed and stopped as soon as he felt the impact, one would
                    have expected the car to come to a complete halt earlier. Counsel for the
                    Respondent was unable to offer a satisfactory explanation for this incongruity.
                    I was thus inclined to agree with the Prosecution that the DJ had placed too
                    much weight on the Respondent’s assertion that he had slowed down and that
                    he had checked for oncoming traffic and his blind spot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Even though the cyclist was dressed in dark
                    clothing and his bicycle was not well lit, which might have made it more
                    difficult to spot the deceased on the road at night, this would be more than
                    off-set by the presence of front and side reflectors on the bicycle which were
                    in serviceable condition as stated in the Accident Damaged Vehicle Inspection
                    Report. I was not persuaded that the manner the deceased had dressed, the
                    absence of a bicycle light, the Respondent’s lack of antecedents and his
                    early plea of guilt would sufficiently mitigate in favour of a non-custodial
                    sentence in respect of the s 304A(b) PC offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 67(1)(b) RTA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For reasons mentioned above at [10], this part
                    of the appeal had to proceed without the benefit of the DJ’s full grounds
                    of decision for the s 67(1)(b) RTA charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aggravating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Prosecution’s primary contention was
                    that the DJ failed to give sufficient weight to the aggravating factor of death
                    having been caused. In <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate
                        Courts</em> (Lexis Nexis, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition,
                    2003) at pp 938-939, it was observed that although a fine is the norm for a
                    first offender, this would not be the case if there were aggravating
                    circumstances like involvement in an accident resulting in personal injuries. It
                    was further noted that “[i]n cases where death was caused, a term of
                    imprisonment appears to be inevitable”. Support for this proposition can
                    be found in cases like <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Eng
                        Kiang</em> (MA 48/92/01-02, unreported) (“<em>Lim Eng Kiang</em>”) and <em>Public Prosecutor
                        v Teo Seng Hock</em> (MA 273/95/01, unreported) (“<em>Teo Seng Hock</em>”) where the fines originally
                    imposed on the offenders were substituted with custodial sentences on
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The length of the custodial sentence would in
                    turn depend on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of each case, in
                    particular on the quality of the driving and the amount by which the offender
                    was over the limit. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng
                        Soon</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 240 (“<em>Lee Meng
                        Soon</em>”), Lee Seiu Kin J held at [22] and [29] that the
                    principal aggravating factors were the level of alcohol and degree of control
                    over the vehicle. As regards the latter factor, Chao Hick Tin JA observed in
                        <em>Lim Kay Han Irene v Public Prosecutor</em> [2010] 3
                    SLR 240 (“<em>Lim Kay Han Irene</em>”) that
                    the mere commission of an offence under s 67(1)(b) RTA would not give rise to
                    the presumption that the driver was also incapable of controlling the vehicle.
                    Although involvement in an accident could be indicative of poor control of the
                    vehicle, much would also depend on the circumstances of the accident: see
                        <em>Lee Meng Soon</em> at [27]-[28].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In this regard, I observed that the breath
                    alcohol level of the Respondent had exceeded the prescribed limit of 35
                    microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, albeit by 20%, and that
                    there was no other objective evidence indicating that the Respondent might have
                    lost some degree of control of his vehicle apart from the fact of the accident
                    and the vehicle stopping about a car length after the collision. However, it
                    should be emphasised that the absence of other evidence indicating that he had
                    lost control of his vehicle would not sufficiently mitigate the seriousness of
                    the offence on the facts of his case when he failed to give way, caused the
                    cyclist’s death and his breath alcohol level at the time of causing the
                    fatal accident had exceeded the prescribed limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Culpability of the offender</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>Lim Kay Han
                        Irene</em>, the High Court observed that the sentence meted out to the
                    offender must be calibrated according to the degree to which the offender was
                    culpable for the offence. As Chao JA stated at [29]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Deliberate, purposeful and calculated harm-causing must be
                        differentiated from unintended or incidental peccadilloes. In assessing the
                        degree of culpability of an offender, the court must take into account, all
                        the circumstances, including the reason why the person drove on that
                        occasion and only when this is done would the sentence meted out be fair and
                        proportionate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Such an analysis should not be undertaken from the <em>ex post facto</em> point of view but by stepping into the shoes of
                    the offender (at [34]). In that case, the court took into account the special
                    circumstances of the case — the offender was emotionally fragile and in a
                    heightened state of panic, having been woken up in the wee hours of the morning
                    by a call from the hospital that the medical condition of her aunt, with whom
                    she shared an extremely close relationship, was rapidly deteriorating. The court
                    was of the view that in such a context, her good judgment took leave of her and
                    the fact that she had consumed alcohol hours before was understandably not at
                    the forefront of her mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The circumstances of the present case were far
                    removed from that of <em>Lim Kay Han Irene</em>. According
                    to his own mitigation plea, the Respondent was the designated driver for the
                    evening. Despite this, he consumed two bottles of beer in the course of the
                    evening. The Respondent thus knowingly placed himself in a difficult position
                    where he should have appreciated the possible consequences of his
                    actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Respondent further pleaded in mitigation
                    that he had genuinely believed that he was fit to drive as he had not drunk much
                    and allowed himself 45 minutes prior to taking the wheel. In this regard, the
                    observations of Lee J in <em>Lee Meng Soon</em> at [30] are
                    pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Such precautions arguably reflect a lesser degree of wilful
                        disregard for the law. However the amount of weight to give to this factor
                        is quite another issue as it is far too easy for an offender to undertake
                        precautions, but thereafter underestimate the level of alcohol remaining in
                        his system …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is further noted that the precautionary period allegedly taken by
                    the Respondent in our present case was shorter than that in <em>Lee Meng Soon</em>. I was thus not inclined to place much weight on
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General deterrence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Law
                        Aik Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814, the court held at [24] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">General deterrence aims to educate and deter other
                        like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a
                        particular offender: <em>Meeran bin Mydin v PP</em>
                        [1998] 1 SLR(R) 522 at [9] (“<em>Meeran bin
                            Mydin</em>”). Premeditated offences aside, there are many
                        other situations where general deterrence assumes significance and
                        relevance. These may relate to the type and/or circumstances of a particular
                        offence. Some examples of the types of offences, which warrant general
                        deterrence are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) Offences affecting public safety, public health, public services,
                            public or widely used facilities or public security...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     By now, the opprobrium evoked by drink driving
                    needs no repetition. As Professor S. Jayakumar stated in the 1990 Parliamentary
                    Debates (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (28 March 1990) vol 55 at col 960):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…we must get every driver in Singapore to note that when he is
                        issued a licence, it is in fact a very special privilege and it is granted
                        on condition that he drives in a responsible manner bearing in mind the
                        interests of others. And certainly no driver in Singapore who drinks can
                        claim or should be able to claim that he was unaware of the serious
                        consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The strict legislation put in place for drink driving has been
                    accompanied by rigorous enforcement efforts by the Traffic Police and constant
                    public education efforts to curb drink driving. There is little doubt that a
                    deterrent sentence is warranted here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sentencing Precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Numerous sentencing precedents involving a
                    vast array of factual matrices were presented by the Prosecution and
                    Respondent’s counsel. For purposes of this appeal, I think it appropriate
                    to highlight precedents which involve factual matrices very similar to our own,
                        <em>ie</em>, the offenders were charged with both drink
                    driving and causing death by negligent act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     These sentencing precedents could further be
                    classified into those prior to the 2008 amendments to the PC and those after it.
                    This classification is significant. For the reasons given above at [23]-[27],
                    the precedential value of the former cases have been somewhat
                diminished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Both <em>Lim Eng
                        Kiang</em> and <em>Teo Seng Hock</em> were
                    pre-2008 amendments cases. In <em>Lim Eng Kiang</em>, the
                    offender whilst making a right turn at a junction, cut into the path of an
                    oncoming motorcyclist which resulted in the latter colliding head on into the
                    front left side of the lorry. The offender’s blood specimen contained 132
                    milligrammes of ethanol per 100 millilitres of blood. The High Court rejected
                    the Prosecution’s appeal on the s 304A charge and upheld the fine of
                    $7,000 and a disqualification period of 10 years imposed for the charge. The
                    appeal on the drink driving charge succeeded and the court imposed a sentence of
                    one week’s imprisonment and a disqualification period of 10
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In <em>Teo Seng
                    Hock</em>, the offender failed to keep a proper lookout for vehicles in
                    front of him and collided with the rear of a trishaw. The offender was also
                    convicted of drink driving under s 67(1) and s 84(1) read with s 84(3) RTA for
                    failing to stop and render assistance. The offender’s blood alcohol level
                    was 208 milligrammes of ethanol per 100 millilitres of blood. Following the
                    appeal, the $10,000 fine imposed for the s 304A charge was upheld, but the fine
                    for the offence under s 67 RTA was set aside and substituted with a sentence of
                    4 weeks’ imprisonment and a disqualification period of five years for all
                    classes of vehicle. The disqualification period for the offence under s 304A PC
                    was similarly reduced to five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Prosecution also brought to the
                    court’s attention another pre-2008 PC amendments case. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Su Hong</em> (DACs 17678, 17679 and 17680
                    of 2007, unreported) the accused failed to keep a proper lookout when travelling
                    along the 2<sup>nd</sup> lane from the right of a 5-lane
                    carriageway and collided with the deceased who was crossing from the left to the
                    right of the accused. The collision had taken place more than 50 m away from the
                    nearest pedestrian crossing. The accused did not stop after the accident and
                    fled the scene. Tested three hours after the accident, the accused’s
                    breath alcohol level was found to contain 39 microgrammes of alcohol per 100
                    millilitres of breath. There was some contributory negligence on the part of the
                    deceased who was also drunk. As regards the s 304A PC offence, the accused was
                    sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment and 5 years’ disqualification for
                    all classes of vehicle. As regards the s 67(1)(b) RTA offence, the accused was
                    sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment and 3 years’ disqualification.
                    The accused was also sentenced to 9 weeks’ imprisonment and 3 years’
                    disqualification for the s 84(1) read with s 84(7) RTA charge. Two additional
                    charges were taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It would appear therefore that the courts had
                    imposed relatively short custodial sentences, if any, in circumstances highly
                    similar to our own. Without the benefit of written decisions however, it was not
                    possible to discern the judges’ reasoning for imposing such sentences.
                    Moreover, as had been emphasised, it was questionable if these pre-2008
                    amendment cases were of precedential value, particularly in respect of the s
                    304A(b) charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Prosecution sought to bring to my
                    attention two recent decisions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Public Prosecutor
                            v Mohamed Zairi Bin Ahmad</em> (MAC 11783/2011, DAC 39997-39999 of
                        2011, unreported) — the accused failed to keep a proper lookout for
                        the deceased’s bicycle which was travelling in front of him. The right
                        view mirror and right rear portion of the accused’s motor van hit the
                        deceased. The accused did not stop and drove off at high speed, returning to
                        the scene only later when told to do so by a witness. His breath alcohol
                        level was 44 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The accused was sentenced to 6
                        months’ imprisonment and 10 years’ disqualification for the s
                        304A(b) PC Charge, 2 months’ imprisonment and 5 years’
                        disqualification for the s 67(1)(b) RTA charge and 2 months’
                        imprisonment and 2 years’ disqualification for the s 84(1) charge. The
                        last charge was to run concurrently with the rest.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Public Prosecutor v
                            Goh Teck Guan</em> (MAC 2209 and 2210 of 2013, unreported) —
                        the accused was turning right at a signalised traffic junction in his motor
                        lorry on a green light (without the green arrow). He failed to keep a proper
                        lookout for the deceased who was a pedestrian crossing from the
                        accused’s left to right and collided into him. The accused’s
                        alcohol level was 48 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of
                        breath.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>This
                        was the accused’s second conviction for drink driving. He was
                        sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment and 8 years’
                        disqualification for the s 304A(b) PC offence, and 4 months’
                        imprisonment, $3000 fine and 5 years’ disqualification for the RTA
                        offence. Both sentences were to run concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The Respondent cited the case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Chean Wei</em> [2010] SGDC 240
                        (“<em>Tan Chean Wei</em>”). There the
                    accused was charged under s 304A(b) PC and s 67(1)(a) RTA for driving under the
                    influence of a drug, Nimetazepam. He was driving along a 3-lane, 2-way road when
                    he lost control of his motor van and collided into the deceased’s bicycle.
                    The accused was fined $6,000 and a disqualification period of 3 years was
                    imposed for the s 304A(b) PC offence and a fine of $2,000 and 3 years’
                    disqualification was imposed for the s 67(1)(a) RTA offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Prosecution sought to distinguish
                        <em>Tan Chean Wei</em> from our present case. They
                    pointed out that the accused in that case was under the medication Erimin which
                    had been <em>legally</em> prescribed to the accused for his
                    insomnia and that it was not shown that the level of medication present in his
                    system exceeded the dosage to such a degree as to constitute abuse. Moreover,
                    the accused had taken the medication some <em>18 hours</em>
                    prior to the accident. I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions in respect
                    of <em>Tan Chean Wei</em>; the level of culpability on the
                    part of the Respondent clearly exceeded that of the accused in that case in the
                    light of his conscious decision to drink two whole bottles of beer and then
                    drive soon thereafter<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The recent unreported precedents also evince
                    the imposition of a custodial sentence of more than a few weeks even in cases
                    where the accused’s alcohol level was low. The DJ’s imposition of
                    fines for both the s 304A(b) PC and s 67(1)(b) RTA charges on the facts of this
                    case were therefore manifestly inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I also found that the period of
                    disqualification of 4 years imposed in respect of the s 304A(b) PC charge was
                    manifestly inadequate in the light of the above precedents. I declined however
                    to disturb the disqualification period imposed in respect of the s 67(1)(b) RTA
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For the above reasons, I allowed the
                    Prosecution’s appeal against the sentences for both charges and ordered
                    the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     For the charge MAC 7965-2012 under s
                        304A(b) PC: the fine imposed by the DJ to be substituted with a sentence of
                        4 months’ imprisonment and the disqualification period enhanced from 4
                        years to 6 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     For the charge MAC 7966-2012 under s 67(1)(b) RTA: the fine imposed
                        by the DJ to be substituted with a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment
                        and the disqualification period of 2 years to remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both sentences were to run concurrently. I also ordered that the fine already
                    paid by the Respondent to be refunded to him.</p>
