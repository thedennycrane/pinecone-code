Does s 14(2) of the SIA </span>apply to a leave order granted under s 29 of the IAA which is served on a foreign State, and if it does apply, how much time does the foreign State have? These were some of the interesting issues that I had to consider in HC/SUM 5125/2021 (“SUM 5125”). SUM 5125 was an application by the defendant State, for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a declaration that it had an additional two months to apply to set aside an <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> order granting the plaintiff leave to enforce a foreign arbitral award against the defendant; alternatively, it sought a corresponding extension of time to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 HC/SUM 5275/2021 (“SUM 5275”) was a cross-application by the plaintiff for security to be furnished by the defendant State as a condition for granting any extension of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Based on counsel’s research and submissions, it appears that this is the first time our courts have been squarely confronted with the issues I highlighted at [1]–[2] above.

However, as I will elaborate below, Ramesh J’s comments on s 14(2) were <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, as the <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> of <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl</span> concerned s 14(1) of the SIA and the question of whether a leave order must be served in accordance with that provision. As such, and whilst there has been no appeal against my decision, given the dearth of direct local authority on the issues that arose before me, I consider it appropriate to provide my full grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiff, CNX, is a company incorporated in Ruritania, while CNY, the defendant, is the sovereign state of Oceania.

</div> In the alternative, if s 14(2) of the SIA were applicable, the plaintiff advanced two alternative positions on how the time for setting aside the Leave Order should be computed. First, that the reference to “entry of appearance” in s 14(2) of the SIA or any “corresponding procedures” should not be interpreted as referring only to an application to set aside the Leave Order, but rather to any step in the proceedings which indicates that the defendant has had a chance to respond to them.

The plaintiff does not dispute this (see [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As held by Ramesh J in <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl </span>(at [41]–[44]), a leave order made under O 69A r 6 of the ROC is a document required to be served for the institution of proceedings to enforce an arbitral award against a foreign State. As such, the Leave Order had to be served on the defendant pursuant to s 14(1) of the SIA and in this case, appears to have been duly served (see [7] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The key issue in dispute was whether s 14(2) of the SIA likewise applies to the Leave Order or an application to set aside the Leave Order. As this is a point that has not been considered at any length by our courts, I found it helpful to first consider the position under the State Immunity Act 1978 (c 33) (UK) (“UK SIA”), since the SIA was modelled after the UK SIA (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (7 September 1979) vol 39 at col 409 (Mr E W Barker, Minister for Law and Science and Technology)). Even then, there are conflicting English High Court authorities on this issue, as I detail below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro ASA v State Property Fund of Ukraine</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2002] All ER (D) 269 (Oct) (“<span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>”), Justice Gross in the English High Court had to consider the applicability of s 12(2) of the UK SIA in the context of proceedings to enforce an arbitration award. Section 12(2) of the UK SIA is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 14(2) of our SIA. On the facts of the case, Norsk Hydro ASA (“Norsk”), having obtained an arbitral award against the Republic of Ukraine (one of the respondents), was granted permission to enforce the arbitral award against it (the “permission order”). The permission order, which was granted <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>, provided that the Republic of Ukraine could apply to set aside the order within 21 days of service. Following service of the permission order and the expiry of the 21-day period, Norsk obtained a third party debt order (the English equivalent of a garnishee order) against Deutsche Bank AG in London. The Republic of Ukraine applied to set aside both the permission order and third party debt order. The questions before the court were, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether s 12(2) of the UK SIA applied to the permission order and if so, how much time the Republic of Ukraine had to challenge the permission order. The latter question was particularly relevant to the issue of whether the third party debt proceedings had been commenced by Norsk prematurely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On the first question, Gross J found that s 12(2) of the UK SIA did apply to the permission order. The learned Judge observed (at [25]) that this conclusion could be supported by the plain wording of s 12(2) of the UK SIA, as well as the reference to “corresponding procedures” in s 22(2) of the UK SIA (which mirrors s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of our SIA):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) As it seems to me, s.12 means what it says. It deals with procedure. It is not to be confined to the court's ‘adjudicative jurisdiction’. The two month period is an acknowledgement of the reality that states do take time to react to legal proceedings. It is understandable that states should have such a period of time to respond to enforcement proceedings under ss. 100 and following of the 1996 Act; not untypically, an award will be made in one country but enforcement may be sought elsewhere, perhaps in a number of jurisdictions, where assets are or are thought to be located. I therefore decline to read words into s.12 so as to preclude its application to the enforcement of a: wards [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] under CPR 62.18.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Insofar as it remains in dispute, I am satisfied that the wording in s. 12(2) of the 1978 Act, ‘Any time for entering an appearance (whether prescribed by rules of court or otherwise)’ applies to the time period to be set by the court as available to a defendant to seek to set aside an order for enforcement under CPR 62.18(9). If need be, s.22(2) of the 1978 Act (‘.. references to entry of appearance … include references to any corresponding procedures’), though, I suspect, primarily designed for other purposes, is capable of supporting such a construction; for my part, however, I would be inclined to arrive at my conclusion on the wording of s.12(2) standing alone but read in context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On the second question, Gross J concluded that the Republic of Ukraine was entitled to a total of two months and 21 days to apply to set aside the permission order, and that the third party debt application had thus been brought by Norsk prematurely (at [25(6)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Justice Stanley Burnton had, however, expressed a conflicting view in <span class="font-italic">AIC Limited v The Federal Government of Nigeria </span>[2003] EWHC 1357 (QB)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">AIC</span>”), which was a case that concerned registration of a foreign judgment. In <span class="font-italic">AIC, </span>Burnton J observed<span class="font-italic"> </span>that an application to set aside the registration of a foreign judgment was not a “corresponding” procedure to an entry of appearance (at [23]). AIC Limited had obtained an order to register a foreign judgment against the Federal Government of Nigeria. It then obtained another order, extending the Federal Government of Nigeria’s time to apply to set aside the order for registration to two months from the date of service. The learned Judge noted that AIC Limited had made the application on the assumption that a notice of an order for the registration of a foreign judgment is the equivalent of a “writ or other document required to be served for instituting proceedings against a State” within the meaning of s 12(1) of the UK SIA, and that an application by a State to set aside the registration was the corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance within the meaning of ss 12(2) and 22(2) of the UK SIA (at [23]). Burnton J held that this assumption was erroneous and reasoned as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 … In my judgment, those assumptions are unfounded. <span class="font-italic">An application to set aside the registration of a judgment is not a </span><span class="font-italic">‘corresponding’ procedure to an entry of appearance. An entry of appearance is an act that precedes a judgment, whereas an application to set aside a registration is made after judgment has been entered into.</span> The registration of a foreign judgment is not the equivalent of a judgment in default of appearance: it precedes the service of any United Kingdom proceedings on the defendant. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26  While <span class="font-italic">AIC </span>concerned an application to register a foreign judgment, Burnton J’s reasoning would suggest that an application to challenge a leave order should likewise <span class="font-italic">not </span>be construed as the corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance, since such an application also <span class="font-italic">post-dates </span>the arbitral award, rather than precedes it. The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">AIC </span>therefore stands in contradiction to that in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro. </span>Although <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro </span>was decided before <span class="font-italic">AIC</span>, it<span class="font-italic"> </span>was not raised or considered in <span class="font-italic">AIC</span>. Based on the authorities cited to me, it appears to me that the position in England has not been definitively resolved since then. While the correctness of <span class="font-italic">AIC </span>was doubted by Justice Teare in <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve Inc v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela </span>[2016] 1 WLR 2829<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve</span>”) (at [64]), and once more by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics United Kingdom Ltd v State of Libya </span>[2021] 3 WLR 231 (“<span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (UKSC)</span>”) (at [68]), those doubts appear to have been in relation to a different point, namely Burnton J’s reasoning that s 12 of the UK SIA must be applicable in <span class="font-italic">its entirety</span> to the proceedings in question or not at all. Further, the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">General </span><span class="font-italic">Dynamics (UKSC) </span>declined to express any concluded view on whether an application to set aside a leave order is a corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance under s 12(2) of the UK SIA, as the point had not been fully argued before it (at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Turning now to local case law, the issue of whether s 14(2) of the SIA applies to an application to set aside a leave order, as well as the conflicting authorities of <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro </span>and <span class="font-italic">AIC, </span>were considered by Ramesh J (albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>) in <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl</span>. The main question in <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl </span>was whether an order granting leave to enforce an arbitral award against a foreign State has to be served in accordance with s 14(1) of the SIA (at [1]). In holding that s 14(1) of the SIA <span class="font-italic">did</span> apply to a leave order, Ramesh J observed that a consequence of this conclusion was that the reference to “corresponding procedures” in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA must accordingly be read to extend to the time for filing an application to set aside a leave order (at [68]–[69]). In particular, the learned Judge noted that the purpose of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA is that it “reconciles the provisions of s 14 [of the SIA] with the different terminology used to describe the institution of enforcement proceedings by service of a leave order” (at [69]). It was for this reason that the learned Judge rejected Burnton J’s interpretation of s 12(2) of the UK SIA in <span class="font-italic">AIC </span>as being “too literal and narrow”, and instead preferred the views expressed by Gross J in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro </span>(at [71]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 [<span class="font-italic">AIC</span>] conflicts with <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), which was not cited in <span class="font-italic">AIC Limited</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>, ‘entry of appearance’ was clearly equivocated with an application to set aside an order granting leave to enforce. Moreover, Stanley Burnton J’s approach appears too literal and narrow; s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (equivalent to s 22(2) of the UK Act) must exist precisely to cater to such differences as Stanley Burnton J identified. In my view, the correct approach is to first ask whether the proceedings in question are intended to fall within the scope of s 14. The stages of the proceedings in question cannot be expected to be identical to the steps of entry of appearance and judgment in default in s 14. A corresponding provision need not necessarily be the same in texture and terminology. That would defeat the purpose of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Act. I therefore prefer the approach in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I agree with Ramesh J that the reasoning of Gross J in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is to be preferred over that of Burnton J in <span class="font-italic">AIC</span>. Under Singapore law, it is trite that a statute must be interpreted purposively, having regard to the text of the provision as well as the context of the provision within the written law as a whole: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock</span>”) at [37]. In other words, the interpretation of the provision in question should be informed by other relevant provisions within the same statute (<span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [44]). To my mind, it was clear that s 14(2) of the SIA must be read together with the relevant definition in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA, which extends the definition of “entry of appearance” to include “any corresponding procedures”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my view, the plain meaning of the term “corresponding procedures”, when applied to s 14(2) of the SIA in the context of a leave order granted under O 69A r 6 of the ROC, <span class="font-italic">does</span> refer to an application to set aside the leave order. Based on a plain reading of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA, it is clear that the phrase “any corresponding procedures” is broad and meant to be an inclusive definition. Moreover, the very existence of s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA suggests that s 14(2) of the SIA is meant to apply to a range of procedures, some of which may not have stages that are the same in “texture and terminology” to the steps of entry of appearance and judgment in default set out in s 14 of the SIA (<span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl </span>at [71]). In my judgment, the correct approach to determining the applicability of s 14(2) of the SIA is therefore to ask if the proceedings in question have a stage that is similar <span class="font-italic">in substance</span> to an entry of appearance. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Court Practice </span>(Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2021) at para 12/1/1, the rationale of entering an appearance is “to enable the defendant to officially communicate his intention to defend or challenge the action”. I agreed with the defendant that by parity of logic, in proceedings where leave has been granted to enforce an arbitral award against a foreign State and the leave order has been served on the defendant State in accordance with s 14(1) of the SIA, the corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance would be <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">next step</span> that the defendant is required to take to communicate its intention to challenge the leave order.

</div>
</div> That next step would, in my view, be the defendant’s application to set aside the leave order. As provided for in O 69A r 6(4) read with O 69A r 6(5) of the ROC, that is the very step that is required to be expressly stated in any leave order made under O 69A r 6 of the ROC. I was therefore satisfied that an application to set aside the Leave Order did fall within the meaning of “corresponding procedures” in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SIA, such that s 14(2) of the SIA applied to the present proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Moreover, I was of the view that such a conclusion better accorded with the legislative purpose of s 14(2) of the SIA. The fact that s 14(2) of the SIA gives States a longer timeline to enter an appearance is an explicit recognition of “the reality” that States require more time to react to proceedings, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl</span> at [45]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45 This accorded with the underlying purpose of s 14 [of the SIA]. The two-month time period in s 12 [of the UK SIA] serves to acknowledge ‘the reality that states do take time to react to legal proceedings’. It is not disproportionately generous, since often ‘an award will be made in one country but enforcement may be sought elsewhere, perhaps in a number of jurisdictions, where assets are or are thought to be located’ (<span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span> ([12] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [25(4)]). I thus agreed with the reasoning at [19] of the AR’s GD ([1] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">States require time to respond to proceedings brought against them, and enforcement proceedings are no exception. Proceedings to enforce an award may be brought in any jurisdiction in which the respondent State has assets, independent from that jurisdiction’s connection to the underlying arbitration or the merits of the substantive dispute. The need for time and opportunity to respond applies with equal force.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I did not see any reason why the observations in <span class="font-italic">Josias </span><span class="font-italic">Van Zyl </span>should not apply in the context of proceedings to enforce an arbitral award against a State. In its submissions, the plaintiff argued that a State does not require as much time to react to <span class="font-italic">enforcement</span> proceedings as compared to <span class="font-italic">fresh</span> claims against it, since it would be aware of the disputes and arbitral proceedings giving rise to the arbitral award, particularly in instances where the State had actively and fully participated in the underlying arbitration.

</div> I did not agree with this submission. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Josias Van Zyl </span>(at [46]), while the enforcement of an arbitral award may not take a respondent State by surprise, different considerations come into play when a State is faced with the potential enforcement of the award in a particular jurisdiction, as compared to the considerations at play in the underlying arbitral proceedings. In my judgment, this remains true even if parallel enforcement proceedings have been brought in other jurisdictions – the grounds for resisting enforcement may apply differently across different jurisdictions, and different jurisdictions may well have differing court processes for resisting enforcement of an arbitral award. Accordingly, I disagreed that the defendant should be deprived of its entitlement to the additional time allowed under s 14(2) of the SIA, simply because it had participated in the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For the foregoing reasons, I disagreed with the plaintiff that s 14(2) of the SIA does not apply to a leave order which was granted under O 69A r 6 of the ROC and served in accordance with s 14(1) of the SIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In support of the plaintiff’s position, Ms Koh also drew my attention to the comments of Teare J in <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve</span>.

</div>
</div> In discussing Burnton J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">AIC</span>, the learned Judge stated as follows (at [63]–[64]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 The basis of the decision [in <span class="font-italic">AIC</span>] appears to be that section 12 [of the UK SIA], which deals in subsection (1) with the mode of service, in subsections (2) and (3) with entry of appearance and in subsections (4) and (5) with judgments in default of appearance, must be applicable in its entirety to the proceedings in question. The procedure of ordering registration of a judgment without notice to the defendant and providing for the defendant to apply to set aside the order was not the equivalent of the provisions for entry of an appearance and for judgments in default of appearance. The judge concluded that an application for registration of a judgment required the issue and service of a claim form.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>With diffidence and with great respect to Stanley Burnton J I do not consider that the provisions of section 12 must be read in that manner. In my judgment section 12 makes special provision with regard to the questions of service, entry of appearance and judgments in default of appearance. But if the particular proceedings do not involve any one of those steps then the special provision of section 12 relating to that step does not apply. This appears to me to be clearly so with regard to section 12(1). It only applies to writs or other documents “required to be served”. If the document instituting the proceedings is not required to be served then the subsection has no application. If an entry of appearance (now acknowledgment of service) is required then subsections (2) and (3) apply. If an entry of appearance (now acknowledgment of service) is not required than the subsections do not apply. If judgment in default of appearance (now acknowledgment of service) is sought then subsections (4) and (5) apply. If it is not sought then they do not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The plaintiff rightly observed that <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve </span>is authority for the proposition that s 12(2) of the UK SIA does not apply by the mere fact that a writ or document is served in accordance with s 12(1) of the UK SIA; if proceedings commenced against a State do not involve an entry of appearance or a corresponding procedure, then s 12(2) of the UK SIA would not have any application.

</div> As an aside, <span class="font-italic">AIC</span> was also doubted on this point in <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (UKSC)</span>; see above at [26]. However, in my view, <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve </span>was ultimately of limited assistance to the plaintiff. As is clear from the above passage, <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve </span>does not deal with the question before me, which was <span class="font-italic">what</span>, if anything, in the context of a leave order,<span class="font-italic"> </span>constitutes a corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance. Moreover, for the reasons detailed above at [28]------–[31], I considered that the present proceedings <span class="font-italic">did </span>envision a stage in the proceedings that would be the equivalent to an entry of appearance (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the defendant’s application to set aside the Leave Order) and that accordingly, s 14(2) of the SIA would apply to the Leave Order.  Thus, <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve</span> did little to buttress the plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Ms Koh also referred me to s 14(6) of the SIA, which provides that where a writ or other document has been served in a manner previously agreed to by a foreign State, the foreign State cannot avail itself of the two-month timeline prescribed under s 14(2) of the SIA. Ms Koh submitted that s 14(6) of the SIA shows that the procedural privileges afforded to States under s 14 are “not immutable”, and can be retracted when it is clear that the State is aware of the proceedings commenced against it and is able to respond.

While the plaintiff may be correct to observe that s 14(6) of the SIA carves out certain circumstances under which States are not afforded the privilege of the additional time under s 14(2), the fact remains that the plain wording of s 14(2) of the SIA mandates that States be accorded a two-month timeline in all other cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Moreover, even if the plaintiff is correct that the privilege of additional time under s 14(2) of the SIA is “not immutable”, I did not see any basis on which the additional time set out in s 14(2) SIA could be whittled down in the present case.

However, as I noted above (at [26]), <span class="font-italic">AIC </span>was not followed by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (UKSC) </span>and the decision in <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (CA)</span> was in fact reversed by the UK Supreme Court. I therefore did not consider <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (CA)</span> to be persuasive. Further, <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics (CA)</span> itself should be understood in its proper context. The issue that arose in that case was whether the requirements of s 12(1) of the UK SIA (<span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 14(1) of the SIA) were applicable to a leave order and if so, whether they were mandatory or capable of being waived or dispensed with. The decision did not therefore concern s 12(2) of the UK SIA and as I mentioned at [26] above, the UK Supreme Court declined to express any concluded view on the applicability of s 12(2) of the UK SIA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Likewise, the observations in <span class="font-italic">Firebird</span> also need to be read and understood in context. The question in <span class="font-italic">Firebird </span>was whether a summons application to register a foreign judgment had to be served on the judgment debtor State, through one of the modes of service prescribed under the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 (Cth). Justices Nettle and Gordon answered this question in the negative (at [215]). Nonetheless, they noted that under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), a court <span class="font-italic">could </span>still require the service of the summons through one of the prescribed modes of service, in situations where it would be expedient to do so. Where the judgment debtor is a foreign State, the court would also usually afford a longer time period to the foreign State to apply to set aside the registration order. It was in this context that the learned Judges made the observations that the plaintiff relied on, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the rules on service are “facultative … rather than imposing an inevitable and ineluctable service requirement regardless of the facts and circumstances of the case” (at [216]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 From the foregoing, it is clear that the true purport of Nettle and Gordon JJ’s comments is that the court has a discretion to fix a <span class="font-italic">longer</span> time period for setting aside a registration order where it is expedient to do so, and not that the court is entitled to <span class="font-italic">shorten</span> the time period for setting aside a registration order <span class="font-italic">despite</span> what may be prescribed by statute. Moreover, the comments of the learned Judges were made <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, since the question before the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Firebird</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did not touch on the time that a State had to set aside a registration order or leave order.<span class="font-italic"> </span> I therefore found the plaintiff’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Firebird</span> to be of little assistance to its case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 On a proper reading of s 14(2) of the SIA, the plaintiff’s proposition that the court retains a residual discretion under O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC to fix <span class="font-italic">any </span>time limit it sees fit for an application to set aside a leave order was simply unsustainable. Section 14(2) of the SIA provides that “[a]ny time for entering an appearance (<span class="font-italic">whether prescribed by Rules of Court or otherwise</span>) shall begin to run 2 months after the date on which the writ or document is so received” [emphasis added]. It is clear from the italicised wording that the court’s power to fix a timeline under the ROC does not supersede or supplant the timeline prescribed under s 14(2) of the SIA – to hold otherwise would result in the tail wagging the dog. Rather, s 14(2) of the SIA and the ROC are meant to work in tandem, such that any time period fixed by the court under O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC begins to run two months <span class="font-italic">after</span> the date of service. Where a foreign State has been served with a leave order to enforce an arbitral award, the effect of s 14(2) of the SIA is therefore this: the foreign State has two months under s 14(2) SIA to set aside the leave order, <span class="font-italic">plus </span>any <span class="font-italic">further</span> time afforded to it by the court in exercise of its discretionary powers under O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC. I elaborate on this below at [50]–[52], when I consider Issue 2. Suffice to say for now that I did not agree with the plaintiff that the court has power under O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC to <span class="font-italic">shorten</span> the time a State has for applying to set aside a leave order, irrespective of what is stipulated in s 14(2) of the SIA. In my judgment, the reference to “such other period as the Court may fix” in O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC simply refers to the court’s power to <span class="font-italic">extend</span> the period for setting aside a leave order beyond <span class="font-italic">the minimum</span> allowed under s 14(2) of the SIA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the reasons set out above, I found that an application by the defendant to set aside the Leave Order constituted the corresponding procedure to an entry of appearance under s 14(2) of the SIA, and that the time the defendant had to set aside the Leave Order was therefore governed by s 14(2) of the SIA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Computation of time under s 14(2) of the SIA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Having answered Issue 1 in the affirmative, I now turn to the issue of how time to set aside the Leave Order should be computed. Mr Bull submitted that the two-month period under s 14(2) of the SIA should be added to the 21 days provided for in the Leave Order, such that the defendant would be entitled to two months and 21 days commencing from 20 October 2021, being the date on which the Leave Order was served.

</div> Time for applying to set aside the Leave Order would therefore expire on 11 January 2022. As I summarised at [15] above, Ms Koh advanced two alternative submissions on how the time should be computed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the reference to an “entry of appearance” in s 14(2) of the SIA should be construed as referring not only to an application to set aside the Leave Order, but also to <span class="font-italic">any</span> step in the proceedings taken by the foreign State that indicates the State has had a chance to respond to the proceedings.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 With regard to the submissions at [45(a)] above, I disagreed that the appointment of D&amp;N and the filing of SUM 5125, taken singly or together, constituted an “entry of appearance” or a corresponding procedure for the purposes of s 14(2) of the SIA. The plaintiff’s interpretation of s 14(2) of the SIA is not supported by the ordinary meaning of the words in the provision. As noted above at [29], an entry of appearance enables the defendant to officially communicate his intention to defend or challenge the action. It is a specific action as compared to some other step in the proceedings. The plaintiff’s interpretation was not, in my view, a possible interpretation having regard to the ordinary meaning of s 14(2) of the SIA. Thus, the plaintiff’s interpretation did not pass the first step of a purposive interpretation of s 14(2) of the SIA, which is to ascertain possible interpretations of the legislative provision: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Moreover, if I accepted the plaintiff’s contention, the defendant would paradoxically be disadvantaged for trying to avail itself of the two-month timeline it would otherwise be entitled to under s 14(2) of the SIA. On the plaintiff’s reasoning, the defendant would have been entitled to two months under s 14(2) of the SIA to react to the enforcement proceedings, once the Leave Order was served on it. Yet, by the very act of filing SUM 5125 to seek a declaration that it was indeed entitled to the time provided for in s 14(2) of the SIA, the defendant had supposedly waived its entitlement to the additional two months and would be left with only 21 days to apply to set aside the Leave Order. This somewhat circular and tautological conclusion cannot plausibly be the manner in which s 14(2) of the SIA was <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to operate. It would also fly in the face of the well-established canons of statutory interpretation that Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock </span>at [38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any case, even if, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, I accepted that the phrase “entry of appearance” in s 14(2) of the SIA encompassed <span class="font-italic">any</span> further step in the proceedings, I was not persuaded that anything done by the defendant thus far amounted to a further step in the proceedings. As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Carona Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Go Go Delicacy Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 460, a “step in the proceedings” is one that evinces a party’s “unequivocal submission” to the jurisdiction of the courts (at [95]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the facts before me, I did not think that the actions of the defendant satisfied this requirement. The appointment of D&amp;N as counsel or the filing of SUM 5125 (which essentially asked for an extension of the deadline by which the defendant could apply to set aside the Leave Order) did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> evidence the defendant’s unequivocal intention to challenge the Leave Order. A defendant may very well apply for more time to apply to set aside a leave order, <span class="font-italic">while </span>it considers more carefully whether it indeed wishes to apply to set aside the order. In any event, I note that the defendant expressly reserved its right to dispute the regularity of <span class="font-italic">service </span>of the Leave Order (and consequently, the court’s jurisdiction) in the supporting affidavit filed with SUM 5125.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  1st affidavit of AS at para 16.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Put simply, it did not appear to me that any step taken by the defendant thus far amounted to an unequivocal submission to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts or an unequivocal intention to challenge the Leave Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 With regard to the plaintiff’s second argument set out above at [45(b)], I was ultimately not persuaded that a plain reading of s 14(2) of the SIA supported the plaintiff’s contention that the defendant should be entitled only to a <span class="font-italic">maximum </span>of two months to apply to set aside the Leave Order. In my judgment, a plain reading of s 14(2) of the SIA supported the defendant’s contention that it was entitled to two months <span class="font-italic">and </span>21 days from the date of service of the Leave Order. As I suggested above at [43], on a proper reading of s 14(2) of the SIA, the two-month timeline under s 14(2) of the SIA is meant to be <span class="font-italic">added</span> to any time a State otherwise has for entering an appearance (or undertaking a corresponding procedure). This is the natural meaning of the words “<span class="font-italic">[</span><span class="font-italic">a]ny time</span> for entering an appearance (whether prescribed by Rules of Court or otherwise) <span class="font-italic">shall </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">begin</span> <span class="font-italic">to run</span> <span class="font-italic">2 months </span><span class="font-italic">after</span> the date on which the writ or document is so received” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]. Put another way, the effect of the wording of s 14(2) of the SIA is to <span class="font-italic">delay</span> by two months the point at which the time period for entering an appearance (or complying with a corresponding procedure, as the case may be) would otherwise begin to run.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Accordingly, I considered that the correct approach to computing the time that a State has under s 14(2) of the SIA to enter an appearance is as follows: (a) determine the “normal” or default time period that the State would have for entering an appearance, if not for the existence of s 14(2) of the SIA, and (b) <span class="font-italic">add</span> two months to this time period. As to how the normal time period for entering an appearance should be ascertained, s 14(2) of the SIA provides that the time period for entering an appearance may be “prescribed by Rules of Court or otherwise”. In my view, this simply makes clear that the normal time limit for entering an appearance may be contained in the ROC or elsewhere. So, for instance, in a writ action where a foreign State is the defendant, the foreign State would have the usual prescribed time period of 21 days (or such extended period as the Court may allow) under O 12 r 4(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, <span class="font-italic">plus </span>an additional two months by operation of s 14(2) of the SIA, to enter an appearance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Where there is no time limit stipulated in the ROC, the question then is whether a time limit is prescribed “otherwise”. The words “or otherwise” in s 14(2) of the SIA would, in my view, include a time limit contained within <span class="font-italic">an order of court</span>. Thus, where an order required to be served under s 14(1) of the SIA, such as the Leave Order, provides for a time limit for a defendant State to undertake a procedure corresponding to entering an appearance, the time limit stated in the order begins to run two months after the date of service of the order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Applying my observations above (at [50]–[52]) to the present case, I agreed with Mr Bull’s submissions that the defendant was entitled to a total of two months and 21 days to apply to set aside the Leave Order. The time for applying to set aside a leave order is prescribed in O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC as “[w]ithin 14 days after service of the order or, if the order is to be served out of the jurisdiction, within such other period as the Court may fix”. On the facts before me, it is plain that the assistant registrar exercised his discretion under O 69A r 6(4) of the ROC to grant a longer time of 21 days to set aside the Leave Order, instead of the default time limit of 14 days. Accordingly, by virtue of s 14(2) of the SIA, the 21-day limit in the Leave Order would only begin to run two months after the date on which the Leave Order was served on the defendant, such that the defendant had a total of two months and 21 days (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>up until 11 January 2022) to apply to set aside the Leave Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In this regard, the conclusion I have reached above is also consistent with how the relevant time to set aside a leave order was computed in several cases that were cited by the parties. First, in <span class="font-italic">Norsk Hydro</span>, Gross J held that the Republic of Ukraine was entitled to two months under s 12(2) of the UK SIA <span class="font-italic">plus </span>the 21 days stipulated in the permission order, to apply to set aside the order (at [25(6)]), and that therefore, on the facts, the third party debt application had been commenced by Norsk prematurely. Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Dallah Real Estate and Tourism Holding Co v Ministry of Religious Affairs, Government of Pakistan </span>[2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 505, the claimants’ solicitors initially drafted a leave order stating that the Government of Pakistan had 31 days to apply to set aside the leave order. After the English High Court observed that the claimants had failed to take into account the timeline provided for in s 12(2) of the UK SIA (at [54]), the claimant resubmitted and obtained a new leave order granting the Government of Pakistan two months <span class="font-italic">and</span> 23 days to apply to set aside the leave order. In addition, in <span class="font-italic">Gold Reserve</span>, the leave order provided that the Republic of Venezuela could apply to set it aside within two months and 22 days after service of the order (at [55]). On the other hand, I also noted that in <span class="font-italic">General Dynamics </span><span class="font-italic">(UKSC)</span>, the leave order provided that the State of Libya had two months from the date of the order to apply to set it aside (at [3]). Nonetheless, I was cognizant of the fact that none of these cases considered the appropriate methodology for computing the time limit for setting aside a leave order. I therefore based my decision primarily on the plain wording of s 14(2) of the SIA (as detailed at [50]–[52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For the foregoing reasons, I agreed with the defendant that it had a total of two months and 21 days to apply to set aside the Leave Order. In my judgment, the period of 21 days stated in the Leave Order was therefore incorrect. It should instead have stipulated that the defendant was entitled, pursuant to s 14(2) of the SIA, to <span class="font-italic">two months and 21 days </span>to apply to set aside the Leave Order. Alternatively, the defendant ought to have been separately notified that it had an additional two months under s 14(2) of the SIA to apply to set aside the Leave Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the defendant should be granted an extension of time under O 3 r 4(1) of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 If I was wrong in my interpretation of s 14(2) of the SIA, there remained the question of whether an extension of time should be afforded to the defendant pursuant to the court’s powers under O 3 r 4(1) of the ROC. The existence of this power was not disputed by the parties. For convenience, O 3 r 4(1) ROC provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Extension, etc., of time (O. 3, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.—(1)  The Court may, on such terms as it thinks just, by order extend or abridge the period within which a person is required or authorised by these Rules or by any judgment, order or direction, to do any act in any proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It was common ground that the factors that a court should consider when deciding whether to exercise its powers under O 3 r 4(1) of the ROC were summarised by Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean in <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts and Hotels Inc and another v Global Gaming Philippines LLC and another </span>[2021] 3 SLR 725 (“<span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts</span>”) at [49]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 The words ‘such terms as it thinks just’ gives the court discretion to grant time extension in order to achieve justice in the circumstances of the case. Generally, the factors the court takes into consideration in deciding whether to grant an extension of time are: (a) the length of delay; (b) the reasons for delay; (c) the chances of the defaulting party succeeding on appeal if the time for appealing were extended; and (d) the degree of prejudice to the would-be respondent if the extension of time were granted: see <span class="font-italic">Sun Jin Engineering Pte Ltd v Hwang Jae Woo</span> [2011] 2 SLR 196 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">AD v AE</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 505 at [10]) with the courts generally focusing on the first two: <span class="font-italic">Falmac Ltd v Cheng Ji Lai Charlie and another matter</span> [2014] 4 SLR 202 at [14] …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Applying the factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Bloomberry Resorts </span>to the present case, I considered it just to grant the defendant an extension of time up to and including 11 January 2022 to challenge the Leave Order. Allowing the defendant an extension of time of approximately six weeks from the date of the hearing before me would not cause inordinate delay. More importantly, in my judgment, there were valid reasons for this delay. As discussed above at [30]–[31], foreign States reasonably require more time to react to proceedings to enforce an arbitral award, even where the State participated in the underlying arbitration. In any event, on the evidence before me, it was clear that the defendant <span class="font-italic">did </span>require more time to react to the enforcement proceedings commenced against it. While the Leave Order was first served on the defendant on 20 October 2021, the Leave Order was mistakenly forwarded to the wrong government department of the defendant, and only forwarded to the correct authority on 29 October 2021.

</div> – however, this was not sought by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For these reasons and if necessary as an alternative ground for my decision, I found it just, in the exercise of my discretionary powers under O 3 r 4(1) of the ROC, to grant the defendant an extension of time until 11 January 2022 to apply to set aside the Leave Order.

</div> Section 31(5) of the IAA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Where, in any proceedings in which the enforcement of a foreign award is sought by virtue of this Part, the court is satisfied that<span class="font-italic"> an application for the setting aside or for the suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority of the country in which</span>, <span class="font-italic">or under the law of which, the award was made</span>, the court may —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) if the court considers it proper to do so, adjourn the proceedings or, as the case may be, so much of the proceedings as relates to the award; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) on the application of the party seeking to enforce the award, order the other party to give suitable security.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 From the wording of s 31(5) of the IAA, a threshold requirement<span class="font-italic"> </span>is that “an application for the setting aside or for the suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, the award was made”. In the present proceedings, it was undisputed that no such application had been taken out or was pending before the seat court in Danubia (see above at [5]). I therefore could not see how s 31(5) of the IAA was even applicable in the present case. All the authorities cited by the plaintiff in its written submissions, including <span class="font-italic">Continental Transfert Technique Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">The Federal Government of Nigeria </span>[2010] EWHC 780 (Comm), involved in substance some form of proceedings taken or pending before the seat court to challenge the award. No authority was cited to me where a court, faced with similar circumstances as those before me, invoked the equivalent of s 31(5) of the IAA as the juridical basis for ordering the award debtor to furnish security as a condition of granting it time to apply to challenge a leave order. Unsurprisingly, at the hearing before me, Ms Koh conceded that s 31(5) of the IAA had no application in the present case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Instead, Ms Koh put forward a number of alternative bases for the plaintiff’s application. The first of which was s 18(2) of the SCJA read with paragraph 15 of the First Schedule to the SCJA, which concerns the court’s power to order interim payments:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Interim payment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15. Power to order a party in a pending proceeding to make interim payments to another party or to a stakeholder or into court on account of any damages, debt or other sum, excluding costs, which he may subsequently in the proceeding be adjudged to be liable to pay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I disagreed that this provision had any relevance or application to the present proceedings. Section 18(3) of the SCJA provides that the court’s powers in the First Schedule to the SCJA must be exercised in accordance with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the ROC. First, the plaintiff’s application was, essentially, for the defendant to furnish <span class="font-italic">security</span> and not for <span class="font-italic">payment</span>; an interim payment application was therefore, and by definition, a very different creature. Second, the plaintiff did not in any event bring an application for interim payment under O 29 r 10 of the ROC, which is the relevant provision governing applications for interim payment. Even assuming that an application for an interim payment was the appropriate application to make in the circumstances before me, such an application requires the applicant to show that the grounds in either O 29 r 11 or O 29 r 12 of the ROC are made out. The plaintiff did not adduce any evidence in the present proceedings that would have assisted it to advance any arguments that an interim payment was warranted, whether unconditionally or otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The second alternative basis advanced by Ms Koh was pursuant to the court’s inherent powers. I agreed with Mr Bull that the present case did not warrant an exercise of my inherent powers under O 92 r 4 of the ROC. It is well-established that the court will generally <span class="font-italic">not </span>invoke its inherent powers where there is an existing rule already covering the situation at hand, save in the most exceptional circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 117 at [81]. Further, the “essential touchstone” for the court’s exercise of its discretionary inherent powers is really one of “need”: <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]. In this case, I disagreed that the present facts were sufficiently exceptional to warrant recourse to the court’s inherent powers; nor was there any need to do so. I therefore dismissed SUM 5275. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons set out in these grounds of decision, I allowed the defendant’s application in SUM 5125 on the terms set out above at [61] and dismissed SUM 5275. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I awarded costs of both applications to the defendant. Taking into consideration the novelty surrounding the issues pertaining to s 14(2) of the SIA, I fixed costs in the round at S$22,000 together with disbursements at S$3,400 to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Swee Yen, Quek Yi Zhi Joel, Dana Chang Kai Qi, Andrea Seet Sze Yuen and Axl Rizqy (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cavinder Bull SC, Lin Shumin and Lee Zhe Xu (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
