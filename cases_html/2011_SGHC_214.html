<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The first accused is Ellarry Bin Puling
                    (“Ellarry”), a 27-year–old male Malaysian who was employed
                    as a cleaner by Twin Creations Pte Ltd at the time of his arrest. The second
                    accused is Fabian Adiu Edwin (“Fabian”), a 22-year-old male
                    Malaysian employed by R Glazen Singapore Pte Ltd as a construction worker at the
                    time of his arrest. Both Ellarry and Fabian were working in Singapore on work
                    permits. They were friends who had known each other back in Sabah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Both accused persons were committed to stand
                    trial in the High Court on the following joint charge:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[O]n the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of August 2008, sometime
                        between 3.00am and 3.50am at bus-stop B13 along Sims Avenue, Singapore, in
                        furtherance of the common intention of both of you, committed murder by
                        causing the death of one LOH EE HUI, male 35 years old, and you have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The trial lasted ten days and took place over
                    three tranches. It concluded on 18 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The deceased, Loh Ee Hui, was a 35-year-old male
                    Singaporean.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 23 August 2008, the police received a call at
                    3.53am reporting that the deceased was lying in a pool of blood at the bus-stop
                    B13 along Sims Avenue. A Singapore Civil Defence Force ambulance arrived about
                    10 minutes later and immediately conveyed the deceased to Changi General
                    Hospital. The deceased had severe head injuries and was in coma. The deceased
                    eventually succumbed to his injuries at 8.32pm on 23 August
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Following investigations, Fabian was arrested in
                    an ambush at Boon Lay Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) station on
                    7 September 2008 and the deceased’s EZ-Link card (a contactless
                    stored value ticket used on several forms of public transport) was subsequently
                    recovered from the rear pocket of Fabian’s pair of jeans (which was
                    hanging in Fabian’s living quarters). Ellarry was arrested at his
                    workplace on 8 September 2008 and the deceased’s Nokia N5610
                    XpressMusic hand phone was recovered from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Forensic evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The autopsy was performed by Dr Teo Eng
                    Swee (“Dr Teo”). Dr Teo certified in his autopsy report
                    that the cause of death was intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral contusions
                    with a fractured skull.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The deceased suffered complex fractures to his
                    skull. The following four fractures were detailed in the autopsy report:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There were two
                            fracture lines of the calvarium, extending from the left mastoid
                            process</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">One fracture line extended medially for 5 cm
                                towards the posterior midline of the inferior edge of the
                                skull</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">One fracture line extended superiorly for 7 cm
                                towards the left parietal eminence.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There was a fracture extending from the midline of
                            the occipital bone, 3 cm above the internal occipital protuberance, to
                            the left transverse sinus groove 3.5 cm from the midline, to the left
                            jugular foramen. From a point on this fracture at the left posterior
                            cranial fossa (3 cm from one end of the end of this fracture line above
                            the internal occipital protuberance), there was another fracture line
                            extending laterally for 3 cm across the left posterior cranial
                            fossa.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There was a hairline crack fracture of the body of
                            the sphenoid.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The autopsy report also revealed that the
                    deceased had suffered severe brain injuries:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The brain was soft and severely oedematous.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was a midline shift to the left.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was a right uncal sub-tentorial herniation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were bilateral cerebellar tonsillar herniations at the foramen
                        magnum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were contusions of the left cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly, both
                        temporal lobes, the right temporal lobe laterally, the right frontal lobe
                        inferiorly, and the right frontal pole.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cut sections of these contused areas showed haemorrhage in the underlying
                        grey matter and superficial white matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cut sections of the rest of the cerebrum and cerebellum showed no gross
                        haemorrhage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The cerebrospinal fluid was bloodstained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Dr Teo gave oral evidence that the force
                    that caused the above injuries would have been very great.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> According to Dr Teo, a simple fall
                    alone could not have caused the skull fractures and brain injuries that were
                    found on the deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In fact, the brain injuries suffered by the
                    deceased were <em>contracoup</em> injuries where a
                    “force from one side has caused a subdural haemorrhage on the opposite
                        side”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     For completeness, it should be noted that the
                    deceased had other injuries present on him, which did not cause his death: a
                    frontal laceration on his scalp, a contusion on his lungs, bruises on his upper
                    back and underlying bleeding in his lower back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to Dr Teo, the injuries on the
                    back were consistent with the deceased being hit with a blunt object. When
                    Dr Teo was shown the broken piece of wood and the brick found at the crime
                    scene, he opined that it was unlikely that the brick was used to cause the
                    injuries on the deceased’s head.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> However, with regard
                    to the frontal laceration on the scalp, both the piece of wood and the brick
                    were possible weapons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dr Kim Guowei
                    (“Dr Kim”), who attended to the deceased at Changi General
                    Hospital, was of the opinion that the deceased’s brain injury appeared to
                    be very severe from the initial scan carried out. As such, he felt that it was
                    very unlikely that the deceased would have recovered from the
                        injury.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Lastly, Ms Ang Hwee Chen, the senior
                    forensic scientist attached to the Forensic Biology Laboratory of the Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”) confirmed that the deceased’s
                    blood was found on the two broken pieces of wood and the brick<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> which
                    were recovered from the crime scene. As the two broken pieces of wood fitted
                    nicely together, I am satisfied that they originally constituted a single piece
                    of wood. I further noted that the single piece of wood (if unbroken) was fairly
                    heavy, and had a substantial solid cross-section. If indeed it were the case
                    that the original piece of wood had broken into two pieces as a result of its
                    use as a weapon, then the assailant must have used considerable force to hit the
                    deceased with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statements of both accused persons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Both accused persons did not raise any issues
                    regarding the recording of the statements (for instance, that the statements
                    were recorded without the aid of interpreters, were poorly recorded or were
                    obtained under threat, inducement or promise, <em>etc</em>). In other words, the admissibility and accuracy of recording of
                    the statements were not challenged at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ellarry’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Seven statements from Ellarry were admitted in
                    evidence as part of the Prosecution’s case:</p>

                            to hospital where he was subsequently pronounced dead. Preliminary
                            investigations revealed that the said male person had suffered serious
                            head injuries. Can you relate what you know about the facts of this
                            incident in detail?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    I was there on
                                that day. I was there with a friend. His name is Fabian. Our
                                intention was to rob the man and not to cause his death. I was not
                                involved when the incident happened but I saw what happened. I saw
                                Fabian hit the man with a wood at the neck region. Fabian hit the
                                man with the wood about 2 to 3 times. Then the wood broke into two
                                pieces. After that, the man was screaming in pain. The man fell to
                                the floor when Fabian continued to kick and punch the man. I cannot
                                remember which part of the body that Fabian had kicked and punch.
                                Maybe Fabian had kicked the man’s body and punched the
                                man’s face. I think the man was unconscious then as he had
                                stop screaming and moving.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.1    The man was lying faced up and I saw Fabian
                                checking the pockets of the man’s shirt and pants pocket. I
                                then saw Fabian holding the man’s wallet, but i do not know
                                which pocket Fabian had retrieved the wallet from. I also saw Fabian
                                holding the man’s hand-phone. I kept my distance from the two
                                of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.2    After seeing Fabian take those things from the
                                man, I cycled away towards a mosque. Fabian was also cycling and he
                                followed me from behind. We both then stopped somewhere near the
                                mosque and sat on the cement floor. It was dim. I then asked Fabian
                                to show me the hand-phone which was dark in colour. I then asked
                                Fabian to show me the hand-phone that he had taken from the man. I
                                think Fabian took out the man’s hand-phone from his trouser
                                pockets and showed it to me. It was a Nokia Express Music which was
                                black and blue in colour. It was a ‘slide’
                            phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.3    I was scared at that time as I was afraid that
                                Police will come. Fabian was checking the contents of wallet. I
                                recalled that there was a S$6.00/- in the wallet in the
                                denominations of two S$2.00/- note and two S$1.00/- note. I also saw
                                one STARHUB and one SINGTEL ‘SIM’ card. There was also a
                                blue Bank card but I do not know from which bank. I also saw a pink
                                Singapore NRIC card. There was also a small photograph of a male
                                Chinese. I took the photograph and looked at it and it resembled the
                                person who Fabian had just hit. All these items were taken out from
                                the wallet by Fabian and he was the one who showed it to
                            me.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.4    Fabian gave me the S$6.00/- from the wallet
                                and for the rest of the items, Fabian put the items back into the
                                wallet and threw it away on the side where we sat.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.5    I wanted to take the STARHUB SIM card, but
                                Fabian wanted it. Instead, Fabian gave me the SINGTEL SIM Card. I
                                took the SINGTEL SIM card and kept it in my back jeans
                                pocket.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.6    Thereafter, we both cycled away and arrived at
                                a coffee-shop that was near a condominium. Although the coffee-shop
                                was closed, we still sat outside the coffee-shop. At the coffee-shop
                                we rested a while and I smoked the cigarette. I then asked Fabian to
                                show me the handphone taken from the man again. Fabian took out the
                                hand-phone from the pocket of his shorts and showed it to me. I told
                                Fabian that I liked the phone and I wanted to keep it. Fabian told
                                me that he would give it to me later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">3.8    We sat the coffee-shop for about 15 to 20
                                minutes. There was no one at the coffee-shop. We both then cycled to
                                the vicinity of Aljunied MRT and looked for another victim to
                                rob.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>Question 4: Could you relate in detail, like what
                                you have just said in your statement, what Fabian and you did before
                                you robbed the deceased?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    I finished work
                                at Secret Recipe at Jurong East IMM at about 11.00pm on Friday, 22
                                August 2008. From Jurong East MRT, I took the train to Paya Lebar
                                MRT Station. During this train journey, i SMS’ed to Fabian. I
                                cannot recall Fabian’s hand-phone number now. In the SMS which
                                was in Malay I recalled I asked something like ‘<b>Macam mana mala mini. Jadi Jalan tak’</b>
                                (meaning: “Tonight how. Going or not”). Fabian replied
                                    ‘<b>OK boleh</b>’ (meaning:
                                “OK can”). I SMS’ed Fabian that I was in the
                                train on the way home and Fabian replied that he would meet me at my
                                house.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">4.1    I wish to say that when I SMS Fabian in such a
                                way, it would be understood by Fabian that I was asking him whether
                                he wants to commit robbery that night. This was not the first time
                                that we have done this. This is our way of communicating when we
                                want to rob.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">4.4    At the Paya Lebar MRT station, we sat and
                                chit-chatted while looking out for people to rob. We targeted people
                                who would be walking alone. Their race or nationality was not an
                                issue. So long as they were walking alone while using their
                                handphone. Another thing we look out for is that the victim cannot
                                be too big sized or else we might be overpowered by the
                                victim.</p>

<b>Question 7: From where we stopped earlier in your
                                statement at para 4.11, what happened after Fabian cycled towards
                                the male Chinese at the bus-stop?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    When Fabian
                                cycled towards the bus-stop where the male Chinese was sitting, I
                                also followed from behind on my bicycle. I was about 2 to 3 metres
                                behind Fabian.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.1    As we approached nearer to the male Chinese, I
                                told Fabian not to continue with the robbery as there were many cars
                                passing by. Fabian stopped cycling and I also stopped behind Fabian.
                                He did not respond to my suggestion. At this point, we were about 5
                                metres or so from the bus-stop where I saw another male person
                                walked to the bus-stop. We just waited and a few minutes later, the
                                same male person who walked to the bus-stop flagged and boarded a
                                taxi. The male Chinese was still sitting at the bus-stop and using
                                his hand-phone. I presumed that he was using his phone as his right
                                hand was against his right ear. I did not notice whether this male
                                Chinese was carrying any bag with him or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.2    Following that, Fabian left his bicycle where
                                we were and he walked towards the bus-stop. I did not follow and
                                remained on the bicycle. I saw Fabian walking behind the male
                                Chinese and at that juncture, I saw Fabian taking out a piece of
                                wood from his sling bag. Fabian then walked around the right of the
                                male Chinese to face the male Chinese. I did not notice whether the
                                male Chinese saw Fabian walking to his front or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.3    I want to mention that when Fabian came to
                                meet me at my house earlier, he had already brought along a sling
                                bag. He always carried that bag with him, particularly for his work.
                                The bag is either dark grey or green in colour. At the time that
                                Fabian took out the piece of wood from the sling bag, I recalled
                                that the strap of the sling bag was on his right shoulder. The strap
                                went across his chest to his left waist. The bag was behind him. The
                                wood was already in his bag when he came to my house and it was
                                wrapped in newspaper. Due to the length of the wood, it protruded
                                out from the bag. Fabian used another black t-shirt to cover up the
                                protruding shirt. This piece of wood is about half a metre in length
                                and tapered. It is about ½ inch thick and 2 to 3 inch broad.
                                This piece of wood was picked up at the vicinity of Paya Lebar MRT
                                station the night before the incident. I was together with Fabian at
                                that time as we also wanted to rob and were looking out for victims.
                                However, we did not find any and that is why I decided to commit
                                robbery the next day.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.4    I then saw Fabian who was standing more to the
                                right side of the male Chinese, raise his right hand while holding
                                onto the wood and swung it towards the male Chinese once. The wood
                                hit the left side of the neck of the male Chinese. I cannot recall
                                whether Fabian used both hands to hold onto the wood or just his
                                right hand. After the wood hit the neck of the male Chinese, I saw
                                the male Chinese slump to his right side but still on the sear the
                                bus-stop. I heard the male Chinese shouting “<b>ahhhh</b>....”. That was when Fabian
                                continued to hit the male Chinese about 3 more times. This was when
                                the wood broke into two. From where I was, it looked to me that
                                Fabian was hitting the same spot on the neck of the male Chinese.
                                The male Chinese then fell onto the ground. The male Chinese was
                                still shouting “<b>ahhhh</b>..<b>ahhhh</b>...”</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.5    The male Chinese shouted very loudly. I felt
                                scared and I actually used my feet to push my bicycle backwards
                                while I was still on it. I wanted to distant myself further from the
                                bus-stop. I was scared also because there were many cars passing and
                                if they saw it, they would call for the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.6    As I was moving backwards, I was still looking
                                at what Fabian was doing. When the male Chinese was lying on the
                                ground, I saw Fabian punched the face of the male Chinese and kick
                                the body. By that time, I did not hear the male Chinese shouting
                                anymore. The male Chinese was no longer moving.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.7    The male Chinese was facing upwards while
                                lying on the ground. As explained earlier, I saw Fabian checking
                                through the body of the male Chinese. That was how he got the wallet
                                and the hand-phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.8    Thereafter, Fabian walked in a calm manner
                                towards his bicycle. As Fabian was walking to his bicycle, he kept
                                turning back to look at the bus-stop. I could see that the male
                                Chinese at the bus-stop did not move at all. Fabian picked up his
                                bicycle and cycled towards me. Before Fabian reached me, I already
                                turned around and cycled along the path towards the direction of the
                                mosque. I cycled slowly until Fabian caught up with me. We both then
                                stopped somewhere along the cement path near the mosque and sat
                                down. As this point, we looked through the items that were inside
                                the wallet taken from the male Chinese at the bus-stop. Thereafter,
                                as mentioned in my earlier statement, we went to a coffee-shop that
                                was closed. Also as mentioned earlier, I took the S$6/- and a
                                SINGTEL SIM card. Both these items were placed inside my jeans
                                pocket that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.9    As we feared that the police would be around
                                the vicinity of the bus-stop, which was also near to my house, we
                                decided to cycle around and therefore, we headed for Aljunied MRT
                                station. Before leaving the coffee-shop, I asked Fabian to let me
                                keep the Nokia hand-phone. Fabian again said “<b>nanti</b>” (meaning: wait or later).
                                Fabian then said that we should go to look for another victim to
                                rob. I do not know the reason why he wanted to look for another
                                victim, but I just followed. We did not cycle along Sims Avenue back
                                to Aljunied MRT station, instead, we took another route that runs
                                parallel behind Sims Avenue. As we did not go pass or near the
                                bus-stop where Fabian robbed the male Chinese, I was not aware that
                                there were ambulance and police there.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.10   We cycled quickly to Aljunied MRT station and
                                after reaching there, we rested at the bus-stop next to the MRT
                                station and remained on our bicycle. There was no one around there
                                except for some adults doing stunts with their BMX bicycle nearby.
                                We rested at the MRT station for about 10 minutes. Then both of us
                                cycled around the vicinity of the MRT station, including the lorongs
                                of Geylang. However, we did not spot any potential
                            victims.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">7.11   All in all, I think we cycled around for
                                about an hour before returning back to Aljunied MRT station. When we
                                arrived at Aljunied MRT station, Fabian saw a male India or
                                Bangladeshi about 30 over years old. This dark skinned person was
                                walking along the pathway in front of Aljunied MRT station, towards
                                the direction of Kallang. We cycled near to this person and followed
                                him, but in the end, there was no opportunity to rob him, so we
                                decided to choose another victim. From there, we again cycled around
                                the vicinity of Geylang to spot for potential victims to rob. We
                                cycled continuously for a long time around Geylang and rested on
                                several occasions but could not find anybody to rob.</p>

                                    that took place after that?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    After cycling
                                around the vicinity of Geylang, both of us ended up in one of the
                                lorongs of Geylang. I cannot remember which lorong was in, but I
                                know that it was near Aljunied MRT station. From where I was, I
                                could also see the MRT track. There were some make-shift tents
                                either blue and white or blue and red in colour along the side of
                                the lorong. There were also some chairs there and these shops were
                                already closed. We rested there.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.1   As we were resting, on the opposite side of
                                the road of Sims Avenue, I spotted a male Chinese walking towards
                                the MRT track. He appeared to be walking towards the direction of
                                one of the opposite lorongs that run beneath the MRT track. Fabian
                                also saw this male Chinese as he said “<b>Itu
                                    ada orang. Macam mana</b>” (meaning: how,
                                there’s someone there). I replied “bah, boleh,
                                bah” (meaning: can. The word ‘bah’ is an
                                expression as explained by the accused that carries no
                                meaning).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.2   We waited until this male Chinese walked
                                deeper into the opposite lorong before both of us cycled across Sims
                                Avenue to follow the male Chinese. I was just cycling behind Fabian
                                along the opposite lorong where we came across three
                                    ‘<b>bulat</b>’ (meaning:
                                concrete barriers) in the middle of the lorong. These were to
                                prevent vehicles from passing through. Fabian stopped and left his
                                bicycle on the ground near one of the ‘bulat’. He
                                alighted from his bicycle and chased the male Chinese on foot. I
                                also stop but was about 3 to 4 metres before the
                                ‘bulat’. I remained on my bicycle and cycled in circles
                                near the ‘bulat’. I saw Fabian running up right to the
                                back of the male Chinese and kicked the male Chinese once with his
                                right leg on the back of said male Chinese. Fabian and the male
                                Chinese were less than 10 metres away from me. This male Chinese
                                fell forward and I saw Fabian kick the man while the man was on the
                                ground. I do not know whether the man was struggling with Fabian or
                                was he trying to get up, but I saw this male Chinese
                            moving.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.3   The place was dim so I was not able to see
                                clearly certain actions of Fabian or the male Chinese. I was also at
                                the same time looking around to make sure that no one was near-by to
                                see what was happening. During this time, I also heard the male
                                Chinese shouting “ahhh...ahhh” in pain many times. I
                                do not know exactly how many times Fabian kicked and stepped on the
                                man, but it was certainly many times.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.4   From the time Fabian gave the first kick
                                until he stopped kicking and stepping on the male Chinese was about
                                4 to 5 minutes. When the male Chinese stopped moving, I saw Fabian
                                searching the man with his hands. Quickly, he ran back towards me.
                                As Fabian was coming towards me, I saw the male Chinese trying to
                                get up, but later fell back onto the ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.5   When Fabian reached me, I saw him carrying a
                                dark colour waist pouch, Fabian then opened the waist pouch and look
                                through the things inside. I told him to do it elsewhere as I was
                                afraid other passer-bys would have heard the commotion and come to
                                take a look. I was also afraid the male Chinese would get up and
                                approach us. Fabian then took only a dark coloured wallet from the
                                pouch and left the pouch on the ground. Fabian retrieved his bicycle
                                and immediately, I cycled across Sims Avenue towards lorong 15
                                Geylang. Fabian was cycling behind me. As I was cycling away, I did
                                turn back to look at the male Chinese and I saw him moving but
                                unable to stand-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.6   I stopped somewhere at the side in the middle
                                of lorong 15 Geylang. There were still a few people walking pass.
                                When no one was near us, Fabian opened up and looked into the
                                wallet. Fabian told me that there was some money inside. I did not
                                really notice, but either from his bag or his pocket, Fabian took
                                out a Sony Ericsson hand-phone (recorder’s note: ‘Sony
                                Ericsson’ was the words said by the accused) and showed it to
                                me. It looked silver in colour to me. Fabian was playing with the
                                phone and he even took a picture of me with it. Fabian then said
                                “Ada Cyber shot la” (meaning: there’s a cyber
                                shot). I also had a look at the phone and told Fabian that I wanted
                                this phone and suggested that he take the Nokia Music Express which
                                I had taken from the other male Chinese earlier at the bus-stop
                                opposite lorong 37 Geylang. Again, Fabian told me to wait as he
                                wanted to decide which phone to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.7   Fabian then took out the Nokia phone either
                                from his bag or his pocket and held both phones in each hand to
                                compare. Fabian than spoke aloud to himself “<b>mana satu nak bagi kamu, yang ini cantek, yang ini pun
                                    cantek</b>” (meaning: which one should I take,
                                this one nice, this one also nice). I then said to him that he could
                                give me anyone of those two. He thought about it and a short while
                                later, he gave me the NokiaMusix Express. I kept this phone in my
                                pocket.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.8   Thereafter, I decided to sell my own
                                hand-phone and use the Nokia Music Express. My own hand-phone was a
                                Nokia 3110. Fabian also agree. From there, we headed further into
                                the lorong and there was a 2<sup>nd</sup> hand
                                hand-phone shop round the corner which was still open. A male
                                Chinese attended to me at the shop and I sold my Nokia 3110 for
                                S$70.00/-.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.9   After that, both of us cycled to lorong 25
                                Geylang and sat at a 24-hour coffee-shop. There were many other
                                customers there. Fabian took out the wallet and counted the money
                                inside. At the same time, I handed over the S$70.00/- to Fabian. I
                                handed over the money to him because the Nokia 3110 was also stolen
                                from a drunkard about 2 months ago near Eunos MRT station. Fabian
                                then took out all the money from the wallet of the
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> male Chinese that we robbed and
                                place the money on the coffee-shop table, including the S$70.00/-
                                for selling the phone.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.10  Fabian then distributed the money evenly
                                between the both of us, meaning if there were two pieces of
                                S$50.00/- , he would take one and I would take one. Altogether, I
                                received about S$120.00/-. If I recall correctly, I received about
                                one S$50.00/-, four pieces of S$10.00/-, four pieces of S$5.00/- and
                                five pieces of S$2.00/-. We both then ordered beer. Altogether we
                                bought about 6 bottles of Tiger beer. We both took turns to pay for
                                the beer and the money used to pay for the beer was from the robbery
                                we committed. While drinking, Fabian again looked through the
                                wallet. I do not know what else was there inside as I did not
                                see.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">10.11  We drank till about sometime after 6.00am. I
                                could remember this time because there was a clock in the
                                coffee-shop. Thereafter, I suggested that we go look for prostitute.
                                Fabian agreed. From the coffee-shop we walked to lorong 24 Geylang.
                                We left the bicycle at the coffee-shop. At lorong 24 Geylang, each
                                of us engaged the services of an Indonesian prostitute. I paid the
                                prostitute S$25.00/- for the services. Both of us then walked back
                                to the coffee-shop and retrieved our bicycle. As Fabian stayed
                                somewhere in Joo Chiat, we both cycled together along Sims Avenue.
                                When I arrived home, it was about 7.00am.</p>

<b>Question 15: Who decided to rob this male Chinese
                                at the bus-stop?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    I was the one
                                who alerted Fabian about the male Chinese who was sitting at the
                                bus-stop. I was also the one who said to ‘<b>Check</b>’ (recorder’s note: this word was
                                used by the accused) the male Chinese. This word ‘Check’
                                is frequently used between Fabian and myself. When the word
                                ‘check’ is used, we meant to proceed to take a closer
                                look at the intended victim and later to decide whether to rob the
                                intended target or not. So for the male Chinese at the bus-stop,
                                Fabian was the one who first suggested that I go and rob the male
                                Chinese. However, I was scared as there were a lot of cars passing
                                by. Fabian just went forward and robbed the male Chinese
                                himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>Question 16: Following from your answer to question
                                15, since there was no one who actually decided to rob, how would
                                Fabian or yourself know what to do or where to position
                                yourself?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    It was my own
                                spontaneous action to follow from behind and observe what Fabian was
                                doing to the male Chinese at the bus-stop. It was also a natural
                                reaction for me to act as the look-out and alert Fabian if anyone
                                was coming or any vehicle stopping to see what was happening at the

                                What do you have to say to this?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    For these two
                                robberies that I have described in my statements, Fabian was the one
                                who committed the robbery as he was the one who confronted the
                                victims. I acted as the look-out. That is the reason why I left it
                                to Fabian to decide who should take what items taken from the
                                victims. There were times that I was the one who committed the
                                robberies while Fabian acted as the look-out. After getting what I
                                could from the victims, I would still hand it over to Fabian who
                                will then decide what my share would be.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">17.1   I never committed robberies until I became
                                friends with Fabian. He was the one who introduced me to robbery.
                                That is also the reason why I kind of became his follower and let
                                him decide.</p>

<b>Question 18</b>:    
                <b>You mentioned in your statement (para 7.3
                                    – dated 11 Sept 2008) that the piece of wood was picked up
                                    at the vicinity of Paya Lebar MRT station the night before the
                                    incident. What was the purpose of picking up and keeping this
                                    piece of wood?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    That night, we
                                picked up the wood because we had the intention to rob. The piece of
                                wood was to be used as a weapon to hit the victims to cause the
                                victim to fall. Once they fall, it would be easier to search and
                                take their belongings. If we do not make the victim fall and just
                                approached them to rob, the victims might retaliate. So we strike
                                first.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">18.1.  Before we picked up the piece of wood to
                                commit robberies, both of us only used our hands and legs to make
                                the victim fall. It was that night that Fabian suggested to use a
                                piece of wood so that the victims would fall easier.</p>

</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    About 8 or 9
                                times. Places we robbed were usually at the vicinity of Eunos, Paya
                                Lebar and Aljunied MRT Station; Geylang Serai and Tanjong Katong
                                area. I have never done any robberies without Fabian being around.
                                We did have one or two others who joined us in some of the
                                robberies.</p>

<b>Question 23</b>:    
                <b>How do you go about planning such robberies
                                    with Fabian?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    It was not
                                always planned. Sometimes during a drinking session, Fabian and I
                                would talk about wanting to commit robbery and decide which location
                                to wait for intended victims. We do not plan who should strike the
                                victim or who should act as the look-out. We only plan the place to
                                rob. The rest just happens naturally when committing the
                                robberies.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Question 24</b>:    
                <b>How do you target your
                                victims?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    As this is
                                Singapore, we tend not to rob Singaporeans. The better choice would
                                be to rob other nationalities. I am not able to give an answer as to
                                why, but I just prefer robbing foreigners. As for the male Chinese
                                at the bus-stop, he was holding a good hand-phone that is why we
                                robbed him. Sometimes we also see how thick the wallet is. The
                                thicker the wallet the victim has, the more possibility of me
                                robbing him. I do not target ladies as they scream very loud and
                                will definitely attract people nearby. The size of the victim also
                                cannot be big so that we can overpower them easily.</p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    Yes, I was the
                                one who did it. I was with Ellarry that morning. I think it was
                                about 3.00am or maybe 2.00am. At that time, Ellarry and I were
                                sitting and talking outside his house along Sims Avenue, near to
                                Lorong 37 Geylang. I stood up and walked a few steps to my left. I
                                saw a man sitting on a seat at the bus-stop. The bus-stop is about
                                30 to 40 metres away from Ellarry’s house.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">

                                “This one how” in English). Ellarry replied”
                                “Tengok dulu” (means “See first” in
                                English). When I asked Ellarry “Ini macam mana?”, I
                                meant to ask him whether we should rob the man at the bus-stop.
                                Ellarry and I then rode our bicycles towards the bus-stop. Almost
                                reaching the bus-stop, Ellarry cycled slightly ahead of me. I cycled

                                was a Chinese. He was wearing long trousers, but I cannot remember
                                if it was pants or jeans. I also cannot remember the colour. I do
                                not remember what top he was wearing. The man was pressing his
                                handphone in his hand. The handphone was blue and black in colour.

                                not think that the man saw me. I then approached him from behind. I
                                used my left hand to pull his shirt near his right shoulder. He

                                at that time. I then pulled him to the back of the bus-stop where
                                there is a pedestrian pavement. I let go of my grip on his shirt and
                                hit the back of his head with the same wooden object, which broke.
                                The man shouted. I pushed his chest and used my left leg to trip
                                him. He fell onto the pavement and laid face-up. I kicked him 2 or 3
                                times near his left upper arm. He continued to shout. After I
                                stepped on his chest once, he stopped shouting, but I saw his eyes

                                bicycle. As I walked away from the bus-stop, I turned around to look
                                at the man. He was still lying on the pavement. He was holding onto
                                his head and his body was turning left and right. When I reached my

                                cycled straight on the same side of the road and later turned left
                                into a small lane. We stopped in front of a mosque. We then
                                    <em>checked</em> the wallet. Inside the
                                wallet, there was cash of S$6/- (3 pieces of S$2/- note), one Ezlink
                                card, one red Singapore IC, two bank cards, one Singtel SIM card,
                                and some papers. The bank cards are from <em>UOB</em> and <em>POSBank</em>. I
                                also looked at the photo on the Singapore IC, and it is the man that
                                I robbed at the bus-stop.</p>

                                things in the wallet. I threw the wallet on the pavement of this

                                coffeeshop was already closed. Ellarry and I then sat on the ground

                                but I kept quiet. I heard a man’s voice saying
                                    “<em>hello</em>” and I
                                immediately switched off the phone. As I did not want anymore calls,
                                I took out the SIM card from the handphone, and replaced it with my
                                SIM card. I then switched on the handphone and checked what was
                                stored inside. Ellarry then asked me to give the handphone to him,
                                but I told him to wait. I then told him we would find some more

                                coffeeshop, we cycled towards Aljunied MRT station. After passing

                                Lorong 21 Geylang. There, I saw a Chinese man. He was crossing the
                                road from Lorong 21 Geylang, and walking into a small road towards
                                some blocks of flat. I could see that he was pressing his handphone.
                                He was also carrying a plastic bag. I asked Ellarry: “Yang
                                ini macam mana?” [means “How about this one??”
                                in English]. I meant to ask Ellarry if we should rob that Chinese
                                man. I cannot remember if Ellarry replied, but he just followed me
                                when I cycled across the road.</p>

                                then cycled in the direction of the Chinese man. He was still
                                walking along that small road leading to a dead end. There is an
                                overhead MRT track near the end of this road. After crossing the
                                road, Ellarry and I continued to cycle along the small road. As the
                                man walked beneath the MRT track, I put down the bicycle. I was
                                about 10 metres away from him. Ellarry stood with his bicycle near
                                where my bicycle was.</p>

                                his back (Recorder’s note: Accused pointed somewhere between
                                his shoulder blades). The man fell onto the <em>cement</em>, and landed on his right. From sideways, he
                                turned his boy and faced up. He raised one leg and tried to fight
                                back. I pushed his leg away and kicked his head 2 or 3 times. After
                                a while, his body stopped moving, I think he fainted.</p>

                                handphone or a white and green handphone. I think the model is
                                    <em>C702</em> because I had seen the same
                                model at a handphone shop in Boon Lay sometime after I had shifted

                                time, he was still standing with our bicycles. Ellarry started to
                                walk towards me when we were about 10 metres apart. As I stepped
                                back onto the small road, I <em>checked</em>
                                the <em>wallet</em> and took out 1 Ezlink card
                                and cash of S$70/-. Ellarry saw me taking out the items from the
                                wallet. There were pieces of S$10/- and S$5/- notes, but I do not
                                remember the exact number. I did not take out the rest of the things
                                inside the <em>wallet</em>. There were a

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">

                                He was easy to rob. He is small-sized. At that time, it was already

                                He did not help me, maybe because he saw that the man had already

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>Ans</b>:    For this case,
                                there was no plan. Ellarry and I did other robberies before. Most of
                                the time, I would be the one to do it. If the victim did not fall or
                                faint, Ellarry would then help. Sometimes, Ellarry would be the one
                                to do it. I would help him in the same way. Sometimes, we discuss on
                                what to do if the victim does not faint but usually the decision on
                                who to do it is made just before we rob. At times, we do not even
                                decide who to do it. When we decide to rob a victim, one of us would
                                just do it while the other would be looking out for people or
                                police. We understand each other, so there was no discussion for the
                                bus-stop robbery.</p>

                            recall and re-examine any person already examined and the court shall
                            summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person, if his
                            evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the
                            case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Upon a careful consideration of the
                    circumstances, I did not allow the application made by the Prosecution. In my
                    view, further cross-examination of the two accused persons was not essential to
                    a just determination of the case. The Prosecution had had ample opportunity to
                    cross-examine both accused persons, and had in fact cross-examined them at
                    length, in relation to (a) the extent of their participation in the criminal
                    acts in question and (b) their states of mind, including their intentions at the
                    material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I did not think it was fair to recall the
                    accused persons some nine months after they completed giving their evidence and
                    to allow them to be cross-examined again by the Prosecution on their states of
                    mind at the material time. In my view, the cross-examination would be repetitive
                    and cover largely the same ground. As it was not likely to add substantially to
                    the evidence that was already before the court, I dismissed the
                    Prosecution’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fabian – s 300(c) murder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Defence conceded that Fabian intended to
                    rob the deceased. However, it was emphasised that he had only hit the deceased
                    to facilitate the robbery, and that the killing was neither premeditated nor
                    intentional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Defence insisted that Fabian did not
                    strike the deceased without warning. According to the Defence, Fabian had
                    confronted the deceased and demanded his hand phone. Fabian was holding the
                    piece of wood for the purpose of intimidating the deceased into handing over his
                    hand phone and only struck the deceased when the deceased failed to surrender
                    his hand phone and began to shout and struggle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Thus, the Defence submitted that when Fabian
                    struck the deceased, he did not have the <em>mens rea</em>
                    for an offence under s 300 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Indeed, the Defence contended, on the
                    authority of <em>Public Prosecutor v AFR</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 82 (“<em>AFR</em>”),
                    that there must be a subjective inquiry into the question of intention,
                        <em>ie</em>, whether Fabian had the intention to cause
                    the bodily injury that was actually found to be present on the deceased. The
                    Defence further suggested that Fabian’s profile (age, education and
                    intelligence) should be taken into account in determining whether he could have
                    formed the requisite intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence of diminished responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Defence also urged me to consider whether
                    the defence of diminished responsibility was made out on the facts. The Defence
                    relied principally on (a) the evidence of their expert witness Dr Tommy
                    Tan, who opined that the defence of diminished responsibility may not be wholly
                    excluded; and (b) the fact that Fabian is of below average intelligence (with an
                    intelligence quotient (“IQ”) in the range 77-85 on the Wechsler
                    Adult Intelligence Scale (“WAIS”)), has a very low education level
                    and was only 18 years old at the time of the offence. In the circumstances, the
                    defence contended that Fabian should be entitled to the defence of diminished
                    responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Causation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Defence further submitted that it was
                    possible that the injuries which caused the deceased’s death may have been
                    caused when he fell onto the pavement <em>after</em> being
                    hit on the head with the wooden stick.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ellarry – s 34 common intention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Defence submitted that Ellarry and Fabian
                    lacked a common intention to commit s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    murder for the following reasons:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the robberies prior to 23 August 2008 committed
                            by the two accused persons did not involve the use of weapons of any

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there was no plan to rob the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Ellarry was shocked when he saw Fabian using the

                            cause the death of the deceased.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Defence submitted that the only common
                    intention the two accused persons shared was to rob the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fabian – s 300(c) murder</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The seminal authority on the interpretation of
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code is the
                    decision of the Supreme Court of India in <em>Virsa Singh v State
                        of Punjab</em> AIR [1958] SC 465 (“<em>Virsa Singh</em>”). At [12] of <em>Virsa Singh</em>, the four
                    elements of s 300(<em>c</em>) are set out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Firstly, [the Prosecution] must establish, quite objectively, that a
                        bodily injury is present;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely
                        objective investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that
                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or
                        otherwise unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was
                        intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds
                        further and,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described
                        made up of the three elements above is sufficient to cause death in the
                        ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and
                        inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     This analysis has been affirmed by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Public Prosecutor v Lim Poh Lye</em>
                    [2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>Lim Poh
                    Lye</em>”) and most recently in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Kho Jabing and Anor</em> [2011] SGCA 24
                        (“<em>Kho Jabing</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Analysis of the evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The first two elements of the <em>Virsa Singh</em> test have been made out in the present case.
                    The autopsy report by Dr Teo and the medical report by Dr Kim show
                    that the deceased suffered four fractures to his skull and severe <em>contracoup</em> brain injuries (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The next (<em>ie</em>,
                    third) element that must be proved is Fabian’s “intention to
                    inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not
                    accidental or otherwise unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was
                    intended” (<em>Virsa Singh</em> at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     At [16] of <em>Virsa Singh</em>, Bose J
                    elaborated on this third element of the offence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious
                        injury or a trivial one but whether he intended to inflict the injury that
                        is proved to be present. If he can show that he did not, or if the totality
                        of the circumstances justify such an inference, then, of course, the intent
                        the section requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the
                        injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only possible
                        inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he knew of its
                        seriousness or intended serious consequences, is neither here nor there. The
                        question is, so far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he
                        intended to kill, or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of
                        seriousness but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and
                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be
                        presumed unless the evidence of the circumstances warrant an opposite
                        conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In <em>Lim Poh Lye</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal emphasised at [22]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Whether a particular injury was accidental or unintended (for the
                        purposes of section 300(c)) is a question of fact which has to be determined
                        by the court in the light of the evidence adduced and taking into account
                        all the surrounding circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In his statements to the police, Fabian
                    admitted to hitting the deceased on the back and top of his head so as to make
                    him “<em>fall and faint faster</em>” (see
                    Questions 14-18 of Fabian’s 3<sup>rd</sup> s 121(1)
                    statement, reproduced at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, at trial, Fabian claimed that he did
                    not actually intend to hit the deceased on the head, and that his blows had just
                    happened to land on the deceased’s head.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Under cross-examination, Fabian was unable to
                    explain the inconsistency between his oral evidence in court and the statements
                    he gave to the police. In fact, Fabian had admitted during cross-examination
                    that he had intended to hit the deceased on the head:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I am of the view that Fabian did have the
                    intention to cause the head and brain injuries that were found on the deceased.
                    His evidence in court that the blows just happened to land on the
                    deceased’s head appeared to be a mere attempt to absolve himself of
                    liability for murder under s 300(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I find it quite hard to believe that Fabian
                    never intended to hit the deceased on the head, when in actual fact all three
                    strikes of the wooden stick landed <em>nowhere else on the
                        deceased’s body</em> but squarely on the back and top of the
                    deceased’s head. It was clearly not a random raining of blows on the
                    deceased’s body but a targeted series of blows to the deceased’s
                    head. I am thus driven to infer that Fabian specifically intended to hit the
                    deceased on the head using the heavy wooden stick with sufficient force so as to
                    render the deceased unconscious. The fact that he had chosen to hit the deceased
                    a few times <em>on the head</em> to achieve his professed
                    aim of making the deceased “fall and faint faster”, suggested that
                    he was plainly aware that the head was a vulnerable part of the
                body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In addition, Ellarry’s oral evidence in
                    court and his statements to the police corroborate the other evidence showing
                    that Fabian had used the piece of wood to hit the deceased on the head with the
                    intention of inflicting those fatal injuries to the head (see Question 18 of
                    Ellarry’s 4<sup>th</sup> s 121(1) statement,
                    reproduced at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I reject the Defence’s suggestion that
                    Fabian did not strike the deceased without warning (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above). I am of the view that this was a clear case of
                    Fabian “striking first” without any warning to catch the deceased
                    totally by surprise so as to minimise the chances of retaliation from the
                    deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I also reject the Defence’s argument
                    (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above) that Fabian could not have
                    formed the subjective intention to cause the particular injuries that caused the
                    death of the deceased. In my opinion, this argument must be rejected once the
                    circumstances giving rise to and the manner of the attack are <em>also</em> taken into consideration. I cannot ignore the evidence that
                    Fabian hit the deceased on the back and top of the head a few times with a heavy
                    wooden stick with considerable force to cause him to fall and faint so that the
                    deceased’s valuables could be taken away easily. At 18 years of age and
                    despite his low average IQ and his low educational level, I find that he knew
                    exactly what he was doing at that time and that he fully understood why he had
                    to hit the deceased on the head to achieve their common purpose. No complex
                    reasoning or high IQ is needed for a simple realisation of the kind of
                    consequences that would naturally follow from inflicting multiple heavy blows to
                    the head. Even after giving due consideration to his young age, his low
                    educational level and low average IQ, I believe that it is not beyond
                    Fabian’s knowledge and comprehension that using a heavy wooden stick to
                    hit the deceased’s head several times with such force as he did would
                    result in severe internal injuries to the head that might well be fatal. I have
                    no difficulty in concluding that Fabian is sufficiently mature and he is
                    intellectually capable of and had indeed formed the subjective intention at the
                    material time to inflict the head injuries that eventually caused or resulted in
                    the death of the deceased. Fabian had a clear purpose in mind <em>ie</em> to make the deceased “fall and faint” and he
                    carried out that purpose in a cold-blooded manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In <em>AFR</em> at
                        [32] to [37], the High Court drew a distinction between injuries which
                    were “ordinary and natural consequences” of the accused
                    person’s acts and thus “well within the contemplation of any normal
                    person” and those which were not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the first category of injuries, the law
                    would, in the absence of evidence that would indicate to the contrary,
                    “infer an intention ... to cause the fatal injuries as such injuries
                    would be the ordinary and natural consequences of that act and well within the
                    contemplation of any normal person” (see <em>AFR</em> at [36]). This was
                    the category of injuries which caused the deaths of the deceased persons in the
                    cases of <em>Public Prosecutor v Visuvanathan</em>
                    [1977-78] SLR(R) 27 (“<em>Visuvanathan</em>”), <em>Tan Joo Cheng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 219 (“<em>Tan Joo Cheng</em>”), <em>Tan Cheow

                    1 SLR(R) 479 (“<em>Tan Chee
                    Wee</em>”) and <em>Lim Poh
                Lye</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     At [36] of <em>AFR</em>, Lee Seiu Kin J
                    explained that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Visuvanathan</em>, <em>Tan Joo
                            Cheng</em>, <em>Tan Cheow Bock</em>, and
                            <em>Lim Poh Lye</em>, the accused persons there had
                        stabbed the deceased persons with knives. The stab wounds were also in
                        particularly vulnerable parts of the body; in <em>Visuvanathan</em> it was aimed at the heart region of the chest,
                        in <em>Tan Joo Cheng</em> it was at the neck. Or they
                        were particularly deep as in <em>Tan Cheow Bock</em>
                        and <em>Lim Poh Lye</em>. In the latter, it was deep
                        enough to cut the femoral vein in the leg. In <em>Tan Chee
                            Wee</em>, multiple blows with a hammer were visited upon the head
                        of the deceased and one of those caused a large crack in the skull ... There
                        is no question that in such circumstances, unless the appellants could
                        produce the evidence to the contrary, the inference would be that those
                        fatal injuries were intended to be inflicted on the victims as they would be
                        the clear outcome of such actions. The situations in these cases accord with
                        everyday human experiences and conform with the words of Bose J in
                            <em>Virsa Singh</em> where he said (at [11]) that the analysis should be
                        “broad-based and simple and based on commonsense: the kind of inquiry
                        that “twelve good men and true” could readily appreciate and
                        understand.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     This justifies the apparently
                    “strict” approach towards s 300(<em>c</em>) in the cases of <em>Visuvanathan</em>,
                        <em>Tan Joo Cheng</em>, <em>Tan Cheow
                        Bock</em>, <em>Lim Poh Lye</em>, <em>Tan Chee Wee</em> (see Annual Review of Singapore Cases 2010
                    (Teo Keang Sood, ed) (Academy Publishing, 2011) (“<em>Annual Review of Singapore Cases 2010</em>”) at para
                    12.80).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the second category of injuries, the
                    law should not draw the inference that the mere presence of such injuries means
                    that the accused person must have intended to cause them. When the injuries that
                    actually resulted in death are not within the “ordinary and natural
                    consequences” of the accused person’s acts, the accused person
                    would not ordinarily be imputed with the knowledge that, by carrying out such
                    acts, he would cause those fatal injuries in question because such knowledge
                    would not be “within the contemplation of a normal person”. As
                    such, in the absence of any credible evidence proving to the contrary, an
                    inference that the accused person intended to cause such unexpected and unusual
                    fatal injuries through his criminal acts should not be drawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In <em>AFR</em>, a father
                    had caused the death of his 1 year and 11 month old daughter when he struck her
                    repeatedly with his fist and feet. Lee J observed that, in the
                    circumstances of the case, “[e]ven an experienced pathologist with expert
                    training could not be certain as to how it had happened in this case”
                        (<em>AFR</em> at [37]). Given the highly unusual nature of the fatal injury
                        <em>ie</em> the rupture to the young child’s
                    inferior vena cava (“IVC”), Lee J could not infer from the
                    mere presence of the injury that the accused had the intention to cause that
                    particular fatal injury (although it could only have been factually caused by
                    the accused’s actions). In Lee J’s view, the accused person, a
                    poorly educated young man with at best average (but more likely below average)
                    intelligence, could not reasonably have known or foreseen that the beating that
                    he was unleashing on the deceased could have caused the unusual and unexpected
                    fatal rupture to the IVC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the present case, the injuries found on the
                    deceased were those in the first category – it is clearly well within the
                    contemplation of a normal person that striking someone on the head a few times
                    with a heavy wooden stick so as to render that person unconscious would likely
                    cause skull fractures and severe brain injuries. Although Fabian has a low IQ,
                    he must have known the consequences of his actions. Indeed he had <em>intended</em> those very consequences to happen as his stated
                    objective was to make the deceased “fall and faint faster”. Such
                    injuries were thus the “ordinary and natural consequences” of
                    Fabian’s acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
                    the very presence of the injuries found on the deceased allows me to draw an
                    inference that Fabian intended to cause those head and brain injuries. Based on
                    Fabian’s admissions to the police, his evidence in court that he wanted to
                    hit the deceased on the head to make him “fall and faint faster”
                    and Ellarry’s statements to the police that Fabian had suggested using the
                    “piece of wood so that the victims would fall easier”, I find
                    beyond a reasonable doubt that the Fabian intended to cause the head and brain
                    injuries found on the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The last (<em>ie</em>,
                    fourth) element to be proved is that the injuries found on the deceased were
                    sufficient to cause his death in the ordinary course of nature. Dr Teo
                    testified unequivocally that the head and brain injuries inflicted by Fabian
                    were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the
                    deceased. Dr Teo was of the opinion that the degree of force used by Fabian
                    to hit the deceased’s head must have been very severe (and see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Defence has merely speculated that the
                    injuries were not sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,
                    without adducing any evidence of the same. In the circumstances, I am of the
                    view that the Prosecution has established that the deceased’s head and
                    brain injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause
                    death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Given that all the elements of the <em>Virsa Singh</em> test are satisfied, Fabian will be convicted
                    of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder unless the Defence can
                    prove that any defences apply in Fabian’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defence of diminished responsibility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code
                    stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such
                        abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or

                        substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts or omissions

                    defence of diminished responsibility:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that the appellant bears the burden of
                        proving the defence of diminished responsibility on a balance of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The definition of an “abnormality of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘Abnormality of mind’ ... means a state of mind so different
                        from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it
                        abnormal. It appears to us wide enough to cover the mind’s activities
                        in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters,
                        and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or
                        wrong, but also the ability to exercise will power to control physical acts
                        in accordance with that rational judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This judicial elaboration of “abnormality of mind” has
                    been cited by our Court of Appeal in <em>Zailani bin Ahmad v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 356
                        (“<em>Zailani bin Ahmad</em>”) at 374 and

                    2 SLR(R) 70 (“<em>Took Leng
                    How</em>”) at 86.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Defence adduced no evidence to prove on a
                    balance of probabilities that Fabian was suffering from an abnormality of mind
                    at the time he caused the death of the deceased. Initially, Defence witness,
                    Dr Tommy Tan, speculated that Fabian might have mild mental retardation but
                    he required an IQ assessment to confirm this finding.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Subsequently Ms Koo
                    Shen Lin (“Ms Koo”) administered the WAIS test on Fabian and
                    found his full scale IQ to be in the low average range (77-85).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Based on
                    Ms Koo’s finding, Dr Tommy Tan concluded that Fabian did not
                    suffer from mental retardation and as such would probably not qualify for the
                    defence of diminished responsibility.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the present case, Fabian cannot even cross
                    the first hurdle of <em>Ong Pang Siew</em>’s
                    three-limb test, as the Defence failed to show that Fabian was suffering from an
                    abnormality of mind at the time he caused the death of the deceased. Indeed, the
                    objective evidence leads me to the conclusion that Fabian fully understood the
                    nature of his actions and made a rational decision to use the wooden stick to
                    hit the deceased on the head to render him unconscious in order to facilitate
                    the robbery. After the deceased was incapacitated, Fabian searched the
                    deceased’s pockets for his hand phone and wallet. Fabian and Ellarry then
                    split the loot between them. In my view, Fabian was clearly not suffering from
                    any abnormality of the mind at the time he caused the death of the deceased. The
                    chain of events before, during and after the robbery and attack on the deceased
                    was the work of a calculated and rational mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As such, the defence of diminished
                    responsibility is not made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I find Fabian to be guilty of the charge
                    against him. I convict him of murder under s 300(<em>c</em>) of the Penal Code and I am compelled to impose the mandatory
                    death penalty on him.</p>

                                predicated upon (or encompass) a common intention to commit robbery

                                implies a “pre-arranged plan” pursuant to which the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     At [36] of <em>Kho Jabing</em>, the Court of

                        actual doer] as to what they would do and how they would do it in order to
                        rob the victims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In light of these recent decisions, Ellarry
                    will only be found constructively liable for the murder actually committed by
                    Fabian if the Prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ellarry
                    shared the common intention with Fabian to commit a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on the deceased. In particular, the
                    Prosecution has to prove the existence of some kind of <em>planning</em> or <em>understanding</em> between
                    Fabian and Ellarry as to what they would do and how they would do it in order to
                    rob the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Crucially, a <em>high degree of
                        specificity</em> is demanded of Ellarry’s intent. In <em>Daniel Vijay</em> at [73]-[76], the Court of
                    Appeal applied the <em>Barendra</em> test to
                        s 300(<em>c</em>) murder:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    … [W]here s 34 is invoked to hold a

                            knowledge which he must have is subjective knowledge of the likely
                            commission of the criminal act that is relevant to the particular limb
                            of s 300 relied upon by the Prosecution. At first glance, this may
                            seem to require fine distinctions to be drawn between the various limbs
                            of s 300 for the purposes of imposing constructive liability on a
                            secondary offender pursuant to s 34. We are, however, of the view
                            that in terms of application, there is, in substance, little or no
                            difference between subjective knowledge of the likelihood of one of the
                            criminal acts in s 300 occurring and subjective knowledge of the
                            likelihood of another of those criminal acts occurring. Subjective
                            knowledge that any one of the criminal acts set out in s 300 might
                            likely be committed, whether that criminal act is the one delineated in
                                s 300(<em>a</em>), s 300(<em>b</em>), s 300(<em>c</em>)
                            or s 300(<em>d</em>), is in effect simply
                            subjective knowledge that the victim might likely be killed or fatally
                            injured, whatever the specific criminal act concerned might

                                receiving, specifically, s </b><b><em>300(c) injury</em></b>. This corresponds to the type of bodily

                                s 300(<em>c</em>) murder. <b>In</b><b><em>this respect, it is not</em></b><b>sufficient</b><b><em>, in our

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    In this regard, it bears emphasis that the

                            murder. In contradistinction, s 34 does not create a substantive
                            offence but merely lays down a principle of liability (see <em>Mahbub Shah v Emperor</em> AIR 1945 PC 118
                                (“<em>Mahbub Shah</em>”) at 120),
                            and the <em>LCK</em> requirement is only a
                                <em>factor</em> in determining whether that
                            principle of liability applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76    Section 34 imputes constructive liability to a

                            actual doer and the secondary offender, whereas s 300(<em>c</em>) imputes direct liability to the actual doer
                            by reference to an intentional act done by him. <b>Different policy considerations apply when imputing direct
                                liability for murder and when imputing constructive liability for
                                that offence</b>. It may be just to hold the actual doer
                            liable for the offence arising from his actions, but, in our view, it
                            may not be just to hold the secondary offender constructively liable for
                            an offence arising from the criminal act of another person (<em>viz</em>, the actual doer) if the secondary offender
                            does not have the intention to do that particular criminal act. This is
                            especially true of serious offences like murder or culpable homicide not
                            amounting to murder. <b>It does not necessarily follow
                                that the</b><b><em>Virsa Singh</em></b><b>interpretation of s 300(</b><b><em>c</em></b><b>), which is applicable to
                                the actual doer, is or should be equally applicable to a secondary
                                offender, especially where the secondary offender did not inflict
                                any injury on the victim at all</b>. In other words, as a
                            principle of criminal liability, it may not be unjust or unreasonable to
                            hold the actual doer liable for s 300(<em>c</em>) murder by applying the <em>Virsa
                                Singh</em> test since (as just mentioned) he was the one who
                            inflicted the s 300(<em>c</em>) injury
                            sustained by the victim. <b>However, it may not be just
                                or reasonable to apply the</b><b><em>Virsa Singh</em></b><b>test to hold a secondary offender constructively
                                liable for s 300(</b><b><em>c</em></b><b>) murder where he had no intention
                                to do the specific criminal act done by the actual doer which gave
                                rise to the offence of s 300(</b><b><em>c</em></b><b>) murder, and also did not
                                subjectively know that that criminal act might likely be committed
                                or that that criminal act would result in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It is useful to briefly recall the facts of
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em> and to see how the Court of
                    Appeal dealt with the constructive liability of the secondary offenders in that
                    case. In <em>Daniel Vijay</em>, the three appellants
                    – Daniel, Christopher and Bala –were part of a plan to rob a cargo
                    of mobile phones. They brought along a baseball bat but it was disputed whether
                    there was any prior agreement to beat up the driver of the cargo lorry to the
                    extent that he could not identify the assailants later on. In the course of the
                    robbery, the driver was repeatedly hit on the head and other parts of his body
                    by Bala. Daniel and Christopher did not attack the driver. The trio looted the
                    cargo and left the victim inside the lorry. The victim eventually died of his
                    head injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The High Court found Bala liable for murder
                    under s 300(<em>c</em>) and no defences were available
                    to him. The trial judge, applying s 34, convicted Daniel and Christopher on
                    a joint charge of murder arising from Bala’s act of attacking the driver
                    even though they did not plan to kill the driver. The Court of Appeal disagreed
                    with the trial judge on the convictions of Daniel and Christopher, noting that
                    even though the trial judge found that Daniel and Christopher knew that the
                    driver would be assaulted as part of the robbery plan, he did not find as a fact
                    that they had a common intention to knock the driver unconscious. <em>They only had a common intention to commit robbery with hurt, and
                        not to kill</em>. As such, the Court of Appeal substituted the charge
                    of murder read with s 34 to a charge of robbery with hurt under ss 394
                    read with 34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In respect of the application of the <em>Barendra</em> test to a charge of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder, the Court of Appeal emphasised (at [145] and

                            had a common intention to beat Wan on the head to render him unconscious
                            (a contention which the Judge did not find to be supported on the
                            facts), <b>an issue would arise as to whether the injury
                                caused to a person by beating him on the head can be regarded as a
                                s 300(</b><b><em>c</em></b><b>) injury if no scientific evidence (which would necessarily
                                included medical evidence) is called (as counsel for Daniel pointed
                                out (see</b> [49] <b>above)) to show as
                                a</b><b><em>scientific fact</em></b><b>that</b><b><em>any knock on the head with a weapon akin to the
                                baseball bat</em></b><b>is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to
                                cause death. Thus, even if the Judge had found on the evidence that
                                the Appellants had a common intention to beat Wan on the head to
                                render him unconscious, it would not necessarily follow that this
                                common intention was a common intention to inflict

                    (so as to cause the deceased to fall down to the ground) with the intention to
                    cause a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury. At the highest, the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     I disbelieve Ellarry’s evidence that he
                    did not know that Fabian was going to use the stick to attack the deceased.
                    Given that they had always picked victims smaller than themselves and were thus
                    always able to overpower them, it did not make sense for Fabian to suddenly arm
                    himself with a wooden stick for “protection”. They had always
                    successfully attacked and robbed their victims by punching and kicking them.
                    Ellarry’s <em>volte-face</em> at trial is nothing
                    more than an attempt to absolve himself of the crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     From the totality of the evidence, I find that
                    Ellarry was obviously aware that Fabian had brought along the wooden stick
                    which, due to its length, was protruding out of the bag that Fabian was carrying
                    when they looking for a victim to rob on that night. I further find that Ellarry
                    expected and intended that Fabian would use the stick to attack and make their
                    next victim fall down to the ground as part of their plan to facilitate their
                    robbery. Ellarry clearly admitted in his own voluntary statement that
                        “<em>the piece of wood was to be used as a weapon to
                        hit the victims to cause the victim to fall. Once they fall, it would be
                        easier to search and take their belongings. If we do not make the victim
                        fall and just approached them to rob, the victims might retaliate. So we
                        strike first</em>.” That also explains why on the night the
                    deceased was attacked and robbed, although Ellarry himself did not bring his
                    half of the wooden stick, he neither suggested that Fabian dispose of the other
                    half of the wooden stick (which he knew Fabian had brought along to attack their
                    next robbery victim), nor attempted in any way to dissuade or stop Fabian from
                    using the weapon to commit their robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Given the extent and nature of the voluntary
                    disclosures in Ellarry’s and Fabian’s statements regarding their
                    plan to use the wooden stick as a weapon to attack their next robbery victim and
                    to make the victim fall down to the ground, it is my view that Ellarry must have
                    realised that it was <em>almost a certainty</em> that
                    Fabian was going to use the stick he was carrying to attack the next
                    victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     With the knowledge and full realisation that
                    Fabian was going to use the wooden stick to attack their robbery victim, and
                    instead of dissociating himself entirely from what Fabian intended to do,
                    Ellarry continued to assist Fabian in looking for a suitable victim and was even
                    prepared to act as a look-out for Fabian so that Fabian could successfully carry
                    out the robbery and thereafter share the loot with him. I thus find that at the
                    material time, Ellarry shared a common intention with Fabian to attack their
                    next robbery victim with the wooden stick to cause the victim to fall down to
                    the ground in order to commit the robbery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, it must be stressed that, on the
                    evidence, the Prosecution failed to show any common intention for (a) the stick
                    to be used to hit the deceased on a specific part of his body, or for (b) the
                    deceased to be rendered unconscious as a result of the attack. From
                    Ellarry’s voluntary statement, it is clear that he only admitted to
                    sharing the common intention with Fabian to cause the deceased to fall down to
                    the ground. While the Prosecution had proven that Fabian intended to cause the
                    deceased injuries on his head so as to render him unconscious (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a>), no evidence was adduced to prove that
                    Ellarry shared the common intention with Fabian to cause the injuries on the
                    deceased’s head so as to render him unconscious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Conduct of the accused persons during the robbery and attack
                on the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Ellarry’s role <em>during</em> the actual robbery and attack was significant. Even
                    though he did not cause the deceased any physical injury, his role must still be
                    regarded as one of <em>active participation</em>, because
                    he:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">actively scouted for a victim;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was acting as a look-out while Fabian attacked
                            the deceased with the wooden stick before robbing the deceased in
                            accordance with their plan; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was ready to step in to assist Fabian to subdue
                            the deceased if the deceased had retaliated and
                        struggled.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Ellarry himself admitted as much in his
                    statements to the police (see Questions 15 and 16 of Ellarry’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> s 121(1) statement, reproduced at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above). Fabian’s statements
                    to the police also support this version of the events (see Questions 25 and 26
                    of Fabian’s 3<sup>rd</sup> s 121(1) statement,
                    reproduced at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     However, at trial, Ellarry, in an attempt to
                    absolve himself of criminal liability, did another <em>volte-face</em> and claimed that he was not acting as look-out for
                    Fabian. Under cross-examination and after some questions from the court, his
                    oral testimony was shown to be inconsistent with his statements to the
                        police.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The evidence clearly showed that the ill-fated
                    robbery and attack on the deceased was conducted in accordance with a common
                    plan. Ellarry and Fabian acted instinctively on the basis of a shared
                    understanding which had been developed over the course of a number of previous
                    successful robberies. The objective of the ill-fated robbery and attack on the
                    deceased was the same as the previous robberies: to cause the victims to fall
                    down to the ground so as to facilitate the act of robbery. However, on this
                    occasion, there was a further understanding between them that a wooden stick was
                    to be used as a weapon to cause the victim to fall down to the
                ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   Conduct of the accused persons after the robbery and attack
                on the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The conduct of Ellarry <em>after</em> the robbery and attack on the deceased is additional
                    supportive evidence showing that Ellarry and Fabian had the common intention to
                    cause the deceased hurt using the stick so as to cause him to fall down to the
                    ground. If Ellarry did not intend that the deceased be attacked with the stick,
                    it would have been natural for him to have been shocked, angered, scared and
                    disappointed at Fabian for hitting the deceased with the stick. He would have
                    confronted Fabian and asked him why he did what he did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Instead, from Ellarry’s and
                    Fabian’s statements to the police, it is undisputed that they had
                    proceeded to rob another victim together on the same night. They then calmly
                    split the loot and sold the stolen hand phones. At the end of the night, they
                    shared about six bottles of Tiger Beer and thereafter solicited prostitutes in
                    Geylang (see Ellarry’s 3<sup>rd</sup> s 121(1)
                    statement, reproduced at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, and
                    Fabian’s 2<sup>nd</sup> s 121(1) statement,
                    reproduced at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     At trial, Ellarry was cross-examined on why he
                    had not confronted Fabian even though he felt disappointed or angry after Fabian
                    had attacked the deceased with the stick. Ellarry’s only response was that
                    after the robbery, they were “only interested in the loot”, and
                    therefore he did not express his feelings of disappointment or
                        anger.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Once again, I find that this evidence of his
                    at the trial is a clear afterthought. First, I have already found that Ellarry
                    knew and intended that Fabian would use the stick to make their next victim fall
                    down to the ground. Second, if indeed Ellarry was as angry, disappointed and
                    upset as he claimed to be, he would naturally have confronted Fabian. He would
                    not have robbed another victim with Fabian, drunk beer and solicited prostitutes
                    together. The totality of Ellarry’s and Fabian’s conduct after the
                    robbery and attack on the deceased leads to the conclusion that things turned
                    out as they had planned insofar as the deceased had been attacked with the
                    wooden stick. This is further corroborative evidence of their common intention
                    to cause the victim to fall down to the ground so as to rob him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     For the above reasons, it is thus clear that
                    Ellarry and Fabian shared the common intention to hit the deceased with stick so
                    that he would fall down to the ground and thereafter to rob him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   No common intention to cause a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Given the high level of specificity required
                    of the secondary offender’s intent following the decision in <em>Daniel Vijay</em>, which in the case of s 300(<em>c</em>) murder requires proof that the secondary offender
                    specifically intended to cause a s 300(<em>c</em>)
                    injury, the <em>Annual Review of Singapore Cases 2010</em>
                    noted at para 12.56 that the case of <em>Daniel
                    Vijay</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">may be seen as a further step in limiting the circumstances in which
                        criminal responsibility can be attributed to individuals in group crimes.
                            <em>Lee Chez Kee</em> restricted the scope of
                        liability by requiring subjective knowledge (as opposed to constructive
                        knowledge) of the likelihood of the collateral offence being committed.
                            <em>Daniel Vijay</em> now requires no less than
                        proof of an intention to commit the collateral offence. In the scenario
                        presented by <em>Daniel Vijay</em>, Daniel and
                        Christopher must be proved to have a common intention to cause a
                        “section 300(<em>c</em>) injury, and not any
                        other type of injury”: <em>Daniel Vijay</em> at
                        [145].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The <em>Annual Review of
                        Singapore Cases 2010</em> also noted, at para 12.58, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">in practice, “a section 300(<em>c</em>)
                        injury” would generally require an intention to cause death since a
                            s 300(<em>c</em>) injury is one which is
                        sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death: <em>Daniel Vijay</em> at [73] and [146]. <b>The threshold set for a
                            secondary offender is, therefore, raised to that of
                            s 300(</b><b><em>a</em></b><b>) even though he would be held jointly liable for murder under
                            s 300(</b><b><em>c</em></b><b>) read with s 34</b>. [emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    On the facts of the present case, while the
                    Prosecution can prove that Ellarry shared a common intention with Fabian to hit
                    the deceased with the stick to cause him to fall down to the ground, I find that
                    they are unable to prove that Ellarry and Fabian shared the common intention to
                    cause, specifically, a Section 300(<em>c</em>) injury (see
                        <em>Daniel Vijay</em> at [147], reproduced at <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    While I am able to accept that Fabian and
                    Ellarry had the common intention to hit the deceased with the stick so as to
                    cause him to fall down to the ground, it does not necessarily follow that this
                    common intention was a common intention to inflict a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury on the deceased. Adopting the language and
                    reasoning of the Court of Appeal in <em>Daniel Vijay</em>
                    at [147], in the present case the Prosecution has not adduced medical or
                    forensic evidence to show as a <em>scientific fact</em>
                    that hitting a person using the wooden stick with enough force required to cause
                    the person to fall down to the ground is <em>sufficient in the
                        ordinary course of nature to cause death</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Instead, the Prosecution’s submission
                    wrongly conflated the common intention to inflict hurt using the wooden stick so
                    as to cause the victim to fall down to the ground with the common intention to
                    cause a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury to the deceased. The
                    Prosecution has not proved the high degree of specificity required of the
                    secondary offender’s intent following the decision in <em>Daniel Vijay</em>: it had failed to prove that Ellarry had the
                    intention to do the specific criminal act done by Fabian, <em>ie</em> hitting the deceased <em>on the
                        head</em> with the wooden stick to <em>render him
                        unconscious</em>. Ellarry also did not subjectively know that that
                    specific criminal act might likely be committed or that that criminal act would
                    result in a s 300(<em>c</em>) injury to the victim.
                    The Prosecution has only been able to prove that the common intention of Fabian
                    and Ellarry extended only to hitting the deceased with the wooden stick so as to
                    cause him to fall down to the ground and thereafter to rob him. Post-<em>Daniel Vijay</em>, such a finding is insufficient to find
                    Ellarry guilty of s 300(c) murder read with Section 34. As the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Daniel Vijay</em> opined (at [74]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is <em>not</em> sufficient, in
                        our view, for s 34 to apply if the secondary offender merely has
                        subjective knowledge that the victim might likely suffer <em>an injury</em> (or, for that matter, if the
                        secondary offender shares a common intention with the actual doer to inflict
                        an injury on the victim), and that injury is subsequently shown to be of a
                        type which is sufficiently serious to amount to s 300(<em>c</em>) injury.</p>
