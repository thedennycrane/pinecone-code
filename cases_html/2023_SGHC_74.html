The District Judge’s decision is found in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Siang Piow @ Loh Chan Pew</span> [2021] SGMC 16 dated 12 March 2021 (the “GD”), with further reasons contained in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Loh Siang Piow @ Loh Chan Pew</span> [2022] SGMC 13 dated 9 February 2022 (the “Remittal Findings”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Mr Loh is a seasoned track and field coach of considerable reputation and standing in the athletics community in Singapore. At the material time, the complainant, to be referred to as Ms C, was an athlete training with Mr Loh. According to Ms C, Mr Loh molested her under the guise of giving her massages after their individual training sessions on 24 February 2013 and 15 March 2013. I pause to highlight that at that time, there was a prevalent practice in the athletic community for coaches to give trainees massages after intensive training. Mr Loh admits that he had given Ms C such massages once or twice, but he denied the molest allegations. He also sought to provide alibis on the dates of the alleged offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Given that there were <span class="font-italic">no</span> witnesses to the alleged offences, the case largely pitted Ms C’s accusation against Mr Loh’s denial. At the outset, it is critical to emphasise that where a complainant’s uncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for conviction, the court must be persuaded that the complainant’s testimony is “unusually convincing”, such that her testimony, when weighed against all the other available facts, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt.  It should also be borne in mind that whatever view the court may take of the defence, it remains the Prosecution’s burden to prove the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt. With these guiding principles in mind, I turn to consider the merits of the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The facts have been extensively set out in the GD, and I provide a brief overview. At the material time, Mr Loh was 68 years old. He is now 79 years old. Mr Loh joined the Singapore Prison Service in 1965, and he retired as a Deputy Superintendent in 2002. As stated at [2] above, Mr Loh is also a prominent figure in the local track and field scene. In his coaching career spanning 35 years, he had coached 600 to 700 athletes.

She thought it was normal given the prevalent practice of coaches massaging their athletes, and she had received such massages before. He massaged her legs for about five to ten minutes while she was lying in a prone position on a bench along a corridor on the same level as the track beside the spectator’s stand.

Where the appellant seeks to appeal against a finding of fact that hinges on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses based on the demeanour of witnesses, the appellate court would intervene only if the finding of fact can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. An appellate court may also intervene if after taking into account all the advantages available to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is wrong in law and therefore unreasonable: <span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 1 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">ADF</span>”) at [16(a)].<span class="font-italic"> </span>However, where a finding of fact by the trial judge is based on inferences drawn from the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of the witnesses’ testimony or the external consistency between the content of their testimony and the extrinsic evidence, the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial court to assess the veracity of the witnesses’ evidence (<span class="font-italic">ADF </span>at [16(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the District Judge erred in accepting Ms C’s evidence  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of Ms C’s evidence for the first charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I turn to analyse Ms C’s evidence on the substance of the first charge, being her description of the alleged massage on 24 February 2013.

When she did, she used it quite imprecisely to refer to a “part in between the legs”. From her vague answers, it appears unclear whether Ms C’s complaint related to specific contact with the vaginal area, or any other part in between her legs. In this connection, I note that the first charge states that the contact is on the “vulva region”. Therefore, it is not the Prosecution’s case that there was any intrusion into the <span class="font-italic">vagina. </span>That said, based on Ms C’s use of “vagina” in relation to the “part in between [her] legs”, I proceed on the basis that the claimed contact was at the vulva region as particularised in the first charge.

</div> I am mindful that Ms C’s perception of whether the contact was accidental is not wholly determinative of whether Mr Loh had intentionally touched Ms C at the vaginal area, and whether he did so knowing it to be likely that he would outrage her modesty. However, Ms C’s testimony is the <span class="font-italic">only </span>direct evidence upon which the Prosecution had relied on to establish the first charge. The fact that even Ms C could not be certain as to whether Mr Loh had touched her accidentally is cause for caution. The question is whether the elements of the first charge can be safely inferred from Ms C’s narrative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 One possible inference from Ms C’s narrative is that Mr Loh intentionally touched her at the vaginal area under the guise of giving her a massage. However, an equally plausible inference is that Mr Loh was genuinely massaging Ms C’s legs but accidentally brushed against Ms C at the vaginal area when he was massaging Ms C’s thighs. The latter inference is not an unreasonable one and is consistent with the manner of the massage as described by Ms C. Ms C testified that Mr Loh was pressing his fingers on her thighs and moving his hands from the bottom to the top of her thighs. In so doing, it is possible that his thumb could have accidentally come into brief contact with Ms C’s vaginal area, particularly when his hands were massaging Ms C’s upper thighs. This is consistent with Ms C’s testimony that only his thumb came into contact with her vaginal area, while the rest of his fingers remained on her thighs.

</div> The repeated motion of the massage (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>from the bottom to the top of Ms C’s thighs) could have also explained the repetitive brief contact with Ms C’s vaginal area. It bears reminding that it is a little unclear from Ms C’s evidence which part in between her legs she was touched. I should also add that the massage took place over tights which Ms C was wearing. As discussed at [78] below, the “stretchable fabric” might have resulted in Ms C’s impression of pressure being applied at the vaginal area. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With two equally reasonable inferences that can be drawn from Ms C’s description of the incident, with respect, the District Judge’s reliance on Ms C’s testimony in support of the first charge is of concern. As I will go on to elaborate, the difficulties I have with Ms C’s testimony are further exacerbated by the numerous inconsistencies between Ms C’s testimony and her contemporaneous communications with Ms W, Ms Eng and Mr A, as well as her parents’ testimonies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inconsistencies between Ms C’s testimony and the contemporaneous communications </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Contrary to the District Judge’s finding at [14] above, I am of the view that Ms C’s near-contemporaneous communications with Ms W, Mr Ang and Ms Eng do not support Ms C’s testimony that she was molested on 24 February 2013. Indeed, at most, these communications seem to relate to the second charge rather than the first charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, in relation to Ms C’s WhatsApp message to Ms W (see [14(a)] above), the date of the WhatsApp message is 17 March 2013, which is two days <span class="font-italic">after</span> the date of alleged offence in the second charge (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15 March 2013). As a matter of chronology, it is unclear whether Ms C’s complaint to Ms W was made with specific reference to Mr Loh’s actions in relation to the first charge. The timing of her message suggests that it would have been made in relation to the second incident.

It does not support Ms C’s testimony in relation to the first charge in which she alleged that Mr Loh molested her in a public area beside the spectator’s stand, in a “touch-and-move” and “brush and rub” manner. For completeness, Ms C mentioned to Mr A that “it’s <span class="font-italic">always</span> like in a room alone” and that “it kinda got worse, like <span class="font-italic">first few times</span> he just touched”.

</div> Admittedly, these messages appear to refer to previous acts of molest. However, the messages suggest that any previous act of molest happened in a room while she was alone with Mr Loh. The messages do not gel with the evidence she gave in respect of the first charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Furthermore, the insinuation from these messages is that Mr Loh had molested Ms C on <span class="font-italic">many</span> previous occasions, and that it was a pattern for Mr Loh to molest her while she was alone in a room with him. These aspects are inconsistent with Ms C’s testimony that she was molested on <span class="font-italic">only </span>two occasions, <span class="font-italic">one</span> of which occurred in the equipment room. As will be seen below, Ms C’s communications tended <span class="font-italic">not </span>to be consistent with her testimony (including her account for the second charge). I am mindful that the informal communications between friends should be considered in context, and to allow for a degree of inconsistencies within Ms C’s testimony. However, foreshadowing what is to come, in my view, a line has been crossed, and the internal inconsistencies and problematic aspects of her evidence as revealed by these messages tip Ms C’s testimony into the unsatisfactory realm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Reading Ms C and Mr A’s communications in totality, I agree with Mr Loh that after Mr A shared with Ms C that he was homosexual, it appears that Ms C was prompted to reciprocate and share an equally important secret. She may have then exaggerated her discomfort over Mr Loh’s massages and accentuated her vulnerability in an attempt to match the weight of Mr A’s secret. This context undermines the reliability of the contents of the communications with Mr A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I turn to Ms C’s communications with Ms Eng on 2 June 2016. Again, I first set out the context of this set of communications. After Ms C’s exchange with Mr A on 30 March 2013, Ms C testified that she was taken by surprise when Ms Eng approached her at the National Schools Championship 2013 and queried “[Mr A] says you have something to tell me”.

</div> When Ms Eng enquired when this had happened, Ms C says she told Ms Eng “whenever I train with him alone”. When Ms Eng asked about where Mr Loh touched her, Ms C said <span class="font-italic">“</span>well, my legs” and did not give any more explicit details. Ms C said that Ms Eng defended Mr Loh and suggested that the contact had likely been “not on purpose” and that maybe it was because Mr Loh was “so old that he doesn’t understand what the comfort level of a massage should be”.

</div> Ms C did not proceed to disclosure further details on that occasion as she perceived Ms Eng’s apparent defensiveness in issues relating to Mr Loh and because of the long-shared personal history between the two. However, it is worth highlighting that in March 2013, despite being asked specifically about the matter by Ms Eng, Ms C did not disclose any contact by Mr Loh at the vaginal area. Instead, she spoke only about being uncomfortable with the massages on her legs, which would be consistent with Mr Loh’s version of having given “rub down” sessions to her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Three years later, on 2 June 2016, at 3.52pm, Ms C texted Ms Eng to give a more detailed account of what had transpired because she was concerned that a new batch of promising female trainees would be sent to Mr Loh for training.

Indeed, a closer reading of Ms C’s last message in the exchange above suggests that Mr Loh massaged her calves on the first individual training, her upper thighs on the second individual training (presumably when the alleged first offence occurred) and only touched her vaginal area on the last training. These occasions occurred in the equipment room. On that score, her account of the first incident to Ms Eng also differed materially from that alleged in the first charge as to where Mr Loh touched her, and where it took place. I should also point out that in this exchange, Ms C spoke of <span class="font-italic">three </span>and not <span class="font-italic">four </span>individual training sessions with Mr Loh. The inconsistency in relation to the number of individual training sessions is one which I shall return to below at [66]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Notwithstanding the numerous inconsistencies between Ms C’s testimony and her communications with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng as highlighted above, the District Judge relied on these communications in accepting Ms C’s testimony for the first charge. In my view, such reliance is wholly misplaced. For the reasons mentioned above, I am of the view that contrary to the District Judge’s analysis, an analysis of Ms C’s communications with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng about Mr Loh’s conduct do not actually lend support to Ms C’s account of the first charge. In fact, to some extent, they undermine the cogency of her evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inconsistencies between Ms C’s testimony and her parents’ testimony</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Next, I am deeply troubled by the contradiction of Ms C’s evidence by her parents. Ms C testified that after the second individual training, she informed her mother that Mr Loh massaged her during their individual training sessions which made her uncomfortable. Ms C further testified that her mother then asked Ms C’s father to accompany her to the alleged third individual training session.

Had she truly complained to her parents about her discomfort with Mr Loh’s massage on 24 February 2013, it is highly unlikely that <span class="font-italic">both</span> her parents would forget about such a significant complaint. This also bolstered my view that there is no contemporaneous evidence supporting Ms C’s allegation that the alleged molest in the first charge had occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I turn to the District Judge’s treatment of the parents’ evidence. The District Judge did not fault Ms C’s mother for her inability to remember Ms C’s complaints of her discomfort with Mr Loh’s massages, given the effluxion of time between February 2013 and July 2016.

</div> Furthermore, the District Judge found that the inconsistencies between Ms C’s testimony and that of her parents showed that all three family members gave their testimonies independently and eschewed from colluding to render accounts of a “picture-perfect” consistency.

</div> In other words, without discounting Ms C’s evidence on these aspects, the District Judge also forgave the parents’ fallibility in recall. I digress to remark that unfortunately, in my view, the same leniency has not been extended to many of the Defence witnesses’ evidence on account of the lapse of time. For now, the point to be made is that, had Ms C informed them of her complaint, it is highly unlikely that both parents would have completely forgotten about it. This is especially so when Ms C’s mother testified that she would have lodged the complaint years ago had she known about the alleged molest, which demonstrated how seriously Ms C’s mother would have taken issues pertaining to an outrage of her daughter’s modesty. It seems to me that these are material inconsistencies between the evidence of Ms C, and the testimonies of her parents. Not only do these material inconsistencies affect Ms C’s evidence on the first charge, they also taint her evidence on the second charge. In other words, they affected her overall credibility.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ms C’s omission to mention the incident in the first charge in the first information report  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Moving on, I note that even when Ms C made her complaint to the police in 2016, she did not mention the incident in the first charge at all.

</div> Despite the frequency of the group training sessions, it is noteworthy that it was Ms C’s position that there were <span class="font-italic">only</span> four individual training sessions. While I agree with the Prosecution that given the passage of time, certain leeway should be given to Ms C for not being able to pinpoint the precise date and time of the individual training sessions, the lack of specificity is still relevant in an assessment of Ms C’s testimony.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the first charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 To sum up, not only does Ms C’s account suffer from the lack of specificity on the details of the training on 24 February 2013, it also contains a crucial concession that she did not know if Mr Loh’s contact with the vaginal area was an “accidental part of the massage”. In fact, Ms C was not entirely clear where she was touched. Also, Ms C did not specifically raise the incident with Ms W, Mr A or Ms Eng. Indeed, her own messages to them are inconsistent with her account. Ms C claimed to have expressed her discomfort to her parents, and that was why her father accompanied her to the third training session. However, her testimony is not supported by either of her parents. Even if I were to take Ms C’s evidence at its highest, there remains a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr Loh had intentionally touched Ms C at the vulva region over her tights, knowing it to be likely that he would outrage Ms C’s modesty. Therefore, it is plainly wrong for the District Judge to rely on her account to convict Mr Loh of the first charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of Ms C’s evidence for the second charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Unlike the first charge, if Ms C’s account for the second charge were to be accepted, there is no difficulty inferring that the elements under s 354(1) of the Penal Code are established. This is because Ms C testified that Mr Loh’s thumb pressed into her vagina over her tights and continued to rub the area, despite her asking him to stop. However, as I will elaborate below, Ms C’s testimony for the second charge is rife with inherent difficulties, including (a) her change in position in relation to the date of the charge; (b) her inability to recall important details of the second charge; and (c) her conduct after the occurrence of the alleged event.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ms C’s change in position on the date of the second charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Initially, Ms C claimed that the second charge occurred on Sunday, 17 March 2013. On the fifth day of trial, Ms C changed her testimony and claimed that the second charge occurred on Friday, 15 March 2013. The District Judge readily accepted Ms C’s explanation that she had erroneously deduced the date of the second charge based on the dates of her WhatsApp chats with Ms W and Mr A.

Considering Ms C’s initial position that the second charge occurred on 17 March 2013 and her explanation that she informed Ms W immediately that night, it appears to me that at the very least, Ms C had exaggerated her certainty of the date of the second charge and embellished her initial evidence to present a more persuasive case against Mr Loh.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The change of the date meant that the fourth alleged individual training occurred on a Friday instead of a Sunday.

Be that as it may, more importantly, I am troubled by Ms C’s inability to recall other crucial facts in relation to the incident, including the act of molest itself. Not only was Ms C unable to remember (a) the time of the training for the second charge; (b) whether she went to the training after work; and (c) her mode of transport to the training, she was unable to even remember whether the training was in the morning or evening.

</div> Her qualified answers suggest that she was unsure about where exactly Mr Loh touched her, even though she testified that Mr Loh touched her vagina for 10 to 15 seconds on this occasion and caused her to experience an involuntary orgasm. In this regard, I should add that Ms C’s inaccurate references to being touched on the “groin” in WhatsApp messages with Ms W and Mr A (see [47] and [48] above) added to the unsatisfactory state of her evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The District Judge found no reason to fault Ms C for what he described as an “idiosyncratic” account from her. He found that Ms C is “academically brilliant but sexually naive”. He observed that she is an “observant Christian” who attended “convent schools”. He noted that she was “brought up in a conservative and heavily religiously observant background”.

</div> In my view, Ms C’s sexual naivety and conservative upbringing are not sufficient reasons, in themselves, to justify her inability to describe more accurately where she was touched, especially given the serious nature of the second charge. I accept that Ms C was sexually inexperienced. That said, the District Judge should have given more weight to the fact that Ms C was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a young ignorant child. She had completed her A-level examinations at a good junior college. She had studied the anatomy of the female reproductive system in biology classes in school.

</div> As the District Judge acknowledged, she secured a place at the medical faculty in a local university, before deciding to pursue studies in a different professional discipline. By the time of the trial, she was in her twenties. Even if Ms C could not name the anatomical parts intruded upon with accuracy, with the aid of a doll, she should have been able to point out where she was violated in relation to the second charge.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I turn to another aspect of Ms C’s account which I found extremely disconcerting. Initially, Ms C did not attribute the “weird feeling” she experienced during the alleged offence in the second charge as an “orgasm”. It was Mr A who suggested to her that what she had experienced was an “orgasm”. Thereafter, Ms C adopted this as part of her narrative. The District Judge reasoned that it was because of Ms C’s inexperience that she required Mr A to explain to her that she had experienced an orgasm – a known physiological reaction.

</div> However, the Prosecution concedes that it is not their case that what she experienced was physiologically an “orgasm” or that her body was actually moving during the incident. Their submission is that her description shows the intensity of her experience, provided “depth of detail”, and “bears the ring of truth”.

</div> Reluctantly, I disagree with the Prosecution. Like her inaccurate references to various anatomical terms, including “vagina”, I am not persuaded that Ms C used the word “orgasm” with true appreciation of its meaning. Her loose use of the word seems to be, in my view, a form of embellishment. The fact that she attributed the “weird feeling” to an “orgasm” after being prompted by Mr A also suggests, as Mr Loh argues (as set out in [28] above), that her communications with Mr A could have fostered an “echo chamber” which amplified her pre-existing beliefs (mistaken) that she had been molested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 To round off, Ms C claims that she was wearing tights at the material time. The District Judge explained that “the stretchable fabric of [Ms C’s] tights would make it difficult to pin-point exactly where the pressure was being exerted, as the stretch of the fabric would tend to diffuse rubbing and touching sensations”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-b18524ee-65b4-44b5-92fc-92452b23e672" data-toggle="modal" type="button">137</button></sup>

</div> However, by that same reasoning, it is equally plausible that Mr Loh was simply giving Ms C an innocent massage on her thighs and the “stretchable fabric of her tights” caused Ms C to feel pressure being exerted on her vaginal area. This, as Mr Loh surmises, might have led to misunderstanding on her part.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 For completeness, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 486 (“<span class="font-italic">GCK</span>”)<span class="font-italic">, </span>the Court of Appeal cautioned against making generalisations about the victim’s memories of the offence because “an individual’s capacity for observation and memory recall may not always lie on a continuum even when the account in question concerns events occurring within the same episode” (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [113]). I am mindful of this and appreciate that victims of sexual offence may not remember every aspect of their traumatic experience and that alone does not undermine the credibility of their testimony. However, where the victim’s testimony forms the sole basis of the Prosecution’s case, the lack of specificity on important details of the offence may still be relevant in determining whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ms C’s immediate conduct after the alleged offence in the second charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I now turn to the subsequent conduct of Ms C. Immediately after the alleged incident on 15 March 2013, Ms C said that she felt disgusted, and that she cried in private. But after that, she composed herself, and went out for a meal with Mr Loh. Then, at 9.24pm, Ms C posted on her Twitter account: “Prettiest crescent moon so many stars in the sky :)”.

Her inability to recall material details of the second charge and to more accurately describe the exact part of her body that Mr Loh had allegedly touched also affect the cogency of her account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 While I agree with the District Judge that there is no reason for Ms C to fabricate her near-contemporaneous WhatsApp messages with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng, the exchanges must be treated with caution. As I pointed out at [50], [54] and [75] above, Ms C’s messages contain inconsistencies with her version in court about the events. She had also exaggerated aspects of the events, especially to Mr A. Even in court, her account of where she was touched has been unclear, and her account that she allegedly experienced an involuntary orgasm from the violation of her body seemed to be an embellishment (see [77]). Taken together with her apparent state of mind hours after the alleged offence, I am of the view that the District Judge’s reliance on Ms C’s evidence for the second charge is misplaced.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Ms C’s evidence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I now expand on the applicable legal principles for assessing Ms C’s evidence. As alluded to at the outset at [3], it is well-established that in order for an accused to be convicted of an offence based on the complainant’s testimony alone, the complainant’s evidence must be unusually convincing to overcome any doubt that might arise from the lack of corroboration (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan</span> [2019] 2 SLR 490 at [58]; <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]). I pause to observe that subsequent repeated complaints by a victim cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony (<span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [114]). This would apply to Ms C’s complaints in the near-contemporaneous exchanges with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng, as well as her subsequent discussions with Ms W and Mr A.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It should be noted that the “unusually convincing” standard is not a “test”, but rather, a heuristic tool in determining whether the evidence of an uncorroborated witness is sufficient in itself to secure a conviction (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [91]). A complainant’s testimony would be “unusually convincing” if the testimony, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains the ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused” (<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Marnat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 at [28]). In assessing whether a witness’s testimony meets the “unusually convincing” standard, the court must consider the totality of the evidence, including the Defence’s case (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [144]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 That said, the ultimate inquiry that the court has to make is whether the case against an accused has been proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">GCK </span>at [91]). The Court of Appeal at [145], [149(e)] and [149(f)] of <span class="font-italic">GCK</span> held that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">145 Conversely, what the Defence needs to do to bring the Prosecution’s case below the requisite threshold is to point to such evidence that is capable of generating a reasonable doubt … If the Prosecution fails to rebut such evidence, it will necessarily fail in its overall burden of proving the charge against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">We would add that such evidence need not necessarily be raised (in the sense of being </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">asserted, or being made the subject of submissions) by the Defence in order for it to give rise to a reasonable doubt. What matters is that a reasonable doubt arises (in whatever form) from the state of the evidence at the close of the trial.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[149e] The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt can be conceptualised in two ways. First, a reasonable doubt may arise from <span class="font-italic">within the case mounted by the Prosecution</span>. As part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis. Failure to do so may lead to a finding that the Prosecution has failed to mount a case to answer, or to an acquittal. In those situations, the court must nevertheless particularise the specific weaknesses in the Prosecution’s own evidence that irrevocably lowers it below the threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[149](f)] <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Once the court has identified the flaw internal to the Prosecution’s case, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with, because the Prosecution </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">has simply not been able to discharge its overall legal burden.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I have taken pains to elaborate on these legal principles because I want to emphasise that where there are internal flaws in the Prosecution’s case that cast a reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt, the weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily act as a gap-filling device to supplement the Prosecution’s case (see [149(f)] of <span class="font-italic">GCK</span>). I am of the view that the present case is one such instance. As I discussed above, I find that there are inherent weaknesses in Ms C’s testimony in relation to the first and second charges as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) For the first charge, Ms C’s testimony was inconsistent with her communications with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng and with her parents’ testimonies. This undermined the intrinsic and extrinsic consistency of her account. More importantly, Ms C’s testimony is not sufficient, in itself, to establish the elements of the offence especially when she admitted that Mr Loh’s acts could have been accidental. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For the second charge, Ms C’s sudden change in position on the date of the second charge undermined the intrinsic consistency of her testimony. Her inability to recall material details of the second charge and to describe the exact part of her vaginal area that Mr Loh has allegedly touched, as well as her apparent state of mind after the alleged offence, also affect the credibility of her account. The near contemporaneous exchanges with Ms W and Mr A should be treated with caution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 As explained above, I do not agree with the reasons of the District Judge explaining away these material internal and external inconsistencies and disregarding the obviously unsatisfactory aspects of her evidence. With respect, it is plainly wrong, and against the weight of the evidence, for the District Judge to have relied on Ms C’s evidence to convict Mr Loh of the first and second charges. In accordance with the framework set out above, after I analyse certain aspects of the Defence’s case and evaluate the overall circumstances of the case, I will return to consider the issue whether Ms C should be treated as an “unusually convincing witness” at [143] and [148] below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether Mr Loh has proved his alibi defences and whether two of his accounts amounted to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lucas</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Lies</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Burden and standard of proof for defence of alibi</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Before turning to consider the merits of Mr Loh’s alibi defences, I first address the preliminary issue of the burden and standard of proof for the defence of alibi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Mr Loh argues that the District Judge has applied the wrong burden and standard of proof in holding that “it is important to bear in mind that the burden is on the defence to establish an alibi on a balance of probabilities”

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  GD at [227] and [332]. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Loh argues that he only needs to raise a reasonable doubt that he was not at Tampines Stadium at the material time of the alleged offences. He relies on <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul Aziz</span> in which the Court of Criminal Appeal held that “where the accused raises an alibi, the burden of proving the alibi is on the accused but this is only an evidential burden… the defence need only raise a reasonable doubt” (at [35]). This was subsequently followed by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ramakrishnan</span>, where the court held that “an acquittal must follow from reasonable doubt that the appellant might have been elsewhere at the material time” (at [34]). This was further endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o Mourthi and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 105 (“<span class="font-italic">Vignes</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [62]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Prosecution argues that an accused bears the burden to prove his alibi on a balance of probabilities under s 105 of the EA. Section 105 of the EA provides that the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless otherwise provided by any law. Illustration (b) provides that “B wishes the court to believe that at the time in question he or she was elsewhere. B must prove it”. Further, the Prosecution highlights that by s 107 of the EA, an accused has the <span class="font-italic">legal burden</span> to prove defences set out in the Penal Code on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Jayasena v The Queen </span>[1970] 2 WLR 448 (“<span class="font-italic">Jayasena</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat v Public Prosecutor and other matters</span> [2017] 1 SLR 505 (“<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat</span>”)). The Prosecution argues that for consistency, the same interpretation should be extended to s 105 of the EA, and the accused bears the legal burden to prove the alibi defence on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 That said, the Prosecution acknowledges the differing positions in <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul Aziz</span> and <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span> where the court held that the burden of proof on the accused for an alibi defence is only an evidential burden. The Prosecution submits that to reconcile the two strands of cases, the approach proposed in Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence</span><span class="font-italic"> and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 7th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span>”) should be adopted. The learned author proposed that the seemingly inconsistent positions can be reconciled by having regard to the Prosecution’s and accused’s roles in separate stages of the proceeding as follows (<span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> at [12.018]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the prosecution has to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy each element of the charge, including evidence that the accused was at the scene of the crime. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If, and only if, the prosecution adduces sufficient evidence to this effect so that the court determines that the accused has a case to answer, the accused will then have to prove his alibi on a balance of probabilities pursuant to s 105 of the EA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if the accused fails to prove his alibi on a balance of probabilities, the accused may still be in a position to raise a reasonable doubt concerning his presence at the scene of the crime. For example, although the witness giving evidence of alibi may not satisfy the court that the accused was with him at the time of the crime, the facts may emerge from his testimony which raise a reasonable doubt in respect of the Prosecution’s evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In my view, the present state of the law is clear, and it is that set out in <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul Aziz </span>and <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span>. The cases of <span class="font-italic">Jayasena </span>and <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat</span> relied upon by the Prosecution pertain to the interpretation of s 107 of the EA which deal with the defences found in the “general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the Penal Code, or in any law defining the offence”. Section 107 of the EA does not deal with the defence of alibi. Therefore, unlike <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul Aziz </span>and <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span>, the holdings in <span class="font-italic">Jayasena </span>and <span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat</span> do not specifically apply to the defence of alibi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defence of alibi overlaps with the Prosecution’s duty to prove <span class="font-italic">actus re</span><span class="font-italic">us</span> under s 103 of the EA. It is trite law that the Prosecution is required to establish the elements of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt. It follows that if an accused is able to raise a reasonable doubt as to his presence at the scene of an alleged offence, he ought to be acquitted. In the present case, in accordance with <span class="font-italic">Syed Abdul Aziz </span>and <span class="font-italic">Vignes</span>, Mr Loh only bears an evidential burden, and an acquittal must follow should reasonable doubt be raised that at the material time, he was not at Tampines Stadium, but might have been elsewhere. By applying the standard of balance of probabilities in relation to Mr Loh’s alibi defences, the District Judge fell into error by applying the wrong legal test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 With that said, the Prosecution argues that even on the lower threshold, Mr Loh has not adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt that he was not at Tampines Stadium because he was somewhere else at the material time of the offences. I now consider whether Mr Loh has discharged his evidential burden in relation to his alibi defences for 24 February 2013 and 15 March 2013. For this purpose, it bears reminding that Ms C’s evidence is that each individual training session lasted about 1½ hours. Each session took place either in the morning starting at about 9am to 10am or in the evening starting at about 4pm to 5pm. But for the fourth training session, eventually, she said it took place in the evening (see [73] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Loh’s alibi on 24 February 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Loh says that on 24 February 2013, he was celebrating <span class="font-italic">Chap Goh Meh</span> with his extended family.

</div> Upon perusing the GD, with due respect, it seemed to me that there was a stark contrast between the District Judge’s treatment of the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses <span class="font-italic">vis</span> the Defence’s witnesses. While the District Judge generally forgave some of the Prosecution’s witnesses, including Ms C’s parents, for not being able to recall details due to the lapse of time (for instance, see above at [60]), the same latitude had simply not been extended to these Defence witnesses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 With that being said, I agree with the Prosecution that even on the lower threshold <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>to raise a reasonable doubt, Mr Loh could still have been at the Tampines Stadium on 24 February 2013, especially in the late morning or late afternoon, to conduct a training session for Ms C. Although Mr Loh’s wife testified that Mr Loh accompanied her for marketing in the morning, the evidence regarding the time Mr Loh returned home was not clear. Furthermore, neither Mr Loh’s wife nor Mr Loh’s brother could testify that Mr Loh did not leave the home in the late morning or late afternoon. Given that Tampines Stadium was situated just one MRT stop from Mr Loh’s home in Pasir Ris, Mr Loh could have gone to Tampines Stadium, and then returned home to continue with his <span class="font-italic">Chap Goh Mei </span>obligations. Therefore, I am prepared to accept the Prosecution’s contention that there was a lack of evidence that Mr Loh was at home that day in the late morning or late afternoon. Mr Loh has not raised a reasonable doubt that he could not have been at Tampines Stadium, by showing that he might have been at home at the material time.

However, Ms Jayalaxmi and Ms Amirah were consistent in their testimony that there was a “light” training session on 15 March 2013 for the team to practice their “baton passing” for the SPH Schools Relay that weekend. Both witnesses were certain of the date of the “light” training because 15 March 2013 was two days before the SPH Schools Relay on 17 March 2013. Both also specifically testified that one of the main reasons for the “light” training was to prepare Alex, who was a cross-country athlete competing in “4 by 4” event for the first time that year. In these important aspects, Ms Jayalaxmi’s and Ms Amirah’s accounts are internally and externally consistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The District Judge, however, preferred Mr Chan’s testimony over that of Ms Jayalaxmi and Ms Amirah. In accepting Mr Chan’s testimony that Friday trainings were replaced with Tuesday trainings for the first quarter of 2013, the District Judge discounted the credibility of Ms Jayalaxmi’s and Ms Amirah’s accounts on the ground that they could not remember the change in training days. However, I am of the view that Mr Chan’s testimony does not necessarily contradict the testimonies of Ms Jayalaxmi and Ms Amirah. Their evidence was that there was “light” training session on 15 March 2013, not an official training session. Therefore, even if there had been a change in the official training dates, Mr Chan’s testimony should not have a material impact on the credibility of Ms Jayalaxmi’s and Ms Amirah’s accounts. In a similar vein, the fact that the unofficial training session was not recorded on Mr Loh’s payment form and Ms Jayalaxmi’s attendance sheet does not undermine Ms Jayalaxmi’s and Ms Amirah’s credibility.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I am also of the view that the District Judge was hasty in dismissing Mr Terry Tan’s testimony. While I agree with the District Judge’s observations that Mr Terry Tan made a circuitous trip to pick Mr Loh to discuss a problem which could have been discussed over the phone, this alone does not render Mr Terry Tan’s account unbelievable. It is entirely possible that Mr Terry Tan made a circuitous trip to send Mr Loh home out of their friendship, or out of respect or gratitude towards Mr Loh for listening to his problems. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Against the evidence of these witnesses, I note that there are the WhatsApp messages between Ms C and Mr Toh on 15 March 2013 to support Ms C’s version. To recapitulate, Mr Toh asked Ms C at 9.47am on 15 March 2013 whether Mr Loh would be conducting any training at Bishan Stadium, to which Ms C responded “<span class="font-italic">Tampines !!!</span>” sometime later at 1.53pm. As understood by the District Judge, Ms C’s subsequent message at 3.26pm was that while Mr Loh had advised Zaki, Ms W and her to rest, she had resolved to attend as she had missed two days’ training.

</div> This somewhat contradicts Ms C’s account that Mr Loh had invited her to attend four <span class="font-italic">one-on-one</span> training sessions with him (see [6] and [70] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 It seems to me that based on the evidence of his witnesses, Mr Loh has raised a reasonable doubt that he was not at the Tampines Stadium, but might have been elsewhere, in the afternoon of 15 March 2013. However, even if the District Judge was correct to reject the alibi defence, there is little basis for the District Judge to proceed to find that this amounted to a <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>Lie. In <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>, the court held that lies told by an accused person might be capable of amounting to corroboration if they were (a) deliberate; (b) related to a material issue; (c) premised upon a motive of realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and (d) proved independently to be untrue. In the present case, even if Mr Loh failed to prove his alibi defence, there is insufficient evidence to show that his alibi was a deliberate lie. Given that Mr Loh’s alibi on 15 March 2013 was supported by Ms Jayalaxmi, Ms Amirah and Mr Terry Tan, a finding that Mr Loh has deliberately lied in his alibi will necessarily implicate the witnesses, suggesting that they were lying in their testimonies to support Mr Loh’s account of events. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 While the District Judge disagreed with the versions of Ms Jayalaxmi, Ms Amirah and Mr Terry Tan of the events on 15 March 2013, the District Judge did not specifically find that they were lying to the court. I agree with this. Although the individuals know and respect Mr Loh and could not be said to be completely impartial witnesses, their accounts are largely consistent and not inherently unbelievable (see above at [110] to [112]). Furthermore, Ms Jayalaxmi and Mr Terry Tan are working adults with responsible jobs. She was a teacher for many years, and he is a senior officer with the Singapore Prison Service. At the time of the trial, Ms Amirah was a second-year undergraduate at a local university. There is simply no reason offered as to why any of them would <span class="font-italic">lie</span> to help Mr Loh. Given that by the time of the trial, five years had elapsed since 15 March 2013, should their evidence be unsatisfactory in certain aspects, some leeway should be given to these Defence witnesses, as well as Mr Loh, for their inability to recall what exactly transpired that day (and the exact timings of those events). This is especially since Ms C had actually changed her position as to the date of the alleged incident and was unable to clearly testify whether the alleged incident took place in the morning or the afternoon until in cross-examination. The District Judge has relied on the passage of time as a justification for several inconsistencies in the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses, and I am of the view that the District Judge should have extended the same consideration to the Defence witnesses, including Mr Loh, in relation to similar types of inconsistencies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mr Loh’s account of events of 10 March 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For completeness, Mr Loh also provided evidence in relation to the third alleged individual training session (see [10(c)] above) to prove that he had never conducted any individual training sessions for Ms C. Given that nothing untoward happened on this occasion, this was strictly speaking not an alibi defence. Nonetheless, the District Judge rejected this alibi and found that it amounted to a <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> Lie, reasoning that (a) Mr Loh and Mr Tan WL could not name any one person they saw or met at the Swift Event despite Mr Loh’s prominent status in the athletic scene; and (b) both of them could not recall the evening rain that day, as evidenced by the meteorological report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118  I will only spend a moment to discuss the District Judge’s finding that Mr Loh’s evidence amounted to a <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> Lie. Once again, there was no specific finding by the District Judge that Mr Tan WL was lying in his testimony to the court. Indeed, some leniency should be extended to Mr Tan WL, as well as Mr Loh, for their inability to identify other attendees of the Swift Event given that more than five years have elapsed by the time of the trial. While the District Judge faulted Mr Loh and Mr Tan WL for their inability to remember a spell of rain that started from 5pm and persisted till 9pm,

</div> The two men should not be faulted, or Mr Loh treated as having lied, for failing to recall a spell of rain while they were at the coffee shop that occurred more than five years ago.

The District Judge erred by imposing the burden on Mr Loh to establish the alibi defences on a balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In relation to the alibi defence for 24 February 2013, contrary to the position taken by the District Judge, I am prepared to accept the evidence of Mr Loh’s wife and brother. However, I agree with the Prosecution that the alibi defence is not made out even on the lower threshold to raise a reasonable doubt. Based on the evidence of Mr Loh’s wife and brother, Mr Loh could still have been at the Tampines Stadium, particularly in the late morning or late afternoon that day. That said, I agree with the District Judge that Mr Loh’s alibi defence did not amount to a <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> Lie so as to provide support for the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 For the alibi defence for 15 March 2013, as supported by the evidence of Mr Loh’s witnesses, namely, Ms Jayalaxmi, Ms Amirah and Mr Terry Tan, I am of the view that Mr Loh has raised a reasonable doubt that he was not at the Tampines Stadium, but might have been elsewhere that afternoon. Even if the District Judge was correct to reject the alibi defence, I am of the view that he erred in proceeding to find that this amounted to a <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>Lie. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 As for Mr Loh’s evidence of 10 March 2023, again, it seems to me that the District Judge was too hasty to dismiss the evidence put forth by Mr Loh and Mr Tan WL. In any case, there was inadequate basis to rule that there is a <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>Lie which corroborates the Prosecution’s case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether Mr Loh’s conduct at the police meeting on 2 August 2016 indicated his guilty conscience</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Another very key plank the District Judge relied on in convicting Mr Loh on both charges was the fact that Mr Loh gathered photographs he took with Ms C and Ms W before he attended at the police station before Station Inspector Alan Khor (“SI Khor”) for the recording of his statement on 2 August 2016. The District Judge took the view that Mr Loh’s conduct suggests that he knew the identities of his accusers, and the period of the commission of the offences, even before his statement was recorded by SI Khor.

</div> The District Judge’s main reason for believing IO Goh’s account is that IO Goh was an experienced investigation officer of 28 years standing, and it was improbable that he could have gone against what “must have been the most sacrosanct and hard wired tenets that investigation officers presumably adhered to” so as to reveal the identities of the complainants to the alleged offender.

In the face of the objective contemporaneous evidence, IO Goh’s experience as an investigation officer is insufficient ground for disbelieving Mr Loh altogether. Indeed, I note that prior to being shown his phone records, IO Goh had said that he called Ms W ten minutes <span class="font-italic">before </span>calling Mr Loh, but not <span class="font-italic">after </span>contacting Mr Loh.

</div> He reasoned that Ms W was likely to have been confused by an earlier call she had received that morning from Ms T, another trainee under Mr Loh. During this call, Ms W was confronted by Ms T on whether she made a police report against Mr Loh. The District Judge reasoned that Ms W might have conflated Ms T’s confrontation with the fact that IO Goh had disclosed the names of the complainants to Mr Loh, and “misrepresented the actual state of affairs”. This is because Ms W had “a history of making loose situational connections”. For instance, she mistook Mr A for Ms C’s boyfriend. With respect, the District Judge’s explanation appears to be purely speculative. While he explained that “we are none the wiser as Ms W was never examined in this area when she gave her testimony”, there is nothing to suggest that Ms W made such a mistake. On the face of it, this message sent by Ms C is plain and unambiguous. The message mentions both (a) the call from the police informing Ms W about the leakage of their identities; and (b) the call from Ms T confronting Ms W about the police report, as two <span class="font-italic">distinct </span>events. It seems unlikely, therefore, that Ms W (or Ms C) would have conflated the two incidents. Based on the above, I am inclined to believe that IO Goh might have disclosed the identities of the complainants to Mr Loh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 After the District Judge’s treatment of this aspect of the evidence, Mr Loh sought to adduce Ms Monteiro’s testimony. Ms Monteiro filed a statutory declaration stating that she was with Mr Loh when the police called Mr Loh. Given that the District Judge had given little weight to Ms Monteiro’s testimony in the Remittal Findings, I turn now to consider Ms Monteiro’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Ms Monteiro was one of Mr Loh’s trainees who met Mr Loh when she was 16 years old and trained under Mr Loh while she was in junior college.

For completeness, I should state that I find that the District Judge wrongly found that Mr Loh was already aware of the “proximate date and time of the offence” well before the session to take his statement on 2 August 2016. In this connection, the District Judge focused on the fact that Mr Loh produced a photograph of Ms C’s birthday celebration in April 2013, the month after the alleged molests in March 2013.

</div> However, it should be noted that Mr Loh only trained Ms C for a few months. If he had been informed by the police that Ms C had lodged a complaint against him for molest, there was only a limited range of dates in which the alleged offences could have occurred.  Furthermore, Mr Loh had provided a number of photographs to the police on 2 August 2016.

</div>
</div> It is wrong to focus on one specific photograph in April 2013 and conclude that Mr Loh knew the approximate timing of the alleged offences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Therefore, I fail to see how it can be said that Mr Loh’s conduct at the police meeting on 2 August 2016 was pre-emptive or indicative of his guilty mind. Accordingly, I find that the District Judge erred in relying on such an inference of Mr Loh’s “guilty conscience” to convict Mr Loh of the charges. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether Ms C is an unusually convincing witness </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Having considered both the Prosecution’s and Defence’s case, I now return to the overarching question as to whether Ms C is an unusually convincing witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I begin with the context. It bears reminding that as a coach, Mr Loh provided massages to athletes. Mr Loh admitted to giving Ms C massages once or twice, and Ms C accepted that there was this prevalent practice amongst coaches. Against this backdrop, Ms C’s testimony is that Mr Loh then took advantage of her. However, assessed as a whole, her accounts of both the incidents were not cogent, and were lacking in relation to the material details of the alleged acts of molest (which went beyond the boundaries of normal massages after intensive training). For the first charge, she was unclear where the contact occurred, saying that “vagina” was “the part in between the legs”. She also said the contact could have been accidental. Her failure to identify the exact part of her body that Mr Loh has allegedly touched for the second charge, and her embellishment as to its effects <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, that she experienced an orgasm</span>, were unsatisfactory. As expressed in the near-contemporaneous WhatsApp messages with Ms W, Mr A and Ms Eng, she was generally uncomfortable with the massages. But that is not the crux of the charges. For the reasons explained above, her complaints in the WhatsApp messages about the acts of molest (which went beyond the normal massages) must be treated with caution. Taken together with her immediate conduct after the second charge, I have grave hesitation in relying on Ms C’s testimony that she was touched at the vulva region. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I also add that Ms C continued to attend group training sessions with Mr Loh until August 2013. In May 2013, she sought his advice on which university course to pursue. On 28 February 2015, she also attended a social gathering with Mr Loh. While it is the Prosecution’s position that Ms C had taken precautions by avoiding any other individual training sessions with Mr Loh, such subsequent conduct remains somewhat incongruent with the allegations made against Mr Loh, especially in relation to the second charge. Despite all these unsatisfactory aspects of the Prosecution’s case, individually and collectively, the District Judge nonetheless assessed them not to affect the strength of Ms C’s testimony. With due respect, I find this evaluation to be wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 For completeness, I deal with the question whether Ms C had any intention to frame Mr Loh. Ms C lodged the FIR on 30 June 2016. Ms C had read a newspaper report about a coach being accused of molest. Thinking the offender could be Mr Loh, she decided to lodge the police report because she was worried that other new trainees might suffer her plight while training under Mr Loh. However, as it transpired, the newspaper report concerned a different coach. What I find troubling is that Ms C’s communications with Ms W at that time revealed some strongly worded condemnation of sexual offenders in general. If Ms C had misunderstood Mr Loh’s conduct in 2013, there is the distinct possibility that over the three years, this misunderstanding might have deepened (especially after more conversations with Ms W and Mr A with whom she had continued to confide in). Unfortunately, I could not discount the possibility that there was a build-up of mistrust towards Mr Loh over the three years. Precipitated by the newspaper report, and coupled with her strong sentiments against sexual offenders, the complaint was eventually made in 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I note that even during her examination-in-chief on 24 January 2018, Ms C continued to express her strong condemnation of sexual offenders:

He noted that “[i]t would however have helped the coherence of the defence case had there been a clearly articulate motive on the part of Ms C”.

</div> While I do not disagree with the District Judge that there is no evidence that Ms C had any malicious intention to frame Mr Loh, there is the real concern discussed which, as Mr Loh points out, has not been considered by the District Judge (see [28] above). In my view, this lack of a motive to frame Mr Loh is, at best, a neutral factor in the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As the Prosecution’s case contains a reasonable doubt as to Mr Loh’s guilt, I reiterate that Mr Loh should be acquitted of both offences for this reason alone. At the risk of repetition, the weaknesses in Mr Loh’s defence cannot ordinarily shore up the Prosecution’s case. In any event, as I have found above, none of the Mr Loh’s alibis amounted to <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> Lies that can corroborate the Prosecution’s case. In relation to the second charge, Mr Loh has shown a reasonable doubt as to his presence at Tampines Stadium on 15 March 2013. Also, there should not be an inference of a guilty mind drawn against Mr Loh by virtue of his conduct during the statement recording on 2 August 2016. Having analysed Ms C’s evidence against the entirety of the case, I am of the view that Ms C is not an unusually convincing witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Whether the Prosecution has breached its disclosure obligations under </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Kadar </span><span class="font-weight-bold">or </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nabill</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Given my findings above, it is not necessary for me to address Mr Loh’s arguments on the Prosecution’s breach of its disclosure obligations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Before I conclude, I return to the fact that at the material time, there was a prevalent practice in the athletic community for coaches to give trainees massages after intensive training. If the practice remains today, the community, including the coaches, should rethink and review the appropriateness of such a practice. Should this continue to be a necessary practice, there should be proper safeguards adopted to minimise the potential for any abuse by the coaches of trainees, or in some cases, to prevent genuine misunderstandings between coaches and trainees in the conduct of the massages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In respect of the present appeal, I appreciate that this has been a long and protracted trial, with its twists and turns, with the testimonies of many witnesses to assess, and much information to sift through. Indeed, the District Judge took care to provide his reasons in detail. That said, the District Judge tended to resolve all doubts, discrepancies and contradictions in favour of the Prosecution. In the final analysis, the serious doubts as to the veracity of Ms C’s allegations cannot be dismissed. Accordingly, I find that the District Judge has erred in finding that the Prosecution has proved the elements of the first and second charges beyond a reasonable doubt. I allow the appeal and acquit Mr Loh on both charges.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng <br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Chee Meng SC, Paul Loy Chi Syann and Calvin Ong Yik Lin (WongPartnership LLP) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gail Wong, Susanna Abigail Yim and Colin Ng (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-center"> </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
