For this Suit, I note that prior to his counsel informing this court at the end of the first day of trial, there had been no indication from Spackman that he would not be appearing. A witness schedule had been prepared in advance by both parties, which allocated two days of trial time to Spackman. He did not provide any good reason for the sudden absence. His counsel informed that “we have looked at the evidence and it is very likely that Mr Spackman will not be turning up”.

</div> is supported by <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span> in which the court held at [43] that “in order for a <span class="font-italic">foreign judgment to give rise to issue estoppel</span> … the decision on the specific issue that is said to be the subject matter of the estoppel must be <span class="font-italic">final and conclusive under the law of the foreign judgment’s originating jurisdiction</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Spackman also submits that his position is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span>, in which the court held at [14] that a judgment is “final and conclusive” when it can be shown that in the court by which it was pronounced, the judgment conclusively, finally, and forever established the existence of the debt. The court in <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span> further held at [16] that the fact that the judgment may be altered or varied on appeal would not render it any less final or conclusive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In this regard, both Woo’s Korean law expert, Professor Yune (“Yune”) and Spackman’s Korean law expert, Mr Kim Jae Seung (“Kim”), agreed that the SHC could not vary or set aside its own judgment. Following from this, Spackman submits that the SHCJ was “final and conclusive” when it was pronounced, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 29 September 2011. Thus, the enforcement of the SHCJ is time-barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 With respect, I find this to be a very strained submission that is contrary to what is plainly stated in <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span>, <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati</span> and <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span>. As clearly explained in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69], there are two aspects to finality. The first aspect of finality applies when <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>is being invoked in respect of a domestic or a foreign judgment. In relation to this first aspect, <span class="font-italic">The Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati </span>has held that a final decision is one which cannot be varied, re-opened or set aside by the court that delivered it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, as <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> at [70] makes clear, there is a second aspect of finality where a foreign judgment is concerned. From the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> cited above, it is clear that both <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span> and <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>are consistent and clear in stating that where a foreign judgment is concerned, finality is assessed by asking whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would regard it as final and conclusive. Indeed, both decisions cite the same <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> of Lord Reid in <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span> (at 919) that it would “verge on absurdity that we should regard as conclusive something in a [foreign] judgment which the [foreign] courts themselves would not regard as conclusive”:<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span> at [15] and <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Furthermore, while <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span> stated at [16] that the fact that a judgment may be altered or varied on appeal would not render it any less final or conclusive, this was preceded by [15] where it pointed to the need to consider what the foreign courts would consider conclusive. In addition, it is clear from [27] of <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span> that the court in<span class="font-italic"> </span>took into consideration the evidence on Japanese law. There, the court noted that the evidence on Japanese law on the nature of the Tokyo judgment was not disputed between the parties. It was regarded as being <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> between the parties. This was sufficient for the court to arrive at a conclusion as to the finality of the Tokyo judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I also find Spackman’s reliance on the reference in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> (at [70]) to <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati</span> to be misplaced. <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> was referring there to <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> Bunga Melati</span>’s affirmation of Lord Reid’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Carl</span><span class="font-italic"> Zeiss</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that it would “verge on absurdity” to regard as conclusive something in a foreign judgment which the foreign court would not regard as conclusive, and that this was a principled approach which applies in Singapore. Contrary to Spackman’s submission, <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati</span> at [86] reinforces the position that where a foreign judgment is concerned, finality is assessed by whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would regard it as final and conclusive. Indeed, the court in <span class="font-italic">The Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati </span>emphasised at [86] that in determining whether a foreign judgment was final and conclusive, “the court must be extra-sensitive, in particular, to ‘the intention of the [foreign] judge in the earlier proceedings’”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As rightly observed by Woo, this has also been the position in other Singapore authorities.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 545 (“<span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal</span>”), the plaintiff sought to enforce a judgment from the Suzhou Intermediate Court. The court referred at [66] to three authorities and noted that they stood for the proposition that: “[F]oreign law (and not the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span>) determines whether a foreign judgment is final and conclusive for the purposes of recognition and enforcement”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Eleven Gesellschaft </span><span class="font-italic">Zur Entwicklung Und Vermarktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH v Boxsentry Pte Ltd</span> [2014] SGHC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Eleven</span>”), the plaintiff sought to enforce a Berlin default judgment. The court (at [92]) cited <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6(2) (Butterworths Asia, 2013 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span>”), which states at paras 75.157–75.158 that: </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">The judgment must be final and conclusive under the law of its originating jurisdiction; the judgment must be <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> between the parties under that law, ie, it must make a final determination of rights between the parties …</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"> … <span class="font-italic">Finality of a default judgment is tested by its effect under the law of the originating jurisdiction</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">so that it is necessary </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to determine the effect of the default judgment under the foreign law </span>… </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The same position has also been taken in the English case cited by Spackman, <span class="font-italic">Nouvion</span><span class="font-italic"> v Freeman</span> (1889) LR 15 AC 1. In Lord Ashbourne’s concurring opinion (at 18), he held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it would be, I venture to think, a very startling result if in this country we should hold [the remate judgment] to be final and conclusive, while in the municipal institutions of the country which has sent out this judgment, it would not even be regarded as res judicata … It strikes my mind as being to the last degree surprising to listen to a suggestion that when the laws of Spain do not regard this judgment as of such a binding character that it can be relied upon in any proceeding as res judicata, the very minute the intervention of a foreign country is invoked, it becomes so sacrosanct that it is to be regarded by us as final and conclusive. It appears to be almost a contradiction in terms to make such a suggestion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The examination of the above authorities also reveals that there is no merit to Spackman’s submission that <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> and <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span> were only concerned with issue estoppel and not the recognition of foreign judgments. This is clear from a reading of [67]–[70] of <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>, which held that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the tests for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are the same (at [67]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) as a starting point, the foreign judgment must be final and conclusive on the merits (at [68]); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that there are two aspects to finality (at [69]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) where a foreign judgment is concerned, the second aspect of finality is to be assessed by asking whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would itself regard it as final and conclusive (at [70]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Neither does <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span> make the distinction that Spackman submits for. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> recognized at [70], while the observations in <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span> (at 919) were made in the context of issue estoppel, in the court’s view, they are equally applicable when considering the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span> at [43], which Spackman cites, also does not support his proposition that the second aspect of finality in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span> at [70] and the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in <span class="font-italic">Carl Zeiss</span>, is limited to issue estoppel arising from a foreign judgment. At [43], the court in <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span> referred to <span class="font-italic">Mad Atelier International BV v Manes </span>[2020] EWHC 1014 (Comm), an English decision which held that for a foreign judgment to be considered final and conclusive, the foreign legal system in question had to have either a doctrine of issue estoppel covering the issues dealt with in the foreign judgment, or a doctrine with the same underlying basis and operation. The court underscored “the need to be alive to inter-jurisdictional differences, and to consider the expert evidence, if available, on what precisely the position is under the law of the foreign jurisdiction in question”. Nowhere in <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span> was it stated that the importance of considering foreign law is limited to cases involving issue estoppel and not similarly applicable in the context of enforcing a foreign judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Spackman also submits that his position is supported by the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris and Collins</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Conflict of Laws </span>vol 1 (Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>”). However, even in the treatment of Rule 42 in <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span> at para 14-023, the learned authors state: “The test of finality is the treatment of the judgment by the foreign tribunal as a <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span><span class="font-italic">.</span>” This supports the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>, that there are two aspects of finality and that where there is a foreign judgment, assessment is to be made by whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would itself regard it as final and conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Spackman submits that there is a difference between Rule 42 and Rule 48 of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>. I find that the differences between the two rules do not affect the above analysis. I agree with Woo that Rule 48 relates to the effect or result of recognising or enforcing a foreign judgment. <span class="font-italic">Dicey </span>explains at paras 14-123 and 14-125 that where a judgment is final and conclusive, and in addition, there is identity of parties and identity of subject matter, that foreign judgment is “conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon” and not merely a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence of the matters therein decided”. Rule 48 of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span> does not detract from the test for a foreign judgment being “final and conclusive” as set out at Rule 42 of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In summary, I find that the law is clear, as set out in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70], that finality of a foreign judgment is to be assessed by asking whether the foreign court rendering the judgment would itself regard it as final and conclusive. This is consistent with <span class="font-italic">Bellezza</span><span class="font-italic">, The</span> <span class="font-italic">Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>, and is also the position taken in <span class="font-italic">Giant Light Metal</span> and <span class="font-italic">Eleven</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn next to consider whether the SHC would have regarded the SHCJ as final and conclusive when rendered. Both experts agreed that under Korean law, a Korean judgment becomes “final” when it is no longer amendable by the same court. Such a “final” judgment becomes conclusive <span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>) when the decision is either no longer subject to further appeal or all the appeals have been resolved. Thus, in both experts’ view, the SHCJ only became “final and conclusive” when the KSC rendered its decision in the KSCJ on 31 October 2013. Until then, a party could continue to raise arguments on the matters decided in the SHCJ, in another Korean proceeding before the same or different court. In other words, the matters were not <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> until the KSC’s determination on 31 October 2013 rendering the KSCJ.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In this case, it is undisputed that the SHCJ could have been provisionally executed, pursuant to Order 4 of the SHCJ. Spackman submits that the fact that the SHCJ was provisionally enforceable, means that it was enforceable on pronouncement. Yune opined that the fact that the SHCJ could be “provisionally executed” meant that the SHCJ was not “final and conclusive” under Korean law because the judgment is still not <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. If the judgment of the lower court that was “provisionally” executed is overturned on appeal to the KSC, the effect of the provisional execution would be reversed. The judgment creditor of the overturned judgment would be ordered to return any asset seized pursuant to the provisional execution order and compensate for damages caused (including all damages caused by the provisional execution). The rationale for this procedure, was to prevent the losing party from filing a baseless appeal and causing unjust delay to the prevailing party’s enforcement of rights based on a winning judgment. I observe that the order for provisional enforcement did not affect either expert’s view that the SHCJ became “final and conclusive” when the KSC rendered the KSCJ. Kim did not differ from Yune on this. Spackman also accepts that there is a little difference between the Korean law experts’ position on this.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Therefore, taking into consideration Yune and Kim’s expert opinion that the SHCJ only became “final and conclusive” when the KSC rendered the KSCJ, I find that the period of limitation for enforcing the SHCJ began to run from the date of the KSCJ, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 31 October 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I note that such an interpretation is also broadly in line with the position under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) (“REFJA”). Section 4(1) of the REFJA provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for, and effect of, registration of foreign judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>—(1)  A person, being a judgment creditor under a judgment to which this Part applies, may apply to the General Division of the High Court at any time — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) within 6 years after the date of the judgment; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">where there have been proceedings by way of appeal against the judgment, after the date of the last judgment given in those proceedings</span>, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">to have the judgment registered in the General Division of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 While different regimes apply to enforcement of foreign judgments under common law and under REFJA, the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span> at [37], albeit in the context of defences to the recognition of foreign judgments, are nevertheless relevant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 … the common law should … generally be developed in a manner that is compatible and consistent with legislation [such as REFJA] which covers a broadly similar area. This rests on the notion that the recognising court may and, indeed, ordinarily should have due regard to legislative developments in coming to its conclusion on the appropriate balance to strike between comity, international relations and the need to aid in the development of a transnational system of justice, while also safeguarding the rule of law within its jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Following from the above, I find that Woo is not time-barred under <br/>s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) LA from enforcing the SHCJ. Consequently, it is not necessary to address the issue of whether Woo is entitled to rely on s 29(1)(b) LA to “extend” the limitation period.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the SHCJ is a judgment on merits </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, Spackman submits that the SHCJ cannot be enforced as it is not a judgment on the merits. Spackman cites <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat </span>at [13]–[14] as authority for this requirement. I note that the requirement for a judgment to be on the merits is not explicitly mentioned there. Neither was there such an explicit requirement in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span><span class="font-italic"> v Les Placements Germain Gauthier Inc </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee</span>”). The court there held at [12] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 … it is settled law that a foreign judgment <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> given by a foreign court of court of competent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as the foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. The foreign judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached for any error, whether of fact or of law. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In addition, Rule 42 of <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span>, which Spackman cites, also does not contain such a requirement. It states that a foreign judgment may be enforced for the amount under it, if the judgment is for a debt or definite sum of money and is final and conclusive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 However, I recognise that in <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69], the court held that the first aspect of finality is that the judgment must be conclusive of the merits of the case, citing <span class="font-italic">The Bunga </span><span class="font-italic">Melati</span> at [81]. Woo cites <span class="font-italic">Manharlal</span><span class="font-italic"> Trikamdas Mody and another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1161 at [140] which held that in relation to whether a judgment is final and conclusive on the merits, the “real question is whether the decision is final for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>”. In this regard, the Korean law experts of both parties have agreed that under Korean law, the SHCJ is <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>only after the KSC had issued the KSCJ. This would dispose of Spackman’s submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I have in any event, proceeded to examine Spackman’s submission that there is no judgment on the merits. He cites <span class="font-italic">D</span><span class="font-italic"> S V Silo-Und Verwaltungsgesellschaft mbH v Owners of The Sennar</span> [1985] 1WLR 490 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Sennar (No 2)</span>”) at 499, which was cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">he Bunga Melati </span>at [81], that a judgment is final and conclusive on the merits if it “establishes certain facts as proved or not in dispute; states what are the relevant principles of law applicable to such facts; and expresses a conclusion with regard to the effect of applying those principles to the factual situation concerned”. Spackman submits that the SHCJ is not a judgment on the merits as the SHCJ merely applied a procedural rule, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the DCR, against Spackman in default of his participation in the SHC. This is to be contrasted with the detailed manner in which the SHC dealt with Woo’s claims against the other defendants. It is also to be contrasted with the approach taken by the Singapore courts. In <span class="font-italic">Seagate Technology International v Vikas Goel</span> [2016] SGHC 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Seagate</span>”), the defendant did not enter an appearance. The court required at [10] that the plaintiff proceed with the trial (in the defendant’s absence), including adducing evidence in the normal course of trial to put it beyond doubt that the merits of the case had been duly considered. In <span class="font-italic">Indian Overseas Bank v </span><span class="font-italic">Svil Agro Pte Ltd and others</span> [2014] 3 SLR 892 (“<span class="font-italic">Indian Overseas Bank</span>”), the defendant also did not enter an appearance. The court required that the plaintiff proceed to a full trial and to adduce its evidence “in the normal course”: at [34]–[36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Woo submits that the SHC did precisely what was mentioned in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Bunga Melati</span>. The SHC had applied Article 150(3) of the Korean Civil Procedure Act (“KCPA”) and found that Spackman admitted to the facts, such as the circulation of false and exaggerated facts to raise the value of shares and the dumping of shares which caused the share price to plummet, the conclusion of which was that Spackman was liable for the losses suffered by Woo. The SHC made substantive factual findings based on the application of the DCR. Under Korean law, the facts found through the DCR are no less binding on the parties than other fact-finding procedures. The KSC affirmed the SHC’s application of the principle of law to the facts.  Both Korean law experts agreed that the SHCJ and the KSCJ are judgments on the merits under Korean law. Their joint view was that:

The Seoul High Court and the Korean Supreme Court rendered their judgments based on admitted facts and there is no difference between facts that are affirmatively stated and proved by a party and facts admitted via deemed confessions under Korean Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Our courts have held that a default judgment obtained in a foreign court, can be considered to be final and conclusive: <span class="font-italic">Eleven </span>at [92]. Spackman cites <span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 75.162 that “[a] decision turning on a point that is regarded by the private international law of the enforcing forum as a rule of procedure is not a decision on the merits of the case”. However, that same section of <span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span> which Spackman cites, goes on to state that “a judgment can still be on the merits of the case even if the plaintiff won the case as a result of the defendant’s failure to appear or to enter a defence”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Singapore cases cited by Spackman also do not assist him. In <span class="font-italic">Seagate</span>, the plaintiff applied to have the matter proceed to full trial notwithstanding the defendant’s absence: at [9]. In <span class="font-italic">Indian Overseas Bank</span>, the matter proceeded to trial in the defendant’s absence, as the plaintiff had adduced evidence on Indian law that if evidence was not taken, the decision may not be considered by Indian courts to be a decision on the merits: at [36].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In this case, I find that the fact that the SHC applied the DCR in establishing its findings of facts, does not render it any less a judgment on the merits.

In <span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>, the court noted that the forum court recognising the foreign judgment must be satisfied that, according to the forum court’s own rules of private international law, that the foreign court had jurisdiction in the “international sense” (at [71]). Four alternative grounds of jurisdiction were set out: (a) presence in the foreign country; (b) filing a claim or counterclaim before the foreign court; (c) voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court by appearing in the proceedings; and (d) agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction before the commencement of proceedings. At [72], the court further held that whether a defendant has voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court is to be determined without exclusive reference to the law of the forum or the law of the foreign court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Spackman submits that the SHC did not have international jurisdiction over him, as he did not voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of either the SDC or the SHC and did not take part in the proceedings before these courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Woo submits that while Spackman failed to participate in the earlier proceedings, by appealing on the merits, he was taken as having voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the original courts.

However, as was pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span> and <span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span>, cited above, if indeed a defendant takes the view that there was no jurisdiction, he could appeal solely on the basis that there was no existence of jurisdiction (rather than on the merits). In that case, the appeal would not be taken as the defendant voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the court. As the court in <span class="font-italic">SA Consortium</span> rightly observed, if the appellate court decides in the favor of defendant, the defendant would have accepted the decision.

The question is whether, having been given notice, the litigant has the opportunity of substantially presenting his case before the court. At [42], the court noted that the heart of the issue of natural justice lies in the concepts of notice and of the opportunity to be heard. In <span class="font-italic">Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett</span><span class="font-italic">: Private International Law</span> (Paul Torremans ed) (Oxford University Press, 15th Ed, 2017) at p 577, the learned authors stated that “[d]ue notice is concerned with notice of the proceedings and not of the steps necessary to defend those proceedings … [i]f the defendant had knowledge of the foreign proceedings the lack of due notice defence cannot be used.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In this case, it is not disputed that on 21 April 2011, Spackman was personally served with the Three Documents. This would have given him notice of the case against him in the SHC. At the same time, he was also served with a Notice of Hearing Date. He chose not to appear at the SHC proceedings despite being given such notice. In Spackman’s AEIC, he testified that even though he was served with court documents for the SHC proceedings on 21 April 2011, he chose not to appear as he took the view “that Woo’s claims were completely frivolous and vexatious had already been vindicated and reinforced by the Seoul Central District Court and, based on the Served Documents, [he] assumed that there was no difference between the issues in the Seoul Central District Court proceedings (in which Woo's claims were dismissed), and the Seoul High Court proceedings”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Korean courts declared the other co-defendants innocent of any wrongdoing on the facts, but Spackman remained liable under the SHCJ because of the application of the DCR. This is notwithstanding that the claim by Woo was one of conspiracy between the defendants, where Spackman was identified as the leader of the conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Causation was clearly not found by the Korean courts, who found that there were no acts which caused any loss or damage to Woo.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The SHC ought not to have applied the DCR without first giving notice to Spackman. In addition, the SDC’s failure to apply the DCR when it ought to have done so, coupled with the SHC’s application of the same as an appellate court, deprived Spackman of the opportunity to remove the effect of the DCR or substantially present his case, by way of an appeal. He was unable to have his case reviewed on the facts when he appealed to the KSC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Woo made out his case against Spackman in the SHC based on pleadings which were not served on Spackman. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The SHC made its decision based on findings that were not found in the pleadings served on Spackman. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The SHC did not conduct a proper judicial assessment on damages, but relied on pleadings not served on Spackman. Spackman did not have notice of Woo’s claim for damages which the SHC had accepted, and did not have any proper opportunity to substantially present his case against it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Woo submits that there is no reason for the categories of breach of natural justice to be extended beyond the two identified in <span class="font-italic">Paulus </span><span class="font-italic">Tannos</span>. The court there at [29] recognized that <span class="font-italic">Adams v Cape</span> suggested that the categories of what could amount to a breach of natural justice are not limited to issues of notice and the opportunity to be heard, but noted that the appeal there did not concern the possible extension beyond such categories. Such extension is thus not currently part of Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Woo cites Peter Basil Carter, “Decisions of British Courts During 1988 Involving Questions of Public or Private International Law”, The British Yearbook of International Law, vol 59, issue 1, 1988, at p 363:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The thrust of the defence of contravention of English notions of substantial justice is different and more general. It could almost be seen as an ultimate discretion to withhold recognition simply because in the eyes of the English forum justice was palpably not done. In the final analysis it represents a prerogative of the forum – but, of course, a prerogative not to be abused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Woo submits that there is presently no element of discretion when it comes to common law enforcement of foreign judgments. It would be anomalous to extend the categories of breach of natural justice to include such a discretion. Even <span class="font-italic">Adams v Cape</span> rejected an extension of the categories of natural justice to include a breach of reasonable expectation that the procedure of the foreign court would be observed. The court there held at 567G–568A:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We would also accept that the adoption of a particular method of assessment of damages by the foreign court, would not per se amount to an effective defence, as a breach of natural justice under our law, merely because it was shown that, by reference to the procedural rules of the foreign court, the defendant might (on an objective basis) reasonably have expected that a different method would be used. So to hold would be to introduce, under the concept of reasonable expectation, a rule that breach by the foreign court of its own rules of procedure renders the foreign judgment unenforceable as offending our concepts of substantial justice. It is clear law that mere procedural irregularity, on the part of the foreign court and according to its own rules, is not such a ground of defence. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Woo submits that <span class="font-italic">Adams v Cape</span>, properly understood, was about the lack of notice given by the plaintiffs to the defendants. The defendants had been given notice of the plaintiffs’ application for a default judgment which stated that a “hearing to determine the amount of relief entitled to plaintiffs” would be held: at 499C and 559A. When the judge decided not to proceed with such judicial assessment of damages, the “plaintiffs failed to give prior notice to the defendants of the unusual course which they intended to pursue”: at 572A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Woo submits that in any event, the grounds relied on by Spackman do not amount to breaches of substantive justice:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Spackman complains that the SHCJ is unfair because the rest of the co-defendants were exonerated except him. That is untrue. The SHCJ remains binding on two co-defendants, one Mr Gap Soo Seo (“Seo”) and Silverline Investment Limited (“Silverline”), who did not appeal the SHCJ. Spackman is not entitled to rely on the Remand Judgments to assert that there has been a purported breach of natural justice as he was not a party to the Remand Judgments.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to causation of damage, the KSC found that “through the [Three Documents], [Woo stated that] … Woo believed in these statements [made by Spackman about Littauer Tech] and purchased the shares of Defendant Littauer Tech, and Plaintiff [Woo] incurred a loss of KRW 5,207,884,800 due to Defendants dumping the shares of Defendant Littauer Tech purchased by Plaintiff through capital increase with consideration in this case and the share prices plummeted.”

Both Korean law experts agreed that the KSC has the power to intervene and correct any misapplication of the DCR. The KSC found no such error in the SHCJ and stated this in the KSCJ. In addition, Spackman’s allegation that the SDC’s dismissal of Woo’s claim amounted to a breach of substantial justice is absurd. Spackman has produced no authority for this. He did not contend before the KSC that the SDC committed a procedural error for failing to apply the DCR against him. As this issue was not raised, it is speculative why the SDC did not apply the DCR. As this was raised late in the day by Spackman, Woo had no opportunity to instruct his expert, Yune, to provide his opinion on whether the DCR should have been applied in the SDC proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Woo did not allege facts in briefs that were not served.

The SHC was entitled to rely on the DCR to deem Spackman to have admitted to the loss claimed by Woo. There was no need for any separate judicial assessment. In any event, as the HKC found, the SHC did conduct its assessment and analysis on the quantum of damages, accepting the evidence that “the Plaintiff acquired shares of Littauer for KRW 5,790,744,000 and subsequently sold them for a meagre KRW 582,859,200.” Even if the SHC failed in any respect to conduct a judicial assessment of damages, Spackman had ample opportunity to raise this on appeal to the KSC, but did not do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I note that while Spackman submits that the categories of breach of natural justice extend beyond the two identified in <span class="font-italic">Paulus </span><span class="font-italic">Tannos</span>, he did not submit what the additional categories should be.

</div> It applies when a defendant does not appear in the Korean proceedings or submit a contesting brief after being served by a method other than by public notice. When the DCR is applied, the defendant is deemed to have confessed facts alleged by the plaintiff in the documents served on him. There is no requirement under Korean law that the defaulting party be first notified of the existence or the potential application of the DCR.  To avoid the application of the DCR, a defendant needs to participate in the proceedings so served, by appearing and contesting against the alleged facts before the court or by submitting written pleadings before the close of the proceedings, to dispute the facts that would have been confessed. The DCR cannot be applied to the facts not stated in the briefs or to the facts stated in the briefs that were not served.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The above examination of Yune’s evidence indicates that far from stating that it would have been mandatory for the SDC to apply the DCR on the facts, Yune repeatedly stated that he did not know, that he had not been instructed on this and that he would have to conduct further examination into the issue. Notably, Spackman’s own expert, Kim, did not provide an opinion on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Another assumption made in this claim is that Spackman would have appealed if the SDC had upheld Woo’s claim against him by applying the DCR. While this may be likely, there is no evidence from Spackman that he would have done so. This is speculative since Spackman did have notice of the SDC and SHC proceedings but chose not to appear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Moreover, as the SDC and SHC hearings would have proceeded on a completely different basis in such a scenario, the current references in the SHCJ and KSCJ are of limited assistance. It is completely speculative what would have been presented before the SHC by both parties in that scenario, and how the SHC would have ruled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 What further undermines Spackman’s submission that there was a breach of substantive justice in relation to the SDC’s alleged failure to apply the DCR against him, is that he would have been aware of what he had been personally served with and that the SDC did not apply the DCR against him, and yet he did not raise this point before the Korean courts at any point in his appeals and applications. I agree with the observations made in <span class="font-italic">Adams v Cape</span> at 570C that since the ultimate question is whether there has been proof of substantial injustice caused by the proceedings, it would “be unrealistic in fact and incorrect in principle to ignore entirely the possibility of the correction of error within the procedure of a foreign court which itself provides fair procedural rules and a fair opportunity for remedy”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, a number of the allegations made by Spackman as constituting breaches of substantive justice, are in fact unsubstantiated and contrary to what the KSC found and stated in the KSCJ. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Spackman claims that the SHCJ is unfair because he is the only person held liable on a conspiracy claim, when the other defendants were found not to have committed wrongdoings on the facts. However, the SHCJ remains binding on Seo and Silverline, who did not appeal the SHCJ.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Spackman claims that the KSCJ findings that exonerated Littauer Tech and KTIC show that Spackman did not commit any wrongdoings. However, these observations of the KSC, as well as the findings in the Remand Judgment, only had effect on Littauer Tech and KTIC. Spackman was not a party to the remand proceedings. It would not follow that the observations of the KCS and the Remand Judgment regarding Littauer Tech and KTIC were also intended to apply to Spackman. The KSC upheld the SHC’s decision against Spackman notwithstanding the KSC’s observations about the other two defendants. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Spackman claims that Woo made out his case against Spackman in the SHC based on pleadings which were not served on him. However, the KSCJ stated that Woo made his arguments through the Three Documents. Spackman submits that the language of the KSCJ does not state that Woo did not refer to any other document. However, both Korean law experts accept that it would have been an error to apply the DCR to any documents that were not served on Spackman. By this submission, Spackman effectively submits that the KSC itself erred in its review, without being able to support it with anything more than a bare assertion. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Spackman claims that the SHC made its decision based on findings that were not found in the pleadings served on Spackman. However, the KSCJ stated that the KSC reviewed the decision of the SHC and found no error in the SHCJ, whether in the SHC’s application of the DCR or the documents it relied on.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Spackman claims that the Korean courts did not find causation of damage. However, the KSCJ stated that “through the [Three Documents], [Woo stated that] … [Woo] believed in these statements [made by Spackman about Littauer Tech] and purchased the shares of Defendant Littauer Tech, and [Woo] incurred a loss of KRW 5,207,884,800 due to Defendants dumping the shares of Defendant Littauer Tech purchased by [Woo] through capital increase with consideration in this case and the share prices plummeted …”.

</div> The KSC, following review of the SHCJ, including the damages ordered by the SHC against Spackman, found that the SHC did not err in its assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 What Spackman seeks in essence, is for our courts to revisit the merits of the case, which had been reviewed and decided on by the KSC. The observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee </span>(at [28] and [31]) in this regard, are apposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It is also vitally important that no court of one jurisdiction should pass judgment on an issue already decided upon by a competent court of another jurisdiction.

There is no question of which is being more correct. To seek to make such an evaluation would be an invidious exercise and could lead to the undesirable consequence which we have mentioned before of encouraging judicial chauvinism. It must be borne in mind that the enforcement forum is not an appellate tribunal <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the foreign judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 … <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the cardinal principle is that no one court should sit in judgment </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">over the final decision of a competent court of another jurisdiction</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In summary, I find that there is no breach of natural justice that prevents Woo from enforcing the SHCJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether enforcement of SHCJ contravenes Singapore public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Fifth, Spackman submits that the enforcement of the SHCJ would contravene the public policy of Singapore because there was no wrongdoing by Spackman and no damage suffered by Woo. In addition, the sums ordered to be paid by the SHC are punitive and/or manifestly excessive given the penal nature of the 20% interest rate that the SHC ordered to be payable on the judgment sum from 30 September 2011 until the date of full repayment. Spackman cites <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tan Gin </span><span class="font-italic">Huay and another</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 755 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Finance</span>”) where it was held that a default interest of 18% per annum was “manifestly excessive” and was therefore an unenforceable penalty, as well as <span class="font-italic">Lewis v </span><span class="font-italic">Eliades and others</span> [2004] 1 WLR 692 (“<span class="font-italic">Lewis</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Alberto Justo Rodriguez </span><span class="font-italic">Licea and others v Curacao Drydock Co, Inc</span> [2015] 4 SLR 172 (“<span class="font-italic">Alberto Justo Rodriguez</span>”) at [28], the court permitted the punitive part of the foreign judgment to be severed, so that only the compensatory parts were enforceable (as the unobjectionable part of the foreign judgment could be clearly identified and separated). Spackman submits that in this case, the interest component of the SHCJ should also be severed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 It was held in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat </span>at [89] and [111] that a foreign judgment would not be enforced for being contrary to public policy if: (a) it would offend a fundamental principle of justice or deep-rooted tradition of Singapore; (b) the general community in Singapore would be offended by the registration; (c) it would offend fundamental ideas of morality, decency, human liberty, or justice; (d) it would go against a rule whose purpose is to protect the public interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In so far as Spackman submits that there were breaches of natural or substantive justice, or that the SHCJ offends fundamental ideas of justice, that has already been dealt with above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I do not find <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Finance</span> to be relevant here. In that case, the mortgagor defaulted in her payment and the mortgagee applied for an order for possession of the property. The court at [27] found the default interest rate of 18% per annum to be an extravagant increase from the rate of 5.5% for the first two years of the term loan and 6.75% thereafter, and was not referable to the true amount of the loss suffered by the mortgagee following the breach by the mortgagor. The analysis thus proceeded on an examination of the facts of that case, in particular, the terms of the mortgage. <span class="font-italic">Hong Leong Finance</span> does not stand for the proposition that the imposition of high interest rates on foreign judgment sums by the laws of another country, would be contrary to the public policy of Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Neither is <span class="font-italic">Lewis </span>applicable here. The common law principle that a court will not enforce a foreign judgment for a penalty, that was raised by Potter LJ at [50], was in relation to “a sum payable to the state, and not to a private plaintiff, so that an award of punitive or exemplary damages has been said not to be penal”.  In this case, the interest is payable to Woo and not the state.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Both Korean law experts agreed that the 20% interest rate ordered by the SHC on the judgment sum applies in Korea pursuant to its legislation. Yune explained, and Kim agreed, that the purpose of such a statutory rate is to deter litigants from delaying litigation and consequently delaying claimants from being able to enjoy the fruits of litigation.

</div>  Spackman relies on <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat</span>, where the Court of Appeal examined the wording of the California judgment and found that there was nothing in the language of the judgment to support a finding that the judgment was for payment of debt or a definite sum of money. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat</span>, the court held at [19] that “the issue of whether the 2001 California Judgment was a fresh foreign money judgment should be determined according to Californian law”. However, the court cautioned against blindly accepting expert evidence on foreign law at [22] and held that the court must “carefully consider the factual or other premise on which the expert based his opinion” (at [23]). The court at [30]–[31] then went on to examine the language of the 2001 California Judgment and found that it can be seen from the terms of the Santa Clara Superior Court’s orders that the appellant was not ordered to pay a definite sum of money to the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I agree with Spackman that on the application of <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat</span>, the language of the KSCJ should be examined. Such examination indicates that the KSCJ did not order Spackman to pay a definite sum of money to Woo. The KSC only dismissed the appeal. Kim’s opinion was that “the Korean Supreme Court Judgment is not for a debt or a definite sum of money, nor does it create a fresh obligation on [Spackman] to pay [Woo].”

</div>
</div>  Consequently, I find that the KSCJ is not a judgment for a debt or definite sum of money. As set out above, <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Kiat</span> required at [13]–[14] that a foreign judgment be for a definite sum of money, before it can be enforced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Following from the above, I find that the KSCJ is not enforceable in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether New York Judgment is enforceable in Singapore</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Spackman submits that the NYJ is unenforceable because it merely decides on the enforceability of the SHCJ in the State of New York. At law, the enforceability of such a “judgment on a judgment” has been doubted. The NYJ only declares the enforceability of the SHCJ in New York, pursuant to the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. It expressly states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Plaintiff Sang Cheol Woo moved this Court for summary judgment in lieu of complaint against Defendant Charles C. Spackman, pursuant to N.Y. CPLR §§ 3213 and 5303, for the recognition in New York of a foreign civil money judgment in the Republic of Korea … against Charles C. Spackman.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I find that it is clear from the language of the NYJ that the judgment therein is only in relation to the enforcement of the SHCJ against Spackman’s assets in the state of New York and not in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Woo nevertheless submits that a foreign judgment on the enforcement of another foreign judgment can be enforced in Singapore, relying on <span class="font-italic">Morgan Stanley &amp; Co International Ltd v Pilot Lead Investments Ltd</span> [2006] 4 HKC 93 (“<span class="font-italic">Morgan Stanley</span>”). In that case, the Hong Kong court found that a Singapore judgment, which in turn enforced a default judgment issued by the High Court of England, would have been enforceable in Hong Kong if the judgment creditor had adduced evidence that under the laws of Singapore, the Singapore judgment was final and conclusive. This was because the Singapore judgment would have otherwise satisfied the test under the Hong Kong Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance (Cap 319) (“FJREO”), mainly that: (a) the judgment came from a superior court of a designated country; (b) it must be a final and conclusive judgment between the parties thereto; (c) there is payable thereunder a sum of money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Woo did not present any principled basis for regarding <span class="font-italic">Morgan </span><span class="font-italic">Stanley</span> as good law here, beyond its citation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I note that the requirements for recognition of a foreign judgment may differ according to jurisdictions. While there are similarities across certain jurisdictions, it is not clear that a foreign judgment that is recognised for enforcement in another jurisdiction, would ineluctably also be recognised and accepted for enforcement if the application was first made here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In addition, as pointed out by Spackman, the position is not settled even in Hong Kong. <span class="font-italic">Morgan Stanley</span> has been criticised in subsequent Hong Kong decisions. In <span class="font-italic">Motorola Solutions Credit Company LLC (</span><span class="font-italic">fka Motorola Credit Corporation) v Kemal Uzan &amp; Ors </span>[2014] HKCU 975 at [36], the court commented:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 … Ms Ismail argues that the case of <span class="font-italic">Morgan Stanley</span> is probably wrong. She makes the point that the practical problem which would arise from enforcing a judgment on a judgment is demonstrated in this case. I have to agree that confusion may arise when the plaintiff seeks to enforce both the original US judgments and the enforcement UK judgments of the US judgments. As is illustrated by this case the two judgments are for different amounts because different interest rates apply.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I am thus not persuaded that <span class="font-italic">Morgan Stanley </span>should be applied in Singapore. Consequently, I dismiss Woo’s application to enforce the NYJ in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Spackman is estopped from relitigating findings made in the Hong Kong Judgment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Woo submits that Spackman is estopped from relitigating the findings made in the HKJ in relation to the enforcement of the SHCJ there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Spackman submits that the HKJ is concerned solely with whether the SHCJ is enforceable in Hong Kong. It was never intended to have any transnational impact, and cannot give rise to transnational issue estoppel in this case. Any findings in the HKJ would be made in the context of assessing any defences which Spackman may have under Hong Kong law. These findings should not be given weight in so far as they concern matters which the Singapore court ought to determine for itself, under Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In <span class="font-italic">Merck Sharp</span>, the court held that there are three elements to proving transnational issue estoppel: (a) the existence of a foreign judgment that is capable of being recognised in the jurisdiction; (b) identity of issues; and (c) identity of parties (at [35] and [40]). In determining whether there is an identity of issues, the court needs to be cautious in interpreting the foreign judgment and determining, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>: (a) what was actually decided by the foreign court and whether the specific issue that is the subject matter of issue estoppel was necessary, or merely collateral to the foreign judgment; and (b) whether the party against whom the estoppel is invoked had the occasion or opportunity to raise that specific issue (at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I do not find there to be an identity of issues here. Some of the issues raised by Spackman here were not raised in the HK proceedings, such as the alleged breach of natural justice because the SDC did not find against Spackman by applying the DCR. While there are other arguments raised here that may be similar to the alleged breaches of natural justice made before the HK court, those allegations related to whether there was a breach of natural justice under Hong Kong law. Woo has brought no evidence to show that the laws regarding the breach of natural justice are similar to that in Singapore. It cannot then be said that the issue of whether the enforcement of the SHCJ in Hong Kong breached the laws of natural justice under Hong Kong law, is substantially the same issue as whether the enforcement of the SHCJ in Singapore would breach the laws of natural justice under Singapore law. Moreover, the Court of Appeal has held in <span class="font-italic">Paulus </span><span class="font-italic">Tannos</span> at [58] that “[t]he issue of whether a foreign judgment or order should be refused recognition or enforcement because of a breach of natural justice is a question for the recognition court alone to answer.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In summary, I find that Spackman is not restrained by issue estoppel or abuse of process from re-litigating the findings made in the HKJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In conclusion, for the reasons above, I allow Woo to enforce the SHCJ in Singapore against Spackman, but not the KSCJ or the NYJ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Directions will be given to parties in respect of costs.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lin Weiqi Wendy, Leow Jiamin, Pranay Arvind Suryavanshi and Hong Jia Yu (WongPartnership LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Boon Hwee William, Tan Xeauwei, Ong Chin Kiat and Dion Loy (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarah Chew (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the fifth defendant (watching brief).</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
