<p xmlns="">application for summary judgment and the defendants filed an application for an order that

the plaintiffs’ statement of claim be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of

action or as being scandalous, vexatious or frivolous. The plaintiffs’ application

for summary judgment was dismissed with costs whilst the defendants’ application

succeeded. The plaintiffs’ statement of claim be struck out and the plaintiffs were

given liberty to apply to amend their writ and statement of claim by 31 August 2000

failing which the action would stand dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed against both

rulings.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, dismissing the appeal:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)    It was not clear what title the plaintiffs had in

the goods after they endorsed the bills of lading in favour of the various banks. The

documents they submitted showed a sale to the banks. This would mean that title to the

goods would have passed to the banks at the same time. The banks and not the plaintiffs

owned the goods. The position vis--vis the banks was not entirely explained and there

was the possibility that the documents had been endorsed as security for advances rather

than in order to pass title pursuant to the sale. If that was the case, then as the

plaintiffs submitted, whilst the banks would have special property rights in the

documents, the plaintiffs would retain their general property rights. Such general

property rights would not, on the law, entitle the plaintiffs to immediate possession of

the goods. It would therefore be the bank who had the immediate right to possession of the

goods. Even if the plaintiffs retained the general property in the goods and the banks

only acquired a special property in them for security purposes, it is clear that the

persons with the right of possession would be the banks (See  14 – 17). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2)    The legal position is that to sue for conversion,

it is not enough to be the owner of the goods at the time the suit is commenced; you must

also be the person who had the right to possess the goods at the time they were converted

or mis-delivered. In this case, the plaintiffs did not have an immediate right to

possession of the goods at any time between 26 March 1999 and, at least, the end of

October 1999. On 26 March, they endorsed the bills of lading to the three banks either on

a sale or as security. It would therefore be the latter who had the immediate right to

possession of the goods (See  18 and 19).</p>

<font face="Univers" xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">Background</p></b>
<p align="justify">1.        In early 1999, the

plaintiffs, a Singapore company, contracted to sell 1,900 bales of cotton knitted fabrics

to an American buyer on CIF terms. It was agreed that the goods were to be sent to

Port-au-Price, Haiti and the documents forwarded to the buyer who would pay for them on

sight of the documents.</p>
<p align="justify">2.        In February 1999, the

goods were shipped on board two vessels at Singapore. By the eight bills of lading issued

in respect of the goods, the defendants, their servants and/or agents, acknowledged their

shipment on board the respective vessels and undertook to carry the goods for reward from

Singapore to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. For a reason that was not explained, although both

shipments had been effected in February, six of the bills of lading were dated 22 March

1999 whilst the remaining two were dated 26 March 1999. The plaintiffs were named as the

shippers of the goods on the bills of lading whilst the consignee was ‘To order’

and the notify party was named as ‘Haiti Evans Corp’.</p>
<p align="justify">3.        The plaintiffs did not

deal directly with the buyers in order to obtain payment for the goods. Instead, they

dealt with three sets of banks in Singapore to whom on 26 March 1999 they submitted their

invoices, the original bills of lading , drafts drawn on the buyers and other relevant

documents. These banks were Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, Singapore and Bank of India,

Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">4.        The plaintiffs submitted

four sets of bills of lading and accompanying documents to UCO Bank together with a UCO

Bank standard form by which they indicated that the documents were being submitted

‘as collateral for an advance’. At the same time, the four bills of lading were

endorsed by the plaintiffs to the order of UCO Bank. Three sets of bills of lading and

accompanying documents were submitted to Indian Overseas Bank under cover of a form which

stated that these documents were submitted for purchase subject to final payment. The

bills of lading were endorsed to the order of Indian Overseas Bank. The eighth and final

set of documents was submitted to Bank of India under cover of a similar form stating that

the purpose of the submission was ‘For purchase subject to final payment’ and

the bill of lading was endorsed to the order of the said bank.</p>
<p align="justify">5.        The three banks then

forwarded the respective documents in their possession to the buyers’ bank, Broadway

National Bank (‘Broadway’), in New York, for the purpose of collecting the

payment due for the goods. The bills of lading were endorsed in favour of Broadway by the

respective Singapore banks. No payment was received for some months and, in October and

November 1999, the Singapore banks wrote to the New York bank to enquire whether the bills

drawn by the plaintiffs on the buyer had been paid. In November 1999, Broadway replied to

state that payment had not been received.</p>
<p align="justify">6.        In the meantime, the

plaintiffs made enquiries with the defendants’ local freight forwarding agent on the

status of the goods. They were informed that all the goods had arrived at Haiti on dates

at the end of March and in early April 1999. The plaintiffs subsequently discovered that

the goods had been released to the notify party, Haiti Evans Corp, without production of

the original bills of lading. The plaintiffs then sought to recover the bills of lading.</p>
<p align="justify">7.        On 17 November 1999,

Broadway forwarded four bills to UCO Bank which apparently received them on 22 November

1999. There is no evidence in the affidavits as to when these documents were in turn

received by the plaintiffs. On 3 December 1999, Broadway forwarded three bills to Indian

Overseas Bank which received them on 9 December 1999. These were apparently collected by

the plaintiffs on 17 December 1999. The final bill of lading was forwarded to Bank of

India by Broadway on 15 December 1999 and received by Bank of India on 20 December 1999.

All the bills have now been re-endorsed in favour of the plaintiffs.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">The proceedings</p></b>
<p align="justify">8.        On 13 December 1999, the

plaintiffs commenced this action against the defendants. The indorsement of claim on the

writ described the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants as being for damages for

breach of contract and/or duty as bailees and/or negligence of and/or conversion by the

defendants in respect of the, inter alia, discharge and/or delivery of the

plaintiffs’ cargo under the said bills of lading which breach resulted in loss and/or

damage and/or mis-delivery and/or conversion of the cargo and consequential losses and

damages being incurred by the plaintiffs as the owners of the cargo and/or the lawful

holders of the bills of lading.</p>
<p align="justify">9.        The defendants entered an

appearance to the action in March 2000 and on 28 April, the defendants filed their

statement of claim. In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs asserted that they were, at

all material times, the owners of the cargo shipped on the two vessels and/or the

consignees and/or the lawful holders of the eight bills of lading. They went on to plead

that the defendants were under a duty to the plaintiffs as bailees and/or carriers and/or

possessors for reward under the contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the

aforesaid bills of lading to deliver the goods at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, upon presentation

of the bills of lading in the same quantity or amount as they were shipped.</p>
<p align="justify">10.        By para 5, the plaintiffs

asserted that it was an express and/or implied term of the contract of carriage that the

defendants would only deliver the goods against surrender and/or presentation of the

original bills of lading. In paras 6 and 7, the plaintiffs averred that in breach of

contract and/or duty as bailees, the defendants failed to deliver the goods to the

plaintiffs at Port-au-Prince, Haiti and/or had delivered them to Haiti Evans Corp or

unknown third parties who were not entitled the same and had thereby wrongfully converted

the goods and unlawfully interfered with the plaintiffs’ right to immediate

possession of the goods.</p>
<p align="justify">11.        In May, the plaintiffs

filed an application for summary judgment. Two months later, the defendants filed an

application for an order that the plaintiffs’ statement of claim be struck out as

disclosing no reasonable cause of action or as being scandalous, vexatious or frivolous.

Both applications were heard by the Senior Assistant Registrar on 15 August. In the

result, the plaintiffs’ application for summary judgment was dismissed with costs

whilst the defendants’ application succeeded. The order made was that the

plaintiffs’ statement of claim be struck out and the plaintiffs were given liberty to

apply to amend their writ and statement of claim by 31 August 2000 failing which the

action would stand dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed against both rulings.</p>
<p align="justify">12.        The appeals came on for

hearing before me. Since the plaintiffs’ appeal on the application for summary

judgment could not proceed unless they were successful in their appeal against the

striking out order, the first appeal was adjourned sine die with liberty to restore. I

then heard the appeal against the striking out order. I dismissed this appeal with costs.

The plaintiffs are dissatisfied with my decision.</p>
<b>
<p align="justify">Arguments presented on appeal</p></b>
<p align="justify">13.        The defendants’

original application was premised on the ground that the plaintiffs at all material times

had no rights to the immediate possession or delivery of the goods alleged to have been

converted or wrongly delivered by the defendants. This was because when the alleged

mis-deliveries took place on 30 and 31 March 1999 and on 12 April 1999, the plaintiffs

were not in possession of those eight bills of lading and as such were in no position to

call for the delivery of the goods to them on those dates. Further, the plaintiffs had no

title to sue because at the time of commencement of the action ie 13 December 1999, they

were not the lawful holders of the bills of lading. Below, the plaintiffs contested both

those assertions.</p>
<p align="justify">14.        On appeal, however, the

plaintiffs conceded that when the writ was filed, they had no title to sue under the Bills

of Lading Act (Cap 384) (‘the Act’) as they were not then the ‘holder’

of the eight bills of lading as defined by s 52 of the Act. They also conceded that mere

ownership of goods would not give them title to sue the carrier. The plaintiffs submitted,

however, that even though they did not have title to sue under the contract of carriage,

as owners of the goods they had a right to sue the defendants in tort for negligence (para

8 of the statement of claim), independent of the contract of carriage contained in the

bills of lading. In view of the existence of such claim in negligence, the action should

not have been struck out.</p>
<p align="justify">15.        The plaintiffs relied on

the well established principle that the legal owner or person with possessory title to

goods at the time of the tort complained of can sue. They submitted that at the time the

defendants negligently mis-delivered the goods, they were the legal owners or persons with

possessory title to the goods. In April 1999, when the negligent release of the goods took

place, all eight bills of lading were lying with the Broadway for collection. Broadway was

the collection agent of the three Singapore banks. Of the eight bills of lading, three had

been purchased by Indian Overseas Bank and four by UCO Bank on terms which allowed them to

have recourse to the plaintiffs. The remaining bill of lading had been handed to Bank of

India for collection. The plaintiffs submitted that notwithstanding their sale of the

seven bills to the banks concerned, they still have property in the goods and were

entitled to possession of the goods. They submitted that since the sale had been

‘with recourse’ ie meaning that the two banks concerned could require them to

repurchase the documents, they retained the general property in the goods and Indian

Overseas Bank and UCO Bank only acquired a special property in the goods for security

purposes.</p>
<p align="justify">16.        I had some doubt as to

what title the plaintiffs had in the goods after they endorsed the bills of lading in

favour of the various banks. The documents they submitted appeared, to me, to show a sale

to the banks. This would mean that title to the goods would have passed to the banks at

the same time. The fact that the banks had purchased ‘with recourse’ meant that

the banks could require the plaintiffs to repurchase the documents from them. If the banks

exercised that right and the repurchase took place, title would then pass back to the

plaintiffs. Until then, however, it appeared to me that the banks and not the plaintiffs

owned the goods. The position vis--vis the banks was not entirely explained and there

was the possibility that the documents had been endorsed as security for advances rather

than in order to pass title pursuant to the sale. If that was the case, then as the

plaintiffs submitted, whilst the banks would have special property rights in the

documents, the plaintiffs would retain their general property rights.</p>
<p align="justify">17.        The position therefore

appeared to be that either the plaintiffs were not the owners of the goods between 26

March 1999 and whenever it was in November/December 1999 when the bills of lading were

re-endorsed to them, or that during this period the plaintiffs had, at the most, retained

general property rights which were subject to the special property rights of the banks.

Such general property rights would not, on the law, entitle the plaintiffs to immediate

possession of the goods.</p>
<p align="justify">18.        The legal position is

that to sue for conversion it is not enough to be the owner of the goods at the time the

suit is commenced: you must also be the person who had the right to possess the goods at

the time they were converted or mis-delivered. The applicable principles are well set out

in the following paragraphs from <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i> (17<sup>th</sup>

Ed):</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘<b>13-51    Plaintiff must have possession or

    immediate right to possession</b>. The general rule is that a person has title to sue for

    conversion if and only if he had, at the time of the conversion, either actual possession

    or the immediate right to posses. It is not necessary to prove a title of absolute

    ownership, and indeed the owner may not sue unless he either possesses or has the

    immediate right to possess. So a purchaser of goods in whom the title is vested cannot sue

    for conversion until he pays or tenders the price and thus becomes entitled to possession.

    Conversely, there is no reason why one with an interest less than ownership, such as a

    pledgee or the owner of an undivided half-share, should not sue in conversion.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>13-52    Plaintiff’s right must exist at the

    time of conversion</b>. The right on which the plaintiff relies must have existed <i>at

    the time of the alleged conversion</i>: a right to the goods obtained at some other time

    will not suffice. Thus in <i>The Future Express</i> the buyer of a cargo of wheat agreed

    with his bank that bills of lading should be made out to the bank’s order and put in

    its hands as soon as they arrived from the sellers. The buyer subsequently persuaded the

    carriers, with the assent of the sellers, to deliver direct to him. He took the cargo,

    sold it and decamped with the proceeds. Later still the sellers sent the bills of lading

    to the bank. The Court of Appeal held that the bank could not sue the carriers in

    conversion for delivering contrary to the terms of the bill of lading; at the time that

    delivery took place, the bank had no right whatever in the goods.</p>
<p align="justify">...</p>
<p align="justify"><b>13-77    Immediate right to possession</b>. As

    mentioned above, an owner cannot sue in conversion unless he shows either possession or an

    immediate right to it. Thus if goods are let or pledged, the hirer or pledgee, as the case

    may be, has the exclusive custody and consequently the sole right of action until the

    contract is determined. In such cases, therefore, the owner has no right of possession,

    and cannot sue in conversion. If goods are held subject to a lien, the owner’s right

    is of necessity excluded, and the possessor is therefore the only person who can bring the

    action. If a chattel is mortgaged on the terms that until default it shall be lawful for

    the mortgagor to hold and enjoy the chattel, the mortgagee cannot maintain trespass or

    conversion before default, since he has no present right of possession.’<b> </b></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.        In this case, the

plaintiffs did not have an immediate right to possession of the goods at any time between

26 March 1999 and, at least, the end of October 1999. On 26 March, they endorsed the bills

of lading to the three banks either on a sale or as security. It would therefore be the

latter who had the immediate right to possession of the goods. Even if, as the plaintiffs

submitted, the plaintiffs retained the general property in the goods and the banks only

acquired a special property in them for security purposes, it is clear from the extract

from <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell</i> that the persons with the right of possession would be

the banks. In my judgment, the plaintiffs did not have the right to sue the defendants in

tort for conversion of the goods in March and/or April 1999. Their appeal therefore had to

be dismissed.</p>
