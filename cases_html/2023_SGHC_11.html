</div> The crux of the Prosecution’s case was two-fold. First, the Accused had in fact penetrated the Victim’s vagina with his penis. Second, the Accused knew that the Victim was intoxicated and was unable to give her consent. In support, the Prosecution relies on two reports produced by the HSA’s DNA Profiling Laboratory and the expert testimony of Ms Tang. Further, the Prosecution relies on the Victim’s testimony, the Close Circuit Television (“CCTV”) footage recorded at the lift lobby of the Apartment showing the Victim’s unconscious state, the expert testimonies of Dr Lee and Dr Guo, the outgoing and incoming calls from the Victim’s handphone at the material time of the rape, and the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses. The Prosecution submits that the Victim could not have given consent to the sexual intercourse given that she was heavily intoxicated. Thus, the Accused had penetrated the Victim’s vagina with his penis without her consent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Victim’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The Prosecution relies on the Victim’s evidence that she had not consented to have sexual intercourse with the Accused. The Victim said that she has poor alcohol tolerance. On the day the offence was committed, the Victim had consumed large quantities of alcoholic drinks, both at the Unit and then at the KTV Lounge. The Prosecution submits that, given the Victim’s level of intoxication, she would have been unconscious throughout the night up until the point she was raped. Indeed, the Victim’s next immediate recollection after her time at the KTV Lounge was waking up to find the Accused on top of her, with his penis in her vagina.

Thus, she would not have had sufficient cognitive abilities or mental capacity to consent or reject the Accused’s request for sexual intercourse given her state of alcohol intoxication.

Thus, the Victim falsely alleged that the Accused had raped her so that she could continue to stay in Singapore. Prior to the present case, the Victim was a prosecution’s witness involving a sham marriage (“the Sham Marriage Proceedings”). As a result of that case, the Victim’s stay in Singapore was extended by way of a special pass to facilitate investigations and prosecution of the offender involved in the Sham Marriage Proceedings. At the material time when the Accused committed the alleged offences, the Sham Marriage Proceedings she was involved in was about to conclude. Hence, the Victim would have to return to China. The Defence thus argues that the Victim had fabricated the rape allegation, so that her special pass would be extended and she could continue to stay in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Defence further alleges that the Victim has a second and related ulterior motive, which was to obtain monetary compensation from the Accused in order to alleviate her financial difficulties. The Defence submits that the Victim’s father had met with a road accident and was hospitalised in China. Thus, the Victim required money for her father’s medical treatment. In order to pay for her father’s medical bills, the Victim resorted to making a false report against the Accused and claimed monetary compensation from the Accused before the Victim would withdraw the police report. When the Accused failed to pay the Victim compensation on her terms, she lodged a police report against the Accused for raping her.

Accordingly, it is necessary to consider s 458A of the Penal Code, which reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Punishment for subsequent offence under section 454 or 457</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">458A</span>.

Section 451 of the Penal Code (2020 Rev Ed) is the relevant type of house-breaking offence in this case and it reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">House-breaking in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">451.</span> Whoever commits house-breaking in order to commit any offence punishable with imprisonment, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Despite this amendment, it is correct that the Prosecution proceeds under s 457 of the Penal Code. This is because the applicable law at the time of the house-breaking was s 457 of the Penal Code and not s 451 of the Penal Code (2020 Rev Ed), which was not in the Penal Code in force at that time (see also <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and other appeals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2017] 4 SLR 474 at [14]). For the avoidance of doubt, however, the Accused’s act of house-breaking, if committed on or after 1 January 2020, would still be an offence today, albeit under s 451 of the Penal Code (2020 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Rape and the element of consent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the Accused to be guilty of rape, the Prosecution must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the elements of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Rape</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">375.</span>—(1) Any man who penetrates the vagina of a woman with his penis —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) without her consent …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to subsection (3), a man who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 To support a charge of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused had: (a) penetrated the Victim’s vagina with his penis; and (b) the said act of penetration was done without the Victim’s consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In respect of the element of consent, s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code is relevant, and reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Consent given under fear or misconception, by person of unsound mind, etc., and by child</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">90.</span> A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) if the consent is given by a person who, from … intoxication … is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Thus, s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code invalidates any consent if the Victim was so intoxicated that the law deems such consent to be invalid or vitiated (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Pram Nair</span> [2017] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>”) at [62]). In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the Court of Appeal at [93] endorsed the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes: A Commentary on the Indian Penal Code 1860 vol 2</span> (CK Thakker &amp; M C Thakker eds) (Bharat Law House, 26th Ed, 2007) which elaborated on the concept of consent:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Consent on the part of a woman, as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and the moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent … A woman is said to consent only when she freely agrees to submit herself, while in free and unconstrained possession of her physical and moral power to act in a power she wanted. Consent implies the exercise of free and untrammeled right to forbid or withhold what is being consented to; it is always a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is proposed to be done by another and concurred in by the former.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In other words, to demonstrate that an individual had voluntarily consented to sexual intercourse with another person, that individual must have voluntarily and consciously agreed to have sex with the other person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> also prescribed some guiding principles at [96] when dealing with the issue of whether an intoxicated person has the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">96 We would identify the following as the relevant general principles: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Under s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), a person who is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which the person has allegedly given his consent has no capacity to consent. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that a complainant has drunk a substantial amount of alcohol, appears disinhibited, or behaves differently than usual, does not indicate lack of capacity to consent. Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">A complainant who is unconscious obviously has no capacity to consent</span>. But a complainant may have crossed the line into incapacity well before becoming unconscious, and whether that is the case is evidently a fact-sensitive inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. <span class="font-italic">A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">In our view, expert evidence – such as that showing the complainant’s blood alcohol level – may </span><span class="font-italic">assist the court in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Where a complainant is so heavily intoxicated that she is unconscious, therefore, she cannot be said to have the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse. That much is self-explanatory. On the other hand, where a complainant is intoxicated, but not unconscious, whether that complainant has the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse is a more fact-sensitive inquiry. The issue of the complainant’s capacity to consent turns on the degree of impairment in the complainant’s understanding or knowledge. The degree of impairment must be such that the court is satisfied that the complainant lacked the ability to make any decisions. Accordingly, where a complainant is so heavily intoxicated to the extent that she suffers from alcohol-induced delirium, that complainant will be incapable to consent to sexual intercourse. To ascertain whether the Victim was capable of consenting to sexual intercourse with the Accused, the Court may have recourse to evidence such as the Victim’s BAC level. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The threshold of proof in the context of mutually exclusive testimonies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I am mindful that no one had witnessed the Accused’s commission of the sexual acts on the Victim in her bedroom at the material time. However, the Prosecution’s case does not rest solely on the Victim’s testimony of the alleged rape, as there is ample corroborative evidence to buttress the Victim’s account of the events and her state of intoxication both before and after the rape. This includes the corroborative scientific evidence in the form of Dr Guo’s and Dr Lee’s reports and testimonies, the testimonies of the other Prosecution’s witnesses present at the festive celebration at the Apartment and the KTV Lounge, and the Accused’s statements to the police. This is, therefore, not a case where there is no other evidence, and the Court must simply weigh the Victim’s word against the Accused’s. Thus, the “unusually convincing” burden of proof may not be necessary in this case (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri and others</span> [2019] SGHC 105 at [114]–[116], affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Asep Ardiansyah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] SGCA 74 at [28]). This test was explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF v Public Prosecutor </span>[2012] 3 SLR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">AOF</span>”) at [111]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt… but only when it is so ‘unusually convincing’ as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I also note the Court of Appeal’s explanation in <span class="font-italic">Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2016] 5 SLR 636 that the “unusually convincing” standard “does not introduce a new burden of proof [and] … ‘does nothing … to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the accused’” (at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">XP v PP</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Whether or not this standard applies, the burden of proof remains indisputably on the Prosecution to establish each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court must therefore carefully examine all the evidence placed before it to determine if that burden has been satisfactorily discharged. As I shall explain below, I am satisfied that the Victim’s account that the sexual intercourse was without her consent can withstand the close scrutiny akin to the high standard of the “unusually convincing” test. Her evidence is credible, reliable, internally consistent and externally consistent with the other evidence before the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 With these legal principles in mind, I shall set out the issues in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The issues that arise for my consideration in respect of the two charges are primarily factual and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In respect of the Rape Charge, the key factual issue is whether the Victim had consented to the Accused’s act of performing sexual intercourse, and in particular whether she had consented to the Accused’s penetration of her vagina with his penis. The Accused did not deny that his penis penetrated the Victim’s vagina, albeit a little bit using the head of his penis. This requires the Court to consider:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether the Accused’s penetration of the Victim’s vagina with the head of his penis is a viable defence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The extent of the Victim’s intoxication, and whether she was so intoxicated that she would not have been able to give consent.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Whether the Victim had personal motives to fabricate the Rape Charge against the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the House-breaking Charge, the issue is whether the Victim did in fact invite the Accused into the Unit, or had the Accused entered the Unit unlawfully by retrieving the key from underneath the Unit’s main door.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I shall deal with the facts pertaining to the Rape Charge first.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Rape Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Accused penetrated the Victim with his penis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For there to be rape of the Victim, the Accused’s penis must penetrate her vagina. This is not an issue as the Accused admits that his penis did penetrate the Victim’s vagina. The Accused admitted in his first statement to the police, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 31 January Statement, which was given a day after the rape, that he might have penetrated the Victim’s vagina “a few times”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63  I cannot accept the Accused’s explanation. It is not a defence to an offence of rape if the Accused had penetrated the Victim’s vagina “a bit” using the head of his penis. Section 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code does not distinguish between full and partial penetration.

</div> The irrefutable scientific evidence is inconsistent with his repeated accounts that only a little bit of his penis entered the Victim’s vagina. If the Accused’s version were the truth, his DNA would not have been present deep in the Victim’s vagina. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 When confronted with this forensic evidence on the second last day of the trial, the Accused realised the serious inconsistency in his evidence, and that he had to explain the presence of his DNA deep in the Victim’s vagina. He, therefore, claimed, for the first time, to the surprise of everyone in Court, that he had used his finger to penetrate the Victim’s vagina.

</div> This, he thought, would have been able to explain satisfactorily the presence of his DNA deep in the Victim’s vagina. I cannot accept the Accused’s very belated explanation. Nowhere in his evidence or throughout the course of his testimony at the trial did the Accused ever claim to have penetrated the Victim’s vagina with his finger. Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that it was the first time that the Accused mentioned that he also used his finger to penetrate the Victim’s vagina.

It is clear that the Accused lied about informing Dr Phang that he had used his finger to penetrate the Victim’s vagina. When he was asked to explain, in the same breath, he retracted that claim and admitted he did not tell Dr Phang that he used his finger to penetrate the Victim’s vagina.

The Accused undressed the Victim and asked the Victim what clothes she wanted to wear. According to the Accused, the Victim just shook her head and stayed silent. The Accused then used a blanket to cover the Victim and lay beside her. The Accused claimed that they kissed and had intimate physical contact with each other. When the Accused observed that the Victim had groaned in pleasure, he removed his pants and rubbed his penis against her vagina.

</div> Responding to the Victim’s claim that she could not recall any of the events as alleged by the Accused, the Defence suggests that it is possible for the Victim to have given her consent to initiate sexual intercourse with the Accused, either by her words or by her conduct, despite her being unable to recall doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The Defence relies on the Victim’s testimony regarding her prior experience of being unable to recall having consumed noodles when she was intoxicated. While she did in fact consume noodles, the Victim could only remember this after someone had reminded her about that event. According to the Defence, this indicated that the Victim suffered from selective recollection whenever she is intoxicated.

They include the objective evidence such as the CCTV footage obtained from the basement carpark lift lobby of the Apartment dated 30 January 2017 (“the CCTV Footage”) and the medical evidence adduced before the Court. Further, the Accused’s evidence is also internally and externally inconsistent when compared with the evidence proffered by the other Prosecution’s witnesses. Thus, I find that the Accused presented a false narrative of the events leading up to the rape in order to establish his defence that the Victim had consented to have sexual intercourse with him during their sexual encounter in the early morning of 30 January 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I accept the Victim’s evidence as the true account of what had happened at the time of the sexual encounter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that she was heavily intoxicated and could not have woken up to open the Unit’s main door to invite the Accused into the Unit and to have consensual sex with the Accused.

The evidence points towards the Victim being heavily intoxicated and unconscious at the time of the sexual encounter.

</div> The CCTV Footage shows Henry carrying the Victim to the lift lobby and appearing exhausted. He was seen placing her on the ground waiting for the lift together with Ma. Ma pressed the lift button to call for the lift. Even though Henry had propped the Victim up against a wall, she could not lean against the wall and tipped over onto the floor. When the lift arrived, Ma held the lift door open while Henry tried to carry the Victim into the lift. He could not carry her fully into the lift but instead carried and dragged her into the lift. When she was brought into the lift, her body was unresponsive, and her limbs were lifeless. This shows that the Victim was impervious to external stimuli and was not even able to exert minimum force to support herself. Indeed, Henry described the Victim as a “dead weight”.

</div> It is thus clear, from the CCTV Footage, that the Victim was completely unconscious and helpless. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Given the Victim’s state as depicted in the CCTV Footage, it is highly unlikely that the Victim would have been conscious when the Accused returned to the Unit on the morning of 30 January 2017, after sending the rest of the Victim’s friends back home. The Defence did not dispute the accuracy and reliability of the CCTV Footage. Indeed, the Defence recognised that the Victim was so intoxicated to the extent that she “couldn’t even walk” and had to be carried by Ma and Henry up to the Unit.

That explains why the Victim did not respond to any of the Accused’s numerous calls which were made during his journey to the Unit the second time (see [31] above). Further, the Accused’s claim that the Victim had woken up to his ringing of the Unit’s doorbell and knocking on the main door could not have been possible. Indeed, it was inconceivable that the Victim could have brought herself to the main door, opened it, and responded meaningfully and relevantly to the Accused before inviting him in. Instead, it appears that the Victim was and remained completely incapacitated by the heavy intoxication when the Accused returned to the Unit. The CCTV Footage thus supports the Prosecution’s case that the Victim could not have given her consent to have sexual intercourse with the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I turn next to analyse the medical evidence adduced by the Prosecution to show that the Victim could not have been conscious right up to the time the Accused penetrated her vagina with his penis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Medical Evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 There are two sets of expert evidence that the Prosecution relies on to support its case that the Victim was so intoxicated that she could not have either been conscious or in the right state of mind to give her consent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Dr Lee’s expert report</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Dr Lee opined in his expert report that the Victim’s BAC level, at the time of the rape, ranged from 79mg/100ml to 232mg/100ml, with the average reading of 144mg/100ml. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Dr Lee explained that his findings were based on the report prepared by the HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory which measured the Victim’s BAC level during her medical examination at KKH on the morning of 30 January 2017. Using those results, Dr Lee explained that he applied a “non-linear mathematical model” and extrapolated the Victim’s BAC level backwards to arrive at the estimated range of BAC at the time of the alleged rape. Dr Lee explained that there were three possible BAC levels which could reflect the approximate BAC level in the Victim’s body at the time of the rape. These results were reached by considering three possible metabolic rates: individuals with very rapid metabolic rates; the average metabolic rate of the population; and individuals with slow metabolic rates.

</div> Depending on the Victim’s metabolic rate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> whether she has a fast, slow or average metabolic rate, her BAC level would also vary, from 232mg/100ml representing the BAC level in the Victim’s body at the time of the rape if she had a slow metabolic rate to 79mg/100ml if she had a fast metabolic rate. This range of BAC levels, according to Dr Lee, “may be associated with effects extending from mild to severe intoxication”.

</div> Dr Guo then elaborated on two states of amnesia. In the first state, an individual can suffer from complete amnesia and he or she is unable to recall the events that had occurred. Dr Guo described this as “complete anterograde amnesia”. However, Dr Guo clarified that it is possible for that individual to be able to recall the events that occurred despite suffering from complete anterograde amnesia. This can be done either by his or her own efforts, or that individual is reminded of the incident by someone else. In the second state, the individual may be able to remember fragments of the events that occurred. This may occur where another individual had assisted the person in recollecting the events that occurred, such as by showing images or videos to that person. Dr Guo termed this “partial anterograde amnesia”.

This will happen at around a BAC level range of between 100mg/100ml and 160mg/100ml.

</div> Dr Guo opined that the Victim was already heavily sedated. Accordingly, the Victim would by then have entered a state of stupor, such that she would have been unconscious.

The Victim’s unresponsiveness to external stimuli further supports Dr Guo’s finding that she was in a state of stupor.

On the Accused’s version, if the Victim could perform various complex actions, such as walking from her bedroom to the main door, unlocking the door, responding and talking to the Accused and walking back to the bedroom to have consensual sex with the Accused, Dr Guo opined that the Victim’s cognitive functions and state would have been functioning at full capacity. Accordingly, it would not have been possible for her, at any point in time, to have mistaken the Accused for her ex-boyfriend.

As for her mental state at the time the Accused raped her, Dr Guo explained that the Victim “would have been still fluctuating between deep sleep and partial awake state”. This was likely the case, according to Dr Guo, because of the Victim’s high average BAC level of 144 mg/100m.

</div> In other words, at the time the Accused penetrated the Victim, she was likely in a state of “deep sleep” or in a state of “partial awake”. Dr Guo further testified that when the Victim was in a state of “deep sleep”, this meant that she would be unconscious, and would definitely not have the capacity to consent. If the Victim was in the “partial awake” state, she would only have a “little bit of awareness” and would not have been conscious enough to appreciate her surroundings and consent to sex.

Instead, this could be attributed simply to the Victim suffering from amnesia. In making this point, the Defence relies on Dr Guo’s evidence that, while she was at the KTV Lounge, the Victim appeared to be conscious and aware of what she was doing, but she was in fact in a state of blackout and could not remember what she was doing at that time.

</div> That would explain why the Victim was unable to recall the fact of her opening the main door, inviting the Accused into the Unit, and having consensual sex with him.

I am aware that Dr Guo did mention in his cross-examination that, based solely on her estimated BAC level, the Victim could possibly be conscious at the material time of the rape. It is important to note, however, that Dr Guo gave his views following the Defence’s suggestion to rely only on the Victim’s estimated BAC level at the time of the rape, to the exclusion of other relevant evidence before him that he would have to consider in order to arrive at a proper clinical assessment of the Victim’s physical and mental state at the time of the rape.

</div> Dr Guo correctly and appropriately relied on three pieces of evidence, namely the HSA report with the estimated calculation of the Victim’s BAC level at the material time of the rape, the CCTV Footage which offered a visual depiction of the Victim’s unconscious state when she was carried to the Unit at 1.19am, and the Victim’s own account of the rape. I am satisfied that Dr Guo’s approach, which was based on the best available evidence to him, demonstrated a sound, logical and holistic clinical assessment of the Victim’s physical and mental state following alcohol intoxication. Further, the evidence that Dr Guo relied on in reaching his conclusions is objective. I find the Defence’s suggestion for Dr Guo to ignore these other crucial pieces of evidence to be highly artificial and would not have been reliable as it ignored the presence of other relevant evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Finally, I do not accept the Defence’s suggestion that the Victim was suffering from amnesia and hence was unable to recall whether she did in fact consent to have sexual intercourse with the Accused and that this does not negate the possibility that she did indeed give consent. This simply goes against the weight of the undisputed scientific medical evidence before the Court. As Dr Guo explained, the Victim was extremely intoxicated at the time of the rape, such that she was fluctuating between a state of “deep sleep” (and was thus unconscious) and “partial awake” (that she had limited awareness of her surroundings). It could simply not have been the case that the Victim was merely suffering from amnesia. Further, Dr Guo also explained that it was not possible for the Victim to be suffering from amnesia at that time, given that her BAC level was descending at the time of the rape.

However, I do not accept that this shows that the Victim was sufficiently conscious following the rape, such that she must also have been conscious at the time of the rape. Thus, in her state of confusion and intoxication, I find it entirely probable that the Victim might have unconsciously pressed some buttons on her smartphone and thus made calls to several phone numbers or pressed the wrong numbers in her attempt to call the police or her friends to seek assistance. Moreover, the Victim’s mental state was not only affected by her intoxication but was further aggravated by the traumatic and shocking experience of being raped by the Accused in her own bedroom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120  A few of the calls went through with durations ranging from half a minute to three minutes.

</div> Thus, I am unable to accept the Defence’s case that the Call Logs support the finding that the Victim was conscious and was able to give her consent to have sexual intercourse with the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Defence’s reliance on the Call Logs as evidence that the Victim was sufficiently conscious and hence possessed the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse is also speculative and inconclusive. As Dr Guo pointed out, it is important to ascertain whether there was any dialogue or conversation in these Log Calls. In the absence of any dialogues, the sole fact that the Victim had made or picked up calls for a certain duration is equivocal to the issue of whether she was conscious. This further supports the Prosecution’s case. Even if the Victim was conscious as alleged by the Accused, the evidence does not suggest that she consented to have sex with the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The Accused’s motive</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Defence also relies on the Accused’s calls to the Victim, which were recorded in the Call Logs while he was on the way to the Unit for the second time, to show that the Accused could not have had the motive to rape the Victim. The Defence submits that the only reason why the Accused had returned to the Unit was because he “was concerned for [the Victim] and because [she] didn’t pick up his calls”.

</div> The Accused would not have left trails of incriminating evidence if he, at that time, had known that the calls would be used as evidence against him. Further, the Accused thought that he could get away with the rape as the Victim was completely unconscious when he last saw her, and he never expected the Victim to suddenly wake up in the midst of the rape.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I reject the Defence’s arguments. The Accused testified that after he sent Heng home, he proceeded to drive back to the Apartment as he wanted to check on the Victim. The Accused made the first call to the Victim at 2.44am, after he decided to return to the Apartment.

</div> Thus, the Accused had already decided to return to the Apartment even before he made the first call. The Accused’s intention to return to the Unit to have sex with the Victim is evident from the Pre-Polygraph Interview, where the Accused informed SSI Chea that he “went back to look for the Victim to see if there was an opportunity to have sex with her”.

</div> Indeed, when the Accused left the Victim’s Unit together with Henry and Ma, he knew that the Victim was completely intoxicated and was in a stupor. The 12 calls which the Accused made was, therefore, to confirm that the Victim remained intoxicated and unconscious. This would enable him to take advantage of the Victim’s unconsciousness to outrage her modesty with a view to rape her. The Accused’s reliance on the Call Logs does not necessarily indicate that he was “concerned” for the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Even on the Accused’s account, if the Accused truly showed concern for the Victim, he would have displayed his relief when the Victim opened the main door and spoke to him upon his arrival at the Unit the second time. This showed that she would have been sober and conscious and more importantly, that she was safe. Indeed, the Accused admitted this in Court:

</div> There was, therefore, no reason for him to have remained in the Unit for such a long time. In this context, it would have been entirely unnecessary and inappropriate for him to have entered the Victim’s Unit and followed her into her bedroom in the early hours of the morning, let alone to remain in the Unit for about 40 minutes, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from 3.04am to 3.44am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The Accused said that the Victim had opened the Unit’s main door and gone back into her bedroom while leaving the door open.

</div> Even if that was the case, the Accused should have asked a female friend of the Victim, such as Ma, to change it for her when they first arrived at the Unit. It is clearly inappropriate for the Accused, a male and a stranger to the Victim, to change her dress in her bedroom. Even on the Accused’s account that the Victim was conscious, there was no valid reason that she could not change her dress on her own. It was inappropriate for the Accused to have done all that he did. The only logical explanation why the Accused had undressed the Victim was to advance his sinister motive of molesting and eventually raping the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130  Thus, the Call Logs, together with the other evidence presented by the Prosecution, support the case that the Accused took full advantage of the Victim’s complete helplessness to rape her.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The Accused gave multiple versions of the important events leading to the rape. His case as set out in the 31 January Statement was remarkedly different from his defence in Court as his defence has constantly evolved in the course of five years. This is evident when I compared the Accused’s account in the 31 January Statement with the Accused’s Pre-Polygraph Interview, the 27 October Statement, his subsequent interview with Dr Phang at the Changi Remand Prison on 25 and 29 September and 2 October 2020 (“the IMH Interview”), his account as reflected in the case for the defence (“the CFD”), and his oral testimony in the trial. It is pertinent to note that the Accused admitted that all his statements given by him before the trial were voluntary without any threat, inducement or promise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 There are four critical events leading up to the rape which the Accused had given, and these contain internally inconsistent versions. The first is the Accused’s narration of what happened when he arrived at the KTV Lounge. The second is the Accused’s account of how he came to obtain the Address, the Access Code and the Phone Number. The third is the Accused’s explanation of how he managed to gain entry to the Unit for the second time. And the last is the Accused’s account of his interactions with the Victim following his entry into the Unit and until the sexual encounter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Having considered the evidence, I am satisfied that the Accused’s evidence is in total shambles. There were numerous material contradictions and inconsistencies in the Defence. Hence, the Accused’s defence is unreliable, and he was clearly not truthful in his various accounts of the events. This severely undermined the reliability of the various statements which he gave and the credibility of his testimony in Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 I shall now analyse each portion of the Accused’s evidence in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">The Accused’s account of the events at the KTV Lounge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In the 31 January Statement, the Accused claimed that it was Heng who had introduced him to the rest of the group, including the Victim.

</div> Further, the Accused claimed that the Victim had sat next to him, and she offered the Accused a drink as they chatted. However, the Accused did not mention in the 31 January Statement that the Victim was physically intimate towards him and sat on his lap, hugged him and kissed him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In the Pre-Polygraph Interview, which occurred on 22 September 2017, some eight months after the Accused gave the 31 January Statement, he raised for the first time that he and the Victim had allegedly engaged in “intimate behaviour” at the KTV Lounge. Specifically, the Accused claimed that the Victim “was hugging him and telling him that she was lonely and inviting him to look for her at her house”.

There was no mention of the Victim sitting on the Accused’s lap and kissing him in the 27 October Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Some three years and eight months later, after the Accused was charged in Court for rape and other offences, a psychiatric assessment was conducted on him. When he was interviewed by Dr Phang, the Accused raised for the first time further acts of physical intimacy which he engaged in with the Victim at the KTV Lounge. Indeed, the Accused agreed during his cross-examination that this was indeed the first time he gave such an account, but he had not informed Dr Phang of this discrepancy.

This incident of physical intimacy by the Victim at the KTV Lounge is critically important to the Accused’s defence that he perceived the Victim’s acts as an invitation to the Accused to have sexual intercourse with her.

</div> These facts were only brought up for the first time close to four years after the rape had occurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Accused developed and exaggerated his account of the interactions with the Victim at the KTV Lounge. The acts of physical intimacy became more extensive and detailed with each account. The purported intimacy allegedly initiated by the Victim was not supported and not witnessed by those present at the KTV Lounge, which was a small karaoke room, other than Heng, who is his long-time childhood friend. But Heng, like the Accused, is not a reliable witness and his evidence is not credible. I shall deal with Heng’s evidence at [215]–[237] below. Accordingly, I find that the Accused had falsified and embellished this aspect of his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">The Accused’s evidence of how he obtained the Address, the Unit Number, the Access Code and the Phone Number</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145  The Accused said that the Victim gave him the Address together with the Unit number (“the Unit Number”), the Access Code, and the Phone Number at the KTV Lounge. This version was inconsistent throughout the Accused’s testimony. The narrative and explanation of how the Accused came to have these information appear to evolve over time in his various accounts given to the police, to Dr Phang during the IMH Interview, in the CFD, and before this Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The Accused claimed in the 31 January Statement that he knew the Access Code as the Victim had told him the code earlier at the KTV Lounge.

</div> This is to show that the Victim was interested in him when they were in the KTV Lounge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152  In view of the serious contradictions, the Accused’s testimony that the Victim had given the Accused the Address cannot be believed. If indeed that was the truth, the Accused would have told the police of this in the 31 January Statement. Instead, in the 31 January Statement, the Accused claimed to have been unable to recall the Address. This was despite the Accused saying at the trial that the Apartment’s address was simple and easy to remember.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Similarly, I am unable to accept the Accused’s testimony that the Victim had given him the Phone Number while they were at the KTV Lounge. As I have stated above, the Accused volunteered this information to SIO Noor in the 31 January Statement that he had obtained the Phone Number from Heng, after the 31 January Statement was read over to him and he chose to include this fact in his first statement to the police. This is further supported by Heng’s evidence that he did in fact provide the Accused with the Phone Number. I shall consider this in greater detail at [235]–[237] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 As to how the Accused came to know the Unit Number, I likewise am unable to accept the Accused’s version that the Victim had provided this to the Accused. Instead, I accept that the Accused had obtained the Unit Number from her friends. This was the account which the Accused had voluntarily given to SIO Noor in his 27 October Statement. I have no reason to doubt the voluntariness of the Accused’s evidence in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Finally, I do not accept the Accused’s evidence that the Victim had provided him with the Access Code. Instead, the Accused came to know the Access Code when he was helping Henry and Ma carry the Victim to the Apartment from the car the first time he went to the Apartment. I shall consider this at [202]–[205] below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(III) <span class="font-italic">The Accused’s version of how he gained entry to the Unit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The third aspect of the Accused’s evidence, which is significantly important, relates to his narrative on how he entered the Unit the second time he went to the Apartment. There are also serious and critical inconsistencies. In total, the Accused gave four different accounts of how he had re-entered the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In the 31 January Statement, the Accused informed SIO Noor that he was able to access the Unit by “using [the] key that was slid underneath [the Unit’s main] door”. The Accused claimed to have found a satay stick on the floor where there were rubbish bins, before he entered the Apartment’s side gate. He decided to use the satay stick to retrieve the key as he “was worried of the key was too inside and … cannot took [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] it out”.

</div> In other words, the Accused’s account in his first statement to the police one day after the rape was that he had used a satay stick to retrieve the Unit’s main door key from underneath the door. The key had earlier been slid underneath the door when the Accused, Henry and Ma left the Unit after carrying the Victim home. The Accused maintained this account in the Pre-Polygraph Interview six months after the rape, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he “managed to gain access into [the Unit] by retrieving [the Victim’s] key that was earlier slipped underneath [the main door of the Unit]”.

In particular, the Accused retracted his earlier account of using a satay stick to retrieve the main door’s key to enter the Unit. Instead, he claimed that he “had actually used [his] ‘Genting’ membership card to hook out the key from under the door” as the satay stick which he had originally used “broke when [the Accused] try to hook the key out”.

</div> If indeed the Accused could not remember how he retrieved the key, he could have simply told the police that he could not remember how he retrieved the key when the 31 January Statement was recorded. This would mean that he did retrieve the key to enter the Unit but could not remember how he did it. This would have been completely different from his account in Court which he said he rang the doorbell numerous times, knocked on the main door and the Victim opened the door and invited him into the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The Accused again changed his account of how he gained entry to the Unit during the IMH Interview.

</div> The Accused then proceeded to give Dr Phang two contrasting accounts as to how he gained access to the Unit for the second time at 3.04am on 30 January 2017. The first account was provided in the first interview with Dr Phang on 25 September 2020. Dr Phang said that the Accused had spent “nearly the first 1½ hours of … [the] first interview informing [Dr Phang] … that [the Accused] had … used what he described as a satay stick which he had found to hook the key out from under the door, so that he could then use the key to gain entry into the alleged [V]ictim’s [U]nit.”

Instead, it was the Victim who opened the main door and invited the Accused into the Unit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 This final narrative cuts at the core of both the defence to the House-breaking Charge and the Rape Charge. The Accused’s defence for the House-breaking Charge is that he entered the Unit lawfully as the Victim opened the main door and invited him to enter. As for the Rape Charge, the Accused alleges that the Victim had opened the main door and invited the Accused to enter the Unit as well as into her bedroom. According to the Defence, this showed that the Victim was sober and conscious. Thus, the sexual intercourse with the Victim would have been consensual as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 It is significant to note that only the Accused, Ma and Henry knew that the key to the main door of the Unit was slid under the door. Further, nobody knew how the Accused entered the Unit the second time. Only the Accused knew of this fact. Indeed, in the 31 January Statement, SIO Noor did not know how the Accused had entered the Unit. SIO Noor wanted to know how the Accused entered the Unit.

</div> Thus, when the Accused informed the police one day after the rape as to how he entered the Unit, the details of that revelation could only come from the Accused and nobody else. In other words, the Accused volunteered this information to the police. This speaks volumes as to the contemporaneity and the accuracy of the Accused’s account. Indeed, when the Accused realised that the revelation was significantly damaging to his defence to both the House-breaking Charge and the Rape Charge, he began to modify his evidence on how he entered the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The Accused was not truthful when he testified in Court that he neither used the satay stick nor his Genting membership card to retrieve the key, but that he rang the doorbell and knocked on the main door. It is also not true that the Victim opened the door and invited the Accused into the Unit. I accept Dr Guo’s evidence that the Victim would in all likelihood be in deep sleep due to heavy intoxication (see [105] above). Instead, I find that the Accused’s version to the police that he had used the satay stick to retrieve the key to enter the unit was the most likely explanation for how he gained entry to the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(IV) <span class="font-italic">The Accused’s account of his interactions with the Victim in the Unit which led to the sexual encounter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The Accused’s evidence about his interactions with the Victim after he entered the Unit and in the Victim’s bedroom was also internally inconsistent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In the Accused’s accounts before the trial, he claimed that the Victim either remained silent, nodded or shook her head in response to the Accused’s supposed questions, or gave basic responses or incoherent responses.

</div> The issue here is not whether or not the police would have believed the Accused. The Accused was duty-bound to tell the truth to the police. There is, therefore, no explicable basis to justify the Alleged Phobia. The Alleged Phobia is merely an excuse to convince the Court to disregard his incriminating statements which he voluntarily gave to the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The Accused’s allegation that he had the Alleged Phobia is also further contradicted by the objective facts. In the text messages sent between the Accused and Ma, which were retrieved by the TCFB following a forensic examination of the Accused’s handphone after its seizure by the police, the Accused informed Ma to “help [the Accused] tell [the Victim] I m [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] really very very sorry” and that the Accused “will go police station to surrender”. In a follow up message to Ma, the Accused texted “[p]ls forgive me for what I did, I will face the consequence [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”.

</div> The Accused’s willingness to voluntarily surrender himself to the police does not support his claim that he had the Alleged Phobia. Instead, this conversation with Ma, that he was very sorry and willing to surrender to the police, shows the Accused’s guilt and he knew that he had raped the Victim. He knew it was a serious offence and sought forgiveness from the Victim through Ma, hoping that the Victim would not report him to the police. At that time, the Accused did not know that the Victim had already reported the Accused to the police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Further, I find that the Alleged Phobia, which the Accused asserts to have led him to be “confused”, to not remember things correctly, to “say the wrong things” and to “make it worse” when attempting to “rectify things”,

</div> Yet he did not tell him that he had the Alleged Phobia. As the Prosecution points out, Dr Phang would have been the perfect person for the Accused to inform about the Alleged Phobia. It baffles the mind that the Accused was comfortable enough to reveal to Dr Phang topics ranging from illicit drug use that he had never been arrested for, to his sexual preferences of masturbating, to stolen female undergarments, but not the Alleged Phobia.

</div> The Accused has provided no justifications for why the Court should cherry-pick the Accused’s evidence and accept those that are beneficial to his defence. Indeed, the Accused’s feeble attempt to ask the Court to selectively adopt his evidence in Court is evidently self-serving. According to the Accused, the incriminating aspects of his police statements are not true as he had the Alleged Phobia. If indeed he had the Alleged Phobia, one would have expected both the incriminating and exculpatory portions to be affected. But the Accused said that the exculpatory portions are true and anything incriminating him in the police statements is false. This made his explanation that he had the Alleged Phobia incredible and unbelievable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 Ultimately, the protean-like nature of the Accused’s evidence is not favourable to his defence. On the contrary, the constant changes in crucial aspects of the evidence to conveniently adapt to his defence in Court have irretrievably tarnished his credibility and reliability as a witness. That being said, I acknowledge that the 31 January Statement is the first long statement given voluntarily by the Accused one day after the rape. This statement is the contemporaneous evidence available before the Court. The incidents in the KTV Lounge and the subsequent events leading to the rape of the Victim would thus have been fresh in the Accused’s mind. However, it does not necessarily follow that all its contents are the truth. In view of the numerous inconsistencies across the Accused’s evidence, the Court has to evaluate the Accused’s evidence carefully and cautiously to sieve out the grains of truth from the mass of falsehoods instead of rejecting the entire defence of the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Accused’s evidence is externally inconsistent </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189  The Accused’s evidence is also externally inconsistent with the evidence before the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 First, the Accused’s allegation of the Victim’s intimacy towards him at the KTV Lounge is contradicted and not supported by the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses at the KTV Lounge. In so far as the Accused sought to rely on Heng’s testimony to buttress his account, I find that Heng’s testimony is unreliable and should not be accepted (see [237] below). Second, the Accused’s account as to how he obtained the Access Code, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it was the Victim who gave it to him, is also contradicted by the objective evidence. Finally, regarding the Accused’s claim that the Victim was conscious at the time of the rape and was thus able to give her consent, the Accused’s evidence is contradicted by both the CCTV Footage and the medical and forensic evidence presented by the Prosecution to the Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">The Accused’s allegation that the Victim was intimate with him at the KTV Lounge is contradicted by evidence from the Prosecution’s witnesses </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The Prosecution relies on the testimonies of its witnesses to support its case that the Accused’s allegation that the Victim sat on his lap, hugged and kissed him at the KTV Lounge was fabricated.

Henry explained that if it were true that the Victim was intimate with the Accused, he “would have just left [the Victim] … and go straight home instead of bringing [the Victim] back to her house”, as his house was “quite near” to the KTV Lounge.

Indeed, Henry confirmed in re-examination that his purpose of accompanying the Victim home was to ensure that she got home safely. As Henry is the Victim’s friend, he would not have allowed the Accused to drive the Victim home alone as she was already unconscious.

</div> and therefore nothing to stop the Victim’s friends from witnessing this supposed intimacy if it did in fact happen.

</div> This was speculative at best. The fact that the witnesses did not see the Accused and the Victim behaving in a physically intimate manner at the KTV Lounge means that there was no physical intimacy. The KTV Lounge was a small karaoke room and if the Victim had been physically intimate towards the Accused, the witnesses there would have seen it, or at least a few of the witnesses would have noticed it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Accordingly, the Accused’s allegation that the Victim was intimate towards him at the KTV Lounge cannot be believed. The Accused and the Victim first met at the KTV Lounge. It is difficult to believe that the Victim would have been openly intimate with the Accused, whom she met for the first time, in the presence of her friends. Indeed, the Victim testified that this could not have been the case, especially since it was her first time meeting the Accused at the KTV Lounge.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The Prosecution’s witnesses’ description of the Victim’s unconscious state is further corroborated by the CCTV Footage. The CCTV Footage is an independent and objective evidence. As I have described above at [80], the CCTV Footage shows Henry carrying the Victim to the lift lobby. The Victim appeared to be completely unresponsive, and her limbs were lifeless as Henry dragged her into the lift. To my mind, this further indicates that the Victim was in a state of stupor and was unconscious when she reached the Unit. It is impossible that, within a short span of two hours, the Victim would have fully recovered from alcohol intoxication and would have regained substantially her consciousness, her psychomotor skills, and had the presence of mind to react to her surroundings. I have accepted Dr Guo’s evidence (see [112] above) that the Victim would still be heavily intoxicated and unconscious when the Accused raped her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213  The Accused’s narrative that the Victim was not intoxicated but was in fact sober when she opened the main door for him to enter the Unit is also contradicted by the medical evidence. Dr Guo’s evidence is that the Victim would have been in the process of recovering from the effects of alcohol intoxication. Thus, she would have been fluctuating between deep sleep and being partially awake, such that she was unlikely to have been alert. The Victim would not have had sufficient cognitive abilities or sufficient mental capacity to either consent to or to reject the Accused’s request for sexual intercourse, neither would she have had sufficient physical capacity or cognitive abilities to perform the acts that the Accused claimed she had done (see [105] above).

The Accused sought to rely on Heng’s evidence to support his account in respect of three factual areas of his defence: (a) that he saw the Accused and the Victim behaving intimately in the KTV Lounge; (b) the Victim’s state of intoxication at the KTV Lounge; and (c) the conversation between the Accused and Heng while the Accused was sending Heng back home and how the Accused obtained the Phone Number.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216  The Prosecution cross-examined Heng on his previous contemporaneous police statement given on 31 January 2017 (“Heng’s Police Statement” or “Police Statement”) pursuant to s 147(1) of the EA. Section 147 of the EA states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">147.</span>—(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him or her in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he or she is cross‑examined, without such writing being shown to him or her or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him or her by the writing, his or her attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him or her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Section 147(1) of the EA thus provides for a witness to be cross-examined as to his previous statements in writing for the purpose of impeaching his credit. In <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211, Yong Pung How CJ observed at [22] (citing <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Sng Siew Ngoh</span> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 755 at [20]) that s 147 of the EA “applies to cross-examination of previous statements <span class="font-italic">in any proceeding</span>, be it for the impeachment of a witness’s credit, refreshment of memory or otherwise” [emphasis added]. Section 147(1) of the EA is, therefore, not limited to situations involving the cross-examination of a witness for the purpose of impeaching that witness’s credibility. In the present case, the Prosecution wanted to show that there were material discrepancies between Heng’s oral testimony and Heng’s Police Statement. That was why the Prosecution sought to cross-examine Heng in respect of Heng’s Police Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 There were material inconsistencies between Heng’s testimony in Court and what Heng had said in the Police Statement.

</div> In that statement, Heng claimed that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember what had happened after the Accused arrived. There was also no mention of any physical intimacy between the Accused and the Victim in Heng’s Police Statement. It was thus clear that Heng’s contemporaneous evidence to the police was that he had not seen the Accused and the Victim engaging in physical intimacy. But this is completely different from Heng’s conditioned statement and his testimony in Court, where he claimed to have a clear recollection of the Victim seated on the Accused’s lap, kissing and hugging the Accused. Heng is not a truthful and reliable witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 If Heng could not remember the events that occurred at the KTV Lounge the day after the Victim was raped by the Accused which was what he said in his Police Statement, it would be impossible for him to testify, after more than five years, that he remembered the Accused and the Victim were behaving intimately at the KTV Lounge.

He is not truthful and reliable. His testimony in Court varies significantly from the account given in Heng’s Police Statement. Further, Heng has embellished his evidence in order to support the Accused’s defence. As I have considered above, there are numerous serious and material contradictions in Heng’s various evidence, both internally and externally. This severely undermines Heng’s credibility as a witness. Further, Heng made several concessions that are detrimental to the Accused’s defence, including that he did not actually see the Accused and the Victim behaving intimately at the KTV Lounge, that the Victim was heavily intoxicated when she was sent by the group back to the Unit, and that Heng had actually given the Accused the Phone Number. These concessions inflict multiple critical dents in the Defence’s case. The Accused thus cannot rely on Heng’s evidence to support his changing narratives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 I shall now consider the Victim’s evidence and her testimony in Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) The Victim’s evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 For the reasons I shall give below, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that the Victim’s evidence was compelling, clear, coherent, internally consistent, and was corroborated by all of the other evidence presented at the trial.

This was because she was still intoxicated and was thus not aware of her surroundings or in full control of her actions. In her words, she was “not completely sober but [she] could differentiate things”.

Given the short duration between the sexual encounter and these events, the Defence says that the Victim would likely have been in a similar state of consciousness at the time of the sexual encounter.

Further, as I have mentioned above, SSG Kamisah’s account was corroborated by Ma’s account.

</div> She would thus have more experience and would have been more observant of the demeanour and distressed conditions of victims of sexual crimes, namely the Victim’s condition.

Although the “unusually convincing” standard may not apply to her testimony, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Victim’s evidence is not credible. Further, I find that she is honest, truthful and reliable. Nevertheless, the Court has to be vigilant and must exercise great caution in analysing the evidence of both the Victim and the Accused. I observe the Victim to have testified in a straightforward manner. She did not appear evasive, nor did she appear to be hiding anything.

And as I have found above, Dr Guo’s evidence was, with that BAC level, the Victim would have been in a state of stupor and would have been unconscious and unresponsive to external stimuli.

The fundamental issue is whether the Victim was lying in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Lewis Christine v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 131 at [19], the High Court stated that “a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness”. The Victim’s conduct of having perjured herself in the Sham Marriage Proceedings, which occurred some five years ago, ought not to have had any bearing on the Victim’s credibility and reliability in the present proceedings. None of that background, coloured as it may be, affects my finding that the Victim was a candid and reliable witness in the present case. She did not embellish her evidence and she spoke the truth which is corroborated by other evidence. Her evidence was not in any way tarnished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 More importantly, the Victim was forthcoming, and she admitted in her interview with SIO Foo that she had committed perjury in the Sham Marriage Proceedings.

These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies.

But the effects of alcohol intoxication are not instantaneous. Further, the fact that the Victim did not appear intoxicated prior to arriving at the KTV Lounge did not mean that her state of intoxication would not worsen. The Victim continued to consume alcohol at the KTV Lounge. As Dr Guo opined, the Victim’s BAC level would be at its highest after she had left the KTV Lounge and returned to the Unit (see [99] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 As for the Victim’s evidence that she had difficulties recollecting the events at the KTV Lounge, the differences between her evidence and the evidence provided by the Prosecution’s witnesses were not material to affect her credibility.

The Victim thus cannot be expected to recall all the details of what had happened at the KTV Lounge with specificity.

For instance, the Victim generally could not recall the events at the KTV Lounge and had no recollection of the Accused being at the KTV Lounge. This is consistent with Dr Guo’s evidence that the Victim’s level of intoxication at that time would have caused her to suffer from amnesia.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 The factual inconsistencies which the Defence rely on to demonstrate that the Victim’s evidence is not “unusually convincing” are not germane. What is relevant is whether there is any material inconsistency in the Victim’s evidence pertaining to her state of intoxication at the time of the rape, and whether she was able to consent to have sexual intercourse with the Accused. The Defence does not raise any such evidence. Accordingly, the Victim’s reliability and credibility are not tarnished. Her evidence that she was raped by the Accused remains “unusually convincing”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The credibility and reliability of the Accused’s testimony</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 The Accused, on the other hand, was parsimonious with the truth. Further, the Accused kept changing his evidence on significant events that I have mentioned above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 The Accused sought to explain why the incriminating aspects of his evidence in his police statements were not true as compared to his testimony in Court. He attributed it to the Alleged Phobia. This reason is unbelievable. When the Accused was asked by the police to give the 31 January Statement, it was certainly not the first time that he was in a police station. Yet he did not tell SIO Noor that he had the Alleged Phobia. Neither did he inform Dr Phang, the psychiatrist whom he said he was comfortable talking to, that he had the Alleged Phobia. But regardless of whether he had the Alleged Phobia, the Accused was expected to tell the whole truth to the police. Telling the truth to the police in the investigation of the offence of rape is the crux of the matter, and not whether the Accused had the Alleged Phobia. What is more damning is that, despite the Alleged Phobia, he was able to provide the police the other aspects of the case that are not incriminating or less incriminating to his defence of consensual sex. This selective rejection of incriminating aspects of his police statements because of the Alleged Phobia is difficult to believe. This is especially so when he admitted that he had voluntarily given all his statements to the police without threat, inducement or promise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 Beyond the internal contradictions in his evidence, the Accused has also lied numerous times in the face of objective forensic and scientific evidence before the Court. The forensic evidence in the form of the DNA analysis of the high vaginal swab conducted by Ms Tang showed that the Accused’s DNA was found in the high region of the Victim’s vagina. This indicates that his penis had penetrated deep into her vagina. Against this independent forensic evidence, the Accused claimed that his penis only entered “[j]ust a bit” into the Victim’s vagina. To counter the forensic evidence, the Accused suddenly alleged that he used his finger to penetrate deep into the Victim’s vagina. But as I have found at [67]–[69] above, this evidence was raised for the first time on the second last day of the trial, and appears to be an embellishment on the Accused’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 The Accused alleges that the Victim was sober to consent to the sexual intercourse. The Accused’s evidence that he had obtained the Victim’s consent prior to having sexual intercourse with her is simply unacceptable in light of the evidence, especially the medical and forensic evidence. Dr Lee’s and Dr Guo’s expert opinions support the finding that the Victim’s BAC level at the time of the rape would have been very high, with an average of 144mg/100ml, and that she could not have had the capacity to give her consent for the sexual intercourse. The Accused has not challenged the expert evidence. He did not adduce his own expert evidence to support his narrative or to contradict those that were adduced by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 In totality, therefore, I find that the Accused is not a truthful witness and his evidence is highly unreliable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(8) The Defence’s allegations regarding the Victim’s motives for reporting the rape</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The Accused alleged that the Victim reported him to the police for rape as she wanted to remain in Singapore</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 The Defence argues that the Victim had fabricated the allegation of rape against the Accused in order to remain in Singapore for a longer period to assist in the police investigations. In support, the Defence relies on the various WeChat messages which Angela sent to Heng sometime around 14 February 2019. In those messages, Angela alleged that the Victim might have made the false report against the Accused to obtain a special pass from the ICA to remain in Singapore. Angela also suggested that the Victim might have forced her friends to give false statements or evidence and threatened the others.

</div> Thus, it appears that Angela was motivated to inform Heng of the unverified suspicions about the Victim because she wanted to take revenge against the Victim for badmouthing her. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283  Angela’s account,<span class="font-italic"> ie</span>, that her allegation against the Victim was speculative, is supported by Heng’s testimony in cross-examination.

</div> It was also the Accused who chose to unlawfully enter the Unit and go into the Victim’s bedroom. Thus, the allegation that the Victim fabricated the evidence of rape does not hold water. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 The allegation that the Victim had sought to entrap the Accused required a great deal of elaborate and careful planning and execution. It would require the Victim to tempt the Accused at the KTV Lounge, lure and invite him into the Unit, physically caressed him, allowing herself to be raped by the Accused, disengage in the midst of penetration, and to then call the police .

</div> Indeed, if the Victim had intended to fabricate an allegation of rape against the Accused, why did she not simply engage in sexual intercourse with the Accused and then threatened the Accused to make a police report in order to blackmail him thereafter? Why go through all these elaborate and unnecessary steps, such as getting drunk at the KTV Lounge, having her friends and the Accused carry her back, and taking a chance that the Accused would return to the Unit to have sexual intercourse with her? Further, the Victim’s state of intoxication, which worsened as the night progressed, meant that she could not have had the presence of mind to conjure up such an elaborate plan to ensnare the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 When the Victim called the police immediately after the Accused left the Unit, she risked disclosing evidence of the illegal beauty treatments that she conducted at the Unit. Despite this risk, the Victim was prepared to jeopardise her livelihood, in order to seek justice for the wrong that the Accused had clearly done to her.

This is a huge sum which the Accused could ill afford to pay even by instalments. Further, as the Prosecution argues, if the entire matter was truly a misunderstanding, and if the Accused truly had consensual sex with the Victim, there was no reason why the Accused would have to seek the Victim’s forgiveness, much less for him to agree to “face the consequences”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 Further, when the matter regarding compensation was discussed, Ma had not informed the Accused that the Victim had called the police.

The Accused was hoping that the huge monetary compensation would save him from the risk of being charged for rape. The Accused knew that he took advantage of the Victim in her state of deep sleep and had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. He wanted to pay off the Victim to secure her silence as he was afraid that she would go to the police to report him for rape. Since the Accused did not know that the Victim had already reported the incident to the police, the Accused thought that by offering the Victim monetary compensation, she might not report the Accused to the police for rape. Indeed, the Accused admitted that if he had known that the Victim had already reported to the police, he would not have offered compensation. His action of offering monetary compensation is not consistent with the behaviour of an innocent person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 The Accused’s offer of compensation of a huge sum of money in order to purchase the Victim’s silence is further evident from the text messages between the Accused and Heng, which was retrieved following the TCFB’s forensic analysis of the Accused’s handphone. The Accused had sent to Heng screenshots of his text messages between himself and Ma, and he told Heng “[w]ait, later, can reduce <span class="font-italic">bo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[which means “is it possible” in colloquial terms], after she drop the case”.

Indeed, the Accused acknowledged in his cross-examination that the Victim’s behaviour at the KTV Lounge, even if it had occurred, would at best indicate the Victim’s interest in the Accused:

In other words, the Victim was unconscious at the time of the alleged rape, right up to the point when the Accused inserted his penis into the Victim’s vagina. As Dr Guo had explained, the BAC level in the Victim’s body would have been at around 144mg/100ml. The Victim was thus in a state of deep sleep. It follows that it would have been impossible for her to have been awake, to be aware of her surroundings, to respond to the Accused’s sexual advances, or sufficiently conscious to have provided her consent to the Accused to have sexual intercourse. Indeed, the Victim’s state of intoxication obviously meant that she would not have had the capacity to make decisions or choices, including to consent to the Accused having sexual intercourse with her. Accordingly, I accept the Prosecution’s case that the Victim was unconscious at the time of the rape.

</div> It appears from the evidence that the Accused took advantage of the Victim’s vulnerability, outraged her modesty, and eventually penetrated his penis deep into the Victim’s vagina without her consent, and thereby committed rape. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 My finding also puts to rest the Defence’s suggestion that the Victim was conscious at the time of the rape. But for completeness, I turn to address that aspect of the Defence’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 In support of this, the Defence points out that the Victim could feel the Accused’s penis penetrating her vagina and had pushed the Accused away, that she had the presence of mind to ask the Accused for his identity, and that she could remember what the Accused wore at the material time of the rape. Further, the Accused claimed that the Victim thereafter got out of her bed to check her safe and she also checked the Accused’s handphone. The Accused also claimed that the Victim had gone out of her bedroom, picked up a beer can, and threw the beer can down from the balcony.

The prosecution in that case argued that the victim did not consent to the sexual acts as the victim was so intoxicated that she would not have been able to consent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 In any case, from the brief facts as reported in the media, the facts in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew Sin</span> are significantly different from this instant case. The victim in that case was found to have consumed five pints of beer prior to the sexual encounter. In the present case, it is undisputed that the Victim had consumed a large amount of alcohol of different varieties spread out across a significant duration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from the time the Victim was celebrating the Chinese New Year in the Unit to the time she was at the KTV Lounge). It is, therefore, likely that the Victim’s BAC level would have been higher than the victim’s BAC level in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew Sin</span>. The Victim was unconscious when she and her friends left the KTV Lounge and had to be carried to her Unit. The victim in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew Sin</span> was not intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 I am satisfied that, given the Victim’s BAC level at the material time of the rape, her understanding and awareness of her surrounding remained impaired, such that she lacked the ability to give her consent. This is consistent with Dr Guo’s evidence that if the Victim were in a “partial awake” state, she would only have a “little bit of awareness” and would not have been conscious enough to appreciate her surroundings and consent to sex. Indeed, on the Accused’s own evidence, the Victim was not even capable of responding verbally to him, much less capable of consenting to sex.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">312 On the other hand, Pang J found that the victim in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew Sin</span> appeared to retain some level of cognitive capacity as glimpsed from her conduct following her consumption of alcohol up to the point of the sexual encounter. This included the victim responding relevantly and meaningfully to Tan when asked questions, and that she supposedly said she was “not ready” to leave the car and was searching for her wallet to pay for the ride. Further, when the victim behaved emotionally in the car and banged her head on the window, she would stop each time Tan urged her to stop. Pang J found that this illustrated the victim’s awareness of what Tan was saying to her and her decision to accept his suggestion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 Accordingly, it is clear that the extent of and effect of intoxication between the victim in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yew Sin</span> and the Victim was clearly materially different. In the present case, the Victim was unconscious and was in deep sleep as a result of her earlier heavy intoxication. The Victim was awakened by the sexual assault of the Accused when he raped her. In this vein, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pr</span><span class="font-italic">am Nair</span> held at [96(d)] that a person who has limited awareness of what is happening cannot be taken as having the capacity to consent. That person, despite having limited awareness, may nevertheless have such an impaired understanding or knowledge as to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision of whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act. I am therefore satisfied that, even if the Victim was in the “partial awake” state, her mental faculties were sufficiently impaired at the time of the rape, such that she could not have had the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse with the Accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 Further, in respect of the Accused’s account of the Victim’s behaviour after the rape, the Defence submits that the Victim had sufficient cognitive function.

As I have stated at [45] above, the Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (a) the Accused had committed the act of house-breaking “after 7 p.m. and before 7 a.m.”; (b) the Accused had entered the Unit by opening the locked main door without the Victim’s permission; and (c) he entered the Unit with the intent to rape the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">317 The Defence submits that it was not possible for the Accused to have entered the Unit by unlawfully retrieving the key from under the main door. The Defence relies on the following in support of its case. First, the alleged satay stick used by the Accused to retrieve the key could not be found at the crime scene. Second, the police had failed to obtain any fingerprints from the main door’s key. Third, Henry’s evidence was that, at the time he left the Unit with Ma and the Accused, he had slid the key underneath the main door. Henry further claimed that, from his perspective, the key was “far away” and could not be retrieved.

</div> The use of the satay stick was revealed by the Accused to the police in the 31 January Statement. This was a day after the rape and by which time the satay stick could have been disposed of by the cleaners. Further, the fingerprint testing or DNA retrieval of the key may result in a negative outcome as the Accused may not have left his fingerprint on the key or may have left too little DNA behind to have provided a sufficient profile.

</div> The hard facts are that only three people knew that the key was slid under the main door. The Accused was one of the three and he was the only one who returned to the Unit shortly after the key was slid under the main door. The Accused was the only one who knew that he could enter the Unit by using the satay stick to retrieve the key. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 As for Henry’s evidence, he said the key was pushed “far enough”. This was a subjective assessment. Henry could not estimate the distance the key had slid under the main door. It is common sense that it is not easy to forcefully slide the key into the Unit when the gap under the door is very small.

</div> In any case, had the Accused assessed that the key could not be retrieved from under the main door, he would not have returned to the Unit as he knew that the Victim was completely unconscious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 The Defence further argues that, given the purported gaps in the Prosecution’s case regarding how the Accused entered the Unit on the House-breaking Charge, the Prosecution fails to make out its case beyond a reasonable doubt. To this end, the Defence refers to the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>”) at [2] and [87]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2 … <span class="font-italic">yet</span> it is precisely in such situations that the courts must also guard against the mind-set that once an unbelievable defence is rejected, everything is to be taken <span class="font-italic">against</span> the accused.

The prosecution’s case was that R was to deliver bundles containing the controlled drugs to a recipient. The trial judge accepted the prosecution’s case and found that the element of possession for the purposes of trafficking was made out. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that there was evidence to show that R was in possession of the controlled drugs, but the Court of Appeal was not satisfied that there was evidence to establish that R had the controlled drugs for the purpose of trafficking. This was despite the fact that there were many discrepancies in R’s account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 The Court of Appeal also rejected the prosecution’s argument urging the Court of Appeal to look at the totality of the facts and consider that R had agreed to take on the bundles from the co-accused. In the Court of Appeal’s view, there were other possible reasons why R received the drugs from the co-accused, one of which was that R was holding on to the drugs with the intention to return them to the co-accused. It was in this respect that the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge should not have shut his mind to any defence which was reasonably available from the evidence, even where that defence was (in some respects) inconsistent with the accused’s own narrative. Although R’s earlier defence (that R believed the bag containing the drugs to be containing office documents instead of controlled drugs) was found to be untenable and was abandoned by R himself, the Court of Appeal held that this did not mean that all other aspects of his defence ought to be rejected by the trial judge (<span class="font-italic">Ramesh </span>at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> was thus referring to a situation where the trial judge rejected an aspect of an accused’s defence that he found to be unbelievable or untenable. In that situation, the Court of Appeal cautioned against rejecting any other aspect of the accused’s defence that was separate and distinct from the accused’s earlier defence, simply on the basis that the accused’s earlier defence was untenable. The danger in this approach is that the trial judge may inadvertently accept a case advanced by the prosecution that suffers from evidential gaps and inconsistencies, since the absence of any tenable defence does not mean that the prosecution has proved its positive case. Such an approach would be contrary to the well-established principle that the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It is for the prosecution, and not the judge, to fill in any gaps in the prosecution’s case. This was made clear in the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1087 at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The principle that the Prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is a cornerstone of our criminal law.

</div> the Accused’s statements were admitted as part of the Prosecution’s evidential arsenal to support the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge. The Accused in his police statements admitted that he used a satay stick to retrieve the key from under the main door of the Unit. There are no evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case regarding the two proceeded charges. Thus, the Defence has mischaracterised <span class="font-italic">Ramesh’s</span> case. That case does not support the Defence’s case. To reiterate, the Accused’s evidence that the Victim opened the main door and invited him into the Unit was fraught with significant inconsistencies and contradictions. Despite these material differences in the Accused’s evidence, the Court did not jettison the Accused’s evidence and his defence wholesale. Instead, the Court sought to treat the Accused’s evidence with caution and to determine which of the Accused’s version of events was the truth. In particular, the Court had to ascertain whether the Accused: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) used the satay stick to retrieve the key from under the Unit’s main door to unlock the door and enter the Unit;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) used the satay stick to attempt to retrieve the key from under the main door, and when that stick broke, resorted to using his Genting membership card to enter the Unit; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) used the satay stick in trying to retrieve the key, to no avail, and then resorted to pressing the doorbell and knocking on the main door until the Victim came to open the door; or</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) rang the doorbell and knocked on the main door until the Victim opened the door to invite the Accused into the Unit.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 Eventually, the Court was satisfied that the Accused’s testimony in Court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Victim had opened the main door and invited the Accused into the Unit, could not have been the truth. This is because the overwhelming evidence supports the finding that the Victim was in a state of deep sleep owing to her alcohol intoxication (see [164] and [305] above). It was, therefore, impossible for the Victim to be conscious at the time the Accused went to the Unit the second time. Further, the Accused’s evidence contained in the 31 January Statement as to how he managed to gain entry to the Unit was a contemporaneous account. It was also an explanation that only the Accused could have given as only he knew how he gained entry to the Unit (see [163] above). Accordingly, the Court accepts the version given by the Accused in the 31 January Statement as the true account of how he gained entry into the Unit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Accused had unlawfully retrieved the key from under the main door of the Unit in order to gain access to the Unit at around 3.04am on 30 January 2017 (see [164] above). The Defence further submits that the Prosecution was not entitled to rely solely on the Accused’s statement as evidence in establishing its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the House-breaking Charge.

</div> The Defence, however, does not point to any authority in support of its contention that the Prosecution ought to have obtained additional proof of his guilt. There is also nothing to suggest that the Prosecution’s failure to adduce further corroborative evidence was detrimental to its case. Indeed, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BNO</span> [2018] SGHC 243 at [89] held that the police investigators had provided reasonable explanations for why it did not obtain further corroborative evidence of the offender’s guilt and should not be faulted for the same. In the present case, SIO Noor explained that he did not conduct any DNA or fingerprint analysis on the key because the Accused had informed SIO Noor during the recording of the 31 January Statement that the Accused had used the key to open the main door.

</div>
</div> I find this to be a reasonable explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 Legally, an accused person’s statement can be relied on in support of a conviction. For instance, it is well-established that a conviction may be grounded on an accused person’s confession alone, even if that statement is subsequently retracted, so long as the court is satisfied that the confession was voluntary, true and reliable (see <span class="font-italic">Lim Thian Lai v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 319 at [43]). There is no reason, therefore, why an accused person’s statement, especially one that is not retracted and made voluntarily, cannot be relied upon to support the finding that an element of the offence in question has been established to the requisite criminal standard of proof. In this case, the Accused had maintained his version of events in the 31 January Statement and the 27 October Statement that he used the satay stick to retrieve the key from under the main door to enter the Unit. He only sought to change his evidence that the Victim opened the main door and invited him into the Unit some three years after.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 I also accept that the Accused had gained entry to the Unit with the intention of committing rape on the Victim under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. To reiterate, I found at [124] above that the Accused had already decided to return to the Unit, even before he called the Victim. The numerous calls that he made to the Victim’s handphone were to confirm that the Victim remained unconscious. Further, the Accused’s intention to return to the Unit was to rape the Victim is evident from the Pre-Polygraph Interview, where the Accused informed SSI Chea that he went back to look for the Victim to see if there was an opportunity to have sex with her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 Finally, the Accused has an antecedent conviction of house-breaking and theft by night under s 457 read with s 458A of the Penal Code, which is also stated in the House-breaking Charge read out to the Accused (see [3] above). The Accused does not dispute this aspect of his antecedent conviction. I therefore find that s 458A of the Penal Code is also made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 I, therefore, find that the Prosecution has proven all the elements necessary to establish the House-breaking Charge beyond a reasonable doubt. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of my findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">331 I shall summarise my findings in relation to both the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">332 In respect of the Rape Charge, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has established the elements of the offence of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Accused does not dispute that he had penetrated the Victim’s vagina with his penis, even if it was just “a little bit” as he alleged. The fact of a partial penetration is not a recognised defence to a charge of rape. In the present case, the forensic evidence shows that the Accused’s penis had fully penetrated the Victim’s vagina. In particular, the scientific evidence of the HSA report found the Accused’s DNA present in the high vaginal area in the Victim’s vagina. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The objective evidence in the form of the CCTV Footage, the Call Logs and the medical evidence of the Victim’s intoxication, supports the finding that the Victim was heavily intoxicated. This was further supported by the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses. Thus, I find that the Victim was in a state of deep sleep at the time of the rape and was thus unconscious. It, therefore, follows that the Victim could not have consented to have sexual intercourse with the Accused. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I find that the Victim’s evidence is consistent with both the objective evidence and the Prosecution’s witnesses’ testimonies. I also accept that the Victim is an honest and forthcoming witness. It is true that the Victim has a chequered past, having previously committed perjury in respect of the Sham Marriage Proceedings. However, in this case, the Victim’s credibility is not affected. Evidently, the Victim having had voluntarily come clean with the police regarding her past case of perjury in the Sham Marriage Proceedings, is a credit to her reliability and willingness to tell the truth in this case. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Victim’s evidence is “unusually convincing” and can be relied upon.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On the other hand, the Accused’s evidence at the trial is fraught with both external inconsistencies and internal inconsistencies. His evidence is internally inconsistent as they are contradicted by his various accounts developed in a drip-feed fashion across the five years since his first contemporaneous evidence was given. The Accused seeks to explain that the internal inconsistencies in his police statements were due to the Alleged Phobia. This excuse is incredulous and unbelievable. Indeed, this belated excuse was only raised during his testimony in Court, and it defies logic and common sense. His evidence is also externally inconsistent as they are contradicted by the objective evidence and the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses. The Accused’s evidence and the account given at trial are thus fabricated and specifically engineered to support his case that the Victim had consented to sexual intercourse with him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The evidence of the Defence’s witness, Heng, does not corroborate the Accused’s account. There are also numerous serious and material contradictions in Heng’s various evidence, both internally and externally. Heng is not an impartial and credible witness, neither is he truthful and reliable. Heng has embellished his evidence in order to support the Defence. Ironically, Heng’s concessions in Court on material parts of the Defence’s case severely undermined the Accused’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f)  I reject the Accused’s assertions that the Victim had alleged rape against the Accused for ulterior purposes. The Accused asserted that the Victim fabricated the allegation of rape against him in order to remain in Singapore for a longer period by obtaining an ICA special pass to assist in police investigation. This defies belief and is wholly against the evidence. Further, the Accused’s reliance on Angela’s evidence is wholly misconceived. Angela’s allegations that the Victim lodged a false report are unfounded and based on speculative conjectures.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The Accused also alleges that the Victim had lodged a false police report in order to extort monetary compensation from the Accused. This allegation is also spurious and not supported by the evidence. On the contrary, the objective evidence shows that the Accused had offered monetary compensation to the Victim in order to purchase her silence and to sweep the entire criminal incident under the rug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">333 In respect of the House-breaking Charge, I am also satisfied that the Prosecution has established the requisite elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There are numerous material inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence on how he had gained entry to the Unit. The Accused’s testimony in Court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Victim had opened the main door and invited the Accused into the Unit, could not have been the truth. Rather, the Accused’s account in the 31 January Statement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had used a satay stick to retrieve the key from under the main door of the Unit, was the most likely and convincing explanation as to how he entered the Unit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is also undisputed that the Accused had entered the Unit at around 3.04am in the early hours of 30 January 2017.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Accused had gained entry to the Unit with the intention of committing rape on the Victim under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. The Accused intended to enter the Unit unlawfully to rape the Victim even before he made his first phone call to the Victim. The Accused had informed SSI Chea that he decided to head back to the Unit to see if he could have sex with the Victim. Thus, the Accused had lied that he decided to return to the Unit out of concern for the Victim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Accused does not dispute that he has an antecedent conviction of house-breaking and theft by night under s 457 read with s 458A of the Penal Code. Accordingly, s 458A of the Penal Code is made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">334 In conclusion, I find that the Accused’s account was inconsistent internally and externally. He also embellished his narrative. Thus, he is not truthful, and his testimony is unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">335 Despite not believing the Accused’s version, however, the Court must nevertheless be satisfied that there is no reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case as the Accused is not required to prove his innocence. In this respect, the Victim’s evidence, together with the evidence presented before the Court, constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was a sexual predator who sought to take advantage of and exploited the Victim’s vulnerability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 For all the foregoing reasons, I find that the Defence has failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Accordingly, I find the Accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and convict him on both the Rape Charge and the House-breaking Charge accordingly. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chong Kee En and Susanna Yim (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">S S Dhillon and Suppiah Krishnamurthi (Dhillon &amp; Panoo LLC) for the Defence.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
