She had suggested that the component for share trading could be put into a joint account with the Daughter to enable the Daughter to assist her with share investment transactions, as her son was too busy with the family business to be able to do so. The Daughter suggested that the accounts be in their joint names, and the Mother agreed.

In this context, the Law Society of Singapore’s Practice Direction 7.4.3 at para c (dated 31 January 2019), formerly the Practice Directions and Rulings 2013 para 65, states that a law practice must accept another law practice’s written representation that it is authorised save where there is good reason to suspect that the representation is falsely made. The Daughter, instead of providing good reason, relied first, on her own bare assertion that the Mother had not mentioned this suit in a series of visits she made to the Mother.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The Mother’s legal case was a simple one. Joint tenancies are generally abhorred by equity, and unless there is an express declaration or any other intention shown to the contrary, or unless the parties have contributed to the purchase money in equal shares, legal joint tenants are presumed to hold that property as beneficial tenants in common of shares proportionate to their contribution to the acquisition of that property in a resulting trust. This presumption of resulting trust is based on a common-sense presumption that an owner of property never intends to make a gift outside of certain relationships, and a person who provides the money required to purchase a property intends to obtain an equivalent equitable interest in the property acquired: <span class="font-italic">Lau</span> <span class="font-italic">Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [36], [83]. The present case involved one of two common scenarios in which resulting trusts are presumed to arise, where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (in whole or in part) for the purchase of property vested either in B’s name or in their joint names. In such cases, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B and the money or property is held on trust for A proportionate to his contribution: <span class="font-italic">Lau</span> <span class="font-italic">Siew Kim </span>at [34]. This presumption also applies to monies held in a joint account to which several account holders had made unequal contributions: <span class="font-italic">Bhavika Manohar </span><span class="font-italic">Godhwani v Manohar Hargun Godhwani and others</span> [2020] SGHC 147 at [63]–[64]; <span class="font-italic">Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) née Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin</span> [2019] 5 SLR 593 at [70].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Daughter raised three arguments in response.

</div> At its highest, this was an assertion of a common intention constructive trust. Beyond her bare assertion, however, there was no evidence of such common intention in her affidavit. The gravamen of her complaint appeared to be that the Mother made a will dated 31 May 2017 in which she had bequeathed a property in Craig Road to her three daughters, of whom the Daughter is one. After this will was made, however, the property was sold en bloc for around $3.48m.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In my view, these contentions could not form an adequate basis for a common intention as to how the beneficial interest in the money in the joint accounts were be held, which is necessary in order to establish a common intention constructive trust. A will only takes effect on the death of the testator, and a testator may change her mind at any time before death. After the will was made on 31 May 2017, the Daughter possessed merely a bare expectancy; any beneficial interest would only arise upon the testator’s demise (see <span class="font-italic">Sheares</span><span class="font-italic"> Betty Hang Kiu v Chow Kwok Chi and others</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 285 at [34]). And as the property had been sold en bloc, no beneficial interest could arise. The Mother could deal with the proceeds from the en bloc sale as she pleased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In any event, other parts of the Daughter’s affidavit contradicted her narrative that the money in the bank accounts was to be preserved for her inheritance. First, her assertion that she agreed with the Mother that she would be there to sign as a second signatory whenever there was a legitimate purpose belied the argument for its preservation. Further, she did not explain what such a legitimate purpose would be. The money came from the Mother: if the Mother, being of sound mind, desired its return, one would have thought that would be a legitimate request. A second contradiction arose from her reliance on a recording, the same recording mentioned at [9], in which the Mother had described her desired arrangement in the following words: “if she wants to use, she can sign, if I want to use, I can sign”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 10 March 2023 at para 12.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A part of the Daughter’s transcript which related to the right of joint survivorship was disputed by the Mother, who adduced a translation of her own. Notwithstanding, whether the Mother’s translation or the Daughter’s translation was used, other parts of the transcript made clear that the Mother had been confused about the first two-signature arrangement, and plainly wanted to be able to withdraw the money on her own. One signature – her own – was sufficient, in the Mother’s view, in the event she wanted to withdraw money for any medical contingencies. The relevant part of the Daughter’s version of the transcript was as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Mother:  … if I need to go see the doctor, need to get money, and Third Aunt did not sign then I won’t be able to take/draw (money) lah </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Ng Tze Chong:  Okay, so- so you want … what do you want Third Aunt to do?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Mother:  Third Aunt, ask her to go sign, us two … don’t- don’t need for 2 persons to sign lah</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Don’t need to have 2 persons’ signature, 1 will be enough … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore the contention of constructive trust was without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Conversely, I found that the Daughter held the funds on a resulting trust in favour of the Mother. A resulting trust arises in response to a transferor’s lack of intention to benefit the transferee by way of the transfer in question: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [38]–[48]. As already discussed, rather than suggesting that funds were meant to be the Daughter’s inheritance, the affidavit evidence provided by both parties made clear that the Mother intended to be able to independently access and use them as she saw fit. Moreover, the Daughter’s affidavit and submissions did not raise any cogent argument to query the veracity of the Mother’s account. Having accepted the Mother’s evidence regarding her intention at the time she opened the two accounts, and given that it was not intended to benefit the Daughter, this was sufficient for a resulting trust to arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In view of the above finding, while the Mother’s reliance on the presumption of resulting trust was understandable owing to the nature of the application, it was not necessary for me to address it. The presumption of resulting trust, as well as the presumption of advancement, are not applicable where there is direct evidence revealing the intention of the transferor: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [49]–[52]. It is only where the evidence is inconclusive that the presumption of resulting trust or advancement operates: <span class="font-italic">Kua</span><span class="font-italic"> Swee Lin v Ho Kim Yan and another</span> [2023] SGHC 108 at [54]. Having found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the Mother did not intend to benefit the Daughter, there was no need to rely on either presumption. I therefore do not deal with the Daughter’s arguments on the presumption of advancement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I granted a declaration that the Daughter held the money in the bank accounts on resulting trust for the Mother. The joint tenancy was severed, and the Daughter was ordered to take steps to terminate the accounts and return the money. Seven days were requested by the Daughter for compliance. The Mother had no objection and this was granted. The Registrar was empowered to execute the relevant documents if the Daughter did not do so. Interest at 5.33% was ordered on the sums in the bank accounts from the date of writ until the date of payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Costs followed the event and were awarded in favour of the Mother for both HC/SUM 617/2023 and the OA. Counsel for the Mother explained that these costs were high because the Mother was elderly and did not speak or write English. Much time was taken with her in the preparation of the OA, the summons, her affidavits and the hearing. Research was also done for issues raised earlier by the Daughter but not pursued in submissions. He suggested $19,500 excluding disbursements. Opposing counsel suggested $19,000 including disbursements. I awarded the Mother $1,500 for the summons, inclusive of disbursements, and $17,500 for the OA, also inclusive of disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lei Chee Kong Thomas (Lawrence Chua Practice LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Bock Heng Christopher (Alpha Law LLC) the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
