        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       A shareholder of a company dies, leaving under
                    his will a specific gift of his shares to several specific legatees. It so
                    happens that, at the time of his death, the company is in the midst of being
                    wound up. Subsequently, a liquidation surplus is declared and the sole executor
                    of the will takes steps to distribute the deceased’s aliquot share of the
                    surplus to the specific legatees according to their respective shares under the
                    will. He does so, however, without first seeking to transfer the
                    deceased’s shares <em>in specie</em> to the specific
                    legatees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant in this case is the wife of the
                    deceased (“the Testator”). We will hereafter refer to the wife as
                    the Appellant for ease of reference; as will become apparent, although the wife
                    was the plaintiff below, it is two of her children who are parties before this
                    court as appellants. The wife is one of the specific legatees of the bequeathed
                    shares and, notably, also the sole beneficiary of the Testator’s residuary
                    estate. She argues, based on the above facts, that the testamentary gift of
                    shares has failed. Her case centres on s 259 of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“s 259”) which provides that
                    “any transfer of shares” in a company made after the commencement
                    of winding up of that company “shall unless the Court otherwise orders be
                    void”. Since the executor – who is the Respondent in this case
                    – never sought the court’s sanction for a transfer of the shares
                    under s 259, no interest in the shares could have been transferred to the
                    specific legatees. And since the specific legatees never acquired any interest
                    in the shares, they were not entitled to receive any part of the liquidation
                    surplus as representing their respective portion of those shares; that was so
                    because one’s right to receive the liquidation surplus necessarily springs
                    from one’s shareholding. On this footing, the Appellant submits that the
                    Respondent’s attempts at distributing the Testator’s aliquot share
                    of the liquidation surplus to the specific legatees were ultimately misguided
                    since, without them having any interest in the shares to begin with, they were,
                    by logical extension, not entitled to any part of the liquidation surplus as
                    well. In the Appellant’s view, therefore, the specific bequest of shares
                    had failed and the liquidation surplus declared in respect of those shares
                    accordingly fell into the residuary estate to which she was wholly entitled in
                    her capacity as the sole residuary beneficiary. If correct, this would no doubt
                    defeat the intentions of the Testator in making a gift of those shares and also
                    the expectations of the rest of the specific legatees in receiving the
                    same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It emerges clearly from this conspectus of the
                    Appellant’s arguments that the central issue in this case is this: does a
                    specific testamentary gift of shares in a company in winding up <em>necessarily</em> fail for want of compliance with s 259?
                    Putting it in a different way, is s 259 a <em>mandatory</em> legal requirement which must strictly be fulfilled
                    before a specific testamentary gift of shares can take effect under the will in
                    question? This issue entails a close examination of the devolution of shares
                    under a will upon a testator’s death. In our analysis below, it is clear
                    as a matter of <em>the law of wills</em> that the Appellant
                    (as one of the specific legatees) <em>can</em> acquire an
                    interest – specifically, an <b><em>equitable</em></b>
                    interest – in the bequeathed shares <em>quite
                        independently</em> of any consideration of s 259. This will be so
                    if the executor is shown to have <b><em>assented</em></b> to the
                    shares and that, in our view, was clearly manifested in the steps which the
                    Respondent took to distribute the Testator’s aliquot share of the
                    liquidation surplus <em>in lieu</em> of the shares
                    themselves. All this is not to say that s 259 is entirely irrelevant; we
                    consider that s 259 has <em>some</em> relevance, but
                    that is so only to the extent that compliance with it is necessary for the
                        <b><em>legal</em></b> title in the shares to be transferred
                    to the Appellant. In other words, compliance with s 259 in this case would
                    have the effect of <em>perfecting</em> the
                    Appellant’s title to the bequeathed shares, but the absence of such
                    compliance does not detract from the fact that, upon the Respondent’s
                    assent as executor, the Appellant was constituted as the beneficial owner
                    thereof and, concomitantly, became vested with the right to receive her share of
                    the liquidation surplus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In our judgment, therefore, the specific gift of
                    shares in this case did not fail; it properly took effect under the will when
                    the Respondent attempted to distribute the liquidation surplus declared in
                    respect of those shares. Accordingly, we <em>dismiss</em>
                    the appeal. Although we have essentially arrived at the same outcome as the
                    Judge (see <em>Lee Koon (by her attorneys Seah Teong Kang and
                        Seah Chiew Tee) v Seah Yong Chwan (executor of the estate of Seah Eng Teow,
                        deceased)</em> [2014] 1 SLR 1439 (“the Judgment”)),
                    as will become apparent, our reasons are quite different. For the moment, we
                    turn to set out the relevant background to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant was the widow of the Testator. She
                    was also the plaintiff in the action below. At the time when she commenced the
                    underlying proceedings in Originating Summons No 875 of 2013
                    (“OS 875/2013”), she was 83 years old and acting through
                    two of her children as her attorneys. They were her eldest daughter, Seah Chiew
                    Tee (“Chiew Tee”), and her elder son, Seah Teong Kang
                    (“Teong Kang”). Unfortunately, by the time of this appeal, the
                    Appellant had passed away and her attorneys, in their capacity as the
                    co-executors of her estate, were granted leave to carry on with the proceedings
                    in OS 875/2013. The Respondent, who was the defendant below, is the
                    Appellant’s youngest son and the sole executor of the Testator’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The shares which are the subject matter of this
                    dispute are in a company known as Teow Aik Realty (S) Pte Ltd
                    (“the Company”). It was incorporated in 1983 as a family owned and
                    run company whose principal business was in mixed construction activities. It
                    had a paid up share capital of $5m in the form of 5m shares valued at $1 each.
                    Prior to the commencement of this action, the shares in the Company were held in
                    the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Testator:
                    1.2m shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Respondent: 1.8m shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     Teong Kang: 1.8m shares</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chiew Tee:
                200,000 shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 17 December 2007, winding up proceedings
                    were commenced against the Company by Teong Kang in Companies Winding Up
                    No 143 of 2007 (“CWU 143/2007”). Two days later, on
                    19 December 2007, the Testator made his will (“the Will”)
                    under which the Respondent was appointed as the sole executor. By cl 3(ii)
                    of the Will, the Testator bequeathed his entire shareholding of 1.2m shares in
                    the Company in the following manner: 1m shares were bequeathed to the Respondent
                    while the remainder was bequeathed in equal proportions of 100,000 shares
                    (“the Shares”) to the Appellant (“the Gift”) and
                    100,000 shares to Chiew Tee. By cl 4, the Testator gave the rest and
                    residue of his estate absolutely to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 22 July 2008, the High Court made an
                    order granting the application to wind up the Company in CWU 143/2007. An
                    order dissolving the Company and releasing the liquidators was only made some
                    five years later on 19 June 2013. In the meantime, the Testator passed away
                    on 2 March 2011, after which the Respondent obtained a grant of probate on
                    20 April 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       During the course of the Company’s winding
                    up, on 30 May 2012, the liquidators issued a Notice of Return to
                    Contributories, serving written notice to the Testator’s estate that a
                    liquidation surplus of $0.15488 per share had been declared in respect of the
                    1.2m shares held by the estate. That amounted to a gross sum of
                    $185,862.55; but after certain adjustments for sums due from the estate were
                    made, the net liquidation surplus that was eventually paid out to the estate
                    amounted to $177,550.95 (“the Sum”). The Respondent duly collected
                    the Sum in his capacity as executor and thereafter proceeded to distribute it to
                    the Appellant (and to Chiew Tee) under cl 3(ii) of the Will according to
                    their respective shares. As mentioned previously at [1]–[2] above, the
                    Respondent did not, at any time, take steps to transfer <em>the
                        Shares themselves</em> to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 20 June 2012, the Respondent made his
                    first attempt at distributing the liquidation surplus by presenting two cheques
                    of $15,488 each to the Appellant and to Chiew Tee. This sum of $15,488 was
                    calculated based on the <em>gross</em> liquidation surplus
                    declared for the Testator’s estate <em>before</em>
                    adjustments were made (<em>ie</em>, $0.15488 per
                    share x 100,000 shares). The Respondent explained that he did so as he
                    was willing to receive a reduced sum from the <em>net</em>
                    liquidation surplus declared in connection with his own proportion of the
                    bequeathed shares. However, neither the Appellant nor Chiew Tee accepted the
                    respective cheques that were made out to them. Instead, on 28 February
                    2013, the Appellant issued a letter of demand through her solicitors, informing
                    the Respondent that there appeared to be an ademption of the bequeathed shares
                    upon the court’s order to wind up the Company, with the result that the
                    entire liquidation surplus paid out in respect of the bequeathed shares
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Sum) fell into the Testator’s
                    residuary estate and thus belonged to the Appellant as the sole residuary
                    beneficiary. On her part, Chiew Tee had filed an affidavit in these proceedings
                    stating that she accepts that she is not entitled to any part of the Sum, the
                    entirety of which should properly be paid to the Appellant as the sole residuary
                    beneficiary to be used for her upkeep and medical expenses. Her brother, Teong
                    Kang, also filed a brief affidavit in support.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Respondent replied to the
                    Appellant’s letter of demand through his solicitors on 22 March 2013.
                    His position was that the Shares had not been adeemed. With more than six months
                    having lapsed since the issuance of the first cheque, the Respondent’s
                    solicitors expressed concern that it might no longer be valid for presentment
                    and thus enclosed a fresh cheque for $15,488 in full and final satisfaction of
                    the Appellant’s entitlement under cl 3(ii) of the Will. The Appellant
                    replied through her solicitors on 12 June 2013, maintaining that the Sum
                    fell into the residuary estate and proposing going for mediation to avoid a
                    family dispute. However, this did not materialise and, in the result, the second
                    cheque was again not presented for payment by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 18 September 2013, the Appellant
                    commenced OS 875/2013. She sought a declaration that the Sum formed part of
                    the Testator’s residuary estate under cl 4 of the Will and a
                    consequential order that the Respondent transfer the Sum to her forthwith.
                    Notwithstanding the commencement of the action, the Respondent made a final
                    attempt at distributing the liquidation surplus on 26 September 2013 when
                    he issued through his solicitors a third cheque to the Appellant for $15,488.
                    However, the Appellant again refused to accept this cheque. OS 875/2013
                    duly came up for hearing before the High Court judge (“the Judge”)
                    in the court below on 7 November 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was made clear to the Judge in the course
                    of the hearing below that the Appellant was no longer relying on there having
                    been an ademption of the Shares as the basis for her argument that the Gift had
                    failed; she accepted that the Shares were still extant when the Testator passed
                    away notwithstanding that the Company was then in the process of being wound up
                    (see the Judgment at [18]). Instead, the Appellant’s position was broadly
                    similar to that which we had earlier outlined at [2] above, namely, that without
                    strict compliance with s 259, the Appellant could not have acquired any
                    interest (legal or equitable) in the Shares; and without any interest in the
                    Shares, it followed that she was not entitled to receive any part of the
                    liquidation surplus (see the Judgment at [13]–[14]). Therefore, the
                    Appellant argued that the Respondent had no basis for believing that he could
                    distribute the liquidation surplus <em>in lieu</em> of the
                    Shares themselves to give effect to the Gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Judge began his analysis by stating that
                    he agreed with the Appellant’s primary submission that she never became
                    the legal or beneficial owner of the Shares because of the operation of
                    s 259 (see the Judgment at [22]). In his view, there was, at most, a
                        <em>transmission</em> of the Shares <em>to the Respondent</em> in his capacity as the executor, which
                    transmission was not caught by the said provision since this only applied to
                    prohibit share <em>transfers</em> (see the Judgment at
                    [34]). Nevertheless, the Judge found that it did not follow from the
                    Appellant’s lack of ownership interest in the Shares that she was
                    necessarily precluded from receiving the liquidation surplus declared in respect
                    thereof such that the Gift should fail (see the Judgment at [22]). In his view,
                    the Appellant had acquired, by virtue of the bequest of the Shares, not only a
                    chose in action against the Respondent (as executor) to compel due
                    administration of the Testator’s estate upon the Testator’s death,
                    but also an “interest” in the “fruits” of that chose
                    which in this case referred to the liquidation surplus declared in respect of
                    the Shares once such surplus had been ascertained – and this result
                    obtained <em>even though</em> the Appellant was not at any
                    time constituted as the legal or beneficial owner of the Shares themselves (see
                    the Judgment at [36]–[37]). Based on this reasoning, the Judge ultimately
                    held that the liquidation surplus could validly be distributed <em>in lieu</em> of the Shares (as indeed the Respondent had
                    done) such that the Gift under cl 3(ii) of the Will did not fail.
                    Accordingly, the Appellant’s claim was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The issue raised by the present appeal is one
                    that arises from the confluence of two quite different areas of the law,
                        <em>viz</em>, company law and the law of wills. It is a
                    deceptively simple one: does a specific bequest of company shares to a specific
                    legatee fail because the requirement in s 259 that any transfer of those
                    shares after the commencement of winding up be ordered by the court was not
                    complied with? Section 259 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Avoidance of dispositions of property,
                        etc.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">259. Any disposition of the property of the company, including things in
                        action, and <em>any transfer of shares</em> or
                        alteration in the status of the members of the company <em>made after the commencement of the winding up by the Court shall unless
                            the Court otherwise orders be void</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">An overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This case is <em>unusual</em> inasmuch as it is the legatee herself (<em>viz</em>, the Appellant) who is arguing that the bequest has
                    failed for non-compliance with s 259. She seemingly does <em>not</em> desire to receive her <em>share</em> of
                    the liquidation surplus that arose for distribution after the Company had been
                    wound up. However, when considering her argument as a whole, it immediately
                    becomes apparent why she takes such a position. She argues that, the bequest
                    having failed because of the non-compliance with s 259, the <em>entire</em> liquidation surplus declared in respect of the
                    Testator’s 1.2m shareholding (<em>ie</em>, the Sum)
                    fell into the residuary estate of the Testator and that, as the sole residuary
                    beneficiary appointed under cl 4 of the Will, she is entitled to the
                        <em>whole</em> of the Sum (<em>instead
                        of</em> only a <em>share</em> of
                it).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We pause to observe that if the
                    Appellant’s argument centring on the failure to comply with s 259 is
                    accepted, then that would mean that the Testator’s intention to make a
                    gift of the Shares under his will is <em>defeated</em>. The
                    Appellant argues that this ought to be the case because s 259 is a
                        <em>legal</em> requirement which <b><em>trumps</em></b> the <em>construction or
                        interpretation</em> of the Will. Whilst we agree that this argument
                    may, in <em>form</em>, be correct, <b><em>the
                        underlying premise of the Appellant’s argument is that s 259 is
                        such an integral and (more importantly) indispensable requirement that it
                        must therefore be complied with in order for the Gift to take
                        effect</em></b>. <b><em>If, however, it can be demonstrated
                        that s 259 does not have this effect inasmuch as the Gift could
                        nevertheless take effect (even if it is in a more limited fashion) without
                        complying with it, then the Appellant’s argument would
                        fail.</em></b> In order to determine which of these two polar (and
                    opposite) arguments is correct, it is necessary, in our view, to examine the
                    precise legal consequences that obtained <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the Shares themselves upon the Testator’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We proceed to do this in two (related) steps.
                    First, we will ascertain whether any interest in the Shares passes under the
                    Will to the Appellant and, if so, <b><em>what precisely</em></b>
                    that legal interest is. Second, assuming that an interest in the Shares does
                    pass under the Will to the Appellant, we proceed to ascertain <b><em>the purpose as well as effect of s 259</em></b> with regard
                    to that particular interest. As we shall see in a moment, the first step entails
                    a consideration of principles relating to the law of wills, whilst the second
                    step entails a consideration of principles relating to company
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does any interest in the Shares pass under the Will to the
                Appellant?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Passing of the whole interest in the Shares to the executor </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Turning, then, to the first step in our
                    analysis, it is clear that <b><em>no</em></b> interest (whether
                    legal or equitable) in the Shares can pass <b><em>directly</em></b> to <b><em>the Appellant</em></b> under
                    the Will upon the death of the Testator because it is <b><em>the
                        executor</em></b> who must execute the Will, <em>after
                        which</em> the specific bequests (including the Shares which are the
                    subject matter of the present proceedings) will be distributed to the respective
                    specific legatees under the Will. There is, in this regard, clear authority
                    that, following the death of the deceased, the <b><em>whole</em></b> ownership interest in his assets passes to the executor
                        <b><em>by virtue of his office</em></b> without distinction
                    as to the legal or equitable interest. As Viscount Radcliffe observed in the
                    following oft-cited statement in the Privy Council decision (on appeal from the
                    High Court of Australia) of <em>Commissioner of Stamp Duties
                        (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan Livingston</em> [1965] AC 694
                        (“<em>Livingston</em>”) at 707:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whatever property came to the executor virtute officii came to
                        him in full ownership, without distinction between legal and equitable
                        interests. The whole property was his. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Later, in the same vein, Viscount Radcliffe went on (at 712)
                        to describe it as a “fallacy” to search for the existence of a
                        separate equitable interest in the assets of the deceased during the course
                        of administration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… When the whole right of property is in a person, as it is in an
                        executor, there is no need to distinguish between the legal and equitable
                        interest in that property, any more than there is for the property of a full
                        beneficial owner. What matters is that the court will control the executor
                        in the use of his rights over assets that come to him in that capacity; but
                        it will do it by the enforcement of remedies which do not involve the
                        admission or recognition of equitable rights of property in those assets.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The parties are agreed on this point. However,
                    we pause to note that there is some academic suggestion that the observations in
                        <em>Livingston</em> should be qualified such that they
                    apply only to <em>the unadministered assets of a deceased’s
                        residuary estate</em> but not to <em>specific
                        bequests</em>. On this view, the <em>equitable</em> interest in the latter <em>would</em> indeed vest in the specific legatees <em>as
                        soon as the testator dies</em> (see <em>Snell’s
                        Equity</em> (John McGhee QC gen ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) at para 33-003). The
                    significance of this view is that, if it is correct, then the present appeal can
                    be quickly disposed of on the basis that, since the Shares here were indeed the
                    subject of a <em>specific bequest</em>, the equitable
                    interest therein would have passed immediately (and directly) to the Appellant
                    upon the Testator’s death, in which event the Gift to her would <em>not</em> have failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, whilst we acknowledge that Viscount
                    Radcliffe’s comments in <em>Livingston</em> were
                    indeed made in the context of a residuary estate on the facts of that case, we
                    do not read them as being intended to have the limited effect of applying only
                    to such circumstances. A similar view was taken by the High Court of Australia
                    in <em>Official Receiver in Bankruptcy v Schultz and
                        another</em> (1990) 170 CLR 306. That decision dealt with assets
                    which were, as in the present case, the subject of a specific bequest. Despite
                    noting the somewhat different context in which the views in <em>Livingston</em> were expressed, the court nevertheless proceeded on
                    the basis that those views applied “with equal force” in the case
                    of a specific bequest (at 312). We also note that the weight of academic
                    authority in fact expressly casts doubt on the soundness of excluding specific
                    bequests from the general rule in <em>Livingston</em> which
                    holds that, on the death of the testator, the whole interest in the assets of
                    his estate passes to the executor only (see, in this regard, Roger Kerridge,
                        <em>Parry &amp; Kerridge: The Law of
                        Succession</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Parry &amp; Kerridge</em>”) at para 24-35; John
                    Ross Martyn <em>et al</em>, <em>Theobald on
                        Wills</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17th Ed, 2010) at
                    para 10-007; Francis Barlow <em>et al</em>, <em>Williams on Wills</em> vol 1 (LexisNexis, 10th Ed,
                    2014) at para 1.8; Jill E Martin, <em>Hanbury &amp; Martin: Modern Equity</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2012) (“<em>Hanbury &amp; Martin</em>”) at para 2-020; and
                    Joel Nitikman, “The Forgotten Law of Assent” (2012)
                    18(7) Trusts and Trustees 672 (“<em>Nitikman</em>”) at 680). As some of these authors have pointed
                    out, it may well turn out during the course of administration that the assets
                    which are the subject of the specific bequest have to be applied by the executor
                    towards the administration of the estate (see also, in this regard, the New
                    South Wales decision of <em>Bryen v Reus</em> [1961] SR
                    (NSW) 396 (“<em>Bryen</em>”) at 399). If so,
                    then that is inconsistent with the notion of the specific legatees having
                        <em>already</em> acquired the equitable interest in
                    those assets at the time of the testator’s death; thus, the most which can
                    be said, in our view, is that the specific legatees have, during the period of
                    administration, only a chose in action against the executor to have the
                    testator’s estate properly administered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We therefore prefer the view that the
                        <b><em>whole</em></b> interest in the Shares in this case
                    does in fact pass, upon the death of the Testator, to <b><em>the
                        executor</em></b>. In this regard, we should add that we agree with the
                    Judge (see the Judgment at [34]) that the proper characterisation of the manner
                    by which the Shares devolved upon the executor was via the process of <b><em>transmission</em></b> (which takes place <em>by
                        operation of law</em>) and not by a <em>transfer</em> (which occurs as a result of an act of the parties)
                    (see <em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors,
                        Administrators and Probate</em> (John Ross Martyn and Nicholas Caddick
                    gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2013)
                        (“<em>WMS 2013</em>”) at para 45-65;
                    and <em>Palmer’s Company Law</em> vol 1
                    (Geoffrey Morse gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Looseleaf Ed, 2015)
                    at para 6.475). The result is that s 259, which governs only the
                        <em>transfer</em> of shares after a company is ordered
                    to be wound up, is <em>not</em> attracted at this
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Passing of equitable interest in the Shares to the Appellant </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     However, where we depart from the analysis of
                    the Judge is at the next stage of the devolution of the Shares from the executor
                    to the Appellant (as one of the specific legatees). To begin with, we are, with
                    respect, not entirely convinced by the Judge’s analysis that the Appellant
                    had acquired an “interest” in her aliquot share of <em>the liquidation surplus (</em>ie, <em>the
                        Sum)</em>, notwithstanding his finding that no legal or equitable
                    interest in <em>the Shares</em> had passed to her (see
                    above at [14]). In this regard, we agree with the Appellant that, as a matter of
                    principle, one’s entitlement to the liquidation surplus necessarily
                    derives from one’s shareholding. This is why, as we have mentioned above
                    at [3] and [17], the focal lens in this case must be trained on the movement of
                    the interest in <em>the Shares</em> upon the death of the
                    Testator. It is only when the final destination of the interest in <em>the Shares</em> has been properly investigated that one can
                    then answer the question of whether or not the Appellant was entitled to receive
                    her aliquot share of <em>the Sum</em> as representing her
                    interest in the Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     However, we have a more fundamental
                    disagreement with the Judge’s analysis, and this concerns the fact that he
                    had basically accepted the Appellant’s argument that s 259 <em>had</em> to be complied with in order for any interest
                    (whether legal or equitable) in the Shares to pass to the Appellant. It was
                    precisely because he had started off his analysis on this footing that the
                    Judge’s inquiry was then focused (wrongly, as we have explained in the
                    preceding paragraph) on whether the Appellant had any interest in <em>the liquidation surplus</em>. In our judgment, the
                    Judge’s error was, with respect, in entirely omitting to consider the
                    vital concept of <b><em>assent</em></b> in the context of the law
                    of wills, which is basically a dispositive act by the personal representative of
                    an estate (for example, the Respondent <em>qua</em>
                    executor here) resulting in the divestment of property held by him by virtue of
                    his office in favour of the beneficiaries of the deceased’s estate. Had
                    the Judge undertaken this analysis, then he would (as demonstrated below) have
                    arrived at the conclusion that the Appellant in this case <em>did</em> acquire an <b><em>equitable</em></b> interest
                    in the Shares <em>quite independently</em> of any
                    consideration of s 259. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     An <em>assent</em> is an
                    acknowledgment by a personal representative that an asset of the deceased is no
                    longer required for the payment of the debts of the estate, funeral expenses or
                    general pecuniary legacies (see <em>WMS 2013</em> at
                    para 81-01). Where the facts disclose that there has been an assent, then
                    its <em>effect</em>, in the context of a specific bequest
                    under a will, is to turn the executor into a <em>trustee</em> of the bequeathed asset because <em>equitable</em> ownership <em>moves to the specific
                        legatees upon the assent</em> who, for their part, are turned into
                        <em>beneficiaries</em> (see <em>Hanbury &amp; Martin</em> at para 2-020). From that
                    point onwards, the executor is precluded from dealing with the bequeathed asset
                    as executor (see <em>WMS 2013</em> at para 81-20
                    and <em>Nitikman</em> at 675). The effect of an assent upon
                    the role of an executor was explained by Viscount Haldane LC in the leading
                    House of Lords decision of <em>George
                        Attenborough &amp; Son v Solomon and another</em> [1913] AC
                    76 (“<em>George Attenborough</em>”) in these
                    words (at 85):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The executors had long ago lost their vested right of property as
                        executors and become, so far as the title to it was concerned trustees under
                        the will. Executors they remained, but they were executors who had become
                        divested, by their assent to the dispositions of the will, of the property
                        which was theirs virtute officii; and their right in rem, their title of
                        property, had been transformed into a right in personam, – a right to
                        get the property back by proper proceedings against those in whom the
                        property should be vested if it turned out that they required it for payment
                        of debts for which they had made no provision. My Lords, that right always
                        remains to the executors and they can always exercise it, but it is a right
                        to bring an action, not a right of property …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     To be clear, we should stress that the passing
                    of equitable ownership in the bequeathed asset is “not by the mere force
                    of the assent of the executor, but by virtue of the dispositions of the will
                    which have become operative because of [the] assent” (see <em>George Attenborough</em> at 83). In other words, the
                    significance of the assent is that it is necessary to “cause” the
                    property to vest in the legatee, but it should not be mistaken as “the
                    instrument of the vesting”, which is in fact the will (see <em>Bryen</em> at 399). This is neatly summed up in the following
                    passage in <em>Nitikman</em> (at 673):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Once the executor assents, it is the Will, rather than the
                        assent, that determines to whom the property goes, and it is the Will,
                        rather than the assent, that is the legal instrument that effects the
                        passage of beneficial interest. The assent is not a conveyance of the
                        property. The assent makes the Will operative, that is, it perfects the
                        beneficiary’s beneficial ownership to the assets gifted under the
                        Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A final point which we make in relation to the
                    doctrine of assent (which is of some importance in the context of the present
                    case) is that, in determining whether such assent exists, the inquiry is
                    necessarily a <em>fact-sensitive</em> one. What is sought
                    is an indication by the executor that the bequeathed asset is no longer required
                    for the purposes of administration and that it may pass under the
                    testator’s will – and this he or she may do informally and it may be
                    inferred from his or her conduct (see <em>George
                        Attenborough</em> at 83). In other words, it is not necessary in order
                    to prove an assent to show affirmatively that the executor had, either verbally
                    or in writing, made a formal declaration to that effect (see, for example, the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Wise v Whitburn</em>
                    [1924] 1 Ch 460 at 467).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before we draw these principles together and
                    apply them to the facts of the present case, it is necessary for us to deal with
                    a submission that counsel for the Appellant, Mr Earnest Lau
                    (“Mr Lau”), had advanced before us at the hearing. According
                    to Mr Lau, a mere assent by the Respondent in his capacity as the executor
                    is (contrary to the observations we have made above at [25]) <em>not</em> effective to pass <em>any</em> interest
                    in the Shares to the Appellant in the absence of a transfer of the Shares to her
                    in accordance with the articles of the Company resulting in her being properly
                    registered as a member. In effect, his submission was that the doctrine of
                    assent has no application where the bequeathed asset consisted of shares
                    because, ultimately, the passing of interest in this particular species of
                    property turns on the conventional notions of share transfer and registration.
                    Mr Lau relied heavily for this proposition on the following passage in
                        <em>Williams, Mortimer and Sunnucks on Executors,
                        Administrators and Probate</em> (John Ross Martyn and Nicholas Caddick
                    gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>WMS 2008</em>”) at
                    para 78-09:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In general a chose in action is not susceptible of a

                        cannot, however, by-pass the representatives. If they purport themselves to

                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We pause to point out that this passage
                    appears in a substantially similar form at para 81-08 of <em>WMS 2013</em>, which is the latest edition of the text, save that
                    where the footnotes in respect of the two bold italicised statements above
                    previously referred to various provisions of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6)
                    (UK), they now cite the equivalent provisions of the Companies Act 2006
                    (c 46) (UK) (“the 2006 Act”), namely, s 20 and
                    s 544. Section 544 essentially provides that the shares of any member
                    in a company are transferable in accordance with the company’s articles
                    and s 20, in turn, provides that the relevant model articles in operation
                    at the time of the formation of the company will apply by default if they are
                    not excluded or modified. Presently, the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations
                    2008 is in force in the UK and reg 26(1) of Schedule 1, in particular,
                    caters for the transfer of shares. This regulation provides that a transfer of
                    shares may be done “by means of an instrument of transfer in any usual
                    form or any other form approved by the directors” executed by or on
                    behalf of the transferor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     These statutory provisions in the above
                    footnote references are important because they provide the proper context within
                    which the statements in para 81-08 of <em>WMS
                        2013</em> must be read. In our view, it is clear that the gist of
                    these provisions is to prescribe that a certain procedure has to be complied
                    with for the transfer of shares – specifically, that procedure is as set
                    out in the relevant articles of the company and will ordinarily require the
                    execution of some instrument of transfer. But it appears clear to us that
                    compliance with such procedure is, to put it simply, necessary only to get the
                    potential transferee onto the company’s register of members. In other
                    words, it is necessary only for the passing of <b><em>legal</em></b> title in the shares to the potential transferee. Viewed in
                    this way, it becomes clear that the intention behind the quoted passage (which,
                    as mentioned above, appears in a substantially similar form in <em>WMS 2013</em>) is simply to state that, in so far as what is
                    sought to be transferred is the <b><em>legal</em></b> title to
                    shares, a simple assent by the executor is not ordinarily effective because
                    registration in accordance with the company’s articles (which may not be
                    circumvented) is strictly required for this purpose. The quoted passage says
                    nothing which detracts from the general principle that an assent remains
                    effective to pass the <b><em>equitable</em></b> interest in the
                    bequeathed asset to the specific legatee. This in fact appears to be implicit in
                    the passage itself where the authors speak of the title of a legatee of shares
                    not generally being “completed” until he is registered as a member
                    of the company. This statement may be read as operating on the basis that an act
                    of assent at least passes title <em>partially</em> to the
                    specific legatee (<em>ie</em>, the equitable title); what
                    remains to be done in respect of the <em>legal</em> title
                    is, as has been canvassed above, registration in accordance with the
                    company’s articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We are fortified in our interpretation of
                    para 81-08 of <em>WMS 2013</em> by somewhat similar
                    observations made in <em>Parry &amp; Kerridge</em>. The distinction between the
                    legal and equitable title to shares and, importantly, the effect of an assent on
                    both is made explicit in para 24-40 of <em>Parry &amp; Kerridge</em>, which we reproduce here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <b>[I]n the case of a specific legacy, the

                            assent.</b> For instance, company shares are only transferable in
                        the manner provided by the articles of the company, <em>i.e.</em> by entering the name of the transferee in the register
                        of members of the company. <b>After an executor has assented
                            to a specific legacy of company shares, he holds the shares as trustee

                        added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The last sentence of this passage makes it clear that, upon
                        the assent of the executor, he is effectively transformed into a trustee of
                        the shares for the specific legatees who are simultaneously constituted as
                        beneficial owners of the same. The fact that the specific legatees have yet
                        to be registered as members of the company relates to the separate matter of
                        their <em>legal</em> title to the shares but there is
                        no dispute that, in so far as the <em>equitable</em>
                        title is concerned, it is theirs upon the assent of the executor (see also,
                        for similar observations, Rosalind Atherton and Prue Vines, <em>Australian Succession Law: Commentary and Materials: Families,
                            Property and Death</em> (Butterworths, 1996) at
                        para 18.8.6).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Indeed, there is clear authority for this
                    point as cited in <em>Parry &amp; Kerridge</em>.
                    This is the decision of the English High Court in <em>In re
                        Grosvenor</em> [1916] 2 Ch 375. In that case, a testator had made
                    various specific legacies which included shares. His executors had assented to
                    the specific legacies and were prepared to transfer them to the legatees,
                    subject to the court’s determination of how the costs of transferring
                    these legacies ought to be borne – ought they to have been borne by the
                    specific legatees or by the residuary estate? Astbury J reasoned that it
                    had to be the former because once the executors had assented to the shares,
                    beneficial ownership would have passed from them and be vested in the specific
                    legatees who then had to do what was necessary to complete their title to the
                    shares. As Astbury J stated (at 378):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case the costs of transfer and stamps are not costs
                        incurred by the executors and trustees in getting in the estate for
                        distribution, but they are incurred and payable after the specific legacies
                        have been assented to. On the principle of <em>In re De
                            Sommery</em> and <em>In re Scott these are costs
                            and expenses which the separate specific legatees must pay in order to
                            complete their title to their specific property, which
                            </em><b><em>after assent the plaintiffs are holding
                            as trustees for them, and not as executors</em></b>. [emphasis added
                        in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We therefore reject Mr Lau’s
                    submission that an executor’s assent made in respect of a specific bequest
                    of shares was ineffective to pass even the <em>equitable</em> interest in such shares to the specific
                    legatees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Turning, then, to the facts of the present
                    case, it appears clear to us that when the Respondent made his first attempt at
                    paying out part of the Sum to the Appellant by way of a cheque payment of
                    $15,488 on 20 June 2012 (see above at [10]), he was signalling
                    unequivocally that this sum, <em>which represented the monetary
                        value of the Shares upon the Company’s winding up</em>, was no
                    longer required for the administration of the Testator’s estate. In other
                    words, it can be inferred from the Respondent’s conduct that he was, for
                    all intents and purposes, assenting (in his capacity as the executor) to the
                    passing of the interest in <em>the Shares</em> under the
                    Will to the Appellant. And as the foregoing discussion has made clear, the
                    precise nature of this interest is the <em>equitable</em>
                    interest in the Shares. The same analysis holds in respect of the
                    Respondent’s second attempt at making a cheque payment of $15,488 to the
                    Appellant on 22 March 2013 (see above at [11]); this act would similarly
                    have constituted an implied assent by the Respondent which would have been
                    effective to pass equitable interest in the Shares to the Appellant. In so far
                    as the Respondent’s third and final attempt at distributing the
                    liquidation surplus to the Appellant on 26 September 2013 was concerned
                    (see above at [12]), we note that this had occurred <em>after</em> the Company was ordered to be fully and finally dissolved
                    by an order of the court dated 19 June 2013 (see above at [8]). As the
                    Shares would have been extinguished from the dissolution of the Company onwards,
                    it would not have been possible for any equitable interest therein to have
                    passed to the Appellant thereafter. Indeed, this was why it was no longer open
                    to the Respondent to simply apply to court for an order under s 259
                    sanctioning the transfer of the Shares <em>in specie</em>
                    to the Appellant. Had such an application been made prior to the Company’s
                    dissolution and received the approval of the court, then it would have obviated
                    the need for these proceedings given the position that the Appellant has taken.
                    Nevertheless, the fact remains that there were already two separate occasions on
                    which the Respondent had assented to the Shares being passed to the Appellant.
                    This was effective to constitute her as the beneficial owner of the Shares.
                    Accordingly, we do not see how the Gift can be said to have
                failed.</p>

          <b><em>The important point that
                        arises from the foregoing in the context of the present appeal is that, by

                        clear that no compliance with s 259 is required in order for the Gift
                        to take effect pursuant to the Will itself, at least to the extent of the
                        Appellant acquiring an equitable interest in the Shares.</em></b> But, if
                    this is the case, what, then, is the <em>relevance</em> (if
                    any) of <em>s 259</em>? This leads us to <em>the second step</em> in our analysis, <em>viz</em>, the purpose of s 259 in general and its effect with
                    regard to the facts of the present case in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the relevance of s 259 in the present case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It appears clear – even from a cursory
                    reading of s 259 (reproduced above at [15]) – that that provision was
                    intended to prevent any adverse dealing with, or dissipation of, a
                    company’s assets without the sanction of the court. This is only logical
                    and commonsensical, especially given the fact that a winding up order has
                    already been made against the company concerned. However, if that is in fact the
                    mischief that was sought to be dealt with by s 259 itself, such mischief is
                    ostensibly <em>not</em> present in this case. Indeed, that
                    was one of the main submissions advanced at the hearing by counsel for the
                    Respondent, Mr Tay Yong Seng (“Mr Tay”), although he
                    raised a more literal argument that <em>another</em> reason
                    why s 259 had no application here was because it is explicitly stated to be
                    relevant only to the “transfer” of shares post-winding up. In this
                    regard, Mr Tay argued, relying on the Supreme Court of Queensland decision
                    of <em>Re Kenzler</em> (1983) 7 ACLR 767
                        (“<em>Re Kenzler</em>”), that the
                    passing of interest in the Shares upon the Respondent’s assent is more
                    properly characterised as a <em>transmission</em>; and
                    since this process (as explained at [22] above) is an entirely different legal
                    concept from a <em>transfer</em>, Mr Tay submitted
                    that the present case fell outside of the express ambit of
                s 259.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Lau,
                    candidly admitted at the hearing that s 259 was <em>not
                        applicable</em> to the facts of the present case – at least in
                    so far as the basic mischief sought to be addressed by that particular provision
                    was concerned. Yet, he nevertheless sought to argue that s 259 <em>was</em> applicable on the facts of this case for <em>another</em> reason – that in order for the Shares to
                    take effect as a gift under the Will, it was necessary for s 259 to be
                    complied with in order for the Shares to be transferred to the Appellant
                    pursuant to the gift of the same to her under the Will. Even on this preliminary
                    viewing, the <em>disconnect</em> between the admission by
                    Mr Lau that this case did not fall within the mischief sought to be
                    addressed by s 259 on the one hand and his (simultaneous) insistence that
                    s 259 is still relevant in relation to the validity of the gift of the
                    Shares under the Will on the other was quite apparent. Whilst it could be said
                    that these two arguments are different, this is only so at a very <em>literal</em> level. Surely, if s 259 was never intended
                    to apply to cases such as the present, it would be logically inconsistent to
                    then argue that that provision nevertheless applied to cases such as the
                    present. It therefore appeared to us that what Mr Lau actually meant to say
                    was that, at the time s 259 was enacted, the Singapore Parliament did not
                    specifically have in mind the case of a testamentary gift of shares post
                    winding-up; nevertheless, that provision must now apply in such a context (as
                    has arisen in the present case) because the validity of the gift depends on
                    compliance with s 259. Quite apart from this point, Mr Lau also sought
                    to address the Respondent’s alternative submission based on <em>Re Kenzler</em> by arguing that that case had been
                    wrongly decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having heard the parties’ oral
                    arguments, it appeared clear to us that there were two points raised in
                    connection with the overarching issue of the relevance of s 259 to the
                    present case which would benefit from further submissions, namely: (a) how
                    had <em>Re Kenzler</em> been treated in the leading
                    Australian treatises on company law and/or the law of wills and in the
                    subsequent case law; and (b) what was the purposive interpretation of
                    s 259? Parties duly tendered their respective further written submissions
                    and, having considered them, we agree with the position taken by Mr Tay at
                    the hearing in respect of his submissions regarding both the decision of
                        <em>Re Kenzler</em> and the underlying purpose of
                    s 259. We proceed to elaborate on these two sub-issues in
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 259 is relevant only in respect of the transfer (and not
                transmission) of shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The facts of <em>Re Kenzler</em> are as follows. A testator died leaving behind a
                    parcel of shares in a company to one of the executors of his will who was also
                    the residuary legatee. The executor sought to have the shares registered in her
                    own name and, to that end, instructed solicitors who wrote to the company
                    enclosing a document executed by the executors. However, the application for
                    registration was refused by the board of directors purporting to exercise their
                    discretion under the company’s articles to decline to register any
                    proposed “transfer” of shares. This led the executor to apply to
                    court for an order that the shares be registered in her name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     McPherson J allowed the application. He
                    held that the directors had no power under the company’s articles to
                    refuse registration of what was properly a “transmission” of
                    shares rather than a “transfer”. He regarded this application for
                    registration as a “transmission” because title to the shares
                    passed to the residuary legatee <em>by operation of law under the
                        will</em> – even though that only occurred pursuant to the
                    executor’s assent, the assent was <em>not</em> what
                    vested title in the shares in the beneficiary. We pause to mention that this is
                    precisely the point that we had made at [26] above, <em>viz</em>, that it is the will that is the instrument of vesting and
                    not the assent of the executor. It was upon this reasoning that McPherson J
                    then went on to observe that the application for registration was not to be
                    understood as a “transfer” of the shares but simply as implying
                    the executors’ assent to the “transmission” of the same
                    under the will. The following extracts from McPherson J’s judgment
                    (at 772–774) are particularly instructive in this regard:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <b><em>As a matter of general principle, it seems to me that
                            the process by which the applicant became entitled to her shares is
                            properly described as one of “transmission” in which no
                            “transfer” is involved. </em></b><em>The
                            principle is that a legatee takes title to the subject-matter of the
                            bequest </em><b><em>by virtue of the will
                            </em></b><em>of the deceased, and </em><b><em>not by virtue of any act of the executor</em></b>, and this
                        is so whether the legacy is specific or merely residuary: see
                        Williams &amp; Mortimer: <em>Executors
                            Administrators &amp; Probate</em>, at pp 848–850. It is
                        true that, until the executor assents, the legatee has merely an inchoate
                        right to the subject of the bequest, but <b><em>it is not the
                            assent that operates to vest title in the beneficiary</em></b>.
                            <em>As was said by Viscount Haldane in</em> George
                        Attenborough &amp; Son v Solomon <em>[1913] AC 76
                            at 83: “The transfer is not made by the mere force of the assent
                            of the executor but by virtue of the dispositions of the will which have
                            become operative because of this assent.”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows that an application to the company for registration of the
                        applicant as shareholder in place of the deceased cannot be regarded as a
                        “transfer” from the executors to the applicant as legatee.
                        Indeed, the better view appears to be that the deceased remains the
                        “member” or “shareholder” until, if at all, the
                        personal representative is registered: <em>A L Campbell &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Federal
                            Commissioner of Taxation</em> (1951) 82 CLR 452 <em>The document headed “transmission” forwarded by
                            the applicant’s solicitors is therefore not to be regarded as an
                            application for transfer of the shares from the executors, but simply as
                            a request implying their </em><b><em>assent
                            </em></b><em>to the </em><b><em>transmission </em></b><em>from the deceased of
                            </em><em><u>legal </u></em><em>title to the shares which </em><b><em>by virtue of
                            the will devolved on the applicant by operation of
                            law</em></b><em>.</em> Article 22(b)
                        operates, as I have said, only upon a “proposed transfer” of
                        shares, and consequently does not affect the right of a legatee, such as the
                        applicant, to transmission of the shares into her name. There being no other
                        power in the article on which the directors could or did rely, the applicant
                        was and is entitled to registration of the shares in her own name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics, bold italics, and underlined italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In our view, the logic applied by
                    McPherson J in <em>Re Kenzler</em> is sound and
                    in harmony with the basic principles of succession law – because when a
                    specific legatee of shares ultimately acquires an interest in those shares
                        <em>under the provisions of the will</em>, it is
                        <em>by operation of law</em> that he takes such
                    interest and that is properly a “transmission”. This is
                    notwithstanding the fact that the executor’s assent is required to give
                    effect to the provisions of the will. The executor’s assent, properly
                    understood, merely “activates the gift of the property <em>by the testator’s will</em>” [emphasis added] (see
                        <em>Parry &amp; Kerridge</em> at
                    para 24-39). If there is any disagreement that we have with
                    McPherson J’s analysis, it is only in respect of the quite separate
                    point where he says (in underlined italics in the quoted passage) that it is the
                    “legal” title in the shares that passes to the beneficiary by
                    transmission pursuant to an assent. As we have sought to explain at
                    [28]–[33] above, the effect of an assent in respect of a testamentary gift
                    of shares is effective only to pass the <em>beneficial</em>
                    interest therein to the specific legatee. It does not serve also to pass the
                        <em>legal</em> title in the shares – that is
                    contingent on the registration of a share transfer that has taken place in
                    accordance with the company’s articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Given that <em>Re Kenzler</em> generally rests on sound principles, it is
                    unsurprising to find that the proposition which it lays down has <em>not</em> been the subject of any adverse comment in the
                    relevant authorities which have discussed this case (see, for example,
                    H A J Ford, R P Austin and I M Ramsay,
                        <em>Ford’s Principles of Corporations Law</em>
                    vol 2 (LexisNexis Butterworths, Looseleaf Ed, 2000, October 2012 release)
                    at para 21.422; <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Australia</em> vol 7 (LexisNexis Butterworths, 1993) at

                    decisions which have accepted the proposition in <em>Re Kenzler</em>. For example, in <em>Waters v
                        Winmardun Pty Ltd and Ors</em> (1990) 3 ACSR 378, which was a
                    decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Master Evans affirmed (at 384) the
                    principle in <em>Re Kenzler</em> that shares devolved
                    under a will to the legatee by way of transmission (and not by transfer) as

          <em>Re Kenzler</em> was
                    also cited with approval in the recent case of <em>Atwell v
                        Roberts</em> [2013] WASCA 37 which was decided by the Supreme Court of
                    Western Australia. In that case, the testatrix, Ada, had bequeathed her
                    partnership interest to her nephew, Keith, who was also appointed as the
                    executor of her will. The latter then transferred the partnership interest to
                    himself (<em>qua</em> specific legatee) and the question
                    arose as to whether this “transfer” fell within the meaning of
                    cl 6 of the partnership rules which required that a partner proposing to
                    “dispose” of all or any of his or her partnership interest give
                    notice in writing of that desire. The court held that it did not. Relying on
                        <em>Re Kenzler</em>, Murphy JA noted that, in
                    assenting to the bequest of the partnership interest, the executor had caused
                    the partnership interest to devolve upon himself by way of
                    “transmission”; he had not, in so doing, purported to
                    “dispose” of the partnership interest (at [301]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are other reasons why cl 6 of the Rules of the 1976 deed is not
                        engaged in relation to the first, fourth, fifth and sixth transfers. As to
                        the first transfer, Ada’s interest in the partnership was vested in
                        Keith, as trustee of the Hamersley Trust, by virtue of the disposition in
                        Ada’s will. A legatee of an interest in the partnership takes such
                        interest by virtue of the disposition of the will, which becomes operative
                        by the assent of the executor: <em>George
                            Attenborough &amp; Son v Solomon</em> [1913] AC 76 at

                        287. Transmission of the interest to a legatee is not, generally, regarded
                        as an assignment or transfer of the interest: <em>Ex parte
                            Kenzler</em> (285–287); and <em>Andco

                        421–422. In assenting to the bequest, Keith, as executor of
                        Ada’s will, was not “proposing to dispose of … his
                        units” within the meaning of cl 6(1) of the Rules.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In light of the above, we hold that <em>Re Kenzler</em> is good law. Applying it to the present
                    case, it means that when the Respondent assented to the passing of property in
                    the Shares by making cheque payments of the liquidation surplus to the
                    Appellant, the equitable interest in the Shares devolved upon the Appellant
                        <em>under the Testator’s will</em> by the process
                    of <b><em>transmission</em></b>. Accordingly, s 259,
                    concerned as it is with the “transfer” of shares post-winding up,
                    is not attracted at all on a plain reading of that provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 259 is relevant only to bar the registered transfer of
                shares post- winding up </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The conclusion which we have just reached
                    –
                    <em>viz</em>, that s 259 does not operate to bar the
                    transmission of the equitable interest in the Shares to the Appellant – is
                    further buttressed by a <em>purposive</em> interpretation
                    of s 259.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     To begin with, it has been observed that our
                    statutory insolvency scheme has its “ultimate roots” in the
                    Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK) and the latter’s predecessor
                    legislation in England; and, despite certain idiosyncrasies, the fundamental
                    features of our statutory insolvency scheme continue to be found either
                        <em>verbatim</em> or in recognisable analogues of the
                    historical English insolvency enactments and their modern descendants (see the
                    decision of the Singapore High Court in <em>Beluga Chartering
                        GmbH (in liquidation) v Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation)
                        and another (Deugro (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party)</em> [2013]
                    2 SLR 1035 at [32]–[33]; that decision was reversed in <em>Beluga Chartering GmbH (in liquidation) and others v Beluga
                        Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another (deugro
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party)</em> [2014] 2 SLR 815, but not on
                    this particular point). Indeed, in so far as s 259 of our Companies Act is
                    concerned, it is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 127
                    of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“the 1986 Act”). It
                    is therefore useful to consider the rationale behind s 259 with reference
                    to the English statutory equivalent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As the Respondent has pointed out, it appears
                    clear from some of the leading English insolvency texts that the object of
                    s 127 of the 1986 Act is to prevent shareholders from evading liability as
                    contributories by transferring their shares to a man of straw after winding up
                    has commenced (see, for example, Edward Bailey and Hugo Groves, <em>Corporate Insolvency Law and Practice</em> (LexisNexis,
                    3rd Ed, 2007) at para 22.8 and Andrew R Keay, <em>McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“<em>McPherson’s</em>”) at para 7-062). Importantly for
                    our purposes, it has also been observed that “this policy is <em>sufficiently served</em> by avoiding <em>only</em> the transfer itself” [emphasis added] (see <em>McPherson’s</em> at para 7-062). In other words,
                    the focus of s 127 of the 1986 Act is directed only at avoiding a transfer
                    of the <b><em>legal</em></b> title in shares post-winding up in
                    so far as <em>the company</em> is concerned. As between
                        <em>the parties</em>, however, they remain free to
                    transact in the shares <b><em>beneficially</em></b> unhindered by
                    the prohibition in s 127. There is <em>no
                        prejudice</em> to the creditors of the company in allowing such
                    dealings because the persons <em>as reflected on the
                        company’s register</em> continue, in so far as the company is
                    concerned, to be liable to pay up on calls made in respect of those shares. This
                    is clear from the following insightful commentary in <em>Vulnerable Transactions in Corporate Insolvency</em> (Howard Bennett
                    and John Armour gen eds) (Hart Publishing, 2003) (“<em>Vulnerable Transactions</em>”) at para 8.44 on
                    the general purpose and effect of s 127 of the 1986 Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a compulsory winding up the liquidator has a duty to settle a list of
                        contributories and a power (delegated to him by the court) to make calls on
                        those contributories to the extent of their liability. By prohibiting any
                        transfer of the company’s shares or alteration to the register of
                        members after the commencement of winding up, section 127 eases that
                        task. The liquidator can be confident that members whose names were on the
                        register at the commencement of winding up should be entered on the list of
                        contributories. <em>If shares are transferred after the
                            commencement of the winding up, as a result of section 127, the
                            transferee is not entitled to be entered on the register of members. The
                            transferor remains liable for any call and is entitled to participate in
                            any surplus assets. </em><b><em>However, it appears
                            that a post-petition transfer is only void as regards any effect to be
                            given to it by or against the company with the consequence that the
                            rights and liabilities of the transferor and transferee

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Similar observations on the ambit of
                    s 127 were also made by the House of Lords in <em>Inland
                        Revenue Commissioners v Laird Group plc</em> [2003] 1 WLR 2476
                        (“<em>Laird Group</em>”) where, in
                    commenting on the insolvency regime’s purpose of making shares
                    non-transferable, Lord Millett (who delivered the leading judgment)
                    observed as follows (at [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is only the right to transfer <em>legal</em> title to the shares which is affected; shareholders
                        remain free to deal with the <em>beneficial</em>
                        interest in their shares. <em>The purpose of making the legal
                            title to the shares non-transferable is merely to freeze the
                            company’s register of members at the date of the winding up so
                            that the liquidator can safely deal with the shareholders whose names
                            appear on the register at that date.</em> … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The early English Court of Queen’s Bench
                    decision of <em>Rudge v Bowman</em> (1868) LR 3 QB 689
                    provides a useful illustration of the operation of s 127 of the 1986 Act in
                    the manner described above (see also the discussion in <em>Vulnerable Transactions</em> at para 8.45). In that case, the
                    claimant agreed to sell shares in a company to the defendant after the
                    commencement of winding up. Subsequently, the defendant purchaser sought to
                    avoid the contract of sale by relying on the then statutory equivalent of
                    s 127 of the 1986 Act. This argument was held to be misplaced; the
                    statutory prohibition had no application on the facts. In essence, the court
                    held that an agreement between parties in respect of a transfer of shares, as
                    opposed to a completed and registered transfer, was not caught by the section.
                    As Blackburn J observed (at 696):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The object of this section is obvious, inasmuch as when
                            a petition has been filed any shareholder might transfer his shares to
                            an insolvent person, and get him registered, so as to get rid of his own
                            liability, and the register might thus be made to consist of persons who
                            had nothing to lose, the legislature intervenes, and says, that between
                            the petition and the order no transfer of shares shall take place,
                            unless the court otherwise orders.</em> …
                        <b><em>As soon as the list of contributories is fixed, although
                            no transfer can be made till after that, I see no objection in substance

                            point of law forbidding such a bargain, or what is there in the statute
                            which says such a bargain shall not take place? </em><b><em>The seller would still remain a contributory</em></b>; and
                        there is no section in the statute which says a contributory may not bargain
                        as to shares; nor do I see why one of the terms of the bargain should not be
                        a contract of indemnity; not altering in any way the liability of the
                        transferor to the company, but giving him a right of indemnity over against

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We do not see any reason why the position in
                    Singapore should be any different from that which obtains in the UK. The aim of
                    preventing the evasion of liability behind s 127 of the 1986 Act is also
                    what underpins s 259 of our Companies Act and, indeed, our courts have also
                    found this policy to be sufficiently protected by applying s 259 to render
                    void only <em>registered</em> share transfers post-winding
                    up, without disturbing the parties’ underlying transactions that deal only
                    with the <em>beneficial</em> interest in such shares. In
                        <em>Kong Swee Eng v Rolles Rudolf Jurgen August</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 873, Steven Chong J considered whether s 259 applied
                    to prohibit a sale and purchase agreement of shares on the ground that
                    completion of the sale was scheduled to take place only after the commencement
                    of winding up. Chong J held that it did not. He referred to the Supreme
                    Court of Victoria decision of <em>Jordanlane Pty Ltd v Kitching
                        and others</em> [2008] VSC 426 (“<em>Jordanlane</em>”) – which, we pause to observe, also
                    demonstrates that the Australian position in respect of their statutory
                    equivalent (<em>viz</em>, s 468 of the Corporations
                    Act 2001 (Cth)) is similar to that in the UK – before stating as follows
                    (at [30]–[31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>The primary purpose behind s 468 of the Corporations Act
                            is to prevent a shareholder from evading liability as a contributory by
                            transferring shares to some impecunious person after the commencement of
                            winding up.</em> The Court [in <em>Jordanlane</em>] went on to observe that <b><em>such
                            a purpose can be sufficiently served by avoiding the transfer of the

                        a purchaser of the shares, such as the plaintiff, cannot avoid completion in
                        respect of agreements which were entered into prior to the commencement of
                        winding up, even if the company should subsequently be wound up.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Tan [counsel for the purchaser] quite rightly did not seek to rely on
                        s 259 of the Companies Act to avoid completion of the S&amp;P
                        Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The significance of the foregoing discussion
                    to the present case is in making clear that s 259 does not stand in the way
                    of the Appellant acquiring an equitable interest in the Shares even though the
                    Respondent’s assent as executor (which brought about that consequence)
                    occurred only <em>after</em> the Company had been ordered
                    to be wound up. Having regard to the purpose underlying s 259, it can be
                    appreciated why it is sufficient to interpret this provision as barring only the
                        <em>registered</em> transfer of shares. This prevents
                    shareholders from substituting themselves with other impecunious persons on the
                    register which may, in turn, place the liquidator (and the creditors of the
                    company) in a quite untenable position when calls are made in respect of the
                    shares. By “freezing” the register, to use
                    Lord Millett’s description in <em>Laird
                        Group</em> (see above at [48]), the liquidator’s position is
                    safeguarded in the sense that he is able to take those who are listed therein as
                    the persons properly liable as contributories, <em>notwithstanding</em> any dealings which such persons may have
                    privately entered into which affect the <em>beneficial</em>
                    interest in the shares. In light of this, it is unnecessary to read s 259
                    in a way that reaches <em>beyond</em> the register such
                    that it impinges upon the transactions of parties <em>inter
                        se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Therefore, apart from the fact that the
                    equitable interest in the Shares devolved from the Respondent (<em>qua</em> executor) to the Appellant (<em>qua</em> specific legatee) by way of “transmission”,
                    s 259 may <em>also</em> be understood as having no
                    application in the present case when one takes into account its policy
                    rationale. The outcome of our analysis pertaining to the underlying purpose of
                    s 259 is that it would only kick in, so to speak, <em>if</em> the Appellant had sought to <em>register</em> herself as the legal owner of the Shares (which she had
                    not done). In that event, she would have had to seek an order from the court
                    under s 259 approving such a transfer affecting the status of the
                    Company’s register. This leads us to our final observation in respect of
                    s 259, which concerns the limited relevance that it has to the present case
                    as alluded to at [3] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The limited relevance of s 259 to the present case </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It should be evident from what we have just
                    said in the preceding paragraph that the Appellant had a <em>choice</em> as to whether or not she desired –
                    <b><em>in addition to</em></b> having the <em>equitable</em> interest in the Shares – to <em>acquire the </em><b><em>legal </em></b><em>title in the Shares as well</em>. If she had elected to
                    acquire the <em>legal</em> title in the Shares <em>as well</em>, <b><em>then she would have had to
                        seek a court order as required under s 259</em></b>. <b><em>Indeed, in our view, this is the point of confluence, so to speak,
                        between s 259 under company law on the one hand and the law of wills on
                        the other.</em></b> We would add that so long as the transfer of the
                    Shares is not approved by the court pursuant to s 259, the Appellant would
                    –
                    <em>despite</em> her entitlement to <em>the
                        equitable interest</em> in the Shares –
                    <em>not</em> be entitled to the <em>legal</em> title in the Shares. This is notwithstanding the fact that
                    the transfer of the legal title in the Shares to the Appellant in this case, had
                    she chosen to apply to the court for an order to this effect under s 259,
                    would not appear to raise any controversy, it being clear that there was no risk
                    of the Testator’s liability being evaded as a consequence of such a
                    transfer. In our view, so long as a transfer of the legal title in shares is
                    sought in a situation where winding up has already commenced and it is not in
                    any way to the detriment of any other party, it is well within the spirit and
                    purpose of s 259 for the court to confirm that the said transfer is
                    appropriately effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Lau, however, relied upon the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>In re Fry,
                        Deceased</em> [1946] 1 Ch 312 (“<em>Re Fry</em>”) to argue that the failure to comply with
                    s 259 in the present case, akin to the failure of the transferor in
                        <em>Re Fry</em> to obtain prior approval for the
                    share transfer in that particular case, must result in the Appellant failing to
                    obtain an equitable right in the Shares (as was the decision in <em>Re Fry</em>). <em>However</em>, the
                    situation in <em>Re Fry</em> was <em>quite different</em>. As the Respondent has correctly pointed out,
                    that case involved an <em>inter vivos</em> transfer of
                    shares from the shareholder to <em>a </em><b><em>single </em></b><em>(and, indeed, the
                        </em><b><em>only</em></b><em>) other
                        party</em> (<em>viz</em>, the intended transferee
                    of those shares). The failure to obtain the requisite approval as required
                    statutorily in <em>Re Fry</em> meant that the
                        <em>legal</em> title in the shares concerned could not
                    be passed to the transferee; <em>neither</em> could that
                    transferee receive the <em>equitable</em> interest in the
                    said shares since that would have had to have been <em>accompanied</em> by the receipt of the <em>legal</em> interest which had (as we have just noted) <em>failed to pass because of the failure to obtain the requisite
                        approval</em>. In the present case, however, the <em>equitable</em> title in the Shares <em>did in fact
                        vest in the Appellant upon the Respondent’s assent as executor of the
                        Will</em>. Put simply, <em>unlike</em> the
                    situation in <em>Re Fry</em>, the Shares in this case
                    did <em>not</em> fall into a legal black hole for want of
                    compliance with s 259 <em>simply because compliance with
                        s 259 was not required in the first place in order for the equitable
                        title in the Shares to vest in the Appellant</em>. As already noted
                    above, the whole (legal and equitable) title in the Shares vested in the
                    Respondent <em>qua</em> executor by way of transmission
                        <em>via</em> the operation of law upon the
                    Testator’s death. <em>Thereafter</em> (as also noted
                    above), the <em>equitable</em> interest vested in <em>the Appellant</em> upon the Respondent’s
                assent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     For the reasons set out above, we are unable
                    to accept the Appellant’s argument which was premised on the failure to
                    comply with s 259. Whilst s 259 was not (as we have elaborated upon
                    above) wholly irrelevant, it did <em>not</em> prevent the
                        <em>equitable</em> interest in the Shares from vesting
                    in the Appellant by way of transmission pursuant to the Respondent’s
                    assent, and thereby giving effect to the Testator’s intentions under the
                    Will. In the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal with costs, together with the
                    usual consequential orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We should add, however, that we do not, with
                    respect, agree with the Judge’s observations, as follows (see the Judgment
                    at [39]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do <em>not</em> think the [Appellant], or perhaps
                        in this case her attorneys, <em>acted properly</em> in
                        attempting to defeat the bequest made to her so as to be able to <em>plunder a larger gain</em> from the estate. Certainly it
                        could not have been the Deceased’s intention to permit her so to do.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There is no evidence on record that there was
                    anything untoward in the conduct of either the Appellant or her attorneys.
                    Indeed, although we dismissed the appeal, the legal point that was raised was
                    not an easy one by any means, as demonstrated by the analysis
                above.</p>
