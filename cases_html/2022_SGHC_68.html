The defendant was to apply the rental income received to make payments towards the Overdraft, pay for property tax and income tax (for all three co-owners) arising from the Properties and to renovate and maintain the Properties and the Dedap Residence. If there was still income left after this had been done, the defendant could retain that money for himself and his family because he alone had paid for the renovation of No 12. As for accounting, the defendant was only to account to the father as and when the father required, and the father would update the plaintiff where necessary.

</div> The plaintiff relies on the use of the word “shall” in s 73A of the CLPA, which he argues creates a mandatory obligation.

</div>
</div>
</div> Certainly, I agree that s 73A of the CLPA imposes a mandatory obligation on a co-owner receiving more than his share of rental income. The true question, however, is how this mandatory obligation is to be fulfilled. While a co-owner receiving more than his share of rental income cannot unilaterally decide how to fulfil his duty under s 73A of the CLPA, agreement with or consent by the <span class="font-italic">other</span> <span class="font-italic">co-owner</span> will certainly modify the content of the duty. I cannot accept the proposition that the right of a co-owner in the position of the plaintiff to an account under s 73A of the CLPA is absolute and cannot be qualified by his own agreement, whether express or tacit. Accounting to a co-owner in a manner satisfactory to him is sufficient to fulfil the duty imposed by s 73A of the CLPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The second question is whether, generally, co-owners are subject to an equitable duty to account for receipt of more than their share of rental income, such that a constructive trust arises in respect of that rental income.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Section 73A of the CLPA was derived from the repealed English statute, s 27 of 4 and 5 Ann, c.3 Administration of Justice Act 1705. It was inserted into the CLPA in 1993, when the Application of English Law Act 1993 was enacted. Peter Butt, <span class="font-italic">Land Law</span> (Thomson Reuters, 6th Ed, 2010) (“Butt”) at para 14-42 explains the background to the English statute: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">History</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Originally, the law provided no general remedy to compel a co-owner to account to other co-owners for receiving more than his or her proportionate share of the income and profits from the property. An exception was where the co-owner had received the income as “bailiff’ for the other co-owners, whether appointed expressly or self-appointed by conduct. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The lack of a general remedy was partly rectified in 1705, when the Statute 4 and 5 Anne c 3, s 27, permitted a co-owner to bring an action of account against a fellow co-owner “for receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion”.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Thus, s 73A of the CLPA provides co-owners with a remedy against their fellow co-owners for an account for rental income from co-owned property where there would otherwise be none. Importantly, s 73A is not a statutory embodiment of a pre-existing duty at common law. This much is evident from the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 14<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Butterworths Asia, 2014) at para 170.0037, which refers to section 73A of the CLPA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Account between joint tenants</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At common law no action of account could be maintained by a joint tenant against another joint tenant who had occupied the whole property. However, a right to account as between joint tenants (and tenants in common) has been given by statute; and an action of account lies where the joint tenant has been in sole occupation, as well as where he has been in receipt of the rents. Joint tenants are not otherwise in a fiduciary relation to one another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I conclude that the general duty of a co-owner to account for rental income is purely statutory and contained in s 73A of the CLPA. There is no suggestion in the section that it reflects, or creates, an equitable duty to account. The plaintiff did not cite any authority to this effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is neither necessary nor helpful to introduce the law and language of trusts or constructive trusts when there is no hint of this in s 73A of the CLPA. I therefore hold that rental income that is subject to the duty under s 73A is not held on trust, whether implied or constructive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there an equitable duty to account in this case?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiff then argues that the circumstances of this case are such that the defendant was subject to an equitable duty to account, separate from the statutory duty under s 73A of the CLPA. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the voluntary assumption by the defendant of the management of the Properties has made him a fiduciary.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The plaintiff cites <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Panweld</span>”) at [45], where the Court of Appeal approved the remarks of Millett LJ in <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance plc v D B Thakerar &amp; Co (a firm) </span>[1999] 1 All ER 400 (“<span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance</span>”) about the two types of constructive trustees. The plaintiff argues that this is a situation where “the defendant, although not expressly appointed as trustee, has assumed the duties of a trustee by a lawful transaction that was independent of and preceded the breach of trust” and is therefore a Class 1 constructive trustee (as defined in <span class="font-italic">Panweld </span>at [44]–[46], citing <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance</span> at 408).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiff also relies on the remarks of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng </span>[2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>”) at [23] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In determining whether a claimant has a right to an account, the court has to first ascertain whether the defendant has received property in circumstances sufficient to import an equitable obligation to handle the property for the benefit of another: <span class="font-italic">Associated Alloys Pty Ltd v ACN</span> <span class="font-italic">001 452 106 Pty Ltd</span> (2000) 171 ALR 568 at 585.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiff thus argues that the defendant, having assumed responsibility for the management of the Properties, has created a situation whereby he is subject to an equitable obligation to hold rental income received by him for the benefit of the plaintiff. This voluntary assumption of the management of the Properties therefore made him a Class 1 constructive trustee in respect of the plaintiff’s share of the balance rental income. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my view, this analysis is not on point. There is an established class of fiduciary, namely an agent. To the extent that someone described as a manager is clothed with agency by another, that person would be subject to fiduciary obligations under the law of agency. The role of manager is not itself a legal term, and there is no need or room to introduce a new category of fiduciary by that name. Similarly, fiduciary obligations arise in the context of partnership. It would also be possible for co-owners to enter into a partnership in respect of co-owned property. However, both agency and partnership would require something more being agreed, expressly or impliedly, beyond the fact of co-ownership. That additional element would have to be pleaded, and proven. In this case, neither agency nor partnership was pleaded or argued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I return to the cases cited by the plaintiff. Neither assists him. <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah </span>was a case where the defendant held the property in question on trust for the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span> at [25]. <span class="font-italic">Panweld</span> involved a plaintiff company and a defendant director, between whom there was clearly a fiduciary relationship. Both authorities presuppose the state of affairs that the plaintiff is trying to establish: that the defendant has received property impressed with fiduciary obligations owed to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 There is therefore no basis for the plaintiff’s argument that the defendant was subject to fiduciary duties in respect of the plaintiff’s share of the balance rental income. Accordingly, he did not hold the plaintiff’s share of the balance, if any, on constructive trust for the plaintiff. There was no equitable duty to account to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40  Given my conclusion on this issue, I proceed with the rest of the issues in terms only of the statutory duty to account under s 73A of the CLPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Did the father make an arrangement with the defendant that modified the duty to account?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For this question to be answered in the affirmative, I would have to find, first, that the father did make the arrangement and, second, that the plaintiff accepted it. As the father did not give evidence, this issue depended on my assessment of the defendant’s account of his conversations with the father as well as my assessment of whether the plaintiff knew of the arrangement, notwithstanding his denial of knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Direct evidence of the arrangement and the plaintiff’s knowledge of it</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Significant direct evidence of the arrangement and the plaintiff’s knowledge of it emerges from the plaintiff’s text messages to the defendant in English, in particular the one on 28 January 2019, described at [11] above. It bears repeating: “All the year you collected the rent <span class="font-italic">we didn’t get a cent as you agreed to pay the tax</span> now you keep avoiding to pay the said tax” (emphasis added).

</div> By this message, the plaintiff confirmed that he knew that the defendant was collecting the rental from the Properties for many years and that he did not receive his share of it (not even one cent) because the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff’s income tax chargeable on it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This text message is difficult to explain unless the arrangement existed and the plaintiff knew of and assented to it, especially given that once the defendant paid the outstanding income tax the plaintiff did nothing in respect of the rental proceeds until his letter before action two years later described at [12] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Moreover, the text message revealed that there had been a longstanding arrangement for the defendant to pay the income tax chargeable on rental in respect of the Properties. The plaintiff as taxpayer would know or be able to find out readily how much income was being reported to the tax authorities on his behalf and how much tax was being assessed on that income. As he confirmed during cross examination, it was only in 2018 that he authorised the defendant to have direct access to his income tax assessments concerning the Properties.

</div> The same point follows from the fact that property tax was assessed and paid on the Properties. As co-owner, he could also check this at any time with the tax authorities. In these circumstances, where the plaintiff knew that there was rental income that he was not receiving, it is incumbent on the defendant to explain why he did nothing about it if the arrangement did not exist.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff argues that by “didn’t get a cent”, he simply meant that he had not received his share yet, but remained entitled to it.

</div> As the plaintiff said, he was the patriarch. His word carried great, if not decisive, weight with both plaintiff and defendant. It appears to have been the father’s decision to allocate ownership of a third of the Properties to each of the plaintiff and defendant regardless of their actual contribution. From 1989 until 2003, he took charge of the Properties and did not account for the rental to either plaintiff or defendant.

</div> Plaintiff’s counsel suggested that this meant there was no arrangement on the basis that, if there was, the father would have put it in writing. I cannot accept this suggestion. Read as a whole, the father’s notes are consistent with the defendant’s evidence of his conversations with the father. They show how the father trusted the defendant to manage his affairs in the interests of the family, and in particular thought of him as the member of the next generation who would take on future responsibilities for the family.

</div> This is all the more the case in the light of the nature of the parties’ relationships that I have outlined at [48] to [51] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, the rental income was to be used to pay for property tax on the Properties, as well as to renovate and maintain them. Such expenses come within the ambit of outgoings on real property. Secondly, income tax would be chargeable to each of the co-owners and it made sense for the defendant to take care of this, especially as the father was overseas in China. Thirdly, it made sense to use the rental proceeds to pay down the overdraft. The overdraft account was held in all three names of defendant, plaintiff and father. It is true that the overdraft was drawn upon for purposes other than purchase of the property but on the evidence before me, such purposes were approved by the father. Fourthly, using the rental proceeds to renovate and maintain the Dedap Residence also made sense, given it was in the father’s name and both the plaintiff and defendant resided there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This leaves the last alleged instruction, namely that the father told the defendant he could retain any balance for his own and his family’s use (referring to the defendant’s wife and son). It is this instruction that the plaintiff takes the most issue with.

</div> The plaintiff’s response rests, in essence, on three points.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 First, the plaintiff highlights that in the defendant’s first lawyer’s letter in response to the claim, 
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-d3f7a9bb-8506-4905-9a44-392d486aac1a" data-toggle="modal" type="button">54</button></sup>

</div> he dated this instruction to 2012 instead of 2004 as he subsequently pleaded and asserted in his testimony. This discrepancy, while real, is not something to which I am able to put much weight. It is not surprising, given the lapse of time, that the defendant’s first response might have been temporally inaccurate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Secondly, the plaintiff submits that the father had not wanted to join the defendant in his coffee shop business and the defendant began it as a “solo venture”.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-a1886d8f-f162-4e99-856f-fea5bc458b07" data-toggle="modal" type="button">55</button></sup>

</div> This meant that the defendant should personally bear the risks of that venture and the father would not have agreed to its costs being borne out of the rental proceeds. However, this point overlooks the fact that when the defendant stopped operating the coffee shop as his own venture, the property was then let out as a coffee shop. Thus, it could be said that the conversion to coffee shop contributed to obtaining that rental. It certainly is not implausible that the father would have seen it that way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Thirdly, the plaintiff submits that this instruction had the effect of depriving him of his one-third share in the Properties. The father would never have given this instruction because he could not have intended this. The plaintiff would have never accepted an arrangement which contained this instruction for the same reason. However, this submission overstates matters. There was never any suggestion that the plaintiff would be deprived of his one third share of the Properties themselves. Not sharing in the rental income is a separate matter. It is plausible that the father felt that the defendant should retain the balance rental income because he was responsible for the effort that went into finding and managing tenants, and had alone paid for the renovation of No 12. As for the plaintiff’s acceptance of the arrangement, he may have agreed for the same reason or simply out of deference to his father. After all, the father gave him the one-third share in the first place, notwithstanding his having contributed less than a third of the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s credibility</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, I do not accept plaintiff’s counsel’s criticisms of the defendant’s evidence. One such criticism concerned when the defendant was asked why he did not keep the plaintiff informed of how he was using the rental proceeds. The defendant ended his list of reasons by saying that those were what he could think of “currently”.

</div>
</div> Plaintiff’s counsel suggested that this showed he was just making things up as he went along. However, I assess the witnesses’ credibility as a whole, bearing in mind that this was their first experience of giving evidence in court. In addition, they gave evidence via an interpreter (notwithstanding some ability to converse in English, a facility which sometimes makes it harder for witnesses giving evidence in their preferred language). I assess that both plaintiff and defendant were trying to tell the truth as they saw it, but in the plaintiff’s case I conclude that he had mistakenly convinced himself that he had not known of or assented to the arrangement when in fact he had, in part due to his deference to the father. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Moreover, I am not impressed by arguments that the defendant might have unnecessarily incurred some expenses on the Properties that ought to have been borne by the tenant instead, or that he failed to keep the Dedap Residence in good condition. Such arguments had no bearing on whether the arrangement existed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Issue 2 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For the reasons above, I conclude that the arrangement existed and that the plaintiff accepted it. I add that part of the arrangement was that it was the father to whom the defendant accounted. It was up to the father, as it had been in previous years, to decide how he would keep the plaintiff informed. I draw the inference that, as a matter of family dynamics, the two brothers were more comfortable relating to their father than to each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The defendant contends that the arrangement was a permanent one and could not be terminated. I do not agree. It was not a contractual agreement. Rather, it was a voluntary arrangement in a family context. When and to the extent it was carried out, whatever was done could not be undone, but it could always be ended prospectively. This analysis follows that of the law of gifts, where a gift can be revoked until, but not after, it has been conveyed to the donee. The effect of the arrangement was not that the other co-owners gave up their rights to rental income in perpetuity. It was an arrangement that would last only for so long as the other co-owners did not put an end to it in respect of their own share of the rental income. Thus, at least from 2012 onwards (when the Overdraft was repaid) it was open to the plaintiff to bring the arrangement to an end and assert his right to an account as co-owner from the date of such notice, unmodified by any arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 For completeness, I do not find that the arrangement displaced or ousted the operation of s 73A of the CLPA. Rather, I analyse the arrangement as modifying the defendant’s duty to account under s 73A of the CLPA such that it was fulfilled by the defendant acting in accordance with the arrangement, which included dealing with the father and not directly with the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Was the plaintiff bound by the arrangement, whether by acquiescence or otherwise?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63  It follows from the discussion above that the plaintiff knew of the arrangement and assented to it. Consequently, he was bound by it until such time as he notified the defendant that he was putting an end to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  Given my finding that there was a positive assent, it is not necessary to consider the doctrine of acquiescence, by which assent is implied from a person’s standing by and permitting another to do an act that infringes a right of his, so that he cannot thereafter complain of the infringement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Is the defence of laches available?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65  As the liability to account is statutory and not equitable, laches has no application or relevance.

</div> As there is separate litigation concerning the validity of this lasting power of attorney, and as this action is brought only by the plaintiff and not the father, I proceed on the basis that the letter was sent only on the plaintiff’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The letter effectively demanded a full account from the defendant. While it asserted that there was an understanding that the defendant “would fully account… as and when requested, for any and all dealings”, which I have found did not exist, the letter does have the effect of terminating the arrangement that I have found did exist. Thus, at least from 26 March 2021, the defendant was liable to account personally to the plaintiff “for receiving more than his share or proportion of any rents or profits arising from [the Properties]” under s 73A of the CLPA, and could no longer rely on the modification of his duty by the (now terminated) arrangement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I also consider whether the arrangement terminated automatically upon the father’s incapacity. The plaintiff’s position is that the father ceased to have capacity in January 2021 while the defendant considers that it happened prior to the father’s execution of the lasting power of attorney on 28 October 2020.

</div>
</div> In my view, on the facts of this case, once the father was clearly not able to deal with the defendant, the defendant could no longer rely on the arrangement and would have to account directly to the plaintiff as his co-owner. The arrangement depended on the father’s continuing role, a role that he could no longer play once he lost capacity. There is sufficient evidence before me to conclude that this occurred latest by January 2021. I therefore find that the defendant’s full and unmodified liability to account to the plaintiff dates from 1 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I hold that the defendant need not account for rental income received prior to 1 January 2021 even if not expended by him. This is because under the arrangement he was entitled to retain the balance for his own and his family’s use.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Thus, the plaintiff succeeds on his claim for an account but only for rental income received from 1 January 2021 onwards.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 6: Is the defence of time bar made out?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defendant relies on s 6(2) of the LA which provides that an action for an account shall not be brought in respect of any matter which arose more than six years before the commencement of the action.

</div> In closing, however, he relied on the exceptions under ss 22 and 29 of the LA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It is not necessary for me to consider limitation further, given my finding that the defendant’s liability to account is only for the period from 1 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For completeness, however, I would express my views as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Section 6(2) of the LA applies to an action for an account under s 73A of the CLPA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Section 22 of the LA is not available to the plaintiff as there is no fraud on the part of the defendant nor is this an action in respect of trust property or its income.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Section 29 of the LA is not available to the plaintiff as the action is neither based on the fraud of the defendant nor concealed by the defendant’s fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Even leaving aside my finding that the plaintiff knew of and assented to the arrangement, this is not a case where anything was concealed. All these years, the plaintiff has known of rental income being reported to the tax authorities, that the defendant was collecting this income, and that he was not receiving his share of it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I have found that the arrangement existed. The plaintiff knew of and assented to it. The defendant fulfilled his statutory duty to account to the plaintiff by abiding by the arrangement so long as it remained in force. Nonetheless, the plaintiff was entitled to bring the arrangement to an end and attempted to do so shortly before commencing this action. In fact, the arrangement had already come to an end before that, by 1 January 2021, due to the father’s loss of mental capacity. The plaintiff has thus succeeded in his action for an account only in respect of a limited period, namely from 1 January 2021. I will hear counsel for plaintiff and defendant on the form of the order and on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I end by thanking counsel for agreeing to oral submissions within the period originally allocated for the evidentiary hearing. Having oral submissions upon or soon after the conclusion of the evidence is helpful because the evidence is fresh in everyone’s mind. It is my preferred practice for this reason. I consider that doing so fosters the just and expeditious resolution of disputes. Nonetheless it depends on the hard work and efficiency of counsel and I am grateful to them for that.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ling Daw Hoang Philip, Yap Jie Han (Ye Jiehan) and Lim Haan Hui (Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Narayanan Sreenivasan SC and Tan Si Xin Adorabelle (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
