</div> The 2nd plaintiff, Nishiki Real Estate Pte Ltd (“NRE”), is also a company incorporated in Singapore and is a holding company. NH is the ordinary shareholder of NRE. The 3rd plaintiff, Nishiki International Investments Pte Ltd (“NII”), is also a company incorporated in Singapore and a holding company. NII is a wholly owned subsidiary of NH.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The 1st defendant, Sankaty European Investments S.A.R.L (“Sankaty”) is a private limited company incorporated in Luxembourg. Sankaty is part of the debt division of Bain Capital LP. Sankaty was later renamed Bain Capital Credit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The 1st defendant demanded from the plaintiffs, payment of “Additional Interest” arising from a loan agreement entered into between the parties (“Loan Agreement”). Flowing from the alleged debt for “Additional Interest”, the 1st defendant also appointed the 2nd and 3rd defendants, Mr Sajjad Ahmad Akhtar (“Mr Akhtar”) and Mr Chin Sek Peng Michael (from PKF-CAP Advisory Partners Pte Ltd), as private receivers over certain assets of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In this suit, the plaintiffs sought in the main, to set aside the Loan Agreement and in particular, the “Additional Interest” provisions of the Loan Agreement, on the ground that the 1st defendant was put on notice regarding a certain conflict of interest. In the alternative, they sought to set aside the appointment of the appraiser, Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited (“HL China”), whom the 1st defendant had appointed to value certain assets. HL China’s valuation formed the basis for the computation of the “Additional Interest”. I find that the Loan Agreement was valid, but the appointment of HL China as the appraiser was not valid. I set out my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Kinshukai Medical Corporation (“KMC”) is a large healthcare provider in Japan, with substantial holdings of hospitals in Osaka. The controlling shareholder of KMC is Dr Yabumoto. Sometime in or about the middle of 2016, KMC restructured its corporate structure. In particular, ownership of KMC’s nine Osaka medical properties (the “Properties”) were transferred to a Japanese special purpose company called Nishiki Tokutei Mokuteki Kaisha (“Nishiki TMK”). Nishiki TMK is wholly owned by NRE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 KMC and Nishiki TMK entered into a transaction, whereby KMC would sell the Properties to Nishiki TMK, who would lease the properties back to KMC (“Sale Leaseback Transaction”). Nishiki TMK had to raise senior, mezzanine, and equity financing to finance the purchase of properties from KMC. The senior financing to Nishiki TMK was provided by Deutsche Bank Tokyo (“DB Tokyo”) and United Overseas Bank Tokyo (“UOB Tokyo”). This was to serve as bridge financing until Nikishi TMK sold the Properties to third party investors. The 1st defendant was involved in funding DB Tokyo for DB Tokyo’s mezzanine financing to Nishiki TMK at JPY6.9bn and providing a principal loan of JPY100m to NRE pursuant to the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Loan Agreement was entered into by the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant. It was concluded on the plaintiffs’ behalf by Mr Theodore Meegan (“Mr Meegan”). Mr Meegan was the sole director of NH and NRE from June 2016 to on or about 23 October 2018. He was the sole director of NII from 12 October 2015 to on or about 23 October 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Under cl 2 of the Loan Agreement, the 1st defendant would advance JPY100m to NRE (the “Loan”). Clause 6.1 provided that the Loan was repayable in full by the “Maturity Date”. Clause 8.1 of the Loan Agreement provided that “Fixed Interest” would accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan at the rate of 10% per annum. In or about July 2016, the 1st defendant advanced the Loan to NRE. About one year later, on or about 29 June 2017, NRE repaid the Loan and the accrued Fixed Interest in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Around 18 December 2017, Mr Meegan, with the assistance of Ms Zhang, who was then the plaintiffs’ office manager and secretary to Mr Meegan, emailed Dr Yabumoto to inform him that there were covenants with the 1st defendant that remained until equity exit, including a component for “Additional Interest”. Dr Yabumoto replied by email on 18 December 2017 that he did not know of such a covenant and asked to be informed of the conditions to be released from the covenant effectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 This covenant relating to “Additional Interest” is set out in cl 8.2 of the Loan Agreement, which provides that upon the occurrence of certain events specified in cl 8.2(a), the Plaintiffs would be obliged to pay the 1st defendant a component termed “Additional Interest” (the “Additional Interest”). It is the 1st defendant’s contention that the Additional Interest is compensation for the 1st defendant’s provision of the funding for the mezzanine financing that was fronted by DB Tokyo. Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement sets out the mechanism to calculate the quantum of Additional Interest. The relevant clauses from the Loan Agreement and Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Loan Agreement:]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">8.2 Additional Interest Payment</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In addition to the interest payments contemplated under Clause 8.1, the Borrowers shall pay to the Lender, as additional interest on the Loan, the Additional Interest Amount at the following time:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) on the acceleration of the Loan pursuant to Clause 19.16 (<span class="font-italic">Acceleration</span>) or the Maturity Date, or, at the election of the Lender (in its sole discretion), at such later date as may be specified by the Lender to the Borrower Agent (subject to clause (iii) below) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Schedule 1:]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1.

At the final amendment, the Maturity Date was 30 November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 23 October 2018, Mr Meegan was dismissed as sole director of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 On or about 4 December 2018, the 1st defendant emailed to the plaintiffs, a “Demand for Payment of Additional Interest Amount”. The email was sent to Mr Meegan, Mr Shinsuke Kataoka (“Mr Kataoka”) and Ms Zhang, but only Mr Kataoka received the email. Mr Kataoka was a consultant hired by Mr Meegan to assist in the financing for the Sale Leaseback transaction. Ms Zhang testified that her email was deactivated at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 5 December 2018, Ms Eve Lee (“Ms Lee”) of the 1st defendant wrote to Mr Kataoka suggesting the appointment of one of the following three firms as the Appraiser for the purposes of the valuation under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement: “Houlihan Lokey”, “PWC”, and “Deloitte”. Mr Kataoka replied by email on the same day to say that he had no objection to either “Houlihan” or “PWC”, “assuming they do a fair valuation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The 1st defendant appointed HL China on 6 February 2019 as the Appraiser. HL China subsequently subcontracted the entirety of the work of determining the fair market value of the Properties to Enrix Co Ltd (“Enrix”). For its report, HL China relied on Enrix’s valuation of the Properties, which was JPY28.601bn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 On or about 12 July 2019, the 1st defendant wrote a letter of demand to the plaintiffs. The 1st defendant quantified the Additional Interest at JPY1.111bn, based on a valuation report issued by HL China in March 2019 (the “HL China Valuation Report”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On or about 27 September 2019, the plaintiffs’ representative, Mr Takeyuki Matsuda (“Matsuda”), met with the 1st defendant’s representative, Mr Tetsuji Okamoto (“Mr Okamoto”). The plaintiffs’ case is that Mr Okamoto agreed that all parties refrain from taking any legal or enforcement action pending the plaintiffs’ appointment of a third-party appraisal firm to review the HL China Valuation Report. The 1st defendant’s case is that Mr Okamoto had consistently maintained that while the plaintiffs could be given more time to conduct their own internal checks, the Additional Interest of JPY1.111bn would not be compromised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On or about 18 October 2019, the 1st defendant appointed the 2nd and 3rd defendants as joint receivers (the “Receivers”). On or about 23 October 2019, the 2nd and 3rd defendants wrote to each of the plaintiffs informing that they have been appointed Receivers over the plaintiffs’ charged assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The plaintiffs raise three main issues in their action against the 1st defendant:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the 1st defendant was put on notice that Mr Meegan had neither actual nor apparent authority to negotiate and conclude the Loan Agreement, in particular the clauses in relation to the payment of the Additional Interest (the “Notice Issue”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether HL China is an “Appraiser” as defined in the Loan Agreement (the “HL China Issue”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) further and/or alternatively, whether there are manifest errors in HL China Valuation Report that justify the valuation being set aside (the “Valuation Issue”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The plaintiffs submit that if it is found that there is no Additional Interest Amount owed to the 1st defendant, then it follows that the 2nd and 3rd defendants’ appointment as Receivers is invalid and void.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Notice Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiffs’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Notice Issue determines whether the Loan Agreement, in particular the clauses on the Additional Interest, are void. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On or about 28 June 2016, Mr Meegan presented the 1st defendant with a “Certificate of Director of Nishiki Real Estate Pte Ltd” (the “NRE Director’s Certificate”). The NRE Director’s Certificate stated that Mr Meegan had authority to enter into the Loan Agreement on behalf of the 2nd plaintiff. It was signed by only Mr Meegan. The NRE Director’s Certificate also annexed a director’s resolution dated 27 June 2016 (the “NRE Director’s Resolution”). This was again signed only by Mr Meegan. The NRE Director’s Resolution identified the conflict of interest between Mr Meegan (as sole director) and the plaintiffs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After having carefully considered the foregoing, the sole director confirms that he has disclosed all his interests in the subject of these resolutions … In particular, it is noted that the sole director is also a director of each of Nishiki, NII, Brocade Investment and Brocade Management and a holder of 51% of the issued and paid-up shares in the capital of each of Brocade Investment and Brocade Management.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The plaintiffs submit that the evidence indicated to the 1st defendant that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Meegan stood to personally gain from any payment that the plaintiffs made to the 1st defendant as Additional Interest. The Loan Agreement provided for payment of 6.897% of the Additional Interest to Brocade Investment, and Mr Meegan was a 51% shareholder of Brocade Investment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Nobody from the plaintiffs, apart from Mr Meegan, had approved this conflict of interest between Mr Meegan as sole director and the plaintiffs. A fiduciary cannot self-authorise his own breach of fiduciary duty: <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilada Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span>”) [2011] 3 SLR 540 at [38].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In the premises, the 1st defendant was placed on notice that Mr Meegan did not have authority to enter into the Loan Agreement in relation to the Additional Interest, on the plaintiffs’ behalf. The 1st defendant was therefore obliged to make further inquiries to satisfy itself that the requisite shareholder consent, namely that of Dr Yabumoto, had been obtained. The 1st defendant did not do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiffs submit that the conflict of interest taints the provisions relating to Additional Interest. As a result, the clauses in the Loan Agreement on the payment of Additional Interest are a nullity and the 1st defendant cannot enforce the said clauses in the Loan Agreement.

The NRE and NH Director’s Resolution highlight the conflict of interest but were signed by Mr Meegan. It is trite law that a director cannot clear his own conflict of interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Among the documents referred to by the 1st defendant, the most relevant to their case are the L&amp;W Opinion, the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement and the specific comments made by Nishiki TMK’s lawyers from “NH/L&amp;W/N&amp;A” to the 1st defendant on the Loan Agreement at around 21 June 2016, in relation to Dr Yabumoto’s personal interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 First, para 1.3(w) of the L&amp;W Opinion stated that L&amp;W had reviewed a “certified true copy of the written resolutions signed by the relevant shareholders of each Singapore Company dated 27 June 2016, authorising the execution by each Singapore Company of the Principal Agreements to which it is a party …” Pursuant to para 1.2(h), NH is one such “Singapore Company”. The “Principal Agreements” include the Loan Agreement (see para 1.3(j) of the L&amp;W Opinion). Paragraph 2.2 of the L&amp;W Opinion also states that it is the opinion of L&amp;W that “the execution of, and the performance by [each Singapore Company] of its obligations under, the Principal Agreements to which it is a party has been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of each Singapore Company”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The plaintiffs submit that the L&amp;W Opinion is hearsay. However, the key issue is not whether the L&amp;W Opinion is hearsay now before the court, but whether the 1st defendant was entitled at the material time of the Sale Leaseback Transaction, to rely on paragraph 1.3(w) of the L&amp;W Opinion, which stated that L&amp;W had reviewed a NH shareholders’ resolution that authorised the execution of the Loan Agreement. The plaintiffs did not dispute that the document was authentic, marking it as such in the Agreed Bundle. As the L&amp;W Opinion was provided by the plaintiffs to the 1st defendant pursuant to Schedule 2-2 of the Loan Agreement,

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The plaintiffs submit that the NH shareholders’ resolution is not before the court. However, as the NH shareholders’ resolution would belong to the plaintiffs, I find that it is for them to disclose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The plaintiffs note that the L&amp;W opinion only addresses “customary matters for a transaction of this nature” and submit that this equated to regulatory formalities but did not cover issues such as breach of fiduciary duty. In particular, the plaintiffs submit that the effect of the assumptions at paras 1(e), 1(h) and 3 of the L&amp;W Opinion, relating to directors acting in good faith, limits on the powers of directors not being exceeded, and the absence of fraud, is to place issues on conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duties outside the scope of the L&amp;W Opinion. This is because the opinion effectively assumed that the requisite full and informed consent of the shareholders had been obtained. However, I note that that the L&amp;W Opinion also states at para 1.3 that for the purposes of issuing the opinion, L&amp;W had reviewed a list of documents. This includes the NH shareholders’ resolution. Hence, their opinion at para 2.2 that the execution of the obligations under the Loan Agreement had been “duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of each Singapore company”, is not based only on assumptions, but on specific documents L&amp;W had reviewed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The plaintiffs further submit that Schedule 2 of the L&amp;W opinion states that the opinion expresses no opinion as to matters of fact, and whether Dr Yabumoto gave informed consent or not is a “matter of fact”. I do not find this submission helpful to the plaintiffs’ case, as L&amp;W also specifically stated at para 1.3(w) that they had reviewed the NH shareholders’ resolution, which is what the 1st defendant relied on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The plaintiffs also submit that even if the NH shareholders’ resolution exists, it does not show that the NH shareholders knew of Mr Meegan’s potential personal gain under the Loan Agreement and that the NH shareholders proceeded to approve the Loan Agreement with that knowledge.

</div> However, the Loan Agreement is one of the agreements that is authorised by the NH shareholders’ resolution. The form of the Members’ Resolution in Writing (“MRIW”) is set out in the NH Director’s Resolution at para 4(a), and para 1 of the MRIW states that the transaction documents, including the Loan Agreement, be hereby approved, notwithstanding that Mr Meegan “is also a director of NRE, NII, Brocade Investment and Brocade Management and a holder of 51% of the issued and paid-up shares in the capital of each of Brocade Investment and Brocade Management”.

</div> In other words, Mr Meegan’s potential conflict of interest is expressly set out for the NH shareholders, in particular Dr Yabumoto, to see when they signed the NH shareholders’ resolution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The plaintiffs submit that the MRIW is silent on the fact that under the Loan Agreement, payment of the Additional Interest to the 1st defendant would result in a corresponding payment to Brocade Investment. In other words, even though there were documents indicating Mr Meegan’s potential conflict of interest through Brocade Investment and Brocade Management, even though the Loan Agreement was available to Dr Yabumoto in full and even if Dr Yabumoto signed off a shareholders’ resolution authorising the execution of the Loan Agreement, Dr Yabumoto did not know about the conflict of interest because he did not know of a particular provision in the Loan Agreement relating to the Additional Interest. This is a recurring theme in the plaintiffs’ response to other documentary evidence, and I will address this below after reviewing the other relevant documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Second, the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement signed by Dr Yabumoto binds him to certain obligations relating to the Loan Agreement. I find that this is highly indicative that Dr Yabumoto knew of the obligations arising under the Loan Agreement, as he would under the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement be liable for breaches under the Loan Agreement. The obligations include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Article 1.7 – Dr Yabumoto agreed that he cannot file any winding up (or similar) proceedings against the plaintiffs and Nishiki TMK within five years after the entire amount of debt arising from the Loan Agreement has been fully repaid;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Article 1.8 – Dr Yabumoto warranted that he had access to all facts and information regarding the Plaintiffs, Nishiki TMK and related contracts, and the 1st defendant may rely on Dr Yabumoto who has such access; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Article 2.10 – Dr Yabumoto agreed that if a breach of a related contractual obligation committed by a Nishiki-related party other than Nishiki TMK (including a breach of representations, warranties and compliance) is the result of the actions of KMC, Nishiki Corporation, or Dr Yabumoto, Dr Yabumoto would be liable for damages, losses, fees and expenses suffered by the 1st defendant that are considerably related. This would include breaches of the Loan Agreement by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The plaintiffs again, submit that while the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement sets out certain of Dr Yabumoto’s obligations relating to the Loan Agreement, the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement did not deal specifically with the Additional Interest payment to Brocade Investment or Mr Meegan’s potential conflict of interest. The plaintiffs thereby submit that the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement does not show that Dr Yabumoto knew of the conflict of interest and authorised the execution of the Loan Agreement with such knowledge. I will address this below after reviewing the other relevant documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Third, Nishimura and Asahi (“N&amp;A”), who were Nishiki TMK’s lawyers, had on 21 June 2016, sent across an amended version of the Loan Agreement with marked up comments from “NH/L&amp;W/N&amp;A”.

It should be that way. <span class="font-italic">I guess there was some sort of explanation but I'm not sure how much he knew</span>, so my answer is yes. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is not the plaintiffs’ position that Dr Yabumoto was unaware of the set-up of Brocade Investment and Brocade Management, including the fact that Mr Meegan and Mr Kataoka would be their shareholders. Mr Hiroyuki Horikawa (“Mr Horikawa”), a director of the plaintiffs, testified in his AEIC at paras 37–41 that Mr Meegan had explained this to Dr Yabumoto. Nor is it the plaintiffs’ position that Dr Yabumoto was unaware of the Sale Leaseback Transaction, the Loan Agreement or the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement. Instead, the plaintiffs’ position is that although Dr Yabumoto knew of them, he did not know specific details, in particular that the Loan Agreement also contained provisions for the Additional Interest and allocation of part of the Additional Interest to Brocade Investment. He may have forgotten, it was not explained to him or there was some explanation but it was unclear how much he knew from the explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 That there may have been such lack of internal clarity on the details for Dr Yabumoto, would not have been apparent to the 1st defendant. In preparing for the financing of the Sale Leaseback Transaction, they would have seen documents such as the L&amp;W Opinion, the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement and the N&amp;A edits, which showed Dr Yabumoto’s close involvement in the process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Taken together, I find that the weight of the documentary evidence is such that the 1st defendant was entitled to think that Dr Yabumoto knew about the Loan Agreement, including the Additional Interest provision, and Mr Meegan’s potential conflict of interest, and that Dr Yabumoto approved the execution of the Loan Agreement with such knowledge. Mr Matsuda sought to explain that Dr Yabumoto may have forgotten or may not have known because of the lack of proper explanation to him by his staff. However, Mr Matsuda had not even joined the plaintiffs when the Loan Agreement and Sponsor Indemnity Agreement were signed. Hence his evidence on this holds little weight. Moreover, even if Mr Matsuda’s explanation is accepted, the lack of adequate explanation to Dr Yabumoto by his staff or Dr Yabumoto forgetting what he was briefed on, do not change the fact that there was objective documentary evidence that the 1st defendant was entitled to rely on at the time of executing the Loan Agreement, indicating that Dr Yabumoto knew of the potential conflict of interest involving Mr Meegan and nevertheless approved of the Loan Agreement in totality. It is not for the 1st defendant to go behind such documents, to enquire if Dr Yabumoto had properly understood the documents that he had seen or signed or if the plaintiffs had properly briefed their ultimate shareholder on the material documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is notable that the only person who can explain away the weight of the documentary evidence is Dr Yabumoto, but the plaintiffs have chosen not to call him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Taking the evidence on the whole, I find that while there was a potential conflict of interest in Mr Meegan personally profiting from the Additional Interest, this was overcome by the documents indicating knowledge of Dr Yabumoto and his consent for the plaintiffs to nevertheless proceed with the Loan Agreement, as reflected in the L&amp;W Opinion, the Sponsor Indemnity Agreement and N&amp;A’s edits to the Loan Agreement jointly with NH protecting Dr Yabumoto’s personal interests, which the 1st defendant was entitled to rely on. Consequently, I find the Loan Agreement to be valid and enforceable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I will next consider the second issue, the HL China issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The HL China issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In the event the Loan Agreement is found valid and enforceable against the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs submit that the HL China Issue arises. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Plaintiffs’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In particular, the plaintiffs submit that the appointment of HL China failed to comply with the conditions in para 3(a) of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement for the appointment of an Appraiser, which provides that the valuation of the Exit Proceeds had to be determined by an “Appraiser”, which is defined as “a reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan appointed by [the 1st defendant] in consultation with the Borrower Agent”. Clause 20 of the Loan Agreement defines “Borrower Agent” as NRE. The plaintiffs make three submissions on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 First, HL China lacks “operations in Japan”. At most, HL China has an affiliate company with operations in Japan, which is presumably Houlihan Lokey K K (“HL Japan”). This appears to be a distinct corporate entity with a different Managing Director and different employees. Hence, it is HL Japan that has “operations in Japan”, not HL China. If the 1st defendant’s interpretation of “Appraiser” is correct, it would mean that the valuation could have been carried out by any entity within the Houlihan Lokey group (since they would all be “affiliated” to HL Japan). But it would be baffling if the parties had intended for the valuation of the properties in Osaka to have been carried out by for example<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Houlihan Lokey entity in Dubai.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Second, a reasonable reading of the definition of “Appraiser” indicates that not only was the Appraiser to have “operations in Japan”, but that the valuation was to be carried out by those “operations in Japan”. This is sensible, since the reference to “operations in Japan” necessarily indicates the parties’ objective intention for the valuation to be carried out by the Japanese operations of that “reputable appraisal firm”. The parties could not have intended HL Japan to be appointed as the Appraiser, but for the actual valuation to be subcontracted to a valuation firm in Egypt. Hence even if HL China is treated as having “operations in Japan”, the valuation process was still not<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>carried out by HL China’s “operations in Japan” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, HL Japan). Instead, the valuation was carried out by Enrix.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Third, HL China was not appointed “in consultation with NRE”. Only Mr Kataoka was consulted, but he is not a staff of NRE. The relevant timeline shows the following. Mr Meegan was dismissed as sole director of the plaintiffs on 23 October 2018. On or about 23 October 2018, Mr Horikawa and Ms Zhang were appointed as directors of the plaintiffs and the ACRA records were accordingly updated. Ms Lee from the 1st defendant knew by 4 December 2018 that Mr Meegan had “retired”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that he was no longer the sole director of the plaintiffs. On 5 December 2018, Ms Lee sent to Mr Kataoka a list of potential valuation firms, including a “Houlihan Lokey”. On the same day, Mr Kataoka replied that he had “[n]o objection, assuming they do fair valuation”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiffs submit that it is undisputed that Mr Kataoka held no position in and was not employed by the plaintiffs. The documentary evidence indicates that Mr Kataoka acted as part of Mr Meegan’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>team. Hence, even if Mr Kataoka had any authority (actual or implied) to speak on behalf of the plaintiffs, such authority would necessarily have been derived from Mr Meegan, and not the plaintiffs. Therefore, upon the removal of Mr Meegan as sole director, any actual<span class="font-italic"> </span>authority that Mr Kataoka had to represent the plaintiffs disappeared with Mr Meegan. The 1st defendant found out on 4 December 2018 from Mr Kataoka that Mr Meegan was no longer the sole director of the plaintiffs. The 1st defendant would at that point, have been put on notice of the termination of Mr Kataoka’s actual authority. From 4 December 2018 onwards, Mr Kataoka lacked actual and apparent authority to represent the plaintiffs. So, the appointment of HL China and any participation by Mr Kataoka in the valuation process could not have been on the account of the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">1st defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The 1st defendant’s response is that HL China is an appraiser with operations in Japan. HL China confirmed in its letter of engagement dated 6 February 2019 that it had a Japanese affiliate with offices in Roppongi, Tokyo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In addition, nothing in Schedule 1 precluded HL China from subcontracting the real estate appraisal to a valuer based in Japan. The plaintiffs knew that HL China would subcontract such work to a local Japanese real estate appraiser, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Enrix and did not raise any objections. Mr Kataoka had dealt with Enrix and even facilitated their real estate appraisal during the valuation process, without objection. In an email from Ms Lee to Mr Kataoka dated 5 December 2018, she explained that the 1st defendant “need a third party independent valuation firm (rather than just purely a real estate valuer) as this exercise will include the value of all of TMK’s assets”. This was why HL China was appointed even though Enrix conducted the valuation of the properties in Osaka. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiffs’ expectation that the Japan operation of the appraisal firm has to perform the valuation, is not expressed in Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement. If this was the parties’ intention, para 3(a) could have simply stated: “Appraiser” means “a reputable Japanese appraisal firm appointed by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower Agent”. However, it does not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59  The 1st defendant submits that the plaintiffs had by their conduct, represented that Mr Kataoka was authorised to deal on their behalf. Mr Kataoka engaged the 1st defendant and DB Tokyo in relation to Financing for the Sale Leaseback Transaction with the knowledge of Mr Meegan and Dr Yabumoto. Mr Kataoka continued to be involved in and acted as the plaintiffs’ representative post-investment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the closing of the Financing for the Sale Leaseback Transaction). Mr Kataoka was involved in the prepayment of the principal loan and fixed interest. Mr Kataoka was involved in the valuation process and was in direct communication with HL China and Enrix. Mr Kataoka had also arranged the 7 August 2019 meeting between the 1st defendant’s representatives, Dr Yabumoto, Nishiki Corporation representatives and senior lenders per the Mizuho refinancing that took place in June 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The 1st defendant also relies on the terms of the Investment Management Deed

There was an email from Ms Zhang to Dr Yabumoto dated 19 August 2016 conveying a message from Mr Meegan that with the first financing arrangement over, there should be separation of NH employees (Mr Meegan) from third party consultants (Mr Kataoka).

Pursuant to cl 2.1.3 read with cl 2.2 of the IM Deed, Mr Kataoka had the power of attorney from NRE to do any act on its behalf as its key decision-maker in relation to all material matters relating to the management of NRE, which would include its compliance with the Schedule 1 requirements. Consequently, Mr Kataoka had actual authority on NRE’s behalf, for the 1st defendant to “consult” with him on the appointment of the Appraiser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Examining the IM Deed, I note that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 2.1 states that the Manager is to carry out activities “in accordance with and subject” to the IM Deed, and then lists out various responsibilities under its sub-clauses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The “responsibility” of the Manager under cl 2.1.3 for which he remains “the key decision-maker in respect of all material matters” would consequently also be “in accordance with and subject” to the IM Deed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The power of attorney given to the Manager in cl 2.2 is to enable the Manager to carry out the responsibilities in cl 2.1 and would hence similarly be “in accordance with and subject” to the IM Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Hence in assessing the applicability of the IM Deed, it is important to understand the intended scope of the IM Deed. In this respect, it is useful to also examine the other provisions of the IM Deed that deal with the scope. Paragraph (c) of the Preamble states that Brocade Management as the Manager “is willing to provide to the Companies discretionary investment management services in relation to the assets of the Companies [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NRE and NII]”. The focus is thus on the provision of investment management services. This is borne out by the nature of the powers that the Manager has under cl 3 of the IM Deed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 3.1 vests the Manager with the power of discretionary investment management of the “Deposited Property” and the absolute discretion to determine the manner in which any Cash or other assets forming part of the Deposited Property should be invested. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 3.2 vests the Manager with specific powers in relation to the Deposited Property. While the valuation involves the Properties and other non-cash assets of Nishiki TMK, the requirement to consult is not in relation to the Properties, but in relation to the appointment of the Appraiser, whose role is to determine the valuation of Nishiki TMK’s assets for the purposes of the Additional Interest calculations under the Loan Agreement. It is a matter relating to the Loan Agreement and not the Deposited Property. Thus, cl 3.2 is not relevant here.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 3.3 vests the Manager with the power to direct the company to borrow or raise moneys in order to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, meet its liabilities. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 3.4 is titled “Compliance with Restrictions in Financing Documents” and gives the Manager the power to “procure that each of the Companies … complies in all respects with its <span class="font-italic">obligations</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… imposed on it by the Financing Documents.” [emphasis added]. This is the clause which the 1st defendant relies on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In this context, is the requirement under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement for the Appraiser to be appointed by the 1st defendant in consultation with NRE, a <span class="font-italic">right</span> of NRE to be consulted on the appointment of the Appraiser, or an <span class="font-italic">obligation</span> imposed on NRE by the Loan Agreement? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The obligation that is imposed by the Loan Agreement, is for the plaintiffs to pay the Additional Interest, the amount of which is based on the fair market value of Niskhi TMK’s assets as determined by an Appraiser, after making the deductions set out in Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement. But it cannot be said that the requirement for NRE to be consulted on the appointment of the Appraiser, is an <span class="font-italic">obligation</span> imposed on NRE by the Loan Agreement, as opposed to a <span class="font-italic">right</span> vested in NRE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In addition, what cl 3.4 provides is for the Manager to “procure that … the Companies” comply with the obligations, that is, to cause the Companies to comply, and not that the Manager steps into the shoes of the Companies to effect such compliance. This is similar to the ambit of the power in cl 3.3 which allows the Manager to “direct [the] Company to borrow”. This is in contrast to cl 3.1 where the power is not limited to the Manager procuring or directing the Company to move in a certain direction, but instead gives the Manager the “absolute discretion” to determine the manner of investment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Thus, on a close examination of the IM Deed, I find that it does not confer actual authority on Mr Kataoka to act on NRE’s behalf in relation to the consultation of NRE on the appointment of the Appraiser under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I next examine whether the plaintiffs had by their conduct, represented that Mr Kataoka had the authority to act for NRE in respect of the appointment of HL China as the Appraiser.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The 1st defendant would have been aware early on, certainly before the signing of the Loan Agreement, that Mr Kataoka was acting for Brocade Management, as the Nishiki Group’s investment agent for the Sale Leaseback Transaction, and not for NRE. This is clear from the IM Deed that the 1st defendant points to. Clause 9.3 of the IM Deed states that “neither the Manager nor its personnel or representative shall at any time be deemed to be employees of either Company during the term of this Deed.”

</div>
</div>
</div> Taking into account Mr Okamoto’s evidence and Ms Lee’s requests for an NRE contact from Mr Kataoka, I find it more likely that she had doubts and wanted a NRE contact for certainty, but continued with Mr Kataoka because he was who she had dealt with for the financing of the Sale Leaseback Transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Nevertheless, did the plaintiffs, by allowing Mr Kataoka to engage with the 1st defendant on the financing for the Sale Leaseback Transaction, and to continue to be involved in post-investment financial matters such as the prepayment of the principal loan and fixed interest, represent to the 1st defendant that Mr Kataoka would have the authority to act on NRE’s behalf in relation to the consultation of NRE on the appointment of the Appraiser? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I find not. The conduct that the 1st defendant relied on, are related to the financing matters for the Sale Leaseback Transaction. The IM Deed that the 1st defendant points to provides for Mr Kataoka’s role in relation to this. But such involvement does not extend to the plaintiffs representing Mr Kataoka as an NRE staff, and certainly not as someone who can bind NRE on their behalf in respect of the appointment of the Appraiser, who would in effect determine the amount of Additional Interest payable by the plaintiffs to the 1st defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Following from this, I do not accept the 1st defendant’s submission that there was estoppel by acquiescence by the plaintiffs because there was no challenge to the appointment of HL China or HL China’s subcontracting to Enrix, or that the plaintiffs facilitated site visits or reviewed the HL China Valuation Report. There is no evidence that anyone else from the plaintiffs were involved in such actions other than Mr Kataoka. Given that Mr Kataoka did not have authority to act on the plaintiffs’ behalf, his actions similarly would not bind the plaintiffs via estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the absence of any direct evidence that the plaintiffs were aware of Mr Kataoka’s involvement in the appraisal process, the 1st defendant submits in its closing submissions that the plaintiffs’ claims should be struck out under O 24 r 16 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), because <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">there is a real or substantial risk that a fair trial will no longer be possible as a result of the</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> plaintiffs’ failure to provide discovery of the emails between the plaintiffs and Mr Kataoka on the appraisal process. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The 1st defendant relies </span>on the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Grande Corp Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Cubix International Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] SGHC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Grande Corp</span>”). However, the application to strike out under O 24 r 16 of the ROC in <span class="font-italic">Grande Corp </span>came after the applicant there had sought for and obtained from the court a specific discovery order on 13 July 2015, obtained from the court an unless order on 21 November 2016, and filed a second application for an unless order on 8 February 2017 which was withdrawn after the respondents filed a List of Documents. In other words, there were prior applications for specific discovery for which specific discovery orders and unless orders were considered and made. The issue of whether discovery should have been ordered had already been determined, when the issue of O 24 r 16 of the ROC was considered by the court in <span class="font-italic">Grande Corp</span>. In this case, the 1st defendant has not pointed to any specific discovery order that the plaintiffs are in breach of. Nor has the 1st defendant shown that there were emails between the plaintiffs and Mr Kataoka regarding the appraisal process, that the plaintiffs deliberated suppressed. There is hence no basis for the plaintiffs’ claim to be struck out pursuant to O 24 r 16 of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In view of the above considerations, I find that the 1st defendant did not consult NRE as required under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement on the appointment of the Appraiser. Consequently, the appointment of HL China and the HL China Valuation Report is invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There is another sub-issue under the HL China Issue, on whether HL China falls within the definition of “Appraiser” under para 3(a) of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement. On a preliminary note, I agree with the 1st defendant that the language of Schedule 1, para 3(a) does not preclude an appointed “Appraiser” from subcontracting appraisal work. Neither does the language require that the Appraiser be a Japanese firm. In my view, the question which arises, is whether by the phrase “a reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan”, the appraisal firm must have (a) operations in Japan, and that (b) such operations in Japan must be appraisal operations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The applicable principles on contractual interpretation are set out in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Leiman</span><span class="font-italic">, Ricardo and another v Noble Resources Ltd and another</span> [2020] 2 SLR 386 where the court stated at [59]: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point is that the court looks to the text that the parties have used;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The court may have regard to the relevant context as long as the relevant contextual points are clear, obvious and known to both parties; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court has regard to the relevant context because it then places itself in “the best possible position to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions by interpreting the expressions used by the parties in the [contract] in their proper context”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In general, the meaning ascribed to the terms of the contract must be one which the expressions used by the parties can reasonably bear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Court of Appeal also stated at [60] that due consideration should be given to the “commercial purpose of the transaction or provision, and … why a particular obligation was undertaken”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement defines “Appraiser” as “a reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan appointed by the [1st defendant] in consultation with [NRE].” It is clear from Schedule 1 that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The role of the Appraiser is to determine the “fair market value of all of Nishiki TMK’s assets, including the Properties” (para 3(c)(iv) [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The largest component of Nishiki TMK’s assets is real estate in the form of the Properties, which are in Osaka, Japan.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The FMV of the Properties determined by the Appraiser would form the “Exit Proceeds”, which would then be applied in the manner set out in para 1(a) of Schedule 1.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Part of the amount determined by the Appraiser forming the Exit Proceeds, the Additional Interest, would be paid to the 1st defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The appraisal of the Properties by the Appraiser would thus directly and overwhelmingly impact the quantum paid out under the Additional Interest by the plaintiffs to the 1st defendant. Having regard to the relevant context and commercial purpose of the appraisal and the role of the appraiser, which would have been clear, obvious and known to both parties from the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the phrase “reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan” in Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement must mean a reputable appraisal firm (a) with operations in Japan, and (b) such operations in Japan must refer to appraisal operations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Given that the fundamental role of the Appraiser is appraisal, and the bulk of such appraisal is the valuation of the Properties located in Osaka, Japan, it is inconceivable that the parties would have envisioned a reputable appraisal firm with for example, only food and beverage “operations” in Japan, when they contemplated an Appraiser determining the valuation. It might be argued that the commercial purpose can still be achieved by the Appraiser subcontracting to an appraisal firm in Japan, even if the Appraiser did not have appraisal operations in Japan. However, this would render the requirement in Schedule 1, para 3(a) for “operations in Japan” meaningless and otiose. As a matter of contractual interpretation, phrases should be given effect where possible rather than rendered inoperative: see <span class="font-italic">Newall v Lewis </span>[2008] 4 Costs LR 626 at [33], <span class="font-italic">Dwr</span><span class="font-italic"> Cymru Cyfyngedig (Welsh Water) v Corus UK Ltd </span>[2007] EWCA Civ 285 at [13] and <span class="font-italic">Jani-Kang (GB) Ltd v Pula Enterprises Ltd </span>[2008] 1 All ER (Comm) 451 at [26]. Indeed, if it was the intention that the Appraiser need not have appraisal operations in Japan, Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement could simply have defined an appraiser as a “reputable appraisal firm” without the mention of “operations in Japan”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The 1st defendant contends that the appointed appraiser, HL China, has operations in Japan. However, I am unable to accept the 1st defendant’s argument. HL China has at the most, an affiliate in Japan. Mr Terence Tchen (“Mr Tchen”), a Managing Director of Houlihan Lokey Financial Advisors, Inc (“HLF”) in its Los Angeles office, and Co-Head of HLF’s Technical Standards Committee, said that this affiliate was a subsidiary of Houlihan Lokey, Inc (just as HLF and HL China were also subsidiaries of Houlilan Lokey, Inc). But he was not familiar with it. While the 1st defendant in their Reply Submissions refer to HL China’s letter to the 1st defendant dated 6 February 2019, where it was stated under para 6 that Houlihan Lokey “has a Japanese affiliate” in Tokyo engaged in the provision of certain banking and financial advisory services including, “without limitation, valuation advisory services”, this was not the evidence of Mr Tchen. At para 42 of his affidavit, he simply stated that the Japanese affiliate in Tokyo is “engaged in the provision of certain investment banking and financial advisory services” without mention of “valuation advisory services”. When he was asked if the affiliate was involved in the provision of real estate appraisal, he testified that he did not know all the capabilities of that office, but he was not specifically familiar with them doing real estate appraisals. He did not even know the legal name of the affiliate in Tokyo or what it was called generally or externally.

</div>
</div> In other words, on the evidence, HL China does not have operations in Japan, and neither HL China nor its affiliate have appraisal operations in Japan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Thus, I find that HL China is not an “appraisal firm with operations in Japan” and hence is not an “Appraiser” as defined in Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In summary, on the HL China Issue, I find that the appointment of HL China is invalid, as it does not comply with the requirements of an “Appraiser”, and the 1st defendant did not consult NRE on the appointment of the Appraiser, as required by Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement. The appointment of HL China and the HL China Valuation Report is consequently set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The plaintiffs have also submitted that as Mr Yoshinori Nagai (“Mr Nagai”) from Enrix did not file an AEIC or appear at trial, the Enrix reports are hearsay. If the Enrix reports are found to be hearsay, then the portions of the HL China Report that relies on the Enrix reports should be disregarded. Following from my findings above that the appointment of HL China and the HL China Valuation Report should be set aside, this issue does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I observe that on the facts, the lack of consultation with NRE and the improper appointment of HL China as the Appraiser were not just technical breaches. While I have found that the 1st defendant was entitled to proceed on the basis that Dr Yabumoto was aware of the conflict of interest and consented to the Loan Agreement, that only means that the conflict of interest does not void the Loan Agreement. It does not change the undisputed fact that Mr Kataoka stood to gain personally from computation of the Additional Interest, which the valuation of the Appraiser would determine. The more that the plaintiffs had to pay to the 1st defendant in terms of the Additional Interest, the more that Mr Kataoka stood to gain personally through his 49% share in Brocade Investment. Under the structure of the Loan Agreement, such conflict would have been safeguarded by the requirement that the 1st defendant consult NRE on the appointment of the Appraiser. The 1st defendant did not do so, but instead, consulted Mr Kataoka himself, without legal basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I would also add that even when the 1st defendant consulted Mr Kataoka around 5 December 2018 on the choice of appraisal firms, they did not inform him that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the 1st defendant had recently appointed Enrix to conduct a valuation of the exact properties that would be assessed by the appointed appraisal firm; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Enrix had just submitted its valuation report dated 28 September 2018 to the 1st defendant, just two months before the actual valuation date under the Loan Agreement, which was 30 November 2018 (Maturity Date); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that they would be recommending Enrix to the appointed appraisal firm to conduct the valuation of the Properties.

</div> The involvement of HL China as the engaging party of Enrix also does not alter Enrix’s pivotal role in the valuation. HL China subcontracted the valuation of the Properties to Enrix. In the “Engagement Overview” section of the HL China Valuation Report dated 13 November 2019, HL China stated that it “relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that the values for the Properties … as estimated by ENRIX are the fair market values of the assets as of November 30, 2018.”

</div> Enrix’s valuation of the Properties, at JPY28,601.400m, formed the overwhelming bulk of HL China’s assessment of Nishiki TMK’s assets, at JPY29,188.432m.

Mr Matsuda acknowledged on the stand that Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement did not require a report from HL China for the computation of the Additional Interest.

</div> What the Loan Agreement requires, is that the Appraiser makes a determination of the fair market value of the assets of Nishiki TMK. In addition, HL China’s valuation did not change between the draft HL Report (25 March 2019) and the final HL Report (13 November 2019). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The parties agree that the key question in the Valuation Issue is whether there are manifest errors in the HL China Valuation Report.

Arithmetic miscalculations, mistakes as to the identity of parties, or reference to a building that does not exist are examples of manifest errors. In contrast, the following are <span class="font-italic">not</span> manifest errors: (a) a failure to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant considerations; (b) errors in judgment, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, treating as good debts that turn out to be bad, or omitting losses that were not known at the time; and (c) mistakes in the reasoning process; and (d) negligent valuations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The plaintiffs’ expert, Mr Takashi Nakazawa (“Mr Nakazawa”), and the 1st defendant’s expert, Mr Junya Igarashi (“Mr Igarashi”), both produced written reports.

The HL China Valuation Report should hence be set aside because of Enrix’s material departure from instructions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I note that the Loan Agreement does not require the Appraiser to conduct appraisal on an “as is” basis. Neither did the instructions between the 1st defendant and HL China so require. Whether there is a deviation from HL China’s instructions to value on an “as is” basis is hence not material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The more critical issue is whether there is deviation from the requirement under Japan’s Real Estate Appraisal Standards (“JREAS”) Chapter 3, that the valuation should be conducted on an “as is” basis. JREAS Chapter 3, explains “as is” and states that in “the valuation of property where the influence of the operation is large, such as a hotel … [or] hospital, … it is difficult to value without assumption of specific business operation [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]. Accordingly, essentially, such property is valued based on the current operator, employees, competitiveness and other conditions.”

</div> I accept Mr Igarashi’s evidence that Enrix did not deviate from assessing the property “as is”, as Enrix did start by considering the operator “as is”, including its cashflows and rental payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, in the process of considering the operator “as is”, Enrix concluded that the Highest and Best Use of properties 2 and 5 would be to demolish them for residential use as they were less profitable and were in a location highly desirable for residential use. Thus, the more fundamental question, is whether Enrix committed a manifest error in valuing Properties 2 and 5 on the basis of demolishing for residential use, instead of valuing it on their existing use as a hospital. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Mr Nakazawa’s strongest argument on this point is that Enrix erred in concluding that as the hospitals in Properties 2 and 5 were running a deficit, they would not be able to afford the rent, hence Nishiki TMK’s income for these two properties would be zero, and the two properties would thus be better off demolished for residential use. In Enrix’s report, it is stated in respect of Property 2 that “the subject property is deemed not to afford rent, as it seems to be challenging to continue to pay rent for a long period of time unless the cash flow of the subject property will improve dramatically”.

</div> Mr Nakazawa’s view is that this is wrong as it ignores the fact that rent for the nine Properties, including Properties 2 and 5, have consistently been paid by KMC, the operator of these hospitals, as one lump sum rather than individually. Therefore, the assessment of rent affordability should be examined based on the KMC’s entire business revenue and expenses, rather than on an individual hospital basis. Moreover, there is no history of rent not being paid for Properties 2 and 5. JREAS Chapter 3 also states that in the appraisal of securitised properties, “area-specific or property specific assumptions that do not conform to the current conditions should basically not be made.” Yet, Enrix assumed that rental could not be paid when it had consistently been. This assumption did not conform to the “current conditions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Mr Igarashi’s response was that as the cashflow for Properties 2 and 5 were negative, it was reasonable for Enrix to assume that beyond the short term, KMC would cease the operations of these two hospitals, negotiate with Nishiki TMK to terminate the lease of these two properties and vacate the buildings voluntarily to minimise loss.

On this point, Mr Igarashi testified that Enrix might need to consider that rent had been paid by KMC throughout the lease period despite the existing poor cashflows for Properties 2 and 5.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 It is therefore clear from the surrounding facts and from Mr Igarashi’s testimony, that Enrix did not properly consider the lease agreements, and the assumption that KMC would not be able to pay the rents for Properties 2 and 5 was not a reasonable one for Enrix to make. This was not just a question of taking into account irrelevant considerations. On the evidence, there was no basis at all for Enrix to assume that KMC would not pay for the rents, or to assume that because of the poor cashflows from Properties 2 and 5, that KMC would decide to exit from the hospital business in Properties 2 and 5, demolish the hospitals there and rebuild for residential use. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The 1st defendant submits that this was not a manifest error as Mr Nakazawa also recognised that the rent in the Properties was not sustainable and had hence testified that the global rent would have to be reduced in the third year by 12.5%. It is just that the manner in which Mr Nakazawa and Enrix sought to address this need for rent reduction differed. However, I do not find that this reference to Mr Nakazawa’s advocacy for rent reduction changes the analysis at the fundamental level. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The key issue is whether having identified the negative cashflow issue for Properties 2 and 5, Enrix was justified in making the assumption that KMC would demolish the hospitals on those properties and rebuild for residential use. As set out above, the surrounding facts do not support such an assumption. Mr Nakazawa’s view that rent should be reduced, does not render this assumption of KMC’s behaviour any more viable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Moreover, at a conceptual level, valuation analysis proceeding on the basis of demolishing a hospital and converting that land to residential use, is different from a valuation analysis assuming existing use as a hospital but with rental reduction for that hospital. In the former scenario, there is a possibility of upside to the valuation for Nishiki TMK. In the later scenario, the reduced rental cashflows to Nishiki TMK would likely reduce the valuation. However, as the 1st defendant had not put such a question to both experts, there is no evidence from either expert on whether both valuation paths would indeed lead to the same valuation quantum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I therefore find that Enrix’s valuation of Properties 2 and 5 on the basis of demolishing for residential use, is an obvious error which is obviously capable of affecting the determination and which admits of no difference of opinion. It constitutes a manifest error.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 For completeness, in respect of the alleged first manifest error of “[w]rongly allocating rent for each property”, Mr Nakazawa also submitted that a reasonable appraiser would not have referred to the lease agreement between Nishiki TMK and KMC dated 30 June 2016 when this was subsequently replaced by the amended lease agreement dated 30 June 2017, which did not have the rental breakdown contained in the 2016 lease agreement. Mr Nakazawa testified that while the total amount of annual rent in the 2017 amended lease agreement remained the same as the 2016 lease agreement, at JPY1,610,000,000, differing rental breakdown for each property could result in changes in valuation as a different capitalisation rate was applied for each property. Mr Nakazawa testified that in his view, Enrix referring to the original rental breakdown as contained in the 2016 lease agreement was not completely wrong. But he would then have checked further, since the 2017 amended lease agreement no longer had such rental breakdown, by either assessing the rental apportionment based on the relative Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) of each property or by using the cost approach of assessing the value of the land and building for each property to ascertain the rental ratio. However, Mr Nakazawa also testified that he has not done such alternative analysis.

Notably, the total rental quantum remained the same in the 2017 amended lease agreement. It was reasonable for Enrix to refer to the 2016 lease agreement, for an indication of the rental breakdown. As the rental allocation was agreed to by KMC itself, I place little weight on the plaintiffs’ submission that this may have been done on an illogical basis. In any event, Enrix used the rental breakdown in the 2016 lease agreement only as a starting point and did further analysis on the reasonableness of those rental breakdown. Mr Nakazawa himself also accepted that Enrix was not completely wrong in referring to the rental breakdown. While Mr Nakazawa testified that he would have done additional alternative calculations, he did not do so and hence was not able to testify if such alternative approaches would have changed the valuation significantly or be negligible.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Wrongly assessing rental affordability (Issues 4 to 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The plaintiffs submit that the second manifest error, involving Issues 4 to 7, is that Enrix wrongly assessed rental affordability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In assessing rental affordability, Enrix had taken the JPY50m in the 2016 lease agreement for Property 1 as a starting point and conducted an assessment of the comparable rent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I note that while Mr Nakazawa has through his analysis, pointed out questions about the rental allocation between the properties, there is no evidence about why the parties to the lease agreement arrived at such allocation. But what is in evidence, is that both the tenant and owner did agree to the rental allocation set out in the lease agreement. Notably, the total rental amount in the 2017 amended lease agreement stayed the same as that in the 2016 lease agreement. It was just that the rental breakdown for each property was removed in the 2016 lease agreement. From the testimony of Mr Nakazawa, it is also unclear that he has a fairer method of rental allocation if the numbers in the 2016 lease agreement were not used. For example, in respect of Properties 2 and 5, while Mr Nakazawa initially testified that the rental allocation in the 2016 lease agreement could be used for an income approach valuation, he subsequently testified that the rental allocation there was not fair. In its place, he recommended allocating rent by each property’s share of total GFA. However, this could result in properties which have larger GFAs, having much larger rents even if their GOP was negative or lower than those with smaller GFAs. This would not be an inherently fairer method. Hence, I find that the questions raised by Mr Nakazawa, in themselves, do not render the rental allocation in the 2016 lease agreement as mutually unfair, such that Enrix manifestly erred in relying on it as a starting point in their appraisal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Inconsistent application of capitalisation rates (Issue 8)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The plaintiffs submit that the third manifest error arises from Mr Nakazawa’s Issue 8, where he asserts that Enrix incorrectly applied the capitalisation rate and discount rate in its assessment.

He would have checked the rent affordability together with capitalisation rate assessment, but it does not mean that Enrix made a manifest error.

</div> Mr Igarashi’s view was that it was common practice in Japan for renewal fees to be paid by the tenant to the landlord for the lease of the land upon the expiry of the lease, and that a commission of 10% of the renewal fees was typically paid by the landlord to the real estate agent.

</div> Nevertheless, Mr Igarashi disagreed with Enrix’s assumption that the renewal fee would be generated in year six under its discounted cash flow (“DCF”) calculations. His view was that it ought to be generated in year eight under the DCF calculations. This would result in an estimated market value of JPY952m compared to Enrix’s JPY954m.

The plaintiffs rely on Mr Igarashi’s concession on this point to submit that this is such a basic error and shows the haphazard manner in which Enrix appears to have prepared the report. However, in so far as whether particular errors are manifest errors, they would have to be assessed on their own. I hence consider the plaintiffs’ submission on the error relating to the property management fee, which Mr Nakazawa emphasised as the manifest or more serious error in Issue 9, within the confines of both experts’ testimony on this particular alleged error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The plaintiffs submit that Enrix failed to deduct Nishiki TMK’s property management fee as an expense item from each property’s cashflow analysis. Mr Nakazawa points out that a property management agreement dated 22 March 2016 was executed between Nishiki TMK and CBRE, the asset manager of Nishiki TMK (“Property Management Agreement”). The Property Management Agreement specifies that the property management work shall be outsourced by CBRE to a third-party property manager. Thereafter, Brocade Asset Management (“BAM”) was assigned as the property manager and a fixed property management fee of JPY416,667 per month is payable to BAM. Yet, in Enrix’s Valuation Report, under the cash flow modelling in the “income approach” (both direct capitalisation and the DCF), the property management fee is nil. This results in a difference of about JPY100m in valuation.

This is because the lease agreements are “triple-net” lease agreements, whereby the tenant takes on the payment of all expenses including taxes and maintenance. This is pursuant to Article 8 of the 2016 lease agreement.

The main document the plaintiffs rely on is the email sent by Mr Okamoto to Mr Matsuda on 1 October 2019 where Mr Okamoto said: “<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Regarding the valuation process, I hope that it will be completed in two weeks so that we can reach the final agreement</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.” This in itself does not support the plaintiffs’ position. </span>Mr Okamoto’s explanation of this email is that the 1st defendant was prepared to give the plaintiffs two weeks as courtesy, but not more. This explanation is supported by the internal correspondence of the 1st defendant. Mr Okamoto’s email to his colleagues on 29 September 2019 shows that he had not made any commitment at the 27 September 2019 meeting and that he was seeking in the email, his colleagues’ views of the next steps. In his email reply to Mr Okamoto on 29 September 2019, the 1st defendant’s Mr Scott Garfield (“Mr Garfield”) says he would tell the plaintiffs “two weeks” as courtesy. On 30 September 2019, Mr Okamoto informed his colleagues that he had told Mr Matsuda that they would “not have any valuation discussions going forward and that the appraisal process on their end will just be for them to confirm the calculations” and proposed that the 1st defendant give a two-week timeframe for the plaintiffs to confirm. This was followed by the 1 October 2019 email sent out by Mr Okamoto to Mr Matsuda.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I therefore find that the evidence supports the 1st defendant’s position that there was no oral agreement between Mr Matsuda and Mr Okamoto.

It is also contrary to a position that they took at trial through their counsel, who stated that the plaintiffs “are not saying that there was a duty on the part of the receivers to go and investigate more”.

There, the court held that it was inappropriate for the receivers of a law firm to bring proceedings against Mr Forster, the law firm’s former principal, without ascertaining to whom the moneys were due and despite being advised by Deloitte that nothing was owing by Mr Forster to the clients. In this case, the 1st defendant’s position as lender, was that the debt was due and quantified on the basis of the draft valuation report, which was done in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement only requires the Appraiser to make a determination. It does not require a written report or a final report. The 1st defendant had also informed the Receivers that the numbers in the final valuation report would not change,

There is hence no evidence that Mr Akhtar did receive the Access Letter. The plaintiffs did not apply to re-examine any of the 1st defendant’s witnesses or Mr Akhtar on this point but chose to leave it as that. In any event, the draft HL China Valuation Report in March 2019 had already contained a disclaimer that it “may not be relied upon by any other person or entity”, while the disclaimer against use of the valuation report by the “receivers” is found in the final HL China Valuation Report dated 13 November 2019. These reports were available to the plaintiffs before the trial.
