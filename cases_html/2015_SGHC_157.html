<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Plaintiff, Jannie Chan Siew Lee (“the
                    Plaintiff”), is a debtor to the Defendant, Australia and New Zealand
                    Banking Corporation Group Limited (“the Defendant”). The Defendant
                    is a bank incorporated in Australia. The Defendant had, in the course of its
                    business, made a loan (“the loan’) to Timor Global LDA
                    (“TGL”), a company incorporated in Timor-Leste. Pursuant to the
                    terms of the loan, TGL pledged its assets to the Defendant. The Plaintiff is a
                    shareholder and director of TGL and she executed a personal guarantee with the
                    other directors of TGL in favour of the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       TGL defaulted on the loan and the Defendant
                    commenced legal action against the guarantors and obtained judgment against the
                    Plaintiff. When the Plaintiff did not satisfy the judgment, the Defendant served
                    a Statutory Demand (“SD”) issued under r 94 of the Bankruptcy
                    Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“BR”) on the Plaintiff on 15
                    October 2014. On 8 January 2015, the Plaintiff instituted these proceedings
                    against the Defendant to obtain an extension in time for her to apply to set
                    aside the SD under r 97 of the BR and to set aside the SD under r 98 of the BR.
                    I dismissed both applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The grounds for the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff’s case was that the SD
                    should be set aside as it was defective because the security offered by TGL was
                    not listed in the SD. Her explanation for not filing the application to set
                    aside the SD on time was that she had been negotiating with the Defendant
                    through her solicitors for the Defendant to forebear from presenting a
                    bankruptcy petition against her. However, the negotiations broke down on 7
                    January 2015, and she filed the application on the following day. As the main
                    focus of the submissions from the parties was whether the SD should be set
                    aside, I dealt with this issue first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Setting aside the SD</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The application is grounded on rr 94(5) and
                    98(2) of the BR. They read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">94(5) If the creditor
                            holds any property of the debtor or <em>any security for
                                the debt</em>, there shall be specified in the demand
                            —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the full amount of the debt; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the nature and value of the security or the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98(2) The court shall
                            set aside the statutory demand if —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    it appears that the creditor holds assets of
                                the debtor or <em>security in respect of the
                                    debt</em> claimed by the demand, and either rule 94(5) has
                                not been complied with, or the court is satisfied that the value of
                                the assets or security is equivalent to or exceeds the full amount
                                of the debt …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Mr Thuraisingam, counsel for the Plaintiff,
                    contended that the word “security” in the phrases in italics
                    refers to all security held by the creditor in relation to the debt (“the
                    all-security construction”). The Defendant took the position that the
                    word “security” refers only to security provided by the debtor to
                    whom the SD was issued (“the debtor’s-security
                    construction”). This issue arose because the assets pledged by TGL were
                    not specified in the SD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The proper meaning of “security”
                    in rr 94(5) and 98(2) had been dealt with and settled in two cases, namely,
                        <em>Re Loh Lee Keow and another, ex parte Keppel TatLee Bank
                        Ltd</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 283 (“<em>Re Low Lee
                        Keow</em>”) and <em>Sia Leng Yuen v HKR
                        Properties Ltd</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 587 (“<em>Sia Leng Yuen</em>”). In <em>Re Loh Lee
                        Keow</em>, Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) undertook a careful analysis
                    of rr 94(5), 98(2)(c), 101(2), and Form 2 of the BR, and ss 63(1) and (2) of the
                    Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2000 Rev Ed) (“BA”). His conclusion was
                    that the word “security” in rr 94(5) and 98(2) means security on
                    the property of the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings. He explained (at [33])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It does not make sense that while the creditor’s petition does not
                        have to mention a security on the property of a third party, the court
                        should be obliged to take the third party’s security into account in
                        deciding whether to make a bankruptcy order on hearing the petition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In <em>Sia Leng Yuen</em>,
                    Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) was urged to find that <em>Re
                        Loh Lee Keow</em> was wrongly decided and that the security offered by
                    parties other than the debtor who was the subject of the bankruptcy proceedings
                    had to be disclosed and taken into account in an SD. Lee JC declined to do that,
                    and agreed with Woo JC’s construction because “in a very
                    tightly-argued judgment, the judge had demonstrated that the view which he held
                    was the only one possible.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Rule 98(2)(c) is not unique to Singapore. It is
                    virtually identical to r 6.5(4)(c) of the Insolvency Rules 1986 (SI 1986 No
                    1925) (UK), which provides that a court may set a statutory demand aside
                    if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t appears that the creditor holds some security in respect of the debt
                        claimed by the demand, and either Rule 6.1(5) is not complied with in
                        respect of it, or the court is satisfied that the value of the security
                        equals or exceeds the full amount of the debt …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>White v Davenham Trust
                        Ltd</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 747 (“<em>White v
                        Davenham</em>”), the English Court of Appeal held that the
                    security contemplated by r 6.5(4)(<em>c)</em> was the
                    security provided by the debtor. Lloyd LJ, in delivering the judgment of the
                    Court, explained at [35] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If… the security which the creditor holds is given not by
                        the particular debtor but by a third party, whoever that third party may be,
                        that security is not over an asset which can have any effect on the bankrupt
                        estate of the particular debtor and it is accordingly irrelevant for the
                        purposes of rule 6.1(5) and correspondingly for the purposes of rule
                        6.5(4)(c). …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Mr Thuraisingam, however, disagreed. He
                    contended that Woo JC was wrong in two ways and Lee JC was also wrong for
                    agreeing with him as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Woo JC had failed to identify the
                        objects underlying the BA and the BR and failed to take a purposive
                        interpretation of them when determining the meaning of “
                        security”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     Woo JC had failed to give adequate weight to the “unfair
                        consequence” of applying the debtor’s-security construction in
                        that a guarantor can end up being in worse-off than the principal because,
                        if both the guarantor and the borrower came under the bankruptcy regime, the
                        creditor has to take into account the assets pledged by the borrower in
                        bankruptcy proceedings against the borrower but does not have to do that in
                        bankruptcy proceedings against the guarantor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     If Mr Thuraisingam had given proper
                    consideration to Lloyd LJ’s explanation quoted in [9] above, he would have
                    realised that the debtor’s-security construction is not unfair because if
                    the positions were reversed and the guarantor had provided the security, the
                    security would not be taken into account in bankruptcy proceedings against the
                    borrower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Mr Thuraisingam referred to and relied on s
                    9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed (“IA”)), which
                    stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the interpretation of a provision of a written law, an interpretation
                        that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether
                        that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall
                        be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or
                        object.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Thuraisingam then referred to <em>Dorsey James
                        Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 354, in which
                    the Court of Appeal confirmed at [18] that the purposive approach mandated by s
                    9A(1) takes precedence over any other common law principle of statutory
                    interpretation, and argued that the “overarching object” of the BA
                    and BR is to give debtors “an opportunity to make a fresh start in their
                    financial matters while recognizing the rights of the creditors.”
                    However, he did not provide any support for that construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Defendant, on the other hand, contended
                    that Parliament’s intention was to arrive at a proper balance between the
                    interests of the debtor, the creditor and society in bankruptcy proceedings. The
                    Defendant referred to the speech of Minister of Law Prof S Jayakumar at the
                    Second Reading of the Bankruptcy Bill (Bill 16 of 1994) in the lead up to the
                    enactment of the BA (<em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (25 August
                    1994) vol 63 at col 399) where he said that the proposed act was intended
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… improve administration of the affairs of bankrupts and protect
                        creditors’ interests without stifling entrepreneurship. We will strike
                        a balance between the interest of the debtor, the creditor and society.
                        There will be greater accountability of bankrupts in the administration of
                        their estates on the one hand, and speedier discharge of bankrupts on the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     More recently, Senior Minister of State for
                    Law Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee said at the Second Reading of the Bankruptcy
                    (Amendment) Bill 2008 (Bill 39 of 2008) (<em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (19 January 2009) vol 85 at col 1144) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In 1995, we enacted the present Bankruptcy Act to protect creditor
                        interests without stifling entrepreneurship and enterprise, and to improve
                        the administration of the affairs of bankrupts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Such statements may be taken into
                    consideration in the interpretation of statutory provisions pursuant to ss
                        9A(3)(<em>c</em>) and (<em>d</em>)
                    of the IA. The two statements quoted, which are the clearest expressions of the
                    intent and purpose of the BA available, must be given due
                consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It hardly needs saying that the correctness of
                    a purported purposive interpretation of a written law is only as good as the
                    correctness of the identification of the purpose or object of that law. While
                    the bankrupts’ recovery of their financial status is one of the objects of
                    the BA, it is not the overarching object. The BA aims to balance and protect the
                    interests of debtors, bankrupts, creditors and society. A construction that
                    enables the debtor to rely on security which he has not provided, but has been
                    provided by another party, to lower his indebtedness does not promote a proper
                    balance of the interests of the debtor, the party which provided the security,
                    and the creditor. This is a major flaw in Mr Thuraisingam’s reading of the
                    purpose and object of the BA and BR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The all-security construction proposed by Mr
                    Thuraisingam runs into further difficulty in the face of the judicial finding
                    that it does not make sense when examined against the provisions of the BA and
                    BR (<em>Re Loh Lee Keow</em> at [33]) and that the
                    debtor’s-security construction was the only possible construction
                        (<em>Sia Leng Yuen</em> at [9]). There must be strong
                    and compelling reasons for a statutory rule to be given a construction which is
                    at variance with the provisions of its parent legislation, and there are no such
                    reasons here. Mr Thuraisingam’s argument ignores the clear logic behind
                    the debtor’s-security construction set out at [6] and [9]
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Next, I addressed the complaint that Woo JC
                    did not give proper consideration to the fact that the construction he adopted
                    was unfair in that it put the Plaintiff in a less favourable position than TGL.
                    In <em>Re Loh Lee Keow</em> at [35], Woo JC noted that
                    while it may seem unfair, that was clearly the intention of the legislation. Woo
                    JC’s construction is consistent with the Minister’s statement that
                    the legislation was intended to strike a balance between the interests of the
                    debtor, the creditor, and society. Rules which ensure that assets pledged to
                    creditors to secure loans are reserved to reduce the pledgors’
                    indebtedness, and not the indebtedness of other parties would reflect such a
                    balance. While a party in the Plaintiff’s position may consider that to be
                    unfair, it is really not unfair that a debtor is not permitted to rely on
                    security put up by another party. In any event, the legislature is empowered to
                    protect pledgors’ assets in that way, and Woo JC was right to accept and
                    uphold that. Consequently, I reject the Plaintiff’s two grounds for
                    setting aside the SD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application to extend time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Rule 97(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the BR states that an application to set aside SD may be made within 14 days
                    from the date the SD is served. As the SD was served on the Plaintiff on 15
                    October 2014, the application should have been made by 30 October 2014. That
                    being the case, the Plaintiff was 70 days late when she filed her application on
                    8 January 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Plaintiff deposed in her supporting
                    affidavit to her application that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    The main reason why I had not applied to set aside
                            the Statutory Demand earlier was because my solicitors, M/s Eugene
                            Thuraisingam, have been in without prejudice negotiations with the
                            Creditor’s solicitors, M/s WongPartnership LLP, with a view of the
                            Creditor forbearing to present a bankruptcy petition against
                        me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    Unfortunately, these negotiations broke down on 7
                            January 2014 and I have immediately taken steps to set aside the
                            Statutory Demand …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There were no other reasons offered for the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Plaintiff can apply for an extension of
                    time to apply to set aside the SD. Rule 97(3) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may, upon the application of the debtor, allow the debtor an
                        extension of time to make his application to set aside the statutory
                        demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The BR do not provide any guidelines for the
                    exercise of the court’s discretion, and there is no reported decision on
                    this provision. However, I considered this question in <em>Rafat
                        Ali Rizvi v Ing Bank Hong Kong Branch</em> [2011] SGHC 114 and held at
                    [32] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 97(1)(a) provides that the application was to be filed within 14 days from the service of the statutory demand. Rule
                        97(3) empowers a court to extend the period the period. When an application
                        is made for an extension of time, a court would have to take into
                        consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the period of the delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the reasons for the delay;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the grounds for setting aside the statutory demand; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) the prejudice that may result from an extension of time;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but the weightage of each factor has to be determined on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I took the same approach here. A delay of 70
                    days was substantial as the application should have been made within 14 days.
                    The reason for the delay was unsatisfactory because there was no agreement that
                    there would be no need to apply to set aside the SD while negotiations were
                    on-going. The grounds for setting aside the SD were, for the reasons given in
                    the foregoing paragraphs, unsound. While it appeared that little or no prejudice
                    would result if time were extended, I placed greater weight on factors (a), (b)
                    and (c), and found that the Plaintiff had not made out a case for time to be
                    extended.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Plaintiff’s applications were
                    dismissed with costs fixed at $3000 plus reasonable disbursements to be paid by
                    the Plaintiff to the Defendant.</p>
