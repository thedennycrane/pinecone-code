The Company is a holding company and owns 100% of the shares in Agape Vietnam Company Limited (“Agape Vietnam”). Agape Vietnam was incorporated for the purpose of investing in a waterfront city project in Vietnam (“the Vietnam Project”). Since the Vietnam Project was critical to EY’s valuation exercise, EY appointed CBRE (Vietnam) Co., Ltd (“CBRE”), a property valuer in Vietnam, to assess the market value of the Vietnam Project. For the purposes of this dispute, one significant fact is that under Vietnam laws, Agape Vietnam has an obligation to set aside part of the residential land in the Vietnam Project to build social houses.

This is the correct approach as the fundamental contract between the parties is that they had agreed to be bound by the opinion and views of their chosen expert. The courts will not allow a dissatisfied party a second bite at the cherry on the merits so as to preserve the sanctity of the joint agreement made by the parties. In doing so, the court is doing no more than to uphold the parties’ contractual bargain, since they have contracted for the expert’s determination to be final and binding on the merits. As stated by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat Construction Co Pte Ltd v Presscrete Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 634 at [29]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is quite inappropriate for a court to substitute its own view on the merits when the parties have already agreed to rely on the expertise of an expert for a final and irrevocable determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In this case, the defendants did not allege that there was fraud, collusion, partiality and the like on the part of EY. Therefore, these grounds would not be relevant for the purpose of setting aside the EY Report. However, the defendants argued that there were manifest errors in the EY Report and that there was material departure from instructions by EY. Hence, my decision will deal only with the allegations raised by the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 For manifest errors, the dissatisfied party, in this case the defendants, had to show a “manifest error” in the expert’s determination, as opposed to a mere error. As stated by Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Campbell v Edwards </span>[1976] 1 WLR 403 at 407:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is simply the law of contract. If two persons agree that the price of property should be fixed by a valuer on whom they agree, and he gives that valuation honestly and in good faith, they are bound by it. <span class="font-italic">Even if he has made a mistake they are still bound by it. The reason is because they have agreed to be bound by it</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Furthermore, as said by Lawton LJ in <span class="font-italic">Baber v Kenwood Manufacturing Co Ltd and Whinney Murray &amp; Co </span>[1978] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 175 at 181:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Now experts can be wrong; they can be muddle-headed; and, unfortunately, on occasions they can give their opinions negligently. <span class="font-italic">Anyone who agrees to accept the opinion of an expert accepts the risk of these sorts of mi</span><span class="font-italic">sfortunes happening. </span>…<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The principles enunciated above are particularly pertinent in this case, where parties were embroiled in litigation but decided to submit to expert determination as part of the Settlement Agreement. The defendants have themselves stated that their motivation for entering into the Settlement Agreement was to avoid protracted litigation.

</div>
</div> The parties did not dispute that only a manifest error and not a mere error would suffice to set aside the EY Report. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32  There is some debate over the approach the court should adopt with respect to manifest errors. In <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> <span class="font-italic">Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1256 </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1004 (“<span class="font-italic">Geowin</span>”) at [16], Rajah J preferred a narrow approach, and explained that the term “manifest error” is “no more than a convenient shorthand reference to a patent error <span class="font-italic">on the ‘face’ of the award or decision</span>” [emphasis added]. This approach was similarly adopted in <span class="font-italic">Quek Kwee Kee Victoria (in her personal capacity and as executor of the estate of Quek Kiat Song, deceased) and another v Quek Khuay Chuah </span>[2014] 4 SLR 1 at [33]. The rationale for the narrow approach was stated succinctly by Rajah J in <span class="font-italic">Geowin </span>at [19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court should not stray beyond the actual report or award in considering how or why the decision was reached. The underlying evidence ought not to be re-examined or referred to as this would be tantamount to an appellate hearing and to that extent contrary to what the parties had solemnly agreed to. <span class="font-italic">The right of review should be confined to correcting apparent mistakes that appear on the face of the report or award (eg apparent mathematical miscalculations) and to de</span><span class="font-italic">termining whether the expert has complied with his terms of appointment</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, in <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR 385 (“<span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance</span>”) at [89], Chan Seng Onn J adopted a less strict approach, and opined that there was no absolute rule precluding reference to matters beyond the face of the award or decision to establish a manifest error. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In my view, I would respectfully prefer Rajah J’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Geowin</span> for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Firstly, the narrow approach better accords with the fundamental principle that parties would have intended for the expert’s determination to be final and binding, except in exceptional circumstances. The narrow approach honours and upholds the concept and importance of the sanctity of contract, which must be adhered to and respected by the contracting parties. It ensures that the courts will only have a limited right of review, which parties would have intended for as a general starting principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Secondly, the narrow approach is more consistent with the principle that there must be finality to litigation as agreed by the parties. The parties had reflected this desire in appointing a mutually agreed expert valuer to ascertain the market value of the plaintiffs’ 19% shareholding in the Company in the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Thirdly, the narrow approach recognises that “courts have no greater expertise than expert valuers; and that where parties have chosen voluntarily to commit the determination of valuation to an expert, judicial restraint is an appropriate response” (<span class="font-italic">Holt v Cox </span>(1997) 23 ACSR 590 at 597, cited in <span class="font-italic">Geowin </span>at [18]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In any event, I note that even on Chan J’s approach in <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance</span>, the definition<span class="font-italic"> </span>of a manifest error still remains narrow. As observed by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Jayanti Nadarajoo v Bronw</span><span class="font-italic">yn Helen Matthews and another </span>[2015] SGHC 222 at [73]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Even on Chan J’s approach, it is clear that not all error is manifest error. Only error which is capable of affecting the outcome of the determination and <span class="font-italic">admits no difference of opinion </span>amounts to manifest error. The example provided is a clear arithmetical error. In that case, Chan J found manifest error in the determination of the period of interest because of a technical arithmetical error in the expert’s discount calculations. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 To be clear, it is not the law that only a “clear arithmetical error” will amount to a manifest error. However, the example provided in <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance </span>is highly indicative of the type of errors that will suffice to reopen an expert’s determination. Another example is where the expert valuer refers to a building that does not exist (<span class="font-italic">Walton Ho</span><span class="font-italic">mes Ltd v Staffordshire County Council </span>[2013] EWHC 2554 (Ch) at [46]). In <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance </span>at [90], Chan J endorsed the definition of “manifest errors” found in <span class="font-italic">Veba Oil Supply &amp; Trading GmbH v Petrotrade Inc </span>[2002] 1 All ER 703 at [33]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… “oversights and blunders so obvious and obviously capable of affecting the determination as to admit of no difference of opinion”. [original emphasis omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Therefore, there are two requirements that the dissatisfied party has to fulfil before the court will conclude that an error is a manifest error. Firstly, the error must be obvious and admit of no difference of opinion. Secondly, the error must be one that is obviously capable of affecting the expert’s determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On the facts, even if I had applied Chan J’s approach which was advocated by the defendants, I found that EY had not made any manifest errors. The alleged errors identified by the defendants were not obvious – they required the court to extensively investigate whether or not EY and CBRE had made any error. This was plainly not the appropriate forum for such an inquiry to be undertaken given the court’s limited right of review. Furthermore, the alleged errors identified by the defendants were merely differences of opinion between the defendants (relying on Mr Nyugen’s expert opinion and the Savills Report) and the plaintiffs (relying on Dr Luu’s expert opinion and the CBRE Report). As acknowledged by counsel for the defendants, the defendants would not have been able to identify the alleged errors of law without the benefit of Mr Nyugen’s expert opinion and the Savills Report.

The Statement of Work did not stipulate in granular detail how EY was to conduct its valuation. There was certainly nothing to the effect that EY had to ensure that CBRE valued the Vietnam Project in accordance with the Sale Price Formula, or that CBRE should not assume that all the social houses would be sold. Furthermore, apart from the two alleged errors of law, the defendants also did not allege that EY and CBRE had performed their valuations with disregard to Vietnam laws. In fact, the starting assumption unless proven otherwise must be that CBRE, as a professional entity operating in Vietnam had performed its valuation in accordance with Vietnam laws. The burden was on the defendants to prove on a balance of probabilities that CBRE had failed to comply with Vietnam laws in the CBRE Report. Even if CBRE had failed to take into account the relevant Vietnam laws in the two instances highlighted by the defendants, it did not follow that EY had departed from its instructions. The critical distinction between a departure from instructions and mistakes made by the expert as stated at [55] above must be emphasised again.

</div> Thus, CBRE should be invited to clarify whether or not its assumptions were still accurate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The court is an adversarial process and the burden is on the parties to prove their respective cases. The court is entitled to rely on all the available information that is before it at the time of the hearing. If the defendants believed that CBRE had made inaccurate assumptions, then the burden was on <span class="font-italic">the defendants </span>to produce an affidavit from CBRE. Based on what was before the court, it could not be said that CBRE had made any inaccurate assumptions. CBRE did not admit that it had made any errors. The defendants’ assertions that CBRE had made inaccurate assumptions were robustly contested by the plaintiffs, as stated above at [42]–[51]. If CBRE refused to engage the defendants and the defendants were insistent that CBRE had made inaccurate assumptions, then it is for the defendants to initiate an action against CBRE for negligence in its valuation that resulted in the defendants paying more for the plaintiffs’ 19% shareholding in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Moreover, pursuant to cl 1.6 of the Settlement Agreement, the defendants were required to make payments to the plaintiffs in two instalments in April 2018 and June 2018 respectively.

The central plank of the defendants’ case was premised on the Savills Report. It was undeniable that without the Savills Report and Mr Nyugen’s expert opinion, almost all of the defendants’ allegations of manifest errors would not have been identifiable and visible for the defendants to launch a series of attacks on the EY Report. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, disagreed with the Savills Report and its accompanying criticism of the EY Report. In other words, this was a case of a difference of opinions between the two pundits on the valuation of the plaintiffs’ 19% shareholding in the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Savills Report was commissioned by the defendants after they had seen the EY Report and realised that they had to pay US$4,165,675 for the plaintiffs’ 19% shareholding in the Company. The defendants must have felt that the Settlement Sum was too much and decided to seek a second opinion which they were not allowed to do under the Settlement Agreement. Nevertheless, the defendants went ahead and commissioned the Savills Report. If the Savills Report had valued the plaintiffs’ 19% shareholding in the Company higher than the EY Report, the defendants would not have taken issue with the EY Report and this case would not have come before the court. However, from the Savills Report, the defendants alleged that the “Disputed Value would be reduced by approximately US$3.4 million (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 15.5%)”

</div>. Since the defendants had agreed in the Settlement Agreement to be bound by the EY Report, they must abide and honour that agreement notwithstanding the findings of the Savills Report. If the defendants felt strongly that the EY Report was erroneous and unfair, then the appropriate recourse would be to commence an action against EY for professional negligence which resulted in the defendants paying more to the plaintiffs for their 19% shareholding in the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 EY had engaged CBRE to value the Company’s assets in Vietnam. The plaintiffs’ legal pundit in Vietnam laws, Dr Luu, confirmed that CBRE’s valuation was in compliance with Vietnam laws. The defendants’ legal pundit, Mr Nyugen, on the other hand, had a contrary legal opinion. Hence, this was a difference in legal interpretation and there were no manifest errors of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  Therefore, regarding Issue 1, I found that there were no manifest errors of law and fact.
