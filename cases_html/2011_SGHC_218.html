<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The dispute in this case on ancillaries is in
                    respect of the division of assets between the couple and maintenance for the
                    children and the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The couple were married in May 1990 in Turkey.
                    In the first half of 2011, the husband was 46 years of age and the wife was 49
                    years of age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The husband filed his Writ for Divorce on
                    13 April 2009 based on the wife’s unreasonable behaviour. The wife
                    filed a counterclaim on 22 June 2009 based on the husband’s
                    unreasonable behaviour. After some mediation, the parties agreed to proceed on
                    the counterclaim of the wife only. However, before me, the husband said he stood
                    by his Statement of Particulars but agreed not to proceed with that in order to
                    minimise acrimony and have an uncontested hearing for the divorce
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Interim judgment was granted on 2 March
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There are two daughters of the marriage. They
                    were 15 and 12 years of age in the first half of 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The husband is apparently successful. At one
                    time he was earning $25,000 per month in his job from which he was terminated in
                    November 2009. The wife alleged that from 12 August 2010 to
                    11 February 2011, he had a take home salary from another job of about
                    $26,000 per month. On the other hand, the husband said his monthly income from
                    his job as at the time of the hearing of the ancillaries was about $19,000 a
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The husband was the sole breadwinner. He paid
                    for the expenses of the family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The wife said she was a homemaker most of the
                    time. She said that she worked for a total of about seven years and two months
                    during the marriage. On the other hand, the husband said that she worked for ten
                    years and three months and studied for a masters degree in business
                    administration for one year and seven months. He said that she was a fulltime
                    homemaker for six years and two months only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The wife said that she moved with the husband
                    each time his job took him to another country. She was the primary caregiver of
                    the daughters and was in charge of the home whether or not she had a job or was
                    studying. The family moved to Singapore in 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The husband moved out of the rented
                    matrimonial home in April 2008. Apparently, a female friend of his lived with
                    him thereafter before any divorce action was initiated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The wife obtained a job in 2006 after the
                    family moved to Singapore in 2006. In August 2008, she obtained another job. Her
                    monthly salary then was $10,560 per month. At the time of the hearing of the
                    ancillaries before me, she was earning about $13,000 per month from another new
                    job.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     She and the two daughters moved out of the
                    rented matrimonial house when the tenancy expired and into a rented
                    apartment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Custody and care and control of the two daughters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The parties agreed to joint custody of the two
                    daughters and that the wife is to have care and control of them with reasonable
                    access to the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The parties agreed to some extent on the
                    assets held by the husband and by the wife. The details of the agreed assets and
                    disputed assets for each party are found in Schedule A and Schedule B of my oral
                    judgment which is attached hereto. The schedules excluded three assets which
                    were to be dealt with separately from the pool of assets. These three assets
                    were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     An apartment at SW1H 9NE United
                        Kingdom registered in the name of the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The husband’s membership in One Marina
                        Club in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Paintings, drawings and prints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same schedules
                    contain my conclusion on the disputed assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I set out below my reasons for my conclusion.
                    I will first deal with the wife’s allegations in respect of assets of the
                    husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First disputed asset</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">691 Credit Suisse Incentive Share Units Q2 Maturity Year
                2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The wife alleged that the husband had sold
                    these units in or about June 2010. The Singapore dollar equivalent of the sale
                    proceeds was $37,796.18 and had been deposited into the husband’s Citibank
                    account. The wife alleged that the husband did not account for this sum. I
                    should mention that the balance in this account on 1 June 2010 was $342.04
                    before the inclusion of the sum of $37,796.18. After the inclusion of the latter
                    sum on 1 June 2010, the balance was $38,138.22. The balance as at
                    31 August 2010 was $9,754.26. The wife was not claiming the $9,754.26
                    (which was supposed to have been accounted for elsewhere as part of his Citibank
                    account) but claiming the $37,796.18 mentioned above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The husband alleged that the $37,796.18 had
                    been spent on living expenses between June 2010 to September 2010. He
                    had received income from a job in September 2010 after obtaining a job in
                    August 2010. He produced the bank statements for the three months of June
                    to September 2010 which eventually showed a balance of $9,754.26 as at
                    31 August 2010 as mentioned above. In these three months, there were
                    deposits of sums which were negligible except for one sum of $2,945.21. In any
                    event, the $9,754.26 balance as at 31 August 2010 shows that he did not
                    spend the entire $37,796.18 in the three months of June to August
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The wife alleged that some of the expenses as
                    shown in the bank statements were for more than one person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Nevertheless, in my view, that was irrelevant.
                    Generally speaking, if the husband had spent money on normal living expenses for
                    himself and/or for his female friend, he need not account for the money as part
                    of his assets. The money has been spent. There is no suggestion that he was
                    lending money to the female friend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On the other hand, I noted that two of the
                    withdrawals in the three months were not for normal living expenses. One was a
                    withdrawal of $6,947.05 on 17 June 2010 apparently to pay his solicitors.
                    Another was a withdrawal of $3,900 on 24 June 2010 apparently to pay one
                    Thia Lee Sa Liza. No specific explanation was given for the purpose of this
                    withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The total of these two withdrawals was
                    $10,847.05. I was of the view that this sum should be included as part of his
                    assets for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second disputed asset</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Cartier ring</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The wife alleged that the husband had bought a
                    cartier diamond ring in or about February 2009 in London for his female
                    friend for £45,000. She wanted the Singapore dollar equivalent of that sum
                    to be included as part of his assets for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The husband did not dispute the purchase or
                    the quantum spent but said it was a gift to his female friend and that the value
                    should be excluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This is not a normal living expense and it is
                    still an existing item. I was of the view that the husband may give what he
                    wants to his female friend but not at the wife’s expense. The value should
                    be included as part of his assets for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The wife wanted to use an exchange rate at
                    about the time when the ring was purchased. This would have converted
                    £45,000 to S$93,287.70. I was of the view that a more current exchange rate
                    should be used. Using the exchange rates published in the Straits Times issue of
                    2 August 2011, the average exchange rate was £1 = S$1.9765. Therefore,
                    the S$ equivalent of £45,000 was S$88,942.50.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Third disputed asset (referred to as the eighth disputed item in the
                arguments on 8 July 2011) </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Money received by the husband from 2008 to 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Paras 22 to 24 of the wife’s affidavit
                    of 13 July 2010 alleged that the husband had received income of about
                    $1,836,259.98 out of which a balance sum of $1,129,401.33 remained unaccounted
                    for.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, para 39 of the husband’s
                    affidavit of 8 October 2010 refuted this. He also provided copies of his
                    statements of account of various bank accounts to show that the income had been
                    reflected in them as well as his use of the same. Thereafter, the wife did not
                    challenge his explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I accept the husband’s explanation and I
                    reject the wife’s allegation in respect of this item.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fourth disputed asset (referred to as ninth disputed item in the
                arguments on 8 July 2011)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Para 26 of the wife’s affidavit of
                    13 July 2010 alleged that the husband had an account with Haris Direct, a
                    personal wealth management firm. She had seen statements of account from Haris
                    Direct before the husband left the matrimonial home in April 2008 and took
                    the statements with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Para 38 of the husband’s affidavit of
                    8 October 2010 alleged that the Haris Direct account had in fact been
                    closed prior to their move to Singapore in 2006. Also, the company (or firm)
                    ceased to exist in 2007 or 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The wife could have made inquiries as to
                    whether Haris Direct was still in existence in order to refute the
                    husband’s allegation. She did not. I accepted the husband’s
                    explanation in respect of this item. Since the account had been closed even
                    before the couple moved to Singapore, I did not include it as part of the pool
                    of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Fifth and sixth disputed assets (Credit Suisse options – raised
                in arguments on 10 August 2011)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The wife also questioned why the value of
                    items 15 and 16 of the husband’s assets (as disclosed in Schedule A) had
                    declined when compared to earlier disclosures by the husband. The simple
                    explanation was that the values of such assets changed from time to time and he
                    had updated their values then. His counsel had also offered to provide further
                    updates, for example, as at 8 August 2011 but I declined such updates for
                    two reasons. First, the exercise of updating must be cut-off at some point in
                    time especially for assets of that category otherwise different figures would be
                    given to the court from time to time. Second, 8 August 2011 was a
                    particularly volatile time for financial markets and the values then would not
                    necessarily reflect the fair value of those assets. As counsel for the wife did
                    not dispute that the husband had used figures updated since his earlier
                    disclosure, I accepted the husband’s figures without the further updating
                    offered by his counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I now move on to the husband’s
                    allegations in respect of the wife’s assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Seventh disputed asset (referred to as the third disputed item in the
                arguments of 8 July 2011)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Wife’s Standard Life Group Pension Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The husband alleged that although the wife had
                    said that she did not own any pension plan, the documents she had disclosed did
                    refer to such a plan. This was a letter from The Standard Life Assurance Company
                    issued on 6 December 2004 to her in respect of a pension plan number
                    [xxx].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Para 30 of the wife’s affidavit of
                    8 February 2011 alleged that she would be entitled to £500 per year
                    only after 2007 in respect of her Standard Life pension plan. However, a
                    document at pp 31 to 32 of her affidavit was a yearly statement from Standard
                    Life Assurance Limited for the year ending 22 November 2010 in respect of a
                    Group Personal Pension Plan also with the number [xxx] and it stated that the
                    current value of her plan on 22 November 2010 was
                £9,060.41.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Therefore, I was of the view that there is a
                    value in this asset. Based on the £9,060.41 figure and using the exchange
                    rate above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>, the value was
                    $17,907.90.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Eighth disputed asset (referred to as the fourth disputed item in the
                arguments on 8 July 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Wife’s Lloyds TSB Bank Account No [xyz]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The wife had an account with Lloyds TSB in
                    London being account number [xyz]. In para 12 of her affidavit of
                    8 February 2011, she said that the account was closed two years ago. She
                    produced a copy of an undated withdrawal request to withdraw £11,842.70
                    from the account. She alleged that she lent some of the moneys to her brother
                    (unnamed) who had been trying to start his own company after losing his job and
                    the remaining balance to take her children on a holiday.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The husband did not accept her explanation on
                    the use of the funds in the absence of elaboration and documentary
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Neither did I. I included this sum as part of
                    the wife’s assets. The Singapore dollar equivalent was $23,407.10 using
                    the same exchange rate mentioned above at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ninth disputed asset (referred to as the fifth disputed item in the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Money withdrawn from a joint DBS account</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     A sum of $65,000 was withdrawn on 27 May
                    2008 from a joint DBS account of the couple.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The wife was taking the position that it was
                    not clear who had withdrawn the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Consequently, the husband obtained a copy of
                    two Counter Card-Operated Transaction record slips both dated 27 May 2008
                    for two sums totalling $65,000. One of them had handwritten comments which
                    indicated that the staff who handled the transaction had examined the identity
                    card of the wife and had written her identity card number on that record slip.
                    Although this evidence was obtained late, it was evidence the husband did not
                    have before. The wife’s counsel, quite sensibly, did not object to its
                    admission. I allowed it to be admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     However, the wife later adduced evidence to
                    show that the $65,000 cash was deposited into her UOB account at the material
                    time. The current balance in her UOB account is disclosed as item 2 of her
                    undisputed assets. Therefore, I concluded that the $65,000 was not an
                    undisclosed asset of the wife.</p>

                    8 October 2010 alleged that the wife did not disclose her shares in
                    Standard Life plc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The wife disclosed documents in respect of her

                    about her shares in Standard Life plc.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The documentary evidence which the husband had
                    relied on was a letter issued in April 2007 from Standard Life plc to the wife
                    as a shareholder. In view of this evidence and the absence of explanation by the
                    wife, I was of the view that she did have shares in Standard Life plc which she
                    did not disclose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Eleventh disputed asset (referred to as the seventh disputed item in
                the arguments on 8 July 2011)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Wife’s Turkish Pension Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The husband alleged that the wife had
                    participated in a Turkish pension plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Para 29 of the wife’s affidavit of
                    8 February 2011 said that the Turkish pension scheme allowed Turkish
                    nationals to maintain their contribution to the scheme by making contributions
                    for 5000 working days, <em>ie</em>, 20 years. As she had
                    worked in Turkey for five years only, her parents wanted to maintain her
                    participation by contributing to the scheme for the remaining 15 years. Her
                    father was the one who contributed solely to the scheme after she stopped but he
                    died in 2002. Her mother tried to continue the contributions but gradually
                    stopped doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The wife stopped short of saying that all the
                    contributions made by her and her father were worth nothing. I doubted very much
                    that she would allow such a development. Moreover, she did not produce any
                    document from the relevant Turkish authority to confirm that her account in the
                    scheme had ceased. I concluded that she still had an asset in this scheme which
                    she failed to disclose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">General</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     If I were to take the time when the husband
                    left the matrimonial home in April 2008 as the appropriate cut-off date, which I
                    was inclined to do although the interim judgment was granted on 2 March
                    2010, the marriage effectively lasted about 18 years. Even if the marriage was
                    said to have lasted for about 20 years, that would not have been a material
                    difference for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The wife initially sought 70% of the pool of
                    matrimonial assets for herself. She said that if she obtained 70%, she would not
                    claim maintenance for herself or for the children but the husband was still to
                    pay for the children’s present and future education.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, the written submission for the wife
                    said that, based on precedents, the wife would obtain between 40% to 45% of the
                    pool. She sought 45% and also claimed lump sum maintenance for the children and
                    for herself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Counsel for the husband submitted that based
                    on precedents, the wife would be given 30% to 40% of the pool. He submitted that
                    she should be given 30% in the circumstances and bearing in mind that she had
                    failed to disclose all her assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Counsel for the wife submitted that the
                    husband himself had failed to disclose all his assets but I make no such
                    finding. I have already indicated above that I did not accept the allegations
                    about his having failed to disclose certain specific assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Counsel for the wife also submitted that the
                    husband failed to disclose the credit card statement in which the purchase of
                    the Cartier ring would be found. However, the purchase of that ring was not
                    disputed by the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As mentioned above, I found that the wife had
                    not fully disclosed her assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As for the number of years that the wife had
                    not been a full-time homemaker, I was of the view that the different allegations
                    were not material for present purposes and I need not make a finding thereon.
                    For all the allegations, it was not disputed that the husband was considered as
                    the sole breadwinner and the wife was the primary caregiver of the children and
                    had taken care of the home wherever they resided. The submission for the wife
                    was that her share of the pool of matrimonial assets should be between 40% to
                    45% and the submission for the husband was that it should be between 30% to 40%.
                    Naturally the wife wanted 45% and the husband countered with 30%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     After considering the factors set out in
                    s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed), I might have
                    granted the wife 40%. However, in view of her non-disclosure of some assets, I
                    granted the wife 37% of the pool of matrimonial assets and the husband 63% of
                    the same pool. The same division applied to the first two of the separate assets
                    mentioned in [14(a) and (b)] above. Accordingly, the pool of assets as well as
                    the first two of the separate assets were to be apportioned along this division.
                    My oral judgment reflected this division and the mechanics of
                    implementation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the third of the three separate assets
                    [14(c)], the husband held one painting. The wife held 17 paintings, drawings and
                    prints. The value of every one of these items was not established. The husband
                    proposed the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_a"></a>(a)     Each party to keep the item(s) in
                        his/her possession; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_b"></a>(b)     the husband and the wife are to exchange the item(s) held
                        by each of them; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_c"></a>(c)     all the items be sold and the net sale proceeds be divided between
                        them as decided by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The wife did not agree to any of the sensible
                    options proposed by the husband. Neither did she disagree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I allowed each party to keep the item(s) in
                    his/her possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Each party went into some detail about the
                    children’s expenses but as they were very close in their assessment of the
                    overall quantum of such expenses it is unnecessary for me to reiterate such
                    details.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The wife had initially claimed in her initial
                    written submission that general maintenance of the children amounted to $4,823
                    per month and the school and educational expenses of the children amounted to
                    $5,575 per month. This made a total of $10,398. She wanted the husband to pay
                    66.66% thereof amounting to $6,932 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     However, in her revised written submission,
                    she increased the amount for general maintenance of the children to $5,503. The
                    difference of $680 was derived as follows. Firstly, in her initial written
                    submission, she claimed $20 per month for pocket money for them but she said
                    that this was a typographical error and should have been $200 per month. She was
                    now increasing her claim to $300 per month. The difference between $300 and $20
                    is $280. Secondly, in her initial written submission, she did not claim anything
                    for holiday expenses for the children but in her revised written submission, she
                    claimed $400 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As for the school and educational expenses of
                    the children, the wife kept to her initial claim of $5,575 per month for that
                    item.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     So, based on her revised written submission,
                    the total of her claim for the monthly expenses of the children was $11,078
                        (<em>ie</em>, $5,503 + $5,575). She was claiming that
                    the husband should pay two-thirds thereof amounting to $7,385.33 per
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the husband’s written submission, he
                    was prepared to pay $6,500 per month as his share of maintenance for the
                    children. In oral submissions, his counsel said he was prepared to increase this
                    to $6,900 per month. This was very close to the $6,932 per month which the wife
                    was seeking based on her initial written submission which she then increased to
                    $7,385.33 per month as stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I accepted that the wife should be allowed to
                    claim $200 per month (but not $300) for pocket money for the children and $400
                    per month for their holiday expenses. This meant a reduction of $100 per month
                    from her total of $11,078 amounting to $10,978. 66.66% of that sum is $7,318. I
                    therefore ordered the husband to pay $7,318 per month for maintenance of the
                    children. In the revised written submission for the wife, she claimed arrears of
                    maintenance for the children (and for herself) from January 2009 but in oral
                    submission, her counsel asked for it to commence from April 2009. The reason was
                    that the husband had stopped paying maintenance for the children although he did
                    pay for their school fees. The claim for arrears of maintenance for the children
                    was not vigorously contested by the husband. Therefore, I ordered their
                    maintenance to commence from April 2009. However, I allowed the husband to set
                    off any sum he had paid in the meantime from April 2009 for the children’s
                    expenses, including but not limited to school fees, travel or handphones,
                    against the $7,318 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The wife also mentioned that there would be an
                    increase in school fees and the rent for their accommodation. I ordered the
                    husband to pay 66.66% of any increase in school fees in or after June 2011 and
                    66.66% of the children’s share (<em>ie</em>, also
                    66.66%) of any increase in rent from June 2011 upon production of satisfactory
                    evidence by the wife of any such increase. As details are found in my oral
                    judgment, I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The wife said her expenses were $5,980 per
                    month and claimed maintenance from the husband amounting to 66.66% thereof,
                        <em>ie</em>, $3,986 per month since she was no longer
                    claiming 70% of the pool of matrimonial assets. She wanted maintenance to be
                    provided in a lump sum using a multiplier of 15 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The husband accepted the wife’s expenses
                    of $5,980 per month but queried whether he should be responsible for $250
                    thereof which was for the wife’s parents. He also took the position that
                    in view of her earning capacity, he would offer only $100 per month for her
                    maintenance. He was also prepared to pay lump sum maintenance. When I asked the
                    husband’s counsel whether he was still prepared to pay lump sum
                    maintenance even if the calculation for her maintenance was based on a much
                    higher figure than the $100 per month which the husband had offered, his counsel
                    assured me that he still preferred to pay in one lump sum. The husband also
                    agreed to a multiplier of 15 years for the lump sum calculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I therefore had to determine the multiplicand.
                    As mentioned above, the husband accepted the wife’s expenses at $5,980 per
                    month subject to the $250 which was for the wife’s parents. I did not see
                    why he should assist her in whatever she wanted to provide for her parents. The
                    reduced sum is therefore $5,980 - $250 = $5,730 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The wife sought 66.66% of her expenses. Based
                    on $5,730 per month, this amounts to $3,820, as the multiplicand. While the
                    66.66% proportion appeared consistent with the 66.66% that the husband would be
                    paying for the children’s expenses, the wife was not in turn paying for
                    33.33% of the husband’s expenses. He was paying entirely for his own
                    expenses which he claimed to be $25,756.13 per month in his affidavit of assets
                    and means. If I were to deduct his expenses for mortgage for the property in
                    Singapore (which has been sold), the mortgage of the property in the United
                    Kingdom (“UK”), details of which are found in my oral judgment and
                    management fee for the UK property because it will be sold, his expenses would
                    be reduced to around $8,241 per month. The payment of $1,162 which the husband
                    said he was to pay an agent in respect of the Singapore property would cease
                    after a while. If that expense was omitted from his regular monthly expenses,
                    such expenses would be reduced to about $7,079 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     While there is yet no legal obligation for a
                    wife to maintain a husband, that does not mean that a court should ignore the
                    fact that a husband is paying for his own expenses entirely while a wife is
                    claiming maintenance from him. Of course the wife might have also said that the
                    husband’s actual expenses were less than $7,079 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As for the respective earning capacities, I
                    was of the view that the husband could earn $25,000 per month and the wife could
                    earn $13,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     All things considered, I was of the view that
                    a fair multiplicand would be $1,900 per month which is about 33.33% of her
                    monthly expenses of $5,730 per month (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above). Using a multiplier of 180 months (for 15 years),
                    the lump sum maintenance for the wife would be $342,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     While the wife mentioned a rent increase from
                    June 2011, I did not think I should take that into account for her maintenance
                    because she would have the benefit of accelerated payment from the lump
                    sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Also, since the multiplicand was agreed at 180
                    months, there was no question of back-dating her maintenance to grant her any
                    arrears of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I granted the wife some costs of the
                    ancillaries since the divorce proceeded on her counterclaim.</p>
