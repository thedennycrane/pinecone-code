<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the appellant wife’s (“the
                    Wife”) appeal against the decision dated 30 May 2011 of a District
                    Judge (“the DJ”) in the ancillary matters flowing from the divorce
                    of the appellant and the respondent (“the Husband”). I will refer
                    to the DJ’s Grounds of Decision as “GD”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties were married on 10 August 1999
                    at the Singapore Marriage Registry. They have one son who was three years old in
                    September 2011. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband on
                    the ground of unreasonable behaviour on the basis that he had deserted her since
                    2008 and had remained in Taiwan with his mistress. Interim judgment was granted
                    on 31 January 2011. The ancillary hearing took place on 30 May 2011
                    before the DJ in the absence of the Husband, a point I shall elaborate on later.
                    The DJ ordered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     Sole custody, care and control of the
                        child of the marriage (“the Child”) to the Wife with
                        reasonable supervised access to the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     The matrimonial flat to be sold in the open
                        market within three months from the date of the Final Judgment, and the
                        proceeds of the sale be used to repay the outstanding loan, costs and
                        expenses of the sale including agent’s commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     Thereafter, the net sale proceeds to be
                        divided between the Wife and Husband in the proportion of 40% to the Wife
                        and 60% to the Husband in full and final settlement of the division of
                        matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Husband to refund to his own Central Provident Fund
                        (“CPF”) account monies utilised for the purchase of the
                        matrimonial flat plus accrued interest, but not to be required to repay any
                        shortfall of CPF monies or interest in the event that his 60% share of sale
                        profits is insufficient to refund his CPF account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     No maintenance ordered for the
                        Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        Husband to pay $400 per month as contribution towards the maintenance of the
                        Child with effect from 1 June 2011 and thereafter on the first day of
                        every month, with the maintenance to be deposited into the Wife’s bank
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                        Registrar be empowered to sign on behalf of any defaulting party within
                        fourteen days of written notice to the last known
                    address.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_h"></a>(h)     Liberty to
                        apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before the DJ, the Wife used a gross market
                    value of $400,000 for the matrimonial flat. The DJ decided that the Wife was
                    entitled to 30% of the net value by way of division of matrimonial assets (GD at
                        [44]). To this, the DJ added another
                    10% of the net value representing the Wife’s entitlement to a lump sum
                    maintenance of $27,000 being $375 per month for the next six
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The DJ assessed the net value of the matrimonial
                    flat as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As for the Child’s maintenance, the DJ
                    assessed the Child’s monthly expenses to be $740 per month (GD at
                        [36]), of which she ordered the
                    Husband to bear $400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Accordingly, the DJ made the orders at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Before me, the Wife’s appeal was for the
                    entire matrimonial flat to be transferred to her with no refund to the
                    Husband’s CPF account for money used from that account to pay for the
                    matrimonial flat. Originally, her basis for this was (a) an entitlement to
                    30% of the matrimonial flat by way of the division of matrimonial assets and
                    (b) an entitlement to 70% of the matrimonial flat in lieu of lump sum
                    maintenance for herself and for the Child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, the Wife filed Summons
                    No 14782 of 2011 (“SUM 14782”) for leave to adduce new
                    evidence. I will deal with this in more detail below, but generally the new
                    evidence was to show that the Husband had more assets than had been previously
                    disclosed and that the Wife had contributed more towards the Husband’s
                    company than had been previously alleged. On the basis of this new evidence, the
                    Wife revised her submissions before me to base her claim for the transfer of the
                    entire matrimonial flat to her on: (a) 50% (as opposed to the earlier 30%)
                    of the matrimonial flat by way of the division of matrimonial assets and
                    (b) 50% of the matrimonial flat in lieu of lump sum maintenance for herself
                    and for the Child.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Wife stressed that as she would be taking
                    care of the Child, she would need a roof over her head as well as the
                    Child’s. She stressed that although she currently resides in China where
                    she looks after the Child with the help of her parents, she only returned to
                    China with the Child, after living in Singapore for more than 12 years, because
                    she had lost all contact with the Husband and could not support herself in
                    Singapore. She alleged that if she were to have the security of the matrimonial
                    flat, she would definitely settle in Singapore with her Child, who is a
                    Singapore citizen, and find a full-time job. She said she would return to
                    Singapore in 2015 for the Child’s primary education. However, at a hearing
                    on 11 January 2012, her counsel Ms Wong said that the latest
                    instruction was that the Wife would return with the Child in 2013 to start
                    kindergarten classes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The matrimonial flat</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The matrimonial flat is a four-room Housing
                    Development Board (“HDB”) flat in [B]. It was purchased in the
                    sole name of the Husband on 1 February 1999 prior to the parties’
                    marriage. There was no dispute that the Husband solely financed the purchase of
                    the matrimonial flat through an initial cash payment of $16,400 and through his
                    CPF account. As at 25 February 2011, the Husband had used a total of
                    $198,699.66 of his CPF monies to finance the matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The matrimonial flat had an outstanding HDB
                    mortgage loan of $117,755.78 as at 25 October 2010. As mentioned
                    above, the Wife had used a gross market value of $400,000 for the matrimonial
                    flat. At a hearing before me on 18 November 2011, I asked the Wife’s
                    counsel Ms Wong to check and confirm the updated market value. By a letter
                    dated 7 December 2011, Ms Wong said that the resale price of an
                    equivalent four-room flat in [B], as indicated on the HDB website, was $485,000
                    in May 2011, $457,000 in August 2011 and $508,000 in November 2011 respectively.
                    The last value was based on the sale of an equivalent flat on a higher floor,
                        <em>ie</em>, between the 16th to 20th floors. The price
                    of an equivalent flat sold in November 2011 between the 6th to 10th floors was
                    $500,000. The matrimonial flat is on the 12th floor. I assessed its value to be
                    $504,000 in November 2011. As for the outstanding loan on the matrimonial flat,
                    Ms Wong was content to leave it as $117,755 for present
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     My assessment of the net value of the
                    matrimonial flat was different from the DJ’s or the Wife’s figure
                    because I was of the view that, in the first place, the gross market value of
                    $504,000, instead of $400,000, should be used. Hence, my assessment of the net
                    value, leaving aside any cost of a sale to a third party was:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I did not take into account any cost of a sale
                    to a third party since the Wife was hoping to acquire the entire matrimonial
                    flat. If the Wife has to pay her own solicitor any fee for the transfer of the
                    Husband’s interest to her, that should be for her own account. During the
                    marriage, both parties resided in the matrimonial flat until the Husband
                    deserted the family in 2008. The Husband’s mother also resided there. In
                    fact, care for the Husband’s mother, even after the Husband had deserted
                    the family, is one of the contributions that the Wife submitted that she had
                    made to the marriage (see below at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I will comment further below on the
                    significance of the Husband’s absence from the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Furthermore, as will be explained in more
                    detail below, the Wife sought leave of this Court to adduce new evidence of the
                    Husband’s other assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective contributions to the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As stated above, it was not disputed that the
                    Husband had solely contributed to the purchase of the matrimonial flat from his
                    cash and CPF monies. The Wife further agreed that she made no financial
                    contribution, with one exception, <em>ie</em>, she alleged
                    that she had paid for certain furniture in the matrimonial flat totalling $5,300
                    and had also contributed a full set of study room furniture that were gifts to
                    her from her ex-employer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Wife alleged in paras 16 and 17a and
                    b of her affidavit of assets and means filed on 24 March 2011 that her
                    direct and indirect contributions to the marriage were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     caring for the
                    Child;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     caring for
                        the Husband’s mother for the 11 years of the marriage, during which
                        time the Husband’s mother resided in the matrimonial flat, even after
                        the Husband had deserted the family and left for Taiwan in
                    2008;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     doing the
                        household chores, <em>ie</em>,
                    housework;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     paying
                        for some furniture and fittings;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_e"></a>(e)     paying $30,000 for the Husband’s credit card debts
                        and monthly instalments thereafter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_f"></a>(f)     paying half the monthly instalments in respect of three
                        cars which the Husband had purchased during the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_g"></a>(g)     helping the Husband to start his
                        company, (“the Company”), and paying $11,000 to his
                        ex-employer in lieu of the Husband serving his notice period;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_h"></a>(h)     taking care of
                        clerical and compliance matters for the Company and paying suppliers’
                        bills when the Company had cash flow problems.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The DJ accepted that the Wife had cared for
                    the Husband’s mother at least from the start of the marriage until the
                    Wife relocated to China after the birth of the Child, and that there was no
                    doubt that she had been the Child’s care-giver since his birth, aided by
                    her parents in China (GD at [25]). The
                    DJ also accepted that the Wife paid for some furniture and fittings in the
                    matrimonial home (GD at [27]). The DJ
                    did not say specifically whether she accepted that the Wife had done the
                    housework but I accepted that the Wife did do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, with regard to the Wife’s other
                    claims of contribution, <em>ie</em>, (e), (f), (g) and
                    (h) above, the DJ found herself constrained by the lack of evidence offered to
                    substantiate these claims (GD at [26],
                        [28] and [29]). The DJ was of the view that at best the
                    Wife’s contribution in helping out with clerical and compliance matters
                    was limited to one year as the Company was registered on 16 February 2006
                    and the last Annual General Meeting was held on 29 June 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The DJ did not say whether she accepted that
                    the Wife had paid half the monthly instalments for the purchase of three cars. I
                    assumed that the DJ did not accept this allegation as the evidence for this
                    allegation was also scanty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Husband’s absence from the proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before I continue, I should first elaborate on
                    an important aspect of this case, <em>ie</em>, the
                    Husband’s absence from the proceedings both below and before
                me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Wife filed the writ for divorce on
                    16 November 2010. On 23 November 2010, she filed Summons No 20050
                    of 2010 for an order for dispensation of service of the Writ for Divorce,
                    Statement of Claim, Statement of Particulars, Proposed Parenting Plan, Proposed
                    Matrimonial Property Plan, Acknowledgment of Service and Memorandum of
                    Appearance. In the Wife’s affidavit filed on 23 November 2010 to
                    support that Summons, she alleged that the Husband had a mistress in Taiwan. He
                    had brought the mistress to Singapore in April 2008 and returned with her to
                    Taiwan after the Child was born on 3 May 2008. The Wife did not know which
                    part of Taiwan the Husband was residing in. Her attempts to contact him on his
                    mobile phone were unsuccessful. The Husband also did not contact his mother who
                    was staying at the matrimonial flat then. In another affidavit filed on
                    14 December 2010, the Wife deposed that since the Husband left for Taiwan
                    in 2008, she had continued to call him on his mobile phone but he had refused to
                    answer and subsequently his mobile number had ceased to be in service. She had
                    previously contacted the Husband’s employee who had worked with the
                    Husband in Taiwan but the employee did not know the Husband’s whereabouts
                    either and in fact his last salary was unpaid. She had since lost contact with
                    that employee as she had lost her old mobile phone which had that
                    employee’s contact number. The Husband’s trade creditors and credit
                    card companies were also looking for him at the time but, according to the
                    Wife’s affidavit, he “seemed to ignore everything in Singapore
                    including his business”. The Wife learned from the Husband’s mother
                    that the Husband had contacted the latter in November 2009 to borrow money but
                    the request was rejected. The Husband had not contacted his mother or any of his
                    three sisters since November 2009. He did not even reply when one of his sisters
                    emailed him about his debts owing to the credit card companies. Other than his
                    family and the employee she referred to, the Wife only knew the Husband’s
                    best friend and business partner, but had not contacted him since early 2008
                    when the relationship between him and the Husband had become strained. A Deputy
                    Registrar granted the order for dispensation of service on 22 December
                    2010, and the proceedings below proceeded without the Husband’s
                    appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Nevertheless, after the Wife filed the Notice
                    of Appeal to the High Court, Ms Wong made further attempts to
                    “serve” the appeal and other papers on the Husband. One of the
                    Husband’s sisters, [C] went to Ms Wong’s office on
                    15 August 2011 after receiving a letter from the Subordinate Courts dated
                    4 August 2011 informing the Husband of the hearing date of the appeal fixed
                    for 14 September 2011. Ms Wong said she “served” the
                    Record of Appeal and the written submissions for the Wife on [C] on the same
                    day, <em>ie</em>, 15 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 25 August 2011, the Wife filed SUM
                    14782 of 2011 to apply to admit documents in relation to the Husband’s
                    income and assets. I learned later that apparently Ms Wong had sent a copy
                    of this Summons and the supporting affidavit thereof to the Husband with a
                    covering letter by post but apparently the address to which the letter was sent
                    was that of the matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the meantime, Ms Wong appeared before
                    me on 14 September 2011. This was the first hearing date for the
                    Wife’s appeal. SUM 14782 was also fixed for hearing that day. Ms Wong
                    informed me that she had “served” the Record of Appeal and the
                    written submissions for the Wife on [C] on 15 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As a matter of prudence, I decided to adjourn
                    the hearing to 5 October 2011 at 10am and directed Ms Wong to
                    send or hand a written notice to [C] to state the next hearing date of
                    5 October 2011. This would give [C] another chance to contact or try and
                    contact the Husband to inform him about the matrimonial
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In an affidavit filed by Ms Wong on
                    4 October 2011, she disclosed an email she had sent to [C] on
                    14 September 2011. The email stated that the appeal had been adjourned to
                    5 October 2011 and asked for [C]’s address to “serve” a
                    written notice on the Husband to inform him of the next hearing
                date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In an email response also dated
                    14 September 2011, [C] requested that the notice be sent to the address of
                    another sister [D] at Tampines on 16 September 2011 between 10am to
                    12pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Ms Wong said she accordingly arranged for
                    her court clerk to go to that address on 16 September 2011 with the
                    relevant notice to the Husband. There, [D], who is the sister of [C], said that
                    [C] had left for work and had authorised [D] to receive the notice. The notice
                    was handed by the court clerk to [D] that same day. The notice was addressed to
                    the Husband and informed him of the adjourned hearing date of 5 October
                    2011 at 10am. The notice also elaborated on what the DJ had already ordered
                    and mentioned SUM 14782 to adduce new evidence. Ms Wong’s affidavit
                    of “service” was filed on 4 October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On 5 October 2011, Ms Wong attended
                    before me. The Husband again did not attend nor did anyone appear on his behalf.
                    Ms Wong informed me of what she had done so far.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As I had indicated to Ms Wong on
                    14 September 2011 that the 5 October 2011 hearing would be a short
                    hearing for directions, I adjourned the 5 October 2011 hearing to another
                    date to be fixed. I did not require Ms Wong to send yet another notice to
                    the address of [D] to state the next hearing date because I was of the view that
                    more than enough attempts had been made to bring the proceedings to the
                    Husband’s attention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The next two hearings were on 18 November
                    2011 and 11 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary issue: Adducing new evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In SUM 14782, the Wife sought to adduce new
                    documents for broadly two purposes: first, to provide evidence of her
                    contributions to the business of the Company; second, to prove that the Husband
                    owned assets other than the matrimonial home and his CPF accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The first category should be seen in light of
                    the DJ’s declaration of the limitation of the evidence before her (see
                    above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>). In this respect, the Wife
                    sought to adduce the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     With regard to her claim that she
                        had used her personal savings to pay the Company’s suppliers when it
                        was facing cash flow problems, the Wife sought to adduce three cheques
                        totalling $176,000 which she had issued to the Husband or the Company from
                        her Standard Chartered Bank account on 26 April 2007, 13 May 2007
                        and 14 July 2008 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     With respect to her claim that she had been in charge of
                        the Company’s daily operations, the Wife sought to adduce copies of
                        emails and list of email headings which allegedly indicated that she had
                        prepared powerpoint presentation slides for the Husband’s
                        presentations to customers, taking purchase orders from customers, booking
                        hotel rooms for Korean customers who came to Singapore and arranging
                        business trips for the company’s staff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To prove that the Husband has assets other
                    than the matrimonial home and his CPF accounts, the Wife sought to adduce the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     A copy of a purchase order from the
                        Company’s largest purchaser, [U] in August 2007 for goods amounting to
                        US$1,340,000 (which was the equivalent of S$2,038,542 at the exchange rate
                        prevailing at the time of the invoice), as well as three of the
                        Company’s invoices, a Bill of Lading, and [U]’s bank’s
                        payment advices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     Copies of transactions with other major customers of the
                            Company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     A copy of an unsigned and incomplete Memorandum of
                        Understanding (“MOU”) about a joint venture
                        (“JV”) being proposed in 2008 to establish a service centre in
                        Singapore for semiconductor tools. The Wife alleged that although the JV was
                        eventually not set up, the MOU disclosed some evidence about the assets of
                        the Company. From the MOU, the JV was intended to be between two companies,
                        the Husband and three other individuals. The Husband was to have 15% equity
                        amounting to $150,000 paid-up capital. The other three individuals were to
                        have 5% each amounting to a total of $150,000 too. The aggregate of $300,000
                        was to be paid by six furnaces valued at $350,000 with the $50,000 balance
                        being treated as owing to the Company. The Wife alleged that the six
                        furnaces belonged to the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Wife also suggested that the Husband had
                    gradually transferred his business to Taiwan in 2008. To this end she sought to
                    adduce evidence of various cash withdrawals from the Company’s DBS account
                    between March and August 2008, from ATMs both in Singapore and
                        Taiwan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Wife alleged that based on the additional
                    evidence, the Company did not cease business in 2007 and her contributions to
                    the Company lasted till July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Wife said that she did not have access to
                    the Company’s business and bank documents and had earlier only furnished
                    what she had in her possession in China, and had to liaise with banks to obtain
                    the relevant documents after the proceedings below; and also that most of the
                    work she had done for the Company were stored in her Outlook Express account and
                    were lost when she reinstalled her computer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>ACU v ACR</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 1235, I set out the principles for admitting new evidence
                    at this stage. I will not repeat them. In summary, the additional evidence which
                    the Wife sought to adduce might have a material bearing on the outcome of the
                    appeal before me. In view of the particular circumstances before me, I decided
                    to allow SUM 14782 to admit all the new evidence and then decide what weight to
                    give each piece of new evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As explained above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>, the DJ awarded the Wife 30% of the matrimonial flat by way
                    of division of matrimonial assets, on the basis of the Wife’s indirect
                    contributions to the marriage. In effect, therefore, the DJ granted the Wife
                    what she had asked for below, <em>ie</em>, 30% of the
                    matrimonial flat for the division of matrimonial assets. However, as I explained
                    above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>, the Wife asked for 50%, in her
                    appeal, as her share of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I agreed with the DJ that there was a scarcity
                    of evidence to establish the Wife’s original allegations about having made
                    payment for items (e), (f), (g) and (h) of <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As for the Wife’s new allegation about
                    having issued three cheques totalling $176,000 to the Husband or the Company, I
                    was of the view that the three cheques alone did not assist her much. True, they
                    were apparently drawn from her sole account but the source of the funds was not
                    properly established. The Wife had made a bare assertion that the money came
                    from her savings and from her parents but she did not adduce any evidence to
                    support that allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for the Wife’s allegation that she
                    had assisted the Company in its business, the original evidence was scanty. The
                    additional evidence aided in showing that she appeared to have assisted perhaps
                    till some time in 2008 but, again, the extent of her assistance was
                    unclear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In any event, the DJ had already granted the
                    Wife the 30% of the matrimonial flat that the Wife had originally sought for the
                    division of matrimonial assets based on the Wife’s indirect contributions
                    to the marriage. It seemed to me that the question of the other assets of the
                    Husband was more important on the facts before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The evidence that the Wife adduced as
                    mentioned in <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above about a purchase
                    order from [U], invoices and payment advices and transactions with other major
                    customers together with withdrawals of money said to be made by the Husband did
                    suggest that the Company had been an ongoing business and that the Husband might
                    have other substantial assets even though I gave no weight to the unsigned and
                    incomplete MOU.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the absence of evidence from the Husband, I
                    was persuaded by the additional evidence adduced by the Wife that the Husband
                    probably had other substantial assets which she was not able to pinpoint
                    although he had apparently tried to borrow money from his mother in 2008, see
                        <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the circumstances, I was of the view that
                    it was just and equitable to grant the Wife another 20%, making 50%, of the
                    matrimonial flat for the division of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">For the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Wife is an accountant but was doing
                    part-time lecturing in a local college in China when she filed her Statement of
                    Claim. She was 36 years of age at the time of the hearing before the DJ on
                    ancillaries. The Husband was then 39 and was apparently a businessman who had
                    left Singapore for Taiwan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As explained above, the DJ awarded the wife a
                    lump sum maintenance of $27,000 being $375 per month for the next six years,
                    which amounted to approximately 10% of the then net value of the matrimonial
                    flat. In doing so, the DJ found the Wife’s declared expenses of $2,656 per
                    month to be inflated (GD at [40]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The DJ granted the Wife maintenance in the
                    form of a lump sum because the DJ was of the view that this would achieve a
                    clean break from the Husband which was appropriate in the circumstances. The
                    Wife did not appeal against the granting of a lump sum for maintenance. Indeed,
                    that was what she had sought. Her appeal on the maintenance for herself was in
                    respect of the quantum of the lump sum. I would add that I was also of the view
                    that a lump sum maintenance for the Wife was appropriate in the circumstances.
                    The Husband did not want to have anything more to do with the Wife (and the
                    Child) and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible for the Wife to
                    enforce an order for periodic payments of maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On appeal before me, Ms Wong submitted
                    that the lump sum of $27,000 was on the low side, and asked for a sum of $60,000
                    based on $500 a month for ten years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Using this $60,000 figure, Ms Wong sought
                    20% of the matrimonial flat in lieu of lump sum maintenance for the Wife as
                    Ms Wong had assessed the net value of the matrimonial flat to be $283,000
                        (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>, I assessed the net value of the matrimonial flat to be
                    $386,245.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The DJ was of the view that the Wife’s
                    alleged monthly expenses (of $2,656) were inflated (see above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>). Her reason was that the Wife was earning
                    only $500 a month in China. Accepting that the Wife’s parents may be
                    assisting her financially, the DJ nevertheless thought that they could not
                    sustain the Wife’s alleged cost of living. As for the Wife’s plan to
                    return to Singapore, the DJ was of the view that such a plan was not definitive
                    as it was predicated on her receiving the entire matrimonial flat which the DJ
                    was not inclined to grant to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Furthermore, the DJ considered that the Wife
                    did not adduce evidence as to the extent of the Husband’s provision for
                    the family during the marriage. Nevertheless, the DJ was of the view that the
                    Husband must have provided for the Wife in happier times. Bearing in mind the
                    length of the marriage of 11 years, the DJ awarded the Wife the lump sum of
                    $27,000 based on $375 a month for six years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Before me, Ms Wong submitted that the
                    Wife’s alleged expenses of $2,656 per month were based on expenses to be
                    incurred as and when the Wife and the Child move back to Singapore. Since the
                    last drawn salary of the Wife in Singapore was $2,000 per month, she should
                    receive $500 per month maintenance from the Husband. Ms Wong submitted that
                    the list of the Wife’s expenses did not include the cost of employing a
                    maid (although that was included in the list of the Child’s expenses) and
                    having to pay the remainder of the housing loan. The Wife’s expenses were
                    listed in her affidavit of assets and means of 24 March 2011 as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Based on my discussions with Ms Wong and
                    her instructions, it seemed that the Wife would still want to retain the
                    matrimonial flat even if I were to award her, say, 80% thereof (a) for her
                    share of the division of matrimonial assets and (b) in lieu of lump sum
                    maintenance for the Wife and for the Child. She was prepared to pay the Husband
                    20% of the net value (as assessed by Ms Wong or the DJ). At one time, the
                    Wife’s instruction was that she would bring the Child back to Singapore in
                    2015 for his primary school education, but, as stated above, her latest
                    instruction was that she would bring him back to Singapore in 2013 for
                    kindergarten. I accepted that it was likely that she would bring the Child back
                    to Singapore in 2015, if not in 2013. Accordingly, it was not unfair to the
                    Husband to use expenses in Singapore as a guide although I agreed with the DJ
                    that the Wife’s alleged expenses seemed inflated. Looking at her expenses
                    in the round, I assessed them to be about $1,500 per month. It was fair to use
                    $500 per month as the multiplicand for the lump sum maintenance for the
                    Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the multiplier, Ms Wong was using
                    ten years (reduced from 15 years in her initial submission before
                me).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Husband would be 39 or 40 by the time of
                    the hearing before me. As a businessman, he could carry on beyond 65 years of
                    age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     All things considered, I was of the view that
                    $500 per month with a multiplier of ten years was reasonable. This would amount
                    to a total of$60,000 which the Wife sought. This worked out to 15.53% of
                    $386,245, being the net value of the matrimonial flat as assessed by
                me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">For the Child</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Wife had claimed $1,900 per month for the
                    Child’s expenses but the DJ concluded that such expenses should be $240
                    per month since the Child was not yet in formal school and was staying in China
                    with the Wife and her parents (GD at [33]-[35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Taking into account the $500 per month which
                    the Wife was currently earning in China and her previous income of $2,000 per
                    month while working in Singapore and in the absence of the Husband’s
                    income ability, the DJ was of the view that the Husband should bear a larger
                    share of the Child’s maintenance. Hence, the DJ ordered the Husband to pay
                    $400 a month for such maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As mentioned above, the Wife asked for the
                    entire matrimonial flat based on her own share of the matrimonial assets and in
                    lieu of maintenance for herself and for the Child. However, the DJ was not
                    inclined to allow lump sum maintenance for the Child and then translate that
                    into a share of the matrimonial flat. The DJ was of the view that it was
                    impossible to project the quantum for future maintenance for the Child. There
                    was also uncertainty about each parent’s financial circumstances (GD at
                        [39]). The DJ therefore considered
                    it more appropriate to order periodic maintenance for the Child at $400 per
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     While the DJ’s points had merit, I was
                    more concerned about the extreme difficulty or impossibility of enforcing an
                    order for periodic payments of maintenance for the Child. Also, if the Wife was
                    granted lump sum maintenance for the Child and a portion of the matrimonial flat
                    was granted to her in lieu of that lump sum, this would bring her closer to
                    acquiring the matrimonial flat and providing a permanent roof over the heads of
                    the Child and the Wife herself in Singapore. Accordingly, I was of the view
                    that, in principle, the Wife should also be granted a lump sum maintenance for
                    the Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Ms Wong submitted that $400 per month was
                    too low a sum to maintain a Child in Singapore. She initially submitted that the
                    Husband pay $1,000 per month. Then in her supplemental submission, she decided
                    to use the DJ’s starting figure of $740 per month and submitted that the
                    Husband should bear 80% thereof which would round up to $600 per month. She also
                    submitted that the multiplier should be 12 years. This would work out to $86,400
                    and would have been sufficient to grant the Wife 30% of the matrimonial flat (in
                    lieu of lump sum maintenance for the Child) based on the DJ’s net value of
                    $272,245 (see <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above). That 30% would
                    have worked out to $81,673. It seemed to me that the Wife and Ms Wong were
                    simply working backwards to see which figure would be sufficient to obtain the
                    entire flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my view, if the Child were to return to
                    Singapore in 2015 (or 2013), $86,400 was not an excessive figure as a lump sum
                    maintenance for him bearing in mind his young age. I agreed that the Wife should
                    be granted that sum as such maintenance as I was of the view that it was likely
                    that she would bring the Child back to Singapore in 2015, if not in
                2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     However, as mentioned above, my assessment of
                    the net value of the matrimonial flat was $386,245. The $86,400 would be 22.37%
                    of $386,245. I granted the Wife 22.47% in lieu of the Child’s lump sum
                    maintenance to round up the figures.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the circumstances, I granted the Wife 88%
                    of the matrimonial flat comprising:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     50.00% being her share in the
                        division of matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     15.53% being in lieu of lump sum maintenance for the
                        Wife; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     22.47% being in lieu of lump sum maintenance for the
                Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I also granted the Wife:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     An option to acquire the remaining
                        12% valued at $46,349.40 by paying this sum into the Husband’s
                        relevant CPF account. The Wife has two months from the date of my Oral
                        Judgment on 6 February 2012 to exercise this option by giving written
                        notice to the Husband of her decision to do so. The written notice from the
                        Wife (or her solicitors) was to be sent by email to the email address of the
                        Husband’s sister [C] and by letter (certificate of posting) to the
                        residential address of his other sister, [D]. The written notice would be
                        deemed to be given even if the letter was returned undelivered so long as
                        the email had been sent.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the option was exercised, the Wife was to liaise with
                        the HDB on the steps and timing to effect the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     If the Wife did not exercise the
                    option:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     The matrimonial flat was to be sold
                        as soon as possible and the net proceeds of sale were to be divided between
                        the Wife and the Husband in the proportion of 88% to the Wife and 12% to the
                        Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Husband’s 12% share of the net proceeds of sale was to be refunded to
                        his relevant CPF account for money used to purchase the matrimonial flat
                        plus accrued interest but he need not repay any
                shortfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Registrar of the Supreme Court was to sign
                    any document on behalf of the Husband to give effect to the transfer of the
                    matrimonial flat to the Wife or to a third party purchaser if the Husband did
                    not do so within eight days of written notice to do so by the Wife (or her
                    solicitors). The written notice was to be sent by email to the email address of
                    [C] and by letter (certificate of posting) to the residential address of [D].
                    The eight days would run from the date the email was sent or the date of posting
                    of the letter, whichever was the later. The written notice would be deemed to be
                    given even if the letter was returned undelivered so long as the email had been
                    sent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The DJ’s decision was therefore varied
                    to the extent stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Wife was granted liberty to
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Wife did not ask for costs of the appeal
                    and I made no order on such costs.</p>
