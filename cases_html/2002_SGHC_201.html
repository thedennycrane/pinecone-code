<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        Fu Hai Construction Pte

Ltd (the plaintiffs) were incorporated in Singapore on 31 August 1998 as building

contractors. The plaintiffs' managing-director is one Qiu Chang Hai (Qiu) who is a

mainland Chinese national with permanent residence status in Singapore. Econ Corporation

Limited (the defendants) are also in the construction business and it is one of many

subsidiaries of, Econ International Limited, which is a public listed company in

Singapore. The defendants are more diverse than the plaintiffs in their activities; they

not only construct buildings but also build sewerage treatment plants, roads, mass rapid

transit (MRT) stations and carry out land reclamation works at Southern Islands. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        Sometime in late November

or early December 2000, their ex-employee (chief designer) Dr Jeffrey Wang (Wang) offered

to introduce Qiu to the defendants. The defendants were then looking for a subcontractor

for a project. Qiu indicated his interest which Wang duly conveyed to T C Chua, the

defendants' director of construction. As a result, Qiu met up with Ms Sim Peck Hoon (Sim)

and Lai Leong Chong (Lai) the assistant contracts manager and senior projects manager

respectively, of the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        According to Qiu, he was

informed by Sim/Lai that the defendants had been awarded a contract for $13,717,986.05

(the contract sum) by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) for construction of Punggol

East contract 23 shopping centre cum branch office (the project) and the defendants would

consider appointing the plaintiffs as their subcontractor for the same. Qiu alleged that

at the meeting (which took place on or about 5 December 2000), the following

representations were made to him if the plaintiffs agreed to be the main subcontractor for

the project:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">i. there would be three (3) omissions from the contract sum namely, (i)

    the M&amp;E works of the value of $4,618,097.64; (ii) the supply of materials for

    concreting works (but the plaintiffs would provide labour and ancillaries); (iii) the

    supply of pre-cast items. The plaintiffs would be the subcontractor for the balance works

    in the sum of $5,340,906.23;</p>
<p align="justify">ii. the contract period was two (2) years from 3 August 2000 to 2

    August 2002 and the balance 20 months (from January 2001) were more than sufficient for

    the project, which was not too big/difficult to complete; </p>
<p align="justify">iii. the soil condition was normal and there was nothing difficult

    about excavation although substantial excavation was involved in relation to the basement

    for the shopping centre (which occupied a large portion of the project site); </p>
<p align="justify">iv. there were no adverse or unusual factors which would require the

    plaintiffs to expend money, effort, manpower or equipment that would likely result in the

    plaintiffs being subject to the penalty of liquidated damages for delay; </p>
<p align="justify">v. the defendants would support the plaintiffs' request for 250 foreign

    workers (from China) but would only assist the plaintiffs to apply for 180 foreign workers

    initially, leaving the balance 70 for later consideration.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        Qiu further alleged that

his request for an increase of $500,000 in the subcontract sum was rejected; he was told

the defendants had themselves under-provided for M&amp;E works (at $4.618m) when they

tendered for the project and would incur a loss as a result of overruns ($5.1m) in

expenditure for that item. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        On or about 19 December

2000, Qiu was handed a contract by the defendants for his signature. Qiu (who is not

literate in English) was told by his staff that the contract stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. the contract was a lump sum contract at the price of $5,443,524.23

    (the subcontract sum);</p>
<p align="justify">b. the scope of works was not spelt out but was referred to in an

    annexure which was not attached;</p>
<p align="justify">c. the plaintiffs were to supply labour (and tools) for all structural

    works and supply labour, tools and materials for the completion of architectural and

    external works; </p>
<p align="justify">d. the plaintiffs were required to deposit a performance bond with the

    defendants within 14 days, in the sum of $1,371,798.60;</p>
<p align="justify">e. the plaintiffs were deemed to have knowledge of the defendants' main

    contract with HDB as well as of the defendants' construction schedule; and</p>
<p align="justify">f. the plaintiffs would not assign or subcontract out the works under

    the subcontract. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Qiu eventually refused to

provide the performance bond requested which, based on $5,443,524.23, amounted to 25%

thereof; he was aware that the standard performance bond was for 10% of the contract sum.

In February 2001, the defendants agreed to reduce the performance bond from the plaintiffs

to 10% ($544,353) of the subcontract sum; the same was provided on 15 February 2001 by Tai

Ping Insurance Co Ltd (Tai Ping). The plaintiffs then signed the (revised) subcontract

(the subcontract) with the defendants on 28 February 2001. However, even prior thereto (on

30 January 2001), the plaintiffs' representatives had attended the first site meeting with

representatives of the defendants. Indeed, by 28 February 2001, the plaintiffs had

apparently attended four (4) site meetings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        Qiu alleged that the

defendants breached the representations set out in para 3 above. He realised (on

hindsight) that the defendants had made scapegoats of his company as, the defendants

themselves (inter alia), could not have completed the contract within the completion

period of two (2) years. The defendants countered that the plaintiffs failed to carry out

the subcontract works regularly and diligently in particular the excavation works (which

should have been completed by 27 February 2001), despite numerous reminders. Consequently,

after giving the plaintiffs three (3) days' notice by their letter dated 18 May 2001, the

defendants terminated the plaintiffs' contract on 23 May 2001. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The pleadings </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        In the statement of claim,

the plaintiffs pleaded that the representations set out in para 3 above were breached by

the defendants. The plaintiffs further alleged that the defendants purported to hold the

plaintiffs responsible for the delay in works by a letter dated 27 February 2001, even <u>before</u>

the plaintiffs had signed the subcontract. The plaintiffs cited numerous instances of the

defendants' breach of the terms of the subcontract. There was also an allegation that the

defendants deliberately concealed a soil report prepared by their subsidiary ECON GEOTECH

Pte Ltd (ECON GEOTECH) dated 9 September 1999 which showed that the soil conditions

contained backfill (of rubbish) of 6-9m, contrary to the defendants' representation that

the soil condition was not unusual; soil (and dumping of the excavated rubbish) was a

major factor which resulted in delays to the project and caused the plaintiffs to be

subjected to the penalty of liquidated damages. Delay was compounded by the defendants'

failure to provide the plaintiffs with 180 foreign workers and by the late supply of shop

drawings. In addition, the plaintiffs discovered inter alia, three (3) other

subcontractors on site doing bored and soldier piles and excavations which works were

within the scope of the subcontract. The defendants also failed to pay the plaintiffs on

their first and second progress claims (submitted in March and April 2001) promptly or at

all.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        The plaintiffs alleged

that the defendants wrongfully terminated the subcontract on or about 23 May 2001 and took

possession of the site. Further, on or about 25 July 2001, the defendants wrongfully

called on the performance bond by making a demand on Tai Ping. The plaintiffs prayed inter

alia for, a rescission of the subcontract, cancellation of the performance bond and or

damages pursuant to s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act Cap 390. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        In the defence filed, the

defendants admitted they had informed Qiu/the plaintiffs of certain omissions from the

main contract and that the subcontract was in the sum of $5,443,524.23; they also admitted

receiving a performance bond for $544,353. However, the defendants denied they had made

the representations set out in para 3(i) to (iv). As for the representation alleged in

para 3(v), the defendants averred that they had only agreed to support/assist the

plaintiffs' application for 180 foreign workers in consideration of the plaintiffs

furnishing a bond of $2,000/- for each foreign worker (which the plaintiffs did not). If

the representations as alleged were made, the defendants denied they were made with the

intention of inducing the plaintiffs to enter into the subcontract. The defendants

contended that the plaintiffs could not have been induced by the alleged representations

as, the plaintiffs attended site meetings/inspections and could have ascertained for

themselves the scope/nature of the subcontract works. The plaintiffs were therefore aware

of the presence of other subcontractors on site and the nature of the works they carried

out. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        The defendants admitted

receiving the plaintiffs' first and second progress claims but denied the plaintiffs were

entitled to any payment thereon. They also admitted they had given notice of termination

of the subcontract on 23 May 2001 and had demanded payment (on 25 July 2001) from Tai Ping

on the performance bond. The defendants counter-claimed against the plaintiffs for the

additional costs ($752,665.79) they incurred in re-awarding the subcontract to other

subcontractors to complete the works.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        I should point out that

the plaintiffs obtained from this court an exparte injunction on 22 August 2001, to

restrain the defendants from calling on Tai Ping for payment on the performance bond; the

defendants failed in their subsequent application to discharge the injunction.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The evidence</p>
<p align="justify">(i)        the plaintiffs' case</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Qiu was the plaintiffs'

only witness; I shall now consider his evidence, some portions of which have already been

set out in earlier paragraphs. I should at this stage point out that apart from a bare

statement in his affidavit (para 8.3) that he was familiar with HDB contracts, Qiu did not

expand on his/the plaintiffs' experience with HDB contracts nor did he give details of

what jobs the plaintiffs had previously undertaken. It was only in cross-examination that

he revealed the plaintiffs had undertaken HDB projects previously as a subcontractor but

again gave no details; neither did he volunteer any details as to his own background. As

the plaintiffs were only incorporated on 31 August 1998, they could not in any event have

had that much experience in the 2 year interval between their date of incorporation and

the project, bearing in mind the slump in the construction industry in recent years. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        In his written testimony,

Qiu expanded on how the plaintiffs had acted on the defendants' representations to their

detriment. On the first and second representations (omissions from and the value of, the

subcontract), Qiu alleged that he was shown a set of drawings and asked by the defendants

(Sim and Lai) if the plaintiffs would agree to a lump sum of about $5.4m to carry out the

works reflected in those drawings. Qiu calculated that $5.4m was equivalent to the balance

of the contract less the three (3) items omitted, without factoring in the cost ($500,000)

of supplying labour for concreting works, which works Qiu estimated would cost about

$3.54m. As far as the plaintiffs were concerned, it was their prerogative whether they

wished to subcontract out any of the works in the subcontract or do the works themselves.

However, when the plaintiffs came onto the site, they found other subcontractors doing

works which were <u>within</u> the plaintiffs' scope of works. For these subcontracted

works (bored/soldier piles, instrumentation, erection of site office and excavations)

which were carried out without the plaintiffs' consent, the plaintiffs were entitled to

payment from the defendants (inclusive of 15% for profit and attendance) and in turn the

plaintiffs would pay the defendants' subcontractors. However, the defendants not only did

not pay the plaintiffs their two (2) progress payments in that regard but went further to

deduct from the plaintiffs' subcontract, the price for the works carried out by the

defendants' subcontractors. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        On the second

representation, Qiu explained that as the plaintiffs' contract period would be four (4)

months less than the defendants' 24 months from the HDB, it was essential that the

plaintiffs were apprised of any problems which could affect the plaintiffs' ability to

complete the project within 20 months, especially when the plaintiffs were liable for

liquidated damages in the event of delay. Instead of the initial impression given to the

plaintiffs that they would have sufficient time to complete the project, the defendants

took the view from the start after the subcontract was signed, that the plaintiffs were

late in executing the works under the subcontract. Unbeknownst to the plaintiffs, the

defendants were already behind schedule for the project and had received written warnings

(3) in that regard from HDB. Had the plaintiffs known of these warnings Qiu testified,

they would not have accepted the subcontract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        As for the third

representation, Qiu testified that soon after (on 23 March 2001) the plaintiffs'

subcontractor had commenced excavating the basement for the shopping centre, it was

discovered that the soil contained backfill of 6-9m which comprised of rubbish. Although

excavating the rubbish was not a problem, disposal was – there were no dumping

grounds for the rubbish and the more the plaintiffs excavated, the more the rubbish

accumulated. Eventually, the plaintiffs (in April/May 2001) were given permission to

temporarily store the rubbish on nearby state land; the permission was subsequently

revoked and the problem of disposal arose once again. When Qiu obtained (in April 2001) a

copy of the soil report dated 9 September 1999 by ECON GEOTECH (see 1AB74-108), he

discovered that all the boreholes revealed backfill of 6-9m in depth, contrary to the

defendants' representation that there was nothing unusual about the soil. The report was

in the possession of the defendants at all material times but they never gave it to the

plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        On the fourth

representation, Qiu testified the plaintiffs were only offered a full set of drawings on

27 February 2001, one day before they signed the subcontract. On 7 March 2001, Qiu said he

was surprised to receive a letter from the defendants requiring the plaintiffs to produce

shop drawings for six (6) items (including skylight and glazier), which responsibility he

asserted was that of the defendants, not the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.        In regard to the

fifth/last representation, Qiu testified that the plaintiffs' representatives requested

the defendants in April 2001 to let the plaintiffs have their Man Year Entitlement for 180

foreign workers. Despite several reminders from him and their assurance that they would so

provide, Qiu claimed that the defendants did not give the plaintiffs the man years

entitlement for 180 foreign workers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        As this item has a

significant impact on my findings, more need to be said about this alleged representation

and Qiu's testimony in this regard. Under cross-examination, Qiu admitted quite candidly

that the defendants' initial agreement to allocate 180 foreign workers to the plaintiffs

particularly from mainland China, was the factor which prompted him to enter into the

subcontract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        Under the foreign

workers' scheme implemented by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), all building

contractors/developers (who rely essentially on skilled/unskilled foreign workers) are

given a quota of the number of foreign workers they can bring into Singapore; this is

based on the value of the contracts/projects pursuant to which the contractors/developers

apply for such workers. Apparently, the higher the value of the projects, the higher the

quota the foreign workers allocated by MOM. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        Cross-examined, Qiu

revealed that mainland Chinese construction workers in Singapore pay (through their

recruitment agency) to their employers between $6,000 to $8,000 each. Consequently, for

200 Chinese workers, an employer could receive upfront between $1.2m to $1.6m, which sums

Qiu acknowledged were very good profits indeed, more so if there were 250 workers, which

was the number he had requested of the defendants. Qiu further revealed that he had

counted on receiving such sums for the initial funding of the project until the plaintiffs

received progress payments from the defendants. Further, had the defendants given him 250

workers, he would have arranged for two (2) shifts of workers in June 2001 to complete the

work. Questioned, Qiu admitted that he did not provide (under cl 14.3 of the subcontract)

letters of guarantee to indemnify the defendants at $2,000 per worker; he said no approval

had yet been given by MOM without which (he claimed) insurance companies would not provide

the security bond. However, he also admitted that the defendants signed the form (1A)

which would have enabled the plaintiffs to apply to MOM for 50 foreign workers, even

though the plaintiffs did not provide the security bond of $100,000 ($2,000 x 50) for

them; he offered no explanation why the plaintiffs did not submit the form to MOM. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        Further cross-examination

of Qiu extracted the following evidence:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs did not/never provided the defendants with any work

    schedule (although they had one for their own use) despite having been requested to do so

    since the first site meeting. It was the defendants who provided the work schedules

    produced in court (see 2AB481-483 and 2AB477-480) to the plaintiffs, which however, he did

    not accept;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) although he claimed his company had experience in doing such works

    for the HDB, the plaintiffs subcontracted out the excavations (at $580,000 against the

    plaintiffs' price of $412,851.28 from the defendants). He admitted that the plaintiffs

    were sued (in DC Suit No. 3111 of 2001) by System Holdings Pte Ltd who obtained judgment

    in the sum of $180,000 (not including interest and costs) for carrying out the excavations

    works and for the plaintiffs' breach of contract (in subcontracting those works to yet

    another subcontractor); </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) he did not learn about the soil condition until <u>after</u> his

    subcontractor had commenced excavations and had requested him to obtain a soil report from

    the defendants; he denied being given a copy of the soil report by the defendants at their

    first meeting on 5 December 2000. However, he was aware that HDB had provided a soil

    report to all prospective tenderers (including the defendants) to enable them to come up

    with their tenders for the project; </p>
<p align="justify">(iv) he maintained that the defendants knew there was rubbish in the

    soil as, they had completed 70-80% of the piling works before the plaintiffs signed the

    contract. However Qiu admitted that the plaintiffs themselves had written to the

    defendants on 11 April 2001 (see 2AB81) stating that <i>'the excavated earth is full of

    debris</i>' which problem was unforeseeable <i>'while looking through the soil report</i>';</p>
<p align="justify">(v) he admitted that as at 18 April 2001 (see minutes at 2AB121), the

    defendants were pressing the plaintiffs to put more workers on site as work was very much

    behind schedule — strutting works (which should be in tandem with excavations) had

    not commenced, there were only 7 workers on site, huge quantities of excavated materials

    were not removed and, excavation works had stopped; </p>
<p align="justify">(vi) he eventually found a dumping ground for the excavated soil but

    not the rubbish. Hence, the rubbish was dumped on the state land next to the site, as a

    temporary measure until a proper dumping ground could be found, which the plaintiffs never

    did find;</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) in February 2001, the plaintiffs requested the defendants' help

    as they had difficulties in obtaining supplies of timber and in April 2001, they requested

    the defendants for permission to use the defendants' name to place orders for materials

    and to rent machines. However, he denied the plaintiffs did not have enough resources to

    perform the subcontract; </p>
<p align="justify">(viii) he admitted that at the first meeting with the defendants, he

    was informed the project had been on-going for four (4) months;</p>
<p align="justify">(ix) he explained that although the defendants had carried out the

    piling works by the time the plaintiffs took on the project, he nonetheless included

    piling works ($1,346,327) in the plaintiffs' first progress claim because it was within

    the plaintiffs' scope of works under the subcontract and, they were entitled to profit and

    attendance for supervision of these items (although not stated in the subcontract);</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        In re-examination, Qiu

testified that had he known that the defendants would not pay the plaintiffs anything for

the works done by Zap Piling and AL Technologies, he would not have signed the

subcontract. Their presence on site was also a factor which slowed the plaintiffs'

progress because the site was small and Zap Piling had a lot of equipment on site. The

plaintiffs on their part needed to have three (3) excavators and more than ten (10) trucks

on site. He said the plaintiffs would have applied for an extension of time in April-May

2001, relying on the soil condition as the main reason. Indeed, the defendants themselves

applied to HDB for extension of time (see <b>D1</b>) in September 2001 (and succeeded),

citing the <i>'quick sand like'</i> soil as the reason. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The defendants' case</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        The defendants called two

(2) witnesses to refute Qiu's evidence, the first was Sim who is a qualified quantity

surveyor. Sim (DW1) only became involved in the project after the HDB awarded the

defendants the contract on 3 April 2000; she said works commenced on 3 August 2000,

starting with bored piles (about 300 pieces) by the defendants' geotechnic division, which

work was completed on 9 February 2001. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        In her written testimony,

Sim explained that before the plaintiffs were appointed the defendants' main

subcontractor, the defendants had many subcontractors on site including Zap Piling, AL

Technologies, Cape Engineering, Lee Welded Mesh Singapore Pte Ltd (Lee Welded), Hor Kew

Pte Ltd, Supermix Concrete Pte Ltd and Hoe Seng Huat Hardware Co Pte Ltd. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        When the plaintiffs

approached the defendants through Wang to do the project, she had prepared (on the

instructions of T C Chua) a general budget for the proposed main subcontracting contract,

which she handed to Wang. As neither party chose to call Wang as a witness although his

evidence would have been material, it serves no purpose to speculate whether Wang in turn

handed the general budget to Qiu or what he said to Qiu in that regard. Neither did the

defendants call T C Chua to testify. Sim explained that the general budget only provided a

broad overview of the components of work required to complete the project (including the

bored piling then in progress), the subcontractors already appointed, as well as the

aggregate costs the defendants were prepared to incur until completion. It was only <u>after</u>

T C Chua received Wang's telephone confirmation of the plaintiffs' interest in taking on

the project and she was asked by T C Chua to attend a meeting with Qiu, that she prepared

a proper budget which expanded on the earlier general budget. The previous general budget

for $13,717,986.05 comprised the following breakdown:-</p>

bored piling) was very much less than the contract sum (see 1AB2) stated in the general

<p align="justify" xmlns="">Sim pointed out that in accepting the subcontract, the plaintiffs

should have been prepared to manage and supervise the work of the other subcontracts

already appointed and, should have realised that the value of whose works would be

backcharged to the plaintiffs and deducted from the subcontract sum. She claimed she had

reminded Qiu that the works had commenced since August 2000. Qiu apparently had told her

he had vast experience in HDB projects but, Sim warned him that this was no ordinary HDB

project but, a shopping centre with a basement. Sim had also rejected Qiu's request that

the defendants improve on the subcontract sum (by $500,000). She explained that the

defendants themselves had a tight budget as their tender to HDB was $6m lower than the

next lowest tender. Even if Qiu did not understand the difference between the general

budget and the residuary value, Sim deposed that at a meeting she attended (in late April

2001) with Qiu and other representatives from the plaintiffs, she had reminded Qiu of the

residuary value for the subcontract. He did not protest but turned his attention to man

year entitlements asking the defendants for 250 workers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        Sim had also told Qiu

that the plaintiffs must provide a performance bond of 10% of the contract sum even though

the actual residuary value of the subcontract was $5,443,524.23. When Qiu asked for man

year entitlements, she had told him that the defendants were amenable to give the

plaintiffs their balance quota (180) of man year entitlements provided the plaintiffs

furnish a bond/guarantee of $2,000 for each worker. Sim deposed she had extended to Qiu

documents which included the main contract with HDB, the soil report given by HDB,

drawings and plans and advised him to study them carefully before making his decision. Qiu

had subsequently reverted (on or about 12 December 2000) to say he was interested and

could work within the general budget sum and residuary value of the contract; he then

asked for a letter of award which she prepared. She told him to get someone conversant in

English and Mandarin to explain the subcontract terms to him, when the subcontract

agreement was subsequently prepared. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        Qiu told the defendants

he was unable to provide a performance bond at 10% ($1,371,798.60) of the contract sum.

Consequently, towards end January 2001, the defendants agreed to reduce the amount to 10%

($544,353) of the residuary value of the subcontract. Although the subcontract was only

signed on 28 February 2001, Sim said she considered the subcontract a <i>'done deal'</i>

as, the plaintiffs had prepared their detailed work schedule on or about 5 January 2001

and had attended site meetings commencing 31 January 2001.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        Sim denied that the

defendants had made misrepresentations and or fraudulent misrepresentations to the

plaintiffs. She pointed out that negotiations and discussions were conducted in Mandarin;

hence, Qiu could not use the excuse he did not understand what transpired. As regards the

alleged second representation, she had made it clear to Qiu that four (4) months of the

contract period had lapsed, since the defendants' commencement of the project. The alleged

third representation was not sustainable either as, she had given Qiu a copy of HDB's soil

report which did not suggest rubbish in the backfill. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        As for the plaintiffs'

first progress payment, Sim explained that it included works not carried out by the

plaintiffs (bored piles and instrumentation); hence these items had to be deducted or

backcharged to the plaintiffs. The only item in the claim attributable to the plaintiffs

was excavations which sum of $12,385.54 was valued at $8,257.03 by the defendants.

However, the plaintiffs were not paid at all because of deductions totalling $1,463,340.15

for works done by Zap Piling, AL Technologies and the defendants' geotechnic division. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        Similarly, the only item

attributable to the plaintiffs in the second progress claim ($1,612,900.58 at 2AB63) was

$41,285.13 for excavations. Like the first progress claim, the defendants did not pay the

plaintiffs any sum because the deductions of $1,556,218.60 far exceeded the plaintiffs'

payment entitlement. Payment was also withheld because the plaintiffs owed the defendants

the sum of $100,000/- for the security bond for 50 foreign workers for whom the defendants

had signed Form 1A [see 2AB552-554] which the plaintiffs for their own reasons failed to

submit to MOM for processing. After making all the deductions (including deductions for

rental of equipment and supply of materials to the plaintiffs), not only did the

defendants not owe any monies to the plaintiffs but the latter in fact owed the defendants

$28,894.11 on the two (2) progress claims. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        In addition to

$28,894.11, Sim deposed that the plaintiffs were liable to the defendants for liquidated

damages for delay and or damages for failing to provide shop drawings for architectural

works, despite repeated reminders from the defendants/the HDB, over a period of four (4)

months.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        As for excavation works,

Sim pointed out that the plaintiffs' own work schedule stated such works would commence on

12 February 2001 and would be completed by 27 February 2001. As early as 6 February 2001,

the defendants had written to the plaintiffs requiring them to submit the name(s) of their

excavation subcontractor(s). Despite numerous site meetings however, the plaintiffs failed

to commence excavation works by their own schedule. Moreover, the excavations works when

they finally started, were unsatisfactory so much so that the defendants were obliged to

commit their own resources to carry out those works, on or about 26 February 2001. Unless

the excavation works were completed, other works such as exposing the pile caps could not

proceed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        Moving next to the issue

of removing the excavated material, Sim pointed out that it was the plaintiffs'

contractual responsibility to remove such materials. However, the plaintiffs breached that

duty as they did not have a proper dumping ground for such materials — instead, they

dumped the same on the adjoining State Land despite warnings of the consequences of such

encroachment from the defendants/the HDB. Indeed, the HDB went further and warned the

defendants that the plaintiffs' slow progress may cause the defendants to be debarred from

future public sector projects. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        Due to their tardiness,

lack of progress and total disregard for their own work schedule, the defendants by their

latter dated 18 May 2001, gave the plaintiffs three (3) days' notice to proceed with the

works diligently failing which, notice of termination would be given. The plaintiffs

failed to respond to the letter and notice of termination was given by the defendants on

23 May 2001. As a consequence of the plaintiffs' breach, the defendants suffered loss and

damage. Hence, they called on the performance bond which demand for payment was not met by

Tai Ping despite three (3) reminders. Ultimately, the defendants were restrained by an

order of court from receiving payment thereon, on an application filed by the plaintiffs.

Resulting from the plaintiffs' breach of contract, Sim deposed that the defendants had

sustained losses in excess of $2m. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        Cross-examined, Sim

revealed that the defendants did not show to the plaintiffs their contract from the HDB

save for the specifications; it was a matter of strategy. However, the defendants left a

copy of their main contract (with pricing omitted) with their architects for

subcontractors to check if the latter wished to do so. She further revealed that the

defendants' geotechnic division did the piling works at cost. She agreed that the

defendants' tender price of $4,618,097.64 for M&amp;E works fell short of what the

defendants had to pay subcontractors to get the work done — the best price the

defendants could obtain was $5.1m. In order to cover the shortfall for M&amp;E works, the

defendants reduced the budget for architectural works by $400,000/- to $1,347,508.25. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        Sim admitted that by end

2000, the defendants' piling works were 1-2 months behind schedule; she agreed that

piling works are crucial and unless completed, no other construction work can begin. Even

so, the defendants did not apply to the HDB for extension of time. It was much later (in

January 2002), that extension of time was granted by the HDB, <u>but not</u> in relation

to piling works. However, the plaintiffs' subcontract did not contains provisions similar

to the defendants' contact with HDB, for extensions of time. Hence, even if the HDB

granted extensions of time to the defendants, the plaintiffs would not benefit therefrom;

the defendants could still hold the plaintiffs to the completion date in the subcontract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        Notwithstanding that the

plaintiffs' subcontract excluded piling and M&amp;E works, Sim explained that the

defendants' management still wanted the plaintiffs to co-ordinate those works,

particularly on the supply of materials, so as to ensure that all work was completed on

schedule. She denied that the motive was to have another contractor take the blame because

piling works were already delayed. It was similarly on management's (TC Chua's)

instructions that Sim requested the plaintiffs initially for a performance bond at 10% of

the contract sum even though it amounted to 25% of the subcontract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        Sim maintained that

during negotiations she had told Qiu three (3) items of work were taken out of the

subcontract namely: (i) materials ($3.017m); (ii) pre-cast elements ($239,000) and (iii) M

&amp; E works ($5.018m), thereby reducing the plaintiffs' subcontract to the value of

$5.4m. She had also informed him that although bored piling and instrumentation works were

taken out of the plaintiffs' contract, they were required to co-ordinate the works to

which (she claimed), Qiu did not object, before or at any time after, the subcontract was

signed. In reality however (Sim acknowledged), instrumentation being so highly

specialised, the plaintiffs were unlikely to be able to interpret the readings in relation

to the soil condition, nor would they have any role to play as regards bored piling. She

did not deny counsel's suggestion that the motive for including these two (2) items in the

plaintiffs' subcontract was to obtain a higher performance bond from the plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        In cross-examination Sim

revealed that she had told Qiu the defendants had 120 not 180, man year entitlements. She

denied she had agreed to give him 180 initially followed by 70 later, on his request for

250 workers. Qiu and Sam Yong had told her 180 was the minimum figure the plaintiffs could

accept but to her, it was the maximum. She had told Qiu the defendants could only afford

to give him 180 (although her computerised records showed the defendants had 120 left, out

of 370 MOM approved man year entitlements). Sim said she was aware that such entitlement

was a good source of revenue for local contractors who engage mainland Chinese workers and

was an important factor to them. However, it was not the defendants' practice to insert a

clause on man year entitlements into their subcontracts. She was also aware that the

plaintiffs raised the issue in their letters to the defendants in April 2001. The

defendants' practice was to give man year entitlements to subcontractors in batches (but

admittedly this was not told to Qiu). Hence, in Form 1A which the defendants signed as the

main contractor to support the plaintiffs' application, the number stated was 50. In any

case, Qiu had told her/the defendants (sometime in April-May 2001), that the plaintiffs

themselves had 100-200 workers and hence man year entitlement was not a critical factor,

contrary to his testimony. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        Re-examined, Sim

explained the defendants' rationale for agreeing to give the plaintiffs only 50 foreign

workers initially – from past experience, the defendants were afraid that if the

plaintiffs were unable to continue with and or to complete, the project, it meant that the

man year entitlements would all be wasted. In any case, excavation works are not labour

intensive. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        Sim contended that the

defendants' geotechnic division did not reveal to her the condition of the material they

cored out while installing bored piles; she said she was only given a monthly summary of

the lengths of piles installed. She added that the geotechnic division would not know what

was cored out as <i>they didn't see</i>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        Sim admitted that the

defendants’ successful tender was $6m lower than the next lowest price. She said that

had the defendants split up the architectural works amongst the various trades; her

company would have had to pay more than $3.3m for the works instead of the budgeted $1.34m

inserted in the subcontract. She further revealed that the defendants did not require

performance bonds from any of their other subcontractors (save for their glazier) as she

had the security of their retention sums. She agreed that the performance bond originally

requested from the plaintiffs ($1.37m) was more than the defendants' own performance bond

($1.1m) furnished to HDB. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.        Sim disagreed with Qiu's

testimony on the issue of drawings and plans. She contended that during negotiations (19

December 2000) she had handed him a full set of the drawings (including specifications and

soil report) which documents Qiu did not return until the subcontract was signed; Sim

however, did not make Qiu acknowledge the documents she handed over nor did she sign for

those he returned. Qiu on the other hand claimed that it was Wang not Sim, who lent him a

set of plans before the parties met on 5 December 2000. Leaving aside the dispute of how

the documents came to be in Qiu's possession, it is common ground that the plaintiffs were

aware from the drawings, of the defendants' scope of works, <u>before</u> Qiu signed the

subcontract on the plaintiffs' behalf (28 February 2001). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46.        Although she had informed

Qiu that the defendants would engage labour from Zap Piling to do the soldier piles (at

the perimeter of the site), Sim admitted that she did not inform him that the defendants

would also be providing the materials for the work and would be deducting the costs

thereof from the subcontract price. (It was subsequently clarified in re-examination that

the materials would not have added to the costs of soldier piling because the defendants

used materials left over from their other projects). Apparently, Zap Piling did not

complete their work and demobilise their equipment (including two [2] rigs) until 23 March

2001; however, Sin denied that it resulted in the plaintiffs being delayed in their

excavation works. It was drawn to her attention that even before that, on 12 March 2001,

the defendants had given written notice to the plaintiffs that if they did not mobilise

their excavation team <u>by that very afternoon</u>, the defendants would engage another

company Midas-Bilt Pte Ltd to do the work immediately, which costs would be backcharged to

the plaintiffs. Sim insisted that Qiu was told verbally at site meetings of the

particulars of other subcontractors on site notwithstanding that the defendants did not

reply to the plaintiffs' several letters on such queries. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.        Sim did not deny that the

defendants' intention was to subcontract out the <u>entire</u> project. Save for their

project team headed by Ho Hin Sing and subsequently by June Tan, she revealed that the

defendants had no staff or site personnel (other than a safety officer) apart from the

defendants' bored piling workers. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.        What emerges from Sim's

testimony is, that the defendants not the plaintiffs, dictated how the plaintiffs should

carry out the works in the subcontract. What is even more remarkable is the fact that the

plaintiffs or more correctly Qiu, seemed to accept the situation. Further, where there

could be savings in the final price charged by subcontractors appointed for the plaintiffs

by the defendants, those savings were not passed onto the plaintiffs, However, where the

other subcontractors' final pricing exceeded the defendants' budget and in turn the

provision for that item in the subcontract, the defendants had to absorb the excess cost.

An illustration of cost-saving was the budget for piling whilst an example of overrun in

costs would be architectural works, where the budgeted sum of $1,347,508.25 was less than

half of the actual sum ($3,383,362.39) the defendants claimed they eventually expended. In

her written testimony (para 64), Sim provided $1,923,342.28 for bored piling in the

subcontract but the final sum for the item was $281,798.27 less, at $1,641,526.01. Sim

sought to justify the defendants' actions by explaining that the defendants (and in turn

the plaintiffs) were paid for bored piles according to the lengths and number of piles

installed. It was also clear from Sim's testimony that the project was loss-making for the

defendants. I shall return to these observations later in my judgment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.        Although the defendants'

stand was that the plaintiffs should have been aware of the soil condition and the same

did not excuse them from completing the excavation works on time, it was noted (and

admitted by Sim) from the defendants' letters [see <b>D1</b>] to the HDB that the

defendants themselves used the <i>quick sand like</i> condition of the soil to justify

their application for 40 days' extension of time from the HDB, stating the soil

characteristic was very rare and remote in Singapore; hence, it was not foreseeable or

expected at the tender stage. HDB (on 2 October 2001) acceded to the defendants' request

and granted extensions of time up to 20 September 2002, for different stages of work. What

is revealing is, that the defendants' letter (dated 8 September 2001) to the HDB stated

that the defendants discovered <i>the unexpected bad soil condition</i> during excavation

works to basement 2 around 28 July 2001. Sim had also conceded that if the plaintiffs had

continued with the subcontract, she would have passed on to them the same extensions of

time granted by the HDB, notwithstanding that there was no provision for such in the

subcontract. Although she had asserted (in para 53 of her affidavit) that the defendants'

new subcontractor was able to find a dumping ground for the excavated rubbish without the

defendants' assistance, Sim could not name the dumping ground and could not comment on

counsel's suggestion that the defendants' new excavation subcontractor had actually dumped

the rubbish on the adjoining state land, then levelled and concealed the rubbish with

earth. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.        I turn now to the

testimony of the defendants' second and last witness Tan Yew Eing, who is also known as

June Tan (June). June's written testimony basically corroborated Sim's evidence.

Cross-examined and subsequently re-examined, June:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a.        said she assumed the post

    of project manager in January 2000 and asked to be released in June 2001 as she found the

    job <i>too stressful;</i> </p>
<p align="justify">b.        admitted she had pressed

    the plaintiffs to accelerate the works even before they had signed the subcontract

    (because the project was then on a critical path) as by then they had attended site

    meetings. Indeed, the plaintiffs’ site supervisor/engineer Lee Zhong (who has since

    returned to China) used to be on site until 5pm everyday, before 28 February 2000; </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>c.        said although she was aware that Jalan

    Halus (an official dumping ground for rubbish) was nearby, she did not inform the

    plaintiffs as <i>it was not for her to advise, it was for the plaintiffs’ excavation

    contractor to decide where to dump the rubbish.</i> In any event, the rubbish was

    localised and had been dumped on one area of the site only, due to inadequate security

    personnel;</p>
<p>d.        explained that Zap Piling’s work

    would not in any case have delayed or prevented the plaintiffs from commencing excavation

    works because, the former installed soldier piles in rows. After each row was completed,

    the plaintiffs could have installed timber laggings in between for shoring purposes in

    preparation for excavation works. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">June was not questioned on any of the five (5) representations pleaded

in the statement of claim. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The findings. </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.        At the conclusion of the

trial, counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court that his clients were relying on

three (3) representations only for their case, namely:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a)    man year entitlements;</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    soil condition;</p>
<p align="justify">(c)    scope of the plaintiffs' contract</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">thereby abandoning representations (ii) and (iv) set out in para 3

above. I should point out however that representation (iv) [on the absence of adverse or

unusual factors] is merged in the complaint on the unexpected soil condition.

Consequently, I will confine my findings to the three (3) 'live' representations. Counsel

further submitted that the three (3) representations were more than negligent, they were

tantamount to fraudulent misrepresentations, from the evidence adduced. I shall now

address each representation in turn.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i)    man-year entitlements </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.        I have already dealt with

this subject in some detail (paras 19-21 <i>supra</i>) as to the plaintiffs' reasons for

wanting 250 or at the very least 180, mainland Chinese workers. Indeed, counsel for the

plaintiffs candidly submitted that this requirement was a critical condition to his

clients. Consequently, if not for Sim's representation to Qiu that she would give him 120

man year entitlements followed by 60 more from the defendants' other projects, the

plaintiffs would not have accepted the subcontract. The plaintiffs did not receive even

the initial 180 foreign workers, let alone the second lot of 70. He argued that their

cash-flow problem was exacerbated by the defendants' non-payment of the plaintiffs' first

two (2) progress claims which counsel described as, <i>the lifeblood</i> of a construction

company.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.        However, the plaintiffs'

above submission has to be viewed against the actual evidence adduced in court. It was

Sim's unchallenged testimony that the defendants did sign an application form for 50

foreign workers on the plaintiffs' behalf, on or about 2 May 2001. It was also not

disputed that the plaintiffs failed or refused to submit the application form (IA). Qiu's

excuse that he did not provide to the defendants a bond of $2,000 per worker (as which

result the defendants eventually cancelled the application) because the application had

first to be approved by MOM before an insurance company would furnish the security, did

not explain his failure to submit the Form in the first place. Consequently, the

plaintiffs only have themselves to blame for not getting any man year entitlements. It

does not lie in their mouths to complain that the defendants did not give them 250 man

year entitlements when the latter's offer of 50 workers first (for reasons which I accept)

was not even taken up by the plaintiffs. It is therefore irrelevant whether the defendants

(through Sim) initially promised the plaintiffs 180 or 250 foreign workers; the question

of breach of this representation did not even arise.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii)    soil condition </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.        The nature of the soil

excavated was not in dispute (although it was the defendants' contention that it was

localised), it comprised of rubbish. The plaintiffs contended that the defendants (who

denied) knew of the soil condition and failed to disclose to the former; the plaintiffs

relied on the soil report of ECON GEOTECHNIC dated 9 September 1999 and the fact that it

was the defendants' own geotechnic division which installed over 300 bored piles. Qiu had

also alleged that at the meeting with the defendants on 5 December 2000, he had been given

the impression by Lai that the soil condition was normal. The defendants did not call Lai

to rebut Qiu's allegation but Sim had denied that her geotechnic division would have known

beforehand of the rubbish, claiming they <i>did not see </i>whist the soil report only

stated <i>backfill</i>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.        I disbelieve and reject

Sim's testimony in this regard. The defendants must have known or ought to have known, the

nature of the material they excavated; how can their geotechnic division not have seen

what they cored out? Yet they kept the information away from the plaintiffs. It is

noteworthy that the defendants themselves wrote to the HDB much later (on 8 September

2001) using the soil condition as a ground for applying for extension of time. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.        I am mindful of the

defendants' closing submission that non-disclosure of the soil condition does not amount

to a misrepresentation relying on the following extract from <i>Chitty on Contracts</i>

(28 ed vol 1 para 6-013 at p 343) which was also repeated in <i>Hudson's Building and

Engineering Contracts</i> (11 ed vol 1 at para 1.145 p 73):-</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Non-disclosure. The general rule is that mere non-disclosure does not

    constitute misrepresentation, for there is, in general, no duty on the parties to a

    contract to disclose material facts to each other, however dishonest such non-disclosure

    may be in particular circumstances. </p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, further down in the same passage from <i>Chitty's,</i> the

following extract also appears:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">……Tacit acceptance in another's self-deception

    does not itself amount to a misrepresentation, provided that it has not previously been

    caused by a positive misrepresentation. But there are exceptions to the general rule that

    there is no duty to disclose, namely where the contract is within the class of contracts <i>uberrimae

    fidei</i>, where there is fiduciary relationship between the parties, and where failure to

    disclose some fact distorts a positive representation. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.        Granted, a construction

contract is not within the class of contracts of the utmost good faith but where, as in

this instance, Qiu had actually inquired from the defendants whether there were any

adverse factors he should know about and was assured there were none, the defendants are

caught by the second passage I have cited above from para 6-013 of <i>Chitty's</i>.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.        Before I address the

third misrepresentation, I wish to make some general comments first. There is little doubt

from the evidence adduced from both sides' witnesses, of the parties' unequal bargaining

position. Contrary to the defendants' closing submissions, I did not find Qiu to be

business-savvy at all; he was a babe in the woods and was no match for them when it came

to negotiating with the defendants. Moreover, the plaintiff company was barely three (2)

years old as at December 2000. Qiu was incredibly nave and if I may add, utterly foolish

as can be seen from two (2) instances: firstly, his misguided optimism that the initial

cash flow for his company (before progress payments from the defendants [which never

materialised in any case]) would come from the premium (in excess of $1m) payable by

foreign workers employed by his company. Secondly, his optimism that the plaintiffs' delay

in the subcontract works could be remedied eventually by employing more workers and

putting them to work in two (2) shifts. Thirdly, his foolhardiness in sub-subcontracting

out the excavation works to System Holdings Pte Ltd at $580,000 when the plaintiffs'

subcontract provided $412,851.28 for that item. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.        Granted, Qiu's testimony

was inconsistent on the issue of when and what documentation he received from the

defendant on 5 December 2000 and what exactly he was told about the defendants' contract

from HDB for the project, the contract sum and, the omissions therefrom for the

subcontract. Further, no other witness corroborated his evidence; his 'investor' Sam Yong

did not testify, neither did his site supervisor/engineer (Lee Zhong) or project manager

(Ma Jun). Whilst the court was told that Lee Zhong had returned to China, nothing was said

about Sam Yong's or Ma Jun's whereabouts. The court was also not told if any attempts had

been made by either side to procure Wang's attendance in court, notwithstanding his having

left the defendants' services. Despite the shortcomings in his testimony however, I find

that Qiu was not an untruthful witness. Rather, he came across as foolish, confused and

inexperienced although he flattered himself by telling counsel for the defendants he was a

careful man. Based on his company's short existence, he could not have had much

experience. It was mainly due to his inexperience (and perhaps lack of understanding of

what Sim told him) that he did not fully comprehend the enormity of the task he had

undertaken on the plaintiffs’ behalf. If indeed he was as experienced in construction

as he claimed to be, Qiu would not have taken on the project based on the residual value

of $5,443,524 offered by the defendants; any experienced contractor would have realised

that the budget was impossible to achieve, without incurring huge overruns in costs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.        Unlike the plaintiffs

however, the defendants were well aware of the financial risks; their agenda (admitted by

Sim) was therefore to pass on to a third party the burden of not only an unprofitable but

most certainly a loss-making, project. Sim had readily admitted that the defendants were

anxious to look for a main contractor to take over the entire project, on the instructions

of her director of constructions T C Chua. There is no question that the defendants would

have lost money on the project. Just on two (2) items alone, M &amp; E and architectural

works, they had under-provided by $2m not to mention the gulf of $6m between their tender

price and the second lowest tender. The plaintiffs' willingness to accept the project was

therefore a godsend to the defendants, although the plaintiffs' counsel described his

clients as scapegoats. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(iii)    the scope of the contract</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.        Despite their

protestations to the contrary and their repeated assertions that they were only doing

their best to help the plaintiffs to finish the project, I have no doubt from the

defendants' conduct that they did the exact opposite. I say this based on evidence adduced

from the defendants' own witnesses. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.        First, there is June's

conduct. It was reprehensible that knowing Jalan Halus dumping ground was nearby, she

deliberately withheld such information from the plaintiffs when they were desperately

looking for a place to dump the rubbish they had excavated. Secondly, Sim had testified

that the plaintiffs would be the subcontractor for the entire project save for three (3)

omissions, which drastically reduced the contract value from $13.7m to $5.4m. True, that

was known to and accepted by Qiu, who also admitted that he attempted to ask the

defendants for another $500,000 for the subcontract sum, which request was rejected. What

the plaintiffs could validly complain was, how the defendants dictated to the plaintiffs

who the latter should employ as specialist subcontractors and how much those

subcontractors should be paid. As Qiu explained, this arrangement could be highly

inequitable to the plaintiffs because, the total charges of the subcontractors may even

exceed the subcontract sum and caused the plaintiffs to incur losses; yet, the plaintiffs

had no say whatsoever on the choice of subcontractors and subcontract sums awarded to them

not to mention the value of materials supplied by the defendants. Even worse, the

defendants (according to Sim) expected the plaintiffs to co-ordinate the works of such

other subcontractors without any charge (for profit and attendance). Thirdly, there was

the defendants' attempt to procure a performance bond for 25% of the subcontract value

from the plaintiffs, instead of the usual 10% in the construction industry. It reinforced

my finding of Qiu's naivete; he did not provide a performance bond in the larger amount <u>not</u>

because he realised it was outside industry practice but because the plaintiffs' insurance

company (presumably Tai Ping) refused to do so. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.        Consequently, the

subcontract was not only entirely one-sided in the defendants' favour but the scope had

been changed; it was <u>not</u> for the subcontract value of $5,443,524.23 and for the

scope of works represented to and accepted by the plaintiffs/Qiu, but was whittled down

further to exclude bored piling, temporary works/instrumentation and soldier piles. The

breakdown for the subcontract is as follows: </p>

<p align="justify">Excluding those three (3) items, the value of the subcontract was

reduced to $2,435,147.74 ($5,443,524.23 - $1,923,324.28 + $713,590.98 + $371,461.87). In

their final submissions, the defendants pointed out (in para 22 of the statement of claim)

that the plaintiffs had stated they knew of the presence of a bored piling contractor and

Zap Piling on site. That may be so but, the plaintiffs <u>did not know the value or scope

of works</u> of the two (2) and other subcontractors as, their repeated written inquiries

of the defendants in that regard met with no response. Even if Qiu, as the defendants

contended, knew the subcontract value to the plaintiffs was actually $3.2m, that was not

the same as saying that the plaintiffs' subcontract would be $2.4m. If the other

subcontractors were nominated by the defendants, then industry practice entitled the

plaintiffs to profit and attendance for co-ordinating their works with those of the

subcontractors. If the subcontractors were not nominated subcontractors but domestic

subcontractors of the plaintiffs, only the plaintiffs could select and negotiate the terms

and conditions of, their appointment. The defendants however wanted to have their cake and

eat it. On the one hand, they told the plaintiffs they would appoint the other

subcontractors. On the other hand however, they would not allow the plaintiffs to charge

any attendance fee to co-ordinate the works of their appointees. Far worse, copies of the

defendants' various contracts with numerous subcontractors (signed before as well as after

the subcontract) were never extended to the plaintiffs at the material time. </p>
<p align="justify">64.        There is one other small

issue that needs to be dealt with before I turn to the law and the defendants'

counterclaim – when did the subcontract come into existence? Was it on the date of

execution (28 February 2001) as the plaintiffs contended or, much earlier as the

defendants asserted? It was not disputed that the plaintiffs (Qiu and or Lee Zhong) had

attended site meetings since 30 January 2001 as which result, the defendants considered

the subcontract <i>a done deal </i>well before 28 February 2001. It bears recapitulating

that the parties first met on 5 December 2000 and Qiu was handed the subcontract agreement

dated 19 December 2000 about that date. It should be further noted that the plaintiffs

provided the performance bond for the subcontract on 15 February 2001. Applying cl 20.0 of

the subcontract, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Within 14 days of the letter of acceptance, the

    subcontractor shall deposit with the contractor an amount of $544,351.42 as and by way of

    security for the due performance of and observance by the sub-contractor of his

    obligations under the contract or a demand bond in an approved formula </p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">can it be said that the subcontract was actually concluded on 1

February 2001 by the plaintiffs' conduct in furnishing the performance bond? I think not.

In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs explained (in para 20) that they had sent a

representative (presumably Lee Zhong) to the site in January 2001 purely to do preparatory

work; Qiu had alleged that it was the defendants who invited the plaintiffs to visit the

site. The defendants (June) on the other hand gave written notice to the plaintiffs (on 20

February 2001 at 2AB202) that they would start imposing a penalty if the plaintiffs'

workers failed to show up at site. This was followed by another letter from June dated 27

February 2001 (2AB196) pointing out to the plaintiffs that the defendants were <i>so

behind time</i>. The second letter explains the defendants' eagerness to hold the

plaintiffs to the subcontract even before the execution date of 27 February 2001 and

thereafter to terminate the same due to the plaintiffs' alleged breaches – the

defendants themselves were behind schedule on the project, which fact they did not

disclose to Qiu on 5 December 2000. It would be wholly unjust and inequitable to hold that

the plaintiffs were bound by the subcontract before they signed it on 28 February 2001.</p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The law </p></i>
<p align="justify">65.        In the statement of

claim, the plaintiffs had prayed for rescission of the subcontract pursuant to s 2 of the

Misrepresentation Act Cap 390 (the Act) which reads as follows:-</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">(1) Where a person has entered into a contract after a

    misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he

    has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to

    damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person

    shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently,

    unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time

    the contract was made that the facts represented were true.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Where a person has entered into a contract after a

    misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise fraudulently, and he would be entitled,

    by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in

    any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been

    rescinded, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages

    in lieu of rescission, if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to

    the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the

    contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other

    party. </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">The decision </p></i>
<p align="justify">66.        On the evidence, I find

that the plaintiffs have succeeded in their claim on misrepresentations (ii) and (iii) but

failed on misrepresentation (i). In the light of my findings on the defendants' conduct,

it can hardly be said that the misrepresentations were made innocently. I very much doubt

that the defendants can claim (under s 2(1) of the Act) that they had reasonable grounds

to believe and did believe up to the time the subcontract was made, that the facts told to

the plaintiffs under misrepresentations (ii) and (iii) were true. Are the plaintiffs

therefor entitled to rescission of the contract under s 2(1) of the Act or, would damages

be an adequate remedy, under s 2(2) thereof? Even if the misrepresentations had been made

innocently, s 1 of the Act makes it clear that the plaintiffs are not thereby precluded

from having the subcontract rescinded, notwithstanding that the contract has been

performed. </p>
<p align="justify">67.        In this regard, I note

that the plaintiffs' position on their pleadings is ambivalent. In paras (a) and (b) of

the reliefs claimed, they had prayed for <u>both rescission and damages for rescission </u>respectively.

At law, rescission means that the plaintiffs are entitled to be restored to the position

they would have been in had the contract not been made. Effectively, that would mean that

the plaintiffs would recover back all the sums they had expended for working on the

project, including the amount ($30,100) paid to Tai Ping for issuance of the performance

bond. </p>
<p align="justify">68.        It has to be borne in

mind that the plaintiffs did not succeed on misrepresentation (i) and their conduct was

not entirely blameless. One clear example would be Qiu's folly in engaging System Holdings

Pte Ltd to do excavations works at a higher amount than that provided for the item in the

subcontract, and then attempting (unsuccessfully) to switch subcontractors. The court

cannot relieve the plaintiffs and the defendants should not have to pay for the

consequences, of Qiu's folly, namely the judgment sum of $180,000. Another instance of the

plaintiffs' fault would be Qiu's decision not to proceed to apply for 50 man year

entitlements, without valid reasons. It is a moot point whether the plaintiffs would have

been entitled to extensions of time due to the soil condition, and claim the benefit of

the extensions of time granted to the defendants by the HDB; we will never know. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The counterclaim</p></i>
<p align="justify">69.        The maxim he who comes to

equity must come with clean hands is well known and does not bear repetition. Rescission

is an equitable remedy and the defendants cannot rely on their own misrepresentations as a

basis to found a counterclaim for damages. Consequently, their counterclaim is dismissed

with costs to the plaintiffs. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i>
<p align="justify">70.        I award judgment to the

plaintiffs with costs. I hold that the subcontract is rescinded, the defendants are

directed to deliver up Tai Ping's performance bond for cancellation and, the interim

injunction granted on 22 August 2001 to the plaintiffs to restrain the defendants from

calling for payment on the performance bond is affirmed. The Registrar is directed to
