In March 2016, JDK sub-contracted the installation of mechanical &amp; electrical engineering (“M&amp;E”) works for the Project to the plaintiff. This was done by way of a letter of award dated 23 March 2016.

</div>
</div> Wan said that Pauline had agreed, on behalf of the defendant, to provide a “line of credit” to the plaintiff of up to $600,000. Based on this assurance, which was bolstered by the plaintiff’s existing business relationship with the defendant, the plaintiff entered into a sub-contract for the M&amp;E works from JDK. Wan explained that the purpose of the LOC was to provide financing to the plaintiff to procure equipment for the M&amp;E sub-contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Initially, things went according to plan. In the course of the works, the plaintiff obtained an advance payment of $100,000 from JDK, as well as direct payment by the defendant to one equipment supplier in the sum of $107,094.

Wan said that he had to secure the necessary financing, including taking out loans, to procure the rest of the equipment. Works continued and by early April 2018, the entire sub-contract was about 95% completed. In addition, the plaintiff had completed variation orders (“VO”) for which the plaintiff submitted invoices totalling about $437,000.

</div> Wan agreed that all $600,000 worth of equipment had been delivered and installed and this sum had been incorporated in the 16 progress claims submitted by the plaintiff up to April 2018. On 24 April 2018, the defendant terminated the sub-contract with JDK, purportedly on account of delay to the works, including M&amp;E works.

It is also unclear who else was present at the meeting and when it occurred. What is more important is that in replies filed by the plaintiff to further and better particulars (“F&amp;BP”) requested by the defendant, the plaintiff, in answer to the question “whether the Alleged Agreement was made in writing, orally and or by conduct…”, replied that the agreement was made in <span class="font-italic">writing</span>.

</div> It is clear that the plaintiff considered these outstanding sums to be payable by JDK. This puts paid to the plaintiff’s case that the defendant had a binding contractual obligation to the plaintiff to provide the plaintiff with up to $600,000 LOC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I should add that the plaintiff’s position in relation to the LOC is rather confused. Wan agreed that the LOC was provided in the Contract for the purpose of enabling him to procure the $600,000 worth of equipment that the plaintiff was to install under the Contract. Financing was provided to the plaintiff on two instances amounting to a total of $207,094. But it stopped after that. To the plaintiff’s credit, it was able to procure other sources of financing to secure the delivery of the remainder of the equipment to the site, and to complete 95% of the works under the Contract. Yet, the plaintiff is not claiming for damages for the failure to provide the balance of the LOC which, under the circumstances, would be the financing costs it incurred to procure the remainder of the equipment. Its claim appears to be cash, in the sum of the balance of the LOC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $392,906.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> There is no basis for these claims as they arise from the Contract which is between the plaintiff and JDK. Certainly in relation to the outstanding progress payments of $465,000, the plaintiff has not pleaded as to how this was incurred. Paragraphs one to nine of the SOC plead to the $600,000 LOC and the $437,000 in VO claims. Paragraph 10 of the SOC then states that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a result of the above the Plaintiffs suffered losses and damages … as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">i. outstanding progress payments at S$465,767.25;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">ii.  Variation Orders payments at S$437,440.21</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iii. outstanding Line of Credit at S$392,906/-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iv. other costs:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 It is clear from this that the plaintiff has not stated its case in relation to the $465,000 in outstanding progress payments. As for the VOs, the plaintiff has not produced any VO in evidence. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, these would have been issued by the architect to defendant, who, pursuant to its sub-contract with JDK, would have passed it on to JDK who in turn would have passed it on to the plaintiff pursuant to the Contract. The plaintiff has not produced any evidence to prove its claim for the VOs. In any event, the plaintiff’s involvement in the Project is as the sub-contractor of JDK and therefore, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, the plaintiff’s execution of the VOs would be carried out pursuant to the Contract. It is therefore JDK that is liable to the plaintiff in respect of the VOs (and for that matter, in respect of the outstanding progress payments as well). The plaintiff has not produced any evidence to displace this position. In fact, as I have alluded to above, it appears that the plaintiff was cognisant of this fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Finally, the plaintiff’s witnesses placed much reliance on instructions given to them by Mr Jonathan Liow (“Liow”) and Mr Darryl Lim (“Lim”).

</div>
</div> There is no dispute that Liow and Lim were employees of JDK. The plaintiff’s witnesses said that as Liow and Lim had attended site meetings as representatives of the defendant, and in fact had email addresses with the defendant’s domain names in addition to the domain name of JDK, the plaintiff had considered that their instructions emanated from the defendant. I accept the defendant’s evidence that it is normal in the situation where party A has sub-contracted the entire building works to party B, party B would represent party A in all dealings with the employer and his consultants. It would therefore be normal for JDK’s personnel to attend site meetings and attend to the consultants as the defendant’s representatives. However as between JDK and the plaintiff, the Contract clearly sets out their contractual relationship. I do not believe the assertions of the plaintiff’s witnesses that they were misled into thinking that instructions from Liow and Lim were instructions from the defendant and not from JDK.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The plaintiff’s claims are therefore dismissed. Unless there is any reason, such as the existence of an offer to settle, to make a different order, I order costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant fixed at $100,000, inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">K V Sudeep Kumar (S K Kumar Law Practice LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Chia Swee Chye Kelvin and Bernard Tan (Lumen Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
